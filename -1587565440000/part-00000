In the Ottoman imperial family tradition, a sultan's consort was to remain in the harem only until her son came of age (around 16 or 17), after which he would be sent away from the capital to govern a faraway province, and his mother would follow him. This tradition was called ''[[Sanjak-bey|Sancak Beyli\u011fi]].'' The consorts were never to return to Istanbul unless their sons succeeded to the throne.<ref>Imber, Colin (2002).

Some sources say she moved to Topkap\u0131, not because of the fire, but as a result of her marriage to Suleiman. Either way, this was another significant break from established customs, as Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] had specifically issued a decree to the effect that no women would be allowed to reside in the same building where government affairs were conducted.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|131}} After H\u00fcrrem resided at Topkap\u0131 it became known as the New Palace (''saray-\u0131 jedid'').{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=119}}\n\nUnder his pen name, Muhibbi, Sultan Suleiman composed this poem for Hurrem Sultan:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Throne of my lonely niche, my wealth, my love, my moonlight.<br />\nMy most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan, my one and only love.<br />\nThe most beautiful among the beautiful...<br />\nMy springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf...<br />\nMy plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this world...<br />\nMy Istanbul, my Caraman, the earth of my Anatolia<br />\nMy Badakhshan, my Baghdad and Khorasan<br />\nMy woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of mischief...<br />\nI'll sing your praises always<br />\nI, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/sample-10.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608080458/http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/sample-10.html|url-status=dead|title=A Message For The Sultan - Sample Activity (Women in World History Curriculum)|archivedate=June 8, 2007|website=www.womeninworldhistory.com}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== State affairs ==\nHurrem became Suleiman's partner not only in the Sultan's household, but also in state affairs. Thanks to her intelligence, she acted as Suleiman's chief adviser on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and international politics. She frequently accompanied him as a political adviser. Hurrem's influence on Suleiman was so significant that rumors circulated around the Ottoman court that the sultan had been bewitched.<ref name=OEWWH/>\n\nHer influence with Suleiman made her one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history and in the world at that time. Even as a consort, her power was comparable with the most powerful woman of the Imperial Harem, who by tradition was the Sultan's mother or ''[[valide sultan]]''. For this reason, she has become a controversial figure in Ottoman history \u2014 subject to allegations of plotting against and manipulating her political rivals.\n\n=== Controversial figure ===\n[[File:Rosa, Consort of Suleiman, Emperor of the Turks.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Roxelana in the British [[Royal Collection]], {{circa}} 1600\u201370]]\nHurrem's influence in state affairs not only made her one of the most influential women, but also a controversial figure in Ottoman history, especially in her rivalry with [[Mahidevran Hatun]] and her son [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]], [[Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha]], and [[Kara Ahmed Pasha]].\n\nHurrem and Mahidevran had borne Suleiman six ''[[\u015fehzade]]s'' (Ottoman princes), four of whom survived past the 1550s: Mustafa, Selim, Bayezid, and Cihangir. Of these, Mahidevran's son Mustafa was the eldest and preceded Hurrem's children in the order of succession. Traditionally, when a new sultan rose to power, all of his [[Fratricide#Ottoman Empire|brothers were killed]] in order to ensure the stability of the empire. This practice is called ''karde\u015f katliam\u0131''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Eren| isbn = 978-975-7622-65-9| last = Akman| first = Mehmet| title = Osmanl\u0131 devletinde karde\u015f katli| date = 1997-01-01}}</ref>\n\nMustafa was supported by Ibrahim Pasha, who became Suleiman's Grand Vizier in 1523. Hurrem has usually been held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|132}} Although she was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role. This did not, however, prevent Hurrem from wielding powerful political influence. Since the empire lacked, until the reign of [[Ahmed I]] (1603\u20131617), any formal means of nominating a successor, successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions. In attempting to avoid the execution of her sons, Hurrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa's accession to the throne.<ref name=\"Mansel\">{{cite book |last = Mansel |first = Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Mansel|title = [[Constantinople : City of the World's Desire, 1453\u20131924]]|year = 1998|publisher = [[St. Martin's Griffin]] |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-312-18708-8 |pages = 84}}</ref>\n\nA skilled commander of [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman's army]], Ibrahim eventually fell from grace after an imprudence committed during a campaign against the Persian [[Safavid]] empire during the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355)]], when he awarded himself a title including the word \"[[Sultan]]\".<ref name=\"kinross230\">Kinross, 230.</ref> Another conflict occurred when Ibrahim and his former mentor, [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], repeatedly clashed over military leadership and positions during the Safavid war. These incidents launched a series of events which culminated in his execution in 1536 by Suleiman's order. It is believed that Hurrem's influence contributed to Suleiman's decision.<ref name=\"Mansel, 87.\">Mansel, 87.</ref> After three other grand viziers in eight years, Suleiman selected Hurrem's son-in-law, [[Damat]] [[R\u00fcstem Pasha]], husband of [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah]], to become the grand vizier. Scholars have wondered if Hurrem's alliance with Mihrimah Sultan and R\u00fcstem Pasha helped secure the throne for one of Hurrem's sons.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|132}}\n\nMany years later, towards the end of Suleiman's long reign, the rivalry between his sons became evident. Mustafa was later accused of causing unrest. During the campaign against [[Safavid Persia]] in 1553, because of fear of rebellion, Suleiman ordered the execution of Mustafa.<ref>Kinross, 233.</ref> According to a source he was executed that very year on charges of planning to dethrone his father; his guilt for the treason of which he was accused remains neither proven nor disproven.<ref name=\"leslie\">Peirce, 55.</ref> After the death of Mustafa, Mahidevran lost her status in the palace as the mother of the heir apparent and moved to [[Bursa]].<ref name=\"encycloapedia\"/> She did not spend her last years in poverty, as her stepson, [[Selim II]], the new sultan after 1566, put her on a lavish salary.<ref name=\"leslie\" /> Her rehabilitation had been possible after the death of Hurrem in 1558.<ref name=\"leslie\" /> Cihangir, Hurrem's youngest child, allegedly died of grief a few months after the news of his half-brother's murder.<ref name=\"Mansel89\">Mansel, 89.</ref>\n\nAlthough the stories about Hurrem's role in executions of Ibrahim, Mustafa, and Kara Ahmed are very popular, actually none of them are based on first-hand sources. All other depictions of Hurrem, starting with comments by sixteenth and seventeenth-century Ottoman historians as well as by European diplomats, observers, and travellers, are highly derivative and speculative in nature. Because none of these people \u2013 neither Ottomans nor foreign visitors \u2013 were permitted into the inner circle of the imperial harem, which was surrounded by multiple walls, they largely relied on the testimony of the servants or courtiers or on the popular gossip circulating around Istanbul. Even the reports of the Venetian ambassadors (''baili'') at Suleiman's court, the most extensive and objective first-hand Western source on Hurrem to date, were often filled with the authors\u2019 own interpretations of the harem rumours. Most other sixteenth-century Western sources on Hurrem, which are considered highly authoritative today \u2014 such as ''Turcicae epistolae'' (English: ''The Turkish Letters'') of [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Ogier de Busbecq]], the Emissary of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] at the Porte between 1554 and 1562; the account of the murder of \u015eehzade Mustafa by Nicholas de Moffan; the historical chronicles on Turkey by [[Paolo Giovio]]; and the travel narrative by Luidgi Bassano \u2014 derived from hearsay.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:Letter of Roxelane to Sigismond Auguste complementing him for his accession to the throne 1549.jpg|thumb|222px|Letter of Hurrem Sultan to [[Sigismund II Augustus]], congratulating him on his accession to the Polish throne in 1549.]]\nHurrem acted as Suleiman's advisor on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon [[foreign policy]] and on [[international politics]]. Two of her letters to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland (reigned 1548\u20131572) have survived, and during her lifetime the Ottoman Empire generally had peaceful relations with the Polish state within a [[Polish\u2013Ottoman alliance]].\n\nIn her first short letter to Sigismund II, Hurrem expresses her highest joy and congratulations to the new king on the occasion of his ascension to the Polish throne after the death of his father [[Sigismund I the Old]] in 1548. She also pleads with the King to trust her envoy Hassan A\u011fa who took another message from her by word of mouth. In her second letter to Sigismund Augustus, written in response to his letter, Hurrem expresses in superlative terms her joy at hearing that the king is in good health and that he sends assurances of his sincere friendliness and attachment towards Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She also quotes the sultan as saying, \"with the old king we were like brothers, and if it pleases the All-Merciful God, with this king we will be as father and son.\" With this letter, Hurrem sent Sigismund II the gift of two pairs of linen shirts and pants, some belts, six handkerchiefs, and a hand-towel, with a promise to send a special linen robe in the future.\n\nThere are reasons to believe that these two letters were more than just diplomatic gestures, and that Suleiman's references to brotherly or fatherly feelings were not a mere tribute to political expediency.

In this case, Suleiman not only broke the old custom, but created new tradition for the future Ottoman Sultans to marry with a formal ceremony and make their consorts have significant influence on the court, especially in matter of succession. Hurrem's salary was 2,000 aspers a day, making her one of the highest paid hasekis.<ref name=\":1\" /> Their marriage had subsequent consequences including creating a general belief that by this marriage the Sultan had limited his autonomy and was dominated and controlled by his wife.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=109}} Furthermore, a mother's role in educating and guiding her sons throughout their life became more prominent.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=109}}\n\n[[File:Roxelana Rohatyn Jul 2008151.JPG|thumb|upright|Statue of Roxolana (Nastia Lisovska) in [[Rohatyn]]]]\nLater, Hurrem became the first woman to remain in the Sultan's court for the duration of her life. In the Ottoman imperial family tradition, a sultan's consort was to remain in the harem only until her son came of age (around 16 or 17), after which he would be sent away from the capital to govern a faraway province, and his mother would follow him. This tradition was called ''[[Sanjak-bey|Sancak Beyli\u011fi]].'' The consorts were never to return to Istanbul unless their sons succeeded to the throne.<ref>Imber, Colin (2002).

Some sources say she moved to Topkap\u0131, not because of the fire, but as a result of her marriage to Suleiman. Either way, this was another significant break from established customs, as Sultan [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] had specifically issued a decree to the effect that no women would be allowed to reside in the same building where government affairs were conducted.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|131}} After H\u00fcrrem resided at Topkap\u0131 it became known as the New Palace (''saray-\u0131 jedid'').{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=119}}\n\nUnder his pen name, Muhibbi, Sultan Suleiman composed this poem for Hurrem Sultan:\n\n<blockquote>\n\"Throne of my lonely niche, my wealth, my love, my moonlight.<br />\nMy most sincere friend, my confidant, my very existence, my Sultan, my one and only love.<br />\nThe most beautiful among the beautiful...<br />\nMy springtime, my merry faced love, my daytime, my sweetheart, laughing leaf...<br />\nMy plants, my sweet, my rose, the one only who does not distress me in this world...<br />\nMy Istanbul, my Caraman, the earth of my Anatolia<br />\nMy Badakhshan, my Baghdad and Khorasan<br />\nMy woman of the beautiful hair, my love of the slanted brow, my love of eyes full of mischief...<br />\nI'll sing your praises always<br />\nI, lover of the tormented heart, Muhibbi of the eyes full of tears, I am happy.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/sample-10.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608080458/http://www.womeninworldhistory.com/sample-10.html|url-status=dead|title=A Message For The Sultan - Sample Activity (Women in World History Curriculum)|archivedate=June 8, 2007|website=www.womeninworldhistory.com}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n== State affairs ==\nHurrem became Suleiman's partner not only in the Sultan's household, but also in state affairs. Thanks to her intelligence, she acted as Suleiman's chief adviser on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon foreign policy and international politics. She frequently accompanied him as a political adviser. Hurrem's influence on Suleiman was so significant that rumors circulated around the Ottoman court that the sultan had been bewitched.<ref name=OEWWH/>\n\nHer influence with Suleiman made her one of the most powerful women in Ottoman history and in the world at that time. Even as a consort, her power was comparable with the most powerful woman of the Imperial Harem, who by tradition was the Sultan's mother or ''[[valide sultan]]''. For this reason, she has become a controversial figure in Ottoman history \u2014 subject to allegations of plotting against and manipulating her political rivals.\n\n=== Controversial figure ===\n[[File:Rosa, Consort of Suleiman, Emperor of the Turks.jpg|thumb|right|A portrait of Roxelana in the British [[Royal Collection]], {{circa}} 1600\u201370]]\nHurrem's influence in state affairs not only made her one of the most influential women, but also a controversial figure in Ottoman history, especially in her rivalry with [[Mahidevran Hatun]] and her son [[\u015eehzade Mustafa]], [[Pargal\u0131 Ibrahim Pasha]], and [[Kara Ahmed Pasha]].\n\nHurrem and Mahidevran had borne Suleiman six ''[[\u015fehzade]]s'' (Ottoman princes), four of whom survived past the 1550s: Mustafa, Selim, Bayezid, and Cihangir. Of these, Mahidevran's son Mustafa was the eldest and preceded Hurrem's children in the order of succession. Traditionally, when a new sultan rose to power, all of his [[Fratricide#Ottoman Empire|brothers were killed]] in order to ensure the stability of the empire. This practice is called ''karde\u015f katliam\u0131''.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Eren| isbn = 978-975-7622-65-9| last = Akman| first = Mehmet| title = Osmanl\u0131 devletinde karde\u015f katli| date = 1997-01-01}}</ref>\n\nMustafa was supported by Ibrahim Pasha, who became Suleiman's Grand Vizier in 1523. Hurrem has usually been held at least partly responsible for the intrigues in nominating a successor.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|132}} Although she was Suleiman's wife, she exercised no official public role. This did not, however, prevent Hurrem from wielding powerful political influence. Since the empire lacked, until the reign of [[Ahmed I]] (1603\u20131617), any formal means of nominating a successor, successions usually involved the death of competing princes in order to avert civil unrest and rebellions. In attempting to avoid the execution of her sons, Hurrem used her influence to eliminate those who supported Mustafa's accession to the throne.<ref name=\"Mansel\">{{cite book |last = Mansel |first = Phillip |authorlink=Phillip Mansel|title = [[Constantinople : City of the World's Desire, 1453\u20131924]]|year = 1998|publisher = [[St. Martin's Griffin]] |location = New York |isbn = 978-0-312-18708-8 |pages = 84}}</ref>\n\nA skilled commander of [[Military of the Ottoman Empire|Suleiman's army]], Ibrahim eventually fell from grace after an imprudence committed during a campaign against the Persian [[Safavid]] empire during the [[Ottoman\u2013Safavid War (1532\u201355)]], when he awarded himself a title including the word \"[[Sultan]]\".<ref name=\"kinross230\">Kinross, 230.</ref> Another conflict occurred when Ibrahim and his former mentor, [[\u0130skender \u00c7elebi]], repeatedly clashed over military leadership and positions during the Safavid war. These incidents launched a series of events which culminated in his execution in 1536 by Suleiman's order. It is believed that Hurrem's influence contributed to Suleiman's decision.<ref name=\"Mansel, 87.\">Mansel, 87.</ref> After three other grand viziers in eight years, Suleiman selected Hurrem's son-in-law, [[Damat]] [[R\u00fcstem Pasha]], husband of [[Mihrimah Sultan (daughter of Suleiman I)|Mihrimah]], to become the grand vizier. Scholars have wondered if Hurrem's alliance with Mihrimah Sultan and R\u00fcstem Pasha helped secure the throne for one of Hurrem's sons.<ref name=levin/>{{rp|132}}\n\nMany years later, towards the end of Suleiman's long reign, the rivalry between his sons became evident. Mustafa was later accused of causing unrest. During the campaign against [[Safavid Persia]] in 1553, because of fear of rebellion, Suleiman ordered the execution of Mustafa.<ref>Kinross, 233.</ref> According to a source he was executed that very year on charges of planning to dethrone his father; his guilt for the treason of which he was accused remains neither proven nor disproven.<ref name=\"leslie\">Peirce, 55.</ref> After the death of Mustafa, Mahidevran lost her status in the palace as the mother of the heir apparent and moved to [[Bursa]].<ref name=\"encycloapedia\"/> She did not spend her last years in poverty, as her stepson, [[Selim II]], the new sultan after 1566, put her on a lavish salary.<ref name=\"leslie\" /> Her rehabilitation had been possible after the death of Hurrem in 1558.<ref name=\"leslie\" /> Cihangir, Hurrem's youngest child, allegedly died of grief a few months after the news of his half-brother's murder.<ref name=\"Mansel89\">Mansel, 89.</ref>\n\nAlthough the stories about Hurrem's role in executions of Ibrahim, Mustafa, and Kara Ahmed are very popular, actually none of them are based on first-hand sources. All other depictions of Hurrem, starting with comments by sixteenth and seventeenth-century Ottoman historians as well as by European diplomats, observers, and travellers, are highly derivative and speculative in nature. Because none of these people \u2013 neither Ottomans nor foreign visitors \u2013 were permitted into the inner circle of the imperial harem, which was surrounded by multiple walls, they largely relied on the testimony of the servants or courtiers or on the popular gossip circulating around Istanbul. Even the reports of the Venetian ambassadors (''baili'') at Suleiman's court, the most extensive and objective first-hand Western source on Hurrem to date, were often filled with the authors\u2019 own interpretations of the harem rumours. Most other sixteenth-century Western sources on Hurrem, which are considered highly authoritative today \u2014 such as ''Turcicae epistolae'' (English: ''The Turkish Letters'') of [[Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq|Ogier de Busbecq]], the Emissary of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] at the Porte between 1554 and 1562; the account of the murder of \u015eehzade Mustafa by Nicholas de Moffan; the historical chronicles on Turkey by [[Paolo Giovio]]; and the travel narrative by Luidgi Bassano \u2014 derived from hearsay.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Foreign policy ===\n[[File:Letter of Roxelane to Sigismond Auguste complementing him for his accession to the throne 1549.jpg|thumb|222px|Letter of Hurrem Sultan to [[Sigismund II Augustus]], congratulating him on his accession to the Polish throne in 1549.]]\nHurrem acted as Suleiman's advisor on matters of state, and seems to have had an influence upon [[foreign policy]] and on [[international politics]]. Two of her letters to King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of Poland (reigned 1548\u20131572) have survived, and during her lifetime the Ottoman Empire generally had peaceful relations with the Polish state within a [[Polish\u2013Ottoman alliance]].\n\nIn her first short letter to Sigismund II, Hurrem expresses her highest joy and congratulations to the new king on the occasion of his ascension to the Polish throne after the death of his father [[Sigismund I the Old]] in 1548. She also pleads with the King to trust her envoy Hassan A\u011fa who took another message from her by word of mouth. In her second letter to Sigismund Augustus, written in response to his letter, Hurrem expresses in superlative terms her joy at hearing that the king is in good health and that he sends assurances of his sincere friendliness and attachment towards Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent. She also quotes the sultan as saying, \"with the old king we were like brothers, and if it pleases the All-Merciful God, with this king we will be as father and son.\" With this letter, Hurrem sent Sigismund II the gift of two pairs of linen shirts and pants, some belts, six handkerchiefs, and a hand-towel, with a promise to send a special linen robe in the future.\n\nThere are reasons to believe that these two letters were more than just diplomatic gestures, and that Suleiman's references to brotherly or fatherly feelings were not a mere tribute to political expediency. The letters also suggest Hurrem's strong desire to establish personal contact with the king. In his 1551 letter to Sigismund II concerning the embassy of Piotr Opali\u0144ski, Suleiman wrote that the Ambassador had seen \"Your sister and my wife.\" Whether this phrase refers to a warm friendship between the Polish King and Ottoman Haseki, or whether it suggests a closer relation, the degree of their intimacy definitely points to a special link between the two states at the time.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Charities==\n[[File:Bath of Roxelane Istanbul 2007 006.jpg|thumb|222px|The [[Turkish bath]] (hamam) constructed by Hurrem Sultan, Istanbul, 1556]]\nAside from her political concerns, Hurrem engaged in several major works of public buildings, from [[Mecca]] to [[Jerusalem]], perhaps modelling her charitable foundations in part after the caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]]'s consort [[Zubaidah bint Ja`far|Zubaida]].

She was against love and relationships initially and told her boss K (Krishna) that she would never fall in love that are meaningless and selfish. She was awarded the youngest RJ achiever award due to her contribution to the Radio.\nAditya, a rich business man, was once stuck in a heavy traffic. He observed Antara helping clearing the traffic and fell in love with her.\nIn the award ceremony, Antara met Aaditya. He tries to maintain relation with her. He considered her as his best friend and told her that he wants to see her happy, whether as a friend or anything else. Their regular talks became a headline news, and her boss K (Krishna) regularly teases her. Once Antara got a call from Swati, who asked her what to answer because her boyfriend Sagar was going to propose her on Valentines Day. (Sagar is the main actor of the film who got rejected by 23 girls, yet he was optimistic about someone agreeing on him). Antara asked Swati to listen to her heart and breakup with Sagar if she is not happy and doesn't see any future with him.\nConvinced, as a result, Swati rejects Sagar's proposal and breaks up with him. This disheartens Sagar to a great extent. He was somehow consoled by his father.\nLater, when Sagar learns that it was because of Antara's advise that Swati rejected him, he decides to take revenge on her by following her to the Diu Trip, falsely taking photos with her and making it a fake news in the newspaper in order to make Antara fall in trouble with headlines.\nHe along with his friend (who was a photographer) manages to get information about Antara's Diu trip and boards the same bus which she boarded. Sagar continues his talks with Antara and manages to befriend her.\nHowever, Sagar fell in love with her as he started spending time with her in the trip. He asked his friend to avoid posting the fake news until he tells him to do so.\nAntara also secretly felt for Sagar and she knew Sagar also felt for her.\nHowever, once when she was invited by Sagar for a birthday party at his home, she went to Sagar's room and checked all the pictures of her trip with Sagar in his laptop. This made her angry and hurt her a lot. She understood that Sagar didn't love her, but just used her to become famous.\nWhen she left the party, Sagar stopped her. She told everything. Sagar revealed about his anger on Antara when he came to know that her advise forced Swati to reject him. Antara realised that Sagar had planned a revenge and this hurt her more. She told Sagar not to talk with her henceforth.\nAaditya came to know about Sagar and Antara's Diu Trip, called Sagar to his office and warned him to stay away from Antara and avoid hurting her.\nLater, Aaditya proposed her for marriage, however Antara chose not to answer that.\nSagar then called her on her Radio Love Line and reminder her that without her, his life has become monotonous and he misses her alot.\nAntara ignored Sagar's calls and messages, and agreed to marry Aditya.\nSagar came to know about this and reached Antara's office, but her boss Krishna told Sagar to stay away from Antara and avoid hurting her more.\nBecause Antara was not responding Sagar's calls and messages, he sent her a letter asking whom she remembers the most when she gets up in the morning, when drinking coffee and when listening to songs online.\nSagar's friend later informs him that his boss is planning to post all the trip pictures in the newspaper next day to defame Antara.\nThis makes Sagar tense, but he somehow manages to delete all the pictures from the boss' laptop with the help of his friend and snatches the pen-drive having the backup, and throws it into the lake.\nAaditya happens to read the letter sent by Sagar at Antara's home when he came there to take out for coffee and he realised that she is not happy with the marriage.\nDespite asking Antara a lot, she chooses to stay quiet and marry Aditya.\nDuring the marriage, Aaditya meets Antara and asks her to say the truth of whom she really thinks of in her mind. When Antara could not answer, Aditya told her that his aim was to see her happy, whether with him or with anyone else. Aaditya understood her mind and agreed to help her meet Sagar (who had already started giving up on his relationship with Antara).\nHowever, they were not able to locate him.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|295x295px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no.

After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|289x289px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many Broad Gauge countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram [[Dynamic braking|DBR]]'s.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni(KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed asErode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed asRatlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Variants ==\n\n=== WDM-3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-3A}}\nThe WDM-3A class are actually upgraded WDM-2 designed to produce more power ( 3100hp instead of 2600hp) and increased reliability (roller bearings instead of conventional ALCO bearings). Except for some 150 units, the rest are actually rebuilt WDM-2.  Rebuilt WDM3As can be identified by a \u201cR\u201d at the end of their Road Number.\n\n=== WDG-2/3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDG-2/3A}}It is the dedicated freight version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]] and shares the same engine and horsepower rating with [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]].The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by High adhesion Fabricated bogies for better traction and Stability. They are hugely successful with about 1163 units of this class have been produced.\n\n=== WDM-7 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-7}}\n[[File:WDM7 BioDiesel.JPG|left|thumb|238x238px|A [[Indian locomotive class WDM-7|WDM-7]] can be recognized by lack of grilles on the short hood]]\nThey are lower powered('''2000 hp instead of 2600 hp)''' version of the WDM-2. These locos were built from 1987 to 1989. A few were at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] earlier but later all were transferred to [[Tondiarpet railway station|Tondiarpet]] seen shunting at Chennai Central or for light passenger haulage. Some are at the thermal power station, Chennai.\n\nThese Co-Co diesel-electrics were designed for branch-line duties (top speed 105 km/h). They have two 3-axle bogies and are similar to the WDM-2 in appearance. The power-pack is a 12-cylinder ALCO 251B unit. They were formerly housed at [[Diesel Loco Shed, Erode|Erode]] and [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] also. They are reliable and rugged locomotives even though low powered. They can be easily recognized by the lack of grilles on the short hood. Two locos are running on a mixture of bio-diesel and diesel. All 15 are still in service.\n\n\n=== WDP-1 ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDP-1}}\nIt is a lower powered passenger ('''2300 hp)''' version of the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-2|WDM-2]]. The [[Bogie|Bogies]] of WDM-2 have been replaced by Bo-Bo fabricated bogies. They were not hugely successful. About 69 units have been produced with 60 locos still being in service. They are easily identified by baldie grille-less short hood.\n\n<br />\n\n== Some of the sheds holding WDM-2/A/B/G locomotives ==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=60em|\n* [[Abu Road railway station|Abu Road]] - 3\n* [[Guwahati railway station|New Guwahati]] - 4\n* [[Jamalpur railway station|Jamalpur]] - 1\n* [[Jhansi Junction railway station|Jhansi]] - 1\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Kurla]] - 1\n* [[New Katni Jn. railway station|New Katni Jn.]] - 1 \n* [[Malda Town railway station|Malda Town]] - 8\n* [[Mughalsarai Junction railway station|Mughalsarai]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Golden Rock|Golden Rock]] - 3\n* [[Raipur Junction railway station|Raipur]] - 2\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed Tondiarpet]] - 4\n''' Total Locomotioves active in service as of 01-03-2020:''' 30<br />('''Note-'''Before updating the information here anybody should check out the railways current official data first in the  '''Source''' link then change the data.)\n}}\n<br />'''Source:''' http://www.indianrailways.gov.in/railwayboard/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1,304,366,541,710,717\n\n== Former Sheds ==\n\n* [[Andal Junction railway station|Andal]] (UDL)\n* [[Bardhaman railway station|Bardhaman]] (BWN)\n* [[Bokaro Steel City railway station|Bokaro Steel City]] (BKSC)\n* [[Bondamunda railway station|Bondamunda]] (BNDM) \n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ernakulam|Ernakulam]] (ERS)- The very last WDM-2 (18701) was removed from service on june, 2019 after being in the shed for 38 years.\n* [[Diesel loco shed, Erode|Erode]] (ED)\n* [[Gondal railway station|Gonda]] (GD)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Gooty|Gooty]] (GY)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Guntakal|Guntakal]] (GTL)\n* [[Howrah Junction railway station|Howrah]] (HWH)\n* [[Itarsi Junction railway station|Itarsi]] (ET)\n* [[Izzatnagar railway station|Izzatnagar Loco Shed]] (IZN)\n* [[Kalyan Junction railway station|Kalyan]] (KYN)\n* [[Kazipet railway station|Kazipet]] (KZJ)\n* [[Kharagpur Junction railway station|Kharagpur]] (KGP)\n* [[Krishnarajapuram railway station|Krishnarajapuram]] (KJM)\n* [[Lucknow Charbagh railway station|Lucknow]] (LKO)\n* [[Ludhiana Junction railway station|Ludhiana]] (LDH)\n* [[Moula Ali Railway Station|Moula Ali]] (MLY)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Pune|Pune]] (PUNE)\n* [[Patratu railway station|Loco Shed Patratu]] (PTRU)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Ratlam|Ratlam]] (RTM)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Samastipur|Samastipur]] (SPJ)\n* [[Tughlakabad railway station|Tughlakabad]] (TKD)\n* [[Diesel Loco Shed, Vatva|Vatva]] (VTA)\n* [[Visakhapatnam railway station|Visakhapatnam]] (VSKP)\n\n== Liveries ==\n\n* GOC: ICF Rajdhani livery but red replaced by green.

A total of 2700+ WDM-2 were built at ALCO and [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW), Varanasi between 1962 and 1998, which made them the most numerous class of mainline diesel locomotive till its successor the [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A.]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/faq/faq-specs.html|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways FAQ: Diesel and Electric Locomotive Specifications|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nThe WDM-2 is one of the most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains for over 58 years. Despite the introduction of more modern types of locomotives like [[Indian locomotive class WDG-4|WDG-4]] and electrification, a significant number are still in use, both on mainline and departmental duties. As of January 2020, 30 locomotives still exist as WDM-2, with further examples having been converted to [[Indian locomotive class WDM-3A|WDM-3A]] or WDM-2S. 30 retain \"operational status\" on the mainline.\n\n== Origin ==\nThe history of WDM-2 begins in the early 1960s with the stated aim of the [[Indian Railways]] to remove [[steam locomotive]]s from Indian Rails. It therefore required a large build of [[Co-Co locomotives|Co-Co]] diesel locomotives with [[road switcher]] cabs to achieve this aim. This required locomotives producing at least 2,600&nbsp;hp (1,900&nbsp;kW) and began looking at various [[Diesel-electric train|diesel-electric]] designs.\n\nInitially, the Indian railways invited tenders to build locomotives to the new specification.The following responses were received:\n\n* ALCO submitted their model(RSD29 / DL560C) with 2600&nbsp;hp, 16-cylinder, 4-stroke turbo-supercharged engine with Co-Co bogies.\n* [[Electro-Motive Diesel|General Motors Electro-Motive Division]] (EMD) submitted their [[EMD SD24|SD24]], given model number GT16 for the India export version. They had Co-Co bogies with 16-cylinder 2-stroke turbo-supercharged engines.\n\nEach company submitted prototypes and Indian Railways designated these prototypes as the WDM-2 class and [[Indian locomotive class WDM-4|WDM-4]] class respectively. Technologically the General Motors WDM-4 was superior to ALCO's WDM-2, but Indian Railways required a transfer of technology agreement that would allow these locomotives to be ingeniously manufactured in India. Since General Motors did not agree to the transfer of technology agreement, the ALCO prototype was selected for production.\n\nHowever, even before the arrival of WDM-2 another type of diesel locomotive was imported from ALCo beginning in 1957. This locomotive was classified as [[Indian locomotive class WDM-1|WDM-1]].However WDM-1s were not selected for mass production because of having only one forward cab at one end which needed a lot of turntables. \n\n== Production History ==\n[[File:Indian diesel loco WDM2.jpg|thumb|325x325px|18040 the first WDM2 built preserved at national rail museum.|alt=]]\nThe first few prototype WDM-2 were imported with #18040 being the first WDM-2 of India. The need for a large number of locomotives quickly was deemed paramount. After [[Diesel Locomotive Works]] (DLW) completed construction of its factory in Varanasi, production of the locomotives began in India.The first 12 locos were built using kits imported from ALCO(order no. D3389) in the United States. \n\nThe first diesel loco assembled in DLW being #18233<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3732|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Mughalsarai (MGS) WDM-2 18233 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> and the first fully-built WDM-2 from DLW was 18299<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3798|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Bondamunda (BNDM) WDM-2 18299 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref>. After that DLW started manufacturing the WDM-2 locomotives from their own components. Since then over 2,800 locomotives have been manufactured and the WDM-2 has become the most popular locomotive in India with the very last one being #16887.\n[[File:Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|324x324px|Kundan, the first WDM-2 locomotive assembled at DLW, Varanasi]]\nWhile ALCO went bankrupt, DLW varanasi successfully adapted the technology and produced may upgraded versions which were exported to many Broad Gauge countries. Later a number of modifications were made and a few sub classes were created. This includes WDM-2A, WDM-2B and WDM-3A (formerly WDM-2C). Now a few WDM-2 locos are being rebuilt by [[Diesel-Loco Modernisation Works|Diesel Loco Modernization Works]] (DLMW) Patiala, Punjab. These are fitted with Daulat Ram [[Dynamic braking|DBR]]'s.\n\n== Service History ==\nKatni(KTE) was the first shed to hold WDM2. The whole batch of WDM2 imports had all went to KTE. #18040 was first loco in the series, but 18042 was the first commissioned. Third DLS is listed as gooty(GY) in 1963 and first loco was WDM2 18207. Fourth DLS is listed as Itarsi(ET) in 1964 and first loco was WDM2 18043, so it got transfers from KTE initially. Fifth DLS is listed asErode([[Diesel loco shed, Erode|ED]]) in 1966. Sixth DLS is listed asRatlam(RTM) in 1967 and first loco was #18417.\n\nBy 1967 the first trains were being migrated to diesel and the initial high speed foray was the [[Mumbai Rajdhani Express|Mumbai Rajdhani]] with the WDM-2. The other trains dieselised were the premier mails and expresses where the WDM2 ( and  to a lesser and localized extent,the WDM4)  hauled an augmented load of 17 coaches and shaved off 4 to 5 hours over a 1500 km run particularly in systems where WP speeds were lower than other double-line systems like ER,CR and WR.\n\nSome of the trains were end to end WDM2 like the [[Himgiri Superfast Express|Himgiri]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world-railways.co.uk/photo/images/113.jpg|title=WDM-2 with himgiri|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> and [[Tamil Nadu Express|Tamil Nadu]] but some were electric hauled for the part run. All averaged speeds well over 65 kmph. Some had the benefit of double line traction  but the Himgiri was running on large single line stretches  and the Tamil Nadu managed over 70 kmph.The WDM-2 locos have a maximum speed of {{convert|120|km/h|abbr=on}},<ref name=\"interactive\">{{cite web|url=http://www.irfca.org/docs/wdm2-interactive.html|title=Interactive Diagram of the WDM-2 Locomotive|author=Sheeju Chandran|date=|work=|publisher=Indian Railways Fan Club|accessdate=April 2, 2010}}</ref> restricted to {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=on}} when run long hood forward - the gear ratio is 65:18.\n\n=== Maintenance ===\nThe WDM-2 had a maintenance schedule of 3000km or 10-days which was recommended by ALCO. These have been extended by 20 days to 30 days by using better and more efficient lubrication oils and other component fluids and improving some bearings for the suspension.The original WDM-2 bearings were very failure prone and often required minor repairing.However the WDM-2 was very easy to operate and maintain because of its simple construction and mechanics and was very reliable.This maintenance is usually done at the nearest Diesel loco shed.\n\n== Sub-classes ==\n\n=== WDM-2A ===\nThe '''WDM-2A''' is a variant of the original WDM-2. These units have been retro-fitted with [[air brake (rail)|air brake]]s, in addition to the original [[vacuum brake]]s.So these locos have dual braking capacity.Despite this some WDM-2A are still marked as WDM-2 only\n\n=== WDM-2B ===\nThe '''WDM-2B''' is a more recent locomotive, built with air brakes as original equipment. They do not have Vacuum brakes. Only some have been classified as WDM-2B.\n\n=== Jumbos ===\n[[File:WDM-2 Diesel loco of PUNE.jpg|thumb|Jumbo variant of the WDM-2|287x287px]]\nThe WDM-2 locos from serial numbers around 17788 to 17890<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irfca.org/apps/locos/show/3461?authenticity_token=1f1Qxu9tgr7S3q+aySo3YvzVrC0l6leDud+8JTLwvRk=&loco_class_id=11&page=17|title=[IRFCA] Indian Railways Locomotive Roster Shakurbasti (SSB) WDM-2 17890 Show|website=www.irfca.org|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>  to were fitted with full-width short hood with intention of giving them an extended visibility for the drivers.

But these locos proved to be not that useful as the loco pilots raised their concerns that they had to stand up to operate them. So a few were modified to have normal short hoods of WDM-2.Some earlier Jumbos were also converted to WDM-3A.\n\nThese locomotives are easy recognizable by short hood with big windows. After Over-ageing of these locomotives, the jumbos were mainly used on Shunting or Departmental works trains. As a consequence few of them are still in service\n\n=== WDM-2S ===\nThis classification are given to WDM-2 which are nearing the end of their service life. These locos can be easily recognized by '0' at the beginning of their road number. These WDM-2 locos are relegated to do Shunting or occasionally haul Departmental works trains.Some WDM-2 remain in classification for many years before they are scrapped.  \n\n== Variants ==\n\n=== WDM-3A ===\n{{Main|Indian locomotive class WDM-3A}}\nThe WDM-3A class are actually upgraded WDM-2 designed to produce more power ( 3100hp instead of 2600hp) and increased reliability (roller bearings instead of conventional ALCO bearings).

However, if the phenol is substituted, the carbon para to the hydroxyl carbon must not be substituted. Anhydrous [[methanesulfonic acid]] should be present as a condensing agent and a solvent that will dehydrate. The combined compounds should be mixed at 90\u00b0C for 5 hours. The temperature should not reach 100\u00b0C at any point. The mixture should then be cooled to room temperature and, once precipitated, added to ice water. The product should then be filtered, washed, and dried.

Calcium should be precipitated out of 0.1 mL of the blood sample serum as calcium oxalate. After that, the decomposition of the calcium oxalate should occur by heat. Then, the sample should be estimated colorimetrically by o-cresolphthalein complexone. The required liquid complexone is made by dissolving 10 mg o-cresolphthalein complexone in 50 mL alkaline borate, and then 50 mL of 0.05 N HCl are added to make the solution's pH 8.5. This method for calcium determination is efficient and effective, requiring a minimal amount of blood serum sample and a reasonable amount of time. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=J.|last2=Lewis|first2=W.H.P.|date=1957|title=The colorimetric estimation of calcium in serum with o-cresolphthalein complexone|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0009898157900633|journal=Clinica Chimica Acta|volume=2|issue=6|pages=576\u2013580|doi=10.1016/0009-8981(57)90063-3|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Determination of Impact of Gadodiamide on Calcium Measurements ===\nGadolinium is given to patients for magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI.It is used as a contrast agent for the exam to improve clarity of the images formed. However, it can react in the human body and have detrimental effects. Therefore, the agent should be removed. One of these gadolinium based agents is gadodiamide. Calcium in the body should be determined accurately to ensure that the Gadodiamide does not have adverse effects on the patient. There are two o-cresolphthalein methods to determine amount of calcium. The o-cresolpthalein methods are effective because it is a calcium binding dye.

This method is used to synthesize [[phenolphthalein]] and [[thymolphthalein]]. To begin, a 2M equivalent of a [[phenol]] or a substituted phenol should be combined with a 1M equivalent of a [[phthalic anhydride]]. However, if the phenol is substituted, the carbon para to the hydroxyl carbon must not be substituted. Anhydrous [[methanesulfonic acid]] should be present as a condensing agent and a solvent that will dehydrate. The combined compounds should be mixed at 90\u00b0C for 5 hours. The temperature should not reach 100\u00b0C at any point. The mixture should then be cooled to room temperature and, once precipitated, added to ice water. The product should then be filtered, washed, and dried. The crude product should then be [[Recrystallize|recrystallized]] with an appropriate solvent with charcoal treatment-furnished pure thalein dyes. The color after recrystallization should be between a light brown and a soft yellow. <ref name=\":0\" /> The described reaction as described is above.   \n\n== Uses ==\nThe compound has uses ranging from medicine to laboratory syntheses of chemically similar compounds. o-Cresophthalein has been used to derive [[Polyamide|polyamides]] and [[Polyimide|polyimides]], colorimetrically estimate [[calcium]] in serum, and predict amount of time to wait before blood collection after a patient receives [[gadodiamide]].  \n\n=== Deriving Polyamides and Polyimides ===\nAromatic polyamides and polyamides are practical compounds due to their temperature resistance, electrical or insulating characteristics, and their mechanical strength. Some of the polyamides and polyimides that can be synthesized by o-Cresophthalein are [[polycarbonate]], [[Acrylate polymer|polyacrylate]], and [[Epoxy resin|epoxy-resin]]. \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Screen Shot 2020-04-11 at 9.53.31 PM.png|thumb|alt=|left]] --><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe diether-diamine 3,3-bis[4-(4-amino-phenoxy)-3-methylphenyl]phthalide, or BNMP, is synthesized by 12 g o-cresophthalein, 11.5 g ''p''-chloronitrobenzene, 5.1 g anhydrous potassium carbonate, and 55 mL of DMF. The compounds should be refluxed together at 160\u00b0C for eight hours. Once it is done and has cooled, it should be mixed with 0.3 L methanol. A precipitate should form and be vacuum filtered to obtain a solid. It should then be washed with water and dried, yielding a yellow product. It should then be recrystallized from glacial acetic acid to yield yellow needles. The product is BNMP. The reaction can go further by combining 15.5 g of BNMP with 0.18 g 10% Pd/C and 50 mL ethanol. They should be stirred at 80 \u00b0C. 7 mL of hydrazine monohydrate should be added drop by drop for one hour. The solution should then be mixed for eight hours. It should then be filtered to separated from the Pd/C and concentrated. The concentrated solution should be added to water, and a precipitate should be formed. It should then be vacuum filtered to isolate the solid, yelding 3,3-Bis[4-(4-aminophenoxy)-3-methylphenyl]pthalide, or BAMP, as a white solid.

Calcium should be precipitated out of 0.1 mL of the blood sample serum as calcium oxalate. After that, the decomposition of the calcium oxalate should occur by heat. Then, the sample should be estimated colorimetrically by o-cresolphthalein complexone. The required liquid complexone is made by dissolving 10 mg o-cresolphthalein complexone in 50 mL alkaline borate, and then 50 mL of 0.05 N HCl are added to make the solution's pH 8.5. This method for calcium determination is efficient and effective, requiring a minimal amount of blood serum sample and a reasonable amount of time. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Stern|first=J.|last2=Lewis|first2=W.H.P.|date=1957|title=The colorimetric estimation of calcium in serum with o-cresolphthalein complexone|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0009898157900633|journal=Clinica Chimica Acta|volume=2|issue=6|pages=576\u2013580|doi=10.1016/0009-8981(57)90063-3|via=}}</ref>\n\n=== Determination of Impact of Gadodiamide on Calcium Measurements ===\nGadolinium is given to patients for magnetic resonance imaging, or an MRI.It is used as a contrast agent for the exam to improve clarity of the images formed. However, it can react in the human body and have detrimental effects. Therefore, the agent should be removed. One of these gadolinium based agents is gadodiamide. Calcium in the body should be determined accurately to ensure that the Gadodiamide does not have adverse effects on the patient. There are two o-cresolphthalein methods to determine amount of calcium. The o-cresolpthalein methods are effective because it is a calcium binding dye. The gadodinium ion with a charge of +3 can be removed from gadodiamide using o-cresolphthalein. For these methods, glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, and time since gadodiamide was given should be recorded.
