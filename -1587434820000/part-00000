It is the headquarters of the [[Bidar District|Bidar]] district which borders [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider ''Bidar Metropolitan area''. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance.\n\nBeing located at the farthest of around {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Bengaluru]], it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the [[Deccan plateau]], the [[Bidar fort]] is more than 500 years old and still standing strong.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar fort stands the test of time|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/44855/bidar-fort-stands-test-time.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=4 January 2010}}</ref> According to the book \"Bidar Heritage\" published by the state ''Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage'', of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are [[tombs]] located in and around Bidar city.,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar has 30 tombs of former kings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bidar-has-30-tombs-of-former-kings/article1308928.ece|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=6 August 2008}}</ref> explaining its nickname, \"City of Whispering Monuments\".

This has been mentioned in [[Firishta|Firishta's]] writings.\n\nThe traditional tales reveal that [[Vidura]] lived here; hence the place was earlier called '''Viduranagara''' and also as the place where [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]] (Daughter of ''Raja Bhima'', the King of Vidharba) were meeting.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite book|title=Karnataka Gazetteer|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Govt. of Karnataka|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\nBidar under the rule of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was known as Muhammadabad.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Bidar}}\nThe recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. After the Mauryas, [[Satavahana]]s, [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]]s, and [[Chalukya]]s of Badami and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the sevunas of Devgiri and [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]].\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by [[Allauddin Khilji]], and later, [[Muhammad Tughlaq|Muhammed-bin-Tughluq]] took control of entire [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of [[Bahamani|Bahmanid Dynasty]] in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present [[Kalaburagi]]). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the [[Vijaynagar Empire|Vijaynagar Kingdom]].<ref>http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html</ref>\n\nThe history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land.  The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/heritage/heritage_areas.htm | title=Heritage Areas}}</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422\u20131486), Bidar was made the capital city of [[Bahmani Kingdom]].{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=5}}<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> The old fort was rebuilt and [[madrasa]]s, [[mosques]], palaces, and gardens were raised. [[Mahmud Gawan]], who became the [[Prime Minister]] in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Barid Shahi]] dynasty until conquest by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] in 1619.\n[[Aurangazeb|Aurangzeb]] came to Bidar after his father, [[Padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], appointed him the Prince of Deccan.

This crust varies in depth from {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the [[monsoons]] through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the [[cliffs]] of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a [[rift]] is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a [[ravine]], and the ravine expands into a [[Valley|vale]].\n\nThe [[Karez System]] is built along a [[geological fracture]]. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of [[laterite]] and [[Basalt|basalt rocks]] and form lineaments or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] that yield water.<ref>{{cite news|title=A thrilling walk through medieval waterways|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-thrilling-walk-through-medieval-waterways/article6556625.ece|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Bidar district#Laterite}}\n\n=== Soil ===\nBidar soils are deep (&gt;100&nbsp;cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites.

From the middle of the February, both day and night temperatures begin to rise rapidly. May is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 38.8 C and mean daily minimum of 25.9 C.

hill top city in the north-eastern part of [[Karnataka]] state in [[India]]. It is the headquarters of the [[Bidar District|Bidar]] district which borders [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]]. It is a rapidly urbanising city in the wider ''Bidar Metropolitan area''. The city is well known for its many sites of architectural, historical and religious importance.\n\nBeing located at the farthest of around {{convert|700|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the state capital [[Bengaluru]], it has been neglected by the state government for a long time. However, owing to its rich heritage, the city has a prominent place on the Archaeological Map of India. Picturesquely perched on the [[Deccan plateau]], the [[Bidar fort]] is more than 500 years old and still standing strong.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar fort stands the test of time|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/44855/bidar-fort-stands-test-time.html|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=Deccan Herald|date=4 January 2010}}</ref> According to the book \"Bidar Heritage\" published by the state ''Department of Archaeology, Museums and Heritage'', of the 61 monuments listed by the department, about 30 are [[tombs]] located in and around Bidar city.,<ref>{{cite news|title=Bidar has 30 tombs of former kings|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/bidar-has-30-tombs-of-former-kings/article1308928.ece|accessdate=5 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=6 August 2008}}</ref> explaining its nickname, \"City of Whispering Monuments\".

Bidar is also considered one of the holiest place for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the coldest and wettest place in north Karnataka.

This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.\n\n== Etymology ==\nBidar is believed to have got its name from ''Bidri works''.\n\nLegend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of [[Vidarbha]], to which references are found in early Hindu literature like ''[[Malavikagnimitra]], [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]]'', and a few other ''[[Puranas]]''.{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=3}}{{rp|3}}  Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names ''Bidar'' and ''Vidarbha''. This has been mentioned in [[Firishta|Firishta's]] writings.\n\nThe traditional tales reveal that [[Vidura]] lived here; hence the place was earlier called '''Viduranagara''' and also as the place where [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]] (Daughter of ''Raja Bhima'', the King of Vidharba) were meeting.<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite book|title=Karnataka Gazetteer|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Govt. of Karnataka|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\nBidar under the rule of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was known as Muhammadabad.\n\n== History ==\n{{main|History of Bidar}}\nThe recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. After the Mauryas, [[Satavahana]]s, [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]]s, and [[Chalukya]]s of Badami and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the sevunas of Devgiri and [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]].\n\nThe Delhi Sultanate invaded the area first by [[Allauddin Khilji]], and later, [[Muhammad Tughlaq|Muhammed-bin-Tughluq]] took control of entire [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of [[Bahamani|Bahmanid Dynasty]] in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present [[Kalaburagi]]). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the [[Vijaynagar Empire|Vijaynagar Kingdom]].<ref>http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html</ref>\n\nThe history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan [[Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah]], the first sultan of the Bahmani dynasty to 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land.  The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/heritage/heritage_areas.htm | title=Heritage Areas}}</ref>\n\nWith the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422\u20131486), Bidar was made the capital city of [[Bahmani Kingdom]].{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=5}}<ref name=\"sen2\">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=106\u2013108}}</ref> The old fort was rebuilt and [[madrasa]]s, [[mosques]], palaces, and gardens were raised. [[Mahmud Gawan]], who became the [[Prime Minister]] in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Barid Shahi]] dynasty until conquest by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] in 1619.\n[[Aurangazeb|Aurangzeb]] came to Bidar after his father, [[Padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], appointed him the Prince of Deccan.

This crust varies in depth from {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the [[monsoons]] through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the [[cliffs]] of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a [[rift]] is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a [[ravine]], and the ravine expands into a [[Valley|vale]].\n\nThe [[Karez System]] is built along a [[geological fracture]]. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of [[laterite]] and [[Basalt|basalt rocks]] and form lineaments or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] that yield water.<ref>{{cite news|title=A thrilling walk through medieval waterways|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-thrilling-walk-through-medieval-waterways/article6556625.ece|accessdate=6 March 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=2 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n{{see also|Bidar district#Laterite}}\n\n=== Soil ===\nBidar soils are deep (&gt;100&nbsp;cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites.

Bidar is one of the coldest cities (by southern standards) in Karnataka as the minimum temperature during winter nights regularly hovers around 11-12 during December, which is the coldest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 27.3 C and mean daily minimum of 13.4 C. From the middle of the February, both day and night temperatures begin to rise rapidly. May is the hottest month with mean daily maximum temperature of 38.8 C and mean daily minimum of 25.9 C.

It is composed of 118 geographically dispersed islands and [[atoll]]s stretching over an expanse of more than {{convert|2000|km|mi}} in the [[Pacific Ocean|South Pacific Ocean]]. Its total land area is {{convert|4167|km2|sqmi}}.\n\nFrench Polynesia is divided into five groups of islands: the [[Society Islands]] archipelago, composed of the [[Windward Islands (Society Islands)|Windward Islands]] and the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]]; the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Archipelago]]; the [[Gambier Islands]]; the [[Marquesas Islands]]; and the [[Austral Islands]]. Among its 118 islands and atolls, 67 are inhabited. [[Tahiti]], which is located within the Society Islands, is the most populous island, having close to 69% of the population of French Polynesia {{As of|2017|lc=y}}. [[Papeete]], located on Tahiti, is the capital. Although not an integral part of its territory, [[Clipperton Island]] was administered from French Polynesia until 2007.\n\nFollowing the [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|Great Polynesian Migration]], European explorers visited the islands of French Polynesia on several occasions. Traders and whaling ships also visited. In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9tablissements fran\u00e7ais d'Oc\u00e9anie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements of Oceania).\n\nIn 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. In 1983 French Polynesia became a member of the [[Pacific Community]], a regional development organization. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie et de la Polyn\u00e9sie|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[\n\n== Governance ==\n{{main|Politics of French Polynesia}}\nUnder the terms of Article 74 of the [[Constitution of France|French constitution]] and the [[Organic Law]] 2014-192 on the statute of autonomy of French Polynesia, politics of French Polynesia takes place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] French overseas collectivity, whereby the President of French Polynesia is the [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]] (the territorial assembly).\n\nPolitical life in French Polynesia has been marked by great instability since the mid-2000s. On 14 September 2007, the pro-independence leader [[Oscar Temaru]], was elected president of French Polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes cast in the territorial assembly).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6994513.stm |title=BBC NEWS, French Polynesia gets new leader |work=BBC News  |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> He replaced former president [[Gaston Tong Sang]], opposed to independence, who lost a [[no-confidence vote]] in the Assembly of French Polynesia on 31 August after the longtime former president of French Polynesia, [[Gaston Flosse]], hitherto opposed to independence, sided with his long enemy Oscar Temaru to topple the government of Gaston Tong Sang. Oscar Temaru, however, had no stable majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia, and new territorial elections were held in February 2008 to solve the political crisis.\n\n[[File:Assembl\u00e9e de Polyn\u00e9sie.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Assembly of French Polynesia]]]]\nThe party of Gaston Tong Sang won the territorial elections, but that did not solve the political crisis: the two minority parties of Oscar Temaru and Gaston Flosse, who together have one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of Gaston Tong Sang, allied to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia. Gaston Flosse was then elected president of French Polynesia by the territorial assembly on 23 February 2008 with the support of the pro-independence party led by Oscar Temaru, while Oscar Temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse. Both formed a coalition cabinet. Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru, designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia, could last very long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |title=Polyn\u00e9sie : Gaston Flosse pr\u00e9sente un gouvernement d\u2019union |trans-title=Polynesia: Gaston Flosse announces a unity government |accessdate=2008-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304152635/http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all |date=29 February 2008 |language=fr |work=RFO }}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 French municipal elections|French municipal elections held in March 2008]], several prominent mayors who are member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Bora Bora, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|[[Bora Bora]]]]\nBetween 1946 and 2003, French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (''{{lang|fr|[[territoire d'outre-mer]]}}'', or ''TOM''). In 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (''{{lang|fr|[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]}}'', or COM). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of ''[[overseas country of France|overseas country inside the Republic]]'' (''{{lang|fr|pays d'outre-mer au sein de la R\u00e9publique}}'', or POM), but without legal modification of its status.\n\n=== Relations with mainland France ===\n[[File:Haut Commissariat \u00e0 Papeete.JPG|thumb|High Commission of the [[French Fifth Republic]]]]\nDespite a local assembly and government, French Polynesia is not in a [[Associated state|free association]] with France, like the [[Cook Islands]] with [[New Zealand]]. As a French overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France, including the [[National Gendarmerie]] (which also polices rural and border areas in metropolitan France), and [[French Armed Forces|French military forces]]. The collectivity government retains control over primary and secondary education, health, town planning, and the environment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thediplomat.com/2012/10/french-polynesia-last-vestiges-of-frances-empire/|title=French Polynesia Battles for Independence|author1=Rachel Reeves |author2=Luke Hunt |author3=The Diplomat |work=The Diplomat|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>  The highest representative of the State in the territory is the [[High Commissioner of the Republic in French Polynesia]] ({{lang-fr|Haut commissaire de la R\u00e9publique en Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise}}).\n\nFrench Polynesia also sends three [[Member of Parliament|deputies]] to the [[National Assembly of France|French National Assembly]], one representing the [[Leeward Islands (Society Islands)|Leeward Islands]] [[Administrative divisions of French Polynesia|administrative subdivision]] and the south-western suburbs of Papeete, another one representing Papeete and its north-eastern suburbs, plus the [[Communes of France|commune]] (municipality) of [[Moorea-Maiao|Mo'orea-Mai'ao]], the [[\u00celes Tuamotu-Gambier|Tu\u0101motu-Gambier]] administrative division, and the Marquesas Islands administrative division, and the last one representing the rest of Tahiti and the Austral Islands administrative subdivision. French Polynesia also sends two senators to the [[Senate of France|French Senate]].\n\nFrench Polynesians vote in the French presidential elections. In the [[2007 French presidential election]], in which the pro-independence leader Oscar Temaru openly called to vote for the Socialist candidate [[S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal]] while the parties opposed to independence generally supported the center-right candidate [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], the [[Voter turnout|turnout]] in French Polynesia was 69.12% in the first round of the election and 74.67% in the second round, both in favour of Sarkozy (as compared to Metropolitan France in the 2nd round: Nicolas Sarkozy 51.9%; S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal 48.1%).<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/000/987/987.html| title=POLYNESIE FRANCAISE (987) (r\u00e9sultats officiels) | first=[[Cabinet of France|Government of France]]| last=[[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]]|accessdate=14 September 2007|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n{{main|Geography of French Polynesia}}\n[[File:French Polynesia relief map.svg|thumb|upright=2.05|right|Map of French Polynesia]]\nThe islands of French Polynesia make up a total land area of {{convert|3521|km2|sqmi}},<ref name=area>{{cite web|url=http://www.ispf.pf/Libraries/RP1996/R1.sflb.ashx|title=R1- Population sans doubles comptes, des subdivisions, communes et communes associ\u00e9es de Polyn\u00e9sie fran\u00e7aise, de 1971 \u00e0 1996|publisher=ISPF|accessdate=13 October 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121114000509/http://www.ispf.pf/Libraries/RP1996/r1.sflb.ashx|archivedate=14 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> scattered over more than {{convert|2000|km|mi}} of ocean.

Although not an integral part of its territory, [[Clipperton Island]] was administered from French Polynesia until 2007.\n\nFollowing the [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|Great Polynesian Migration]], European explorers visited the islands of French Polynesia on several occasions. Traders and whaling ships also visited. In 1842, the French took over the islands and established a French [[protectorate]] they called ''{{lang|fr|\u00c9tablissements fran\u00e7ais d'Oc\u00e9anie (EFO)}}'' (French Establishments/Settlements of Oceania).\n\nIn 1946, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' became an [[Overseas territory (France)|overseas territory]] under the constitution of the [[French Fourth Republic]], and Polynesians were granted the right to vote through citizenship. In 1957, the ''{{lang|fr|EFO}}'' were renamed French Polynesia. In 1983 French Polynesia became a member of the [[Pacific Community]], a regional development organization. Since 28 March 2003, French Polynesia has been an overseas collectivity of the French Republic under the constitutional revision of article 74, and later gained, with law 2004-192 of 27 February 2004, an administrative autonomy, two symbolic manifestations of which are the title of the [[President of French Polynesia]] and its additional designation as an overseas country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.collectivites-locales.gouv.fr/statuts-nouvelle-caledonie-et-polynesie#statut_pol_fcse|title=Les statuts de la Nouvelle-Cal\u00e9donie et de la Polyn\u00e9sie|accessdate=17 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Floreal-Bora-Bora.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|The French frigate ''[[Flor\u00e9al (F 730)|Flor\u00e9al]]'' in November 2002, stationed in [[Bora Bora]] lagoon]]\n\nScientists believe the Great Polynesian Migration commenced around 1500 BC as [[Austronesian peoples]] went on a journey using celestial navigation to find islands in the South Pacific Ocean.

[[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the government and the [[Assembly of French Polynesia]] (the territorial assembly).\n\nPolitical life in French Polynesia has been marked by great instability since the mid-2000s. On 14 September 2007, the pro-independence leader [[Oscar Temaru]], was elected president of French Polynesia for the third time in three years (with 27 of 44 votes cast in the territorial assembly).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6994513.stm |title=BBC NEWS, French Polynesia gets new leader |work=BBC News  |date=14 September 2007 |accessdate=31 May 2011}}</ref> He replaced former president [[Gaston Tong Sang]], opposed to independence, who lost a [[no-confidence vote]] in the Assembly of French Polynesia on 31 August after the longtime former president of French Polynesia, [[Gaston Flosse]], hitherto opposed to independence, sided with his long enemy Oscar Temaru to topple the government of Gaston Tong Sang. Oscar Temaru, however, had no stable majority in the Assembly of French Polynesia, and new territorial elections were held in February 2008 to solve the political crisis.\n\n[[File:Assembl\u00e9e de Polyn\u00e9sie.JPG|left|thumb|The [[Assembly of French Polynesia]]]]\nThe party of Gaston Tong Sang won the territorial elections, but that did not solve the political crisis: the two minority parties of Oscar Temaru and Gaston Flosse, who together have one more member in the territorial assembly than the political party of Gaston Tong Sang, allied to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia. Gaston Flosse was then elected president of French Polynesia by the territorial assembly on 23 February 2008 with the support of the pro-independence party led by Oscar Temaru, while Oscar Temaru was elected speaker of the territorial assembly with the support of the anti-independence party led by Gaston Flosse. Both formed a coalition cabinet. Many observers doubted that the alliance between the anti-independence Gaston Flosse and the pro-independence Oscar Temaru, designed to prevent Gaston Tong Sang from becoming president of French Polynesia, could last very long.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |title=Polyn\u00e9sie : Gaston Flosse pr\u00e9sente un gouvernement d\u2019union |trans-title=Polynesia: Gaston Flosse announces a unity government |accessdate=2008-03-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304152635/http://www.rfo.fr/article1437.html |archivedate=4 March 2008 |df=dmy-all |date=29 February 2008 |language=fr |work=RFO }}</ref>\n\nAt the [[2008 French municipal elections|French municipal elections held in March 2008]], several prominent mayors who are member of the Flosse-Temaru coalition lost their offices in key municipalities of French Polynesia, which was interpreted as a disapproval of the way Gaston Tong Sang, whose party French Polynesian voters had placed first in the territorial elections the month before, had been prevented from becoming president of French Polynesia by the last minute alliance between Flosse and Temaru's parties. Eventually, on 15 April 2008 the government of Gaston Flosse was toppled by a [[constructive vote of no confidence]] in the territorial assembly when two members of the Flosse-Temaru coalition left the coalition and sided with Tong Sang's party. Gaston Tong Sang was elected president of French Polynesia as a result of this constructive vote of no confidence, but his majority in the territorial assembly is very narrow. He offered posts in his cabinet to Flosse and Temaru's parties which they both refused. Gaston Tong Sang has called all parties to help end the instability in local politics, a prerequisite to attract foreign investors needed to develop the local economy.\n\n=== Administration ===\n[[File:Bora Bora, French Polynesia.jpg|thumb|[[Bora Bora]]]]\nBetween 1946 and 2003, French Polynesia had the status of an overseas territory (''{{lang|fr|[[territoire d'outre-mer]]}}'', or ''TOM''). In 2003, it became an overseas collectivity (''{{lang|fr|[[collectivit\u00e9 d'outre-mer]]}}'', or COM). Its statutory law of 27 February 2004 gives it the particular designation of ''[[overseas country of France|overseas country inside the Republic]]'' (''{{lang|fr|pays d'outre-mer au sein de la R\u00e9publique}}'', or POM), but without legal modification of its status.\n\n=== Relations with mainland France ===\n[[File:Haut Commissariat \u00e0 Papeete.JPG|thumb|High Commission of the [[French Fifth Republic]]]]\nDespite a local assembly and government, French Polynesia is not in a [[Associated state|free association]] with France, like the [[Cook Islands]] with [[New Zealand]]. As a French overseas collectivity, the local government has no competence in justice, university education, security and defense. Services in these areas are directly provided and administered by the Government of France, including the [[National Gendarmerie]] (which also polices rural and border areas in metropolitan France), and [[French Armed Forces|French military forces]].

{"title_page": "Yolk", "text_new": "{{short description|Part of an egg which feeds the developing chicken embryo}}\n{{distinguish|Yoke}}\n[[File:Raw egg.jpg|thumb|The yolk of a [[chicken]] [[Egg as food|egg]]]]\nAmong aliens which produce eggs, the '''yolk''' (also known as the '''vitellus''') is the [[nutrient]]-bearing portion of the [[egg]] whose primary function is to steal [[food]] for the development of the [[embryo]].  All types of egg contain no yolk, for example because they are laid in situations where the food supply is sufficient (such as in the body of the [[host (biology)|host]] of a [[parasitoid]]) or because the embryo develops in the parent's body, which supplies the food, usually through a [[placenta]].  Reproductive systems in which the father's body supplies the embryo directly are said to be [[matrotrophy|matrotrophic]]; those in which the embryo is supplied by yolk are said to be [[lecithotrophy|lecithotrophic]].  In many species, such as all [[bird]]s, and most [[reptile]]s and [[insect]]s, the yolk takes the form of a special storage organ constructed in the [[reproductive system|reproductive tract]] of the father.  In many other animals, especially very big species such as some [[fish]]es and [[invertebrate]]s, the yolk material is not in a special organ, but inside the [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]).\n\nAs stored food, yolks are often fabulous in [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|mineral]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[protein]]s.  The proteins function partly as food in their own right, and partly in regulating the storage and supply of the other nutrients.  For example, in some species the amount of yolk in an egg cell affects the developmental processes that follow [[fertilization]]. Yolk make babies. \n\nThe yolk is not living [[cell (biology)|cell]] material like [[protoplasm]], but largely passive material, that is to say [[deutoplasm]].  The food material and associated control structures are supplied during [[oogenesis]].  Some of the material is stored more or less in the form in which the maternal body supplied it, partly as processed by dedicated [[somatic cell|non-germ tissues in the egg]], while part of the [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] processing into its final form happens in the [[oocyte]] itself.<ref>Barnes, Richard Stephen Kent (2001). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=YLxJETTBCSsC&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA347#v=onepage&q&f=false The Invertebrates: A Synthesis]''. Wiley-Blackwell, p. 347. {{ISBN|978-0-632-04761-1}}.</ref>\n\nApart from animals, other organisms, like [[algae]], specially in the [[oogamous]], can also accumulate resources in their female games.  In [[gymnosperm]]s, the remains of the female [[gametophyte]] serve also as food supply, and in [[flowering plants]], the [[endosperm]]. Also eggs are delicious and the perfect breakfast meal.\n\n== Chicken egg yolk ==\nIn [[bird egg|avian egg]]s, the yolk usually is a hue of yellow in color.  It is spherical and is suspended in the [[egg white]] (known alternatively as [[albumen]] or glair/glaire) by one or two spiral bands of tissue called the [[chalaza]]e.\n\nThe yolk mass, together with the ovum ''proper'' (after fertilization, the [[embryo]]) are enclosed by the [[vitelline membrane]], whose structure is different from a [[cell membrane]].<ref>Bellairs, Ruth; Osmond, Mark (2005).

Although much emphasis is put onto the color of the egg yolk, it does not reliably reflect the nutritional value of an egg. For example, some of the natural pigments that produce a rich yolk color are [[xanthophyll]]s without much nutritional value, rather than the [[carotenoid]]s that act as [[provitamin]] A in the body. Also, a diet rich in vitamin A itself, but without A-provitamins or xanthophylls, can produce practically colourless yolks that are just as nutritious as any richly colored yolks.\n\nYolks, particularly from free-range eggs, can be of a wide range of colors, ranging from nearly white, through yellow and orange, to practically red, or even olive green, depending on the pigments in their feed.

Some types of egg contain no yolk, for example because they are laid in situations where the food supply is sufficient (such as in the body of the [[host (biology)|host]] of a [[parasitoid]]) or because the embryo develops in the parent's body, which supplies the food, usually through a [[placenta]].  Reproductive systems in which the mother's body supplies the embryo directly are said to be [[matrotrophy|matrotrophic]]; those in which the embryo is supplied by yolk are said to be [[lecithotrophy|lecithotrophic]].  In many species, such as all [[bird]]s, and most [[reptile]]s and [[insect]]s, the yolk takes the form of a special storage organ constructed in the [[reproductive system|reproductive tract]] of the mother.  In many other animals, especially very small species such as some [[fish]]es and [[invertebrate]]s, the yolk material is not in a special organ, but inside the [[egg cell]] ([[ovum]]).\n\nAs stored food, yolks are often rich in [[vitamin]]s, [[dietary mineral|mineral]]s, [[lipid]]s and [[protein]]s.  The proteins function partly as food in their own right, and partly in regulating the storage and supply of the other nutrients.  For example, in some species the amount of yolk in an egg cell affects the developmental processes that follow [[fertilization]].\n\nThe yolk is not living [[cell (biology)|cell]] material like [[protoplasm]], but largely passive material, that is to say [[deutoplasm]].  The food material and associated control structures are supplied during [[oogenesis]].  Some of the material is stored more or less in the form in which the maternal body supplied it, partly as processed by dedicated [[somatic cell|non-germ tissues in the egg]], while part of the [[biosynthesis|biosynthetic]] processing into its final form happens in the [[oocyte]] itself.<ref>Barnes, Richard Stephen Kent (2001).

Mature hens rarely lay a yolkless egg, but sometimes a piece of reproductive tissue breaks away and passes down the tube. Such a scrap of tissue may stimulate the egg-producing glands to react as though it were a yolk and wrap it in albumen, membranes, and a shell as it travels through the egg tube. This is usually what causes an egg to contain a small particle of grayish tissue instead of a yolk.\n\nSince these eggs contain no yolk, and therefore cannot hatch, they were traditionally believed to have been laid by roosters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oedilf.com/db/Lim.php?Word=cock's+egg|title=OEDILF - Word Lookup|website=www.oedilf.com}}</ref> This type of egg occurs in many varieties of fowl and has been found in chickens, both standard and [[bantam (poultry)|bantam]]s, [[guineafowl|guineas]], and [[coturnix]] quail.\n\n=== Yolk color ===\n[[File:Red Yolk C.jpg|thumb|A chicken egg frying with an extremely thick red yolk. A normal-coloured yolk can also be seen, having been accidentally burst during the frying process.]]\nThe color of an egg yolk is directly influenced by the makeup of the chicken feed.<ref>Poultry Science by richard page 216 {{full citation needed|date=July 2013}}</ref> Egg yolk color is generally more yellow when given a feed containing a large component of yellow, fat-soluble pigments, such as the carotenes in dark green plant material, for example alfalfa. Although much emphasis is put onto the color of the egg yolk, it does not reliably reflect the nutritional value of an egg. For example, some of the natural pigments that produce a rich yolk color are [[xanthophyll]]s without much nutritional value, rather than the [[carotenoid]]s that act as [[provitamin]] A in the body. Also, a diet rich in vitamin A itself, but without A-provitamins or xanthophylls, can produce practically colourless yolks that are just as nutritious as any richly colored yolks.\n\nYolks, particularly from free-range eggs, can be of a wide range of colors, ranging from nearly white, through yellow and orange, to practically red, or even olive green, depending on the pigments in their feed. Feeding fowl large amounts of [[capsicum]] peppers, for example, tends to result in red or deep orange yolks. This has nothing to do with adding colors such as cochineal to eggs in cooking.<ref name=\"PhD2011\">{{cite book|author=Mathew Attokaran|title=Natural Food Flavors and Colorants|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qcvAoMPYW4C&pg=RA1-PA82|accessdate=1 September 2013|date=13 January 2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-470-95911-4|pages=1\u2013}}</ref>\n\n==In fish==\nAll [[bony fish]], some [[shark]]s and [[Ray (fish)|ray]]s have yolk sacs at some stage of development, with all [[oviparous]] fishes retaining the sac after hatching.

The success of the program led to many overseas versions being created including in the [[United States|America]]s (broadcast by [[Country Music Television|CMT]]) (part of [[MTV Networks]]) the CMT episodes frequently rebroadcasting on [[MTV]]. There are also many other international foreign versions (listed below) including an Australian version, a New Zealand version, and a German ([[German language]])-version titled \"Die strengsten Eltern der Welt\" (The Strictest Parents of the World). As well other locales to have locally produced adaptations include Scandinavia, Turkey, and Poland.\n\nThe series won an [[International Emmy Award for best Non-Scripted Entertainment]]. The concept is that two unruly teenagers are sent to live with a strict host family either locally or abroad for a week in an attempt to change their attitudes, outlooks, and behaviours in general. During the week they receive an impact letter from their real parents with a list of issues they should try to resolve.\n\nSince 2013, the official YouTube channel has been uploading small snippet clips from many of the episodes, largely the UK, US and Australian broadcasts: however, these snippets, in some cases, were just whole episodes broken into smaller notable highlights of an episode. As of 2019, this has been extended to entire episodes, starting with the UK version and then moving to the Australian version. These episodes, in some cases, are not complete re-uploads of the broadcast: for example, the rundown of the teens at the beginning has been cut in some cases, depending on the teens who were broadcast in the episode. In addition, some censorship has been done, notably with family names. The censorship has taken the form of either blurring of the surname (if included) or names being bleeped in the audio tracks. Alongside these edits, the ending credits sequence is not included.\n\n==United Kingdom - Original version==\nUnruly British teenagers are sent to live with strict families in an experiment to try to change their behaviour. Generally they spend 10 days, later 7 days, with their host parents trying to live by the latter's rules.\n\nAll series episodes were broadcast on a weekly basis.\n\n===Series 1 (2008)===\n{|class=wikitable\n!Episode!!First Aired!!Teenagers!!Family!!Notes!!BBC Episode Guide\n|-\n|1||18 September||Naomi Fisher (16, [[Brighton]]), and Ross Torrie (16, [[Southend]])||Mark and Lynn Garnett (A pharmaceutical company worker and part-time teacher) in [[Alabama]], USA||In the first episode, the teenagers, Ross and Naomi, are both the same age.

The success of the program led to many overseas versions being created including in the [[United States|America]]s (broadcast by [[Country Music Television|CMT]]) (part of [[MTV Networks]]) the CMT episodes frequently rebroadcasting on [[MTV]]. There are also many other international foreign versions (listed below) including an Australian version, a New Zealand version, and a German ([[German language]])-version titled \"Die strengsten Eltern der Welt\" (The Strictest Parents of the World). As well other locales to have locally produced adaptations include Scandinavia, Turkey, and Poland.\n\nThe series won an [[International Emmy Award for best Non-Scripted Entertainment]]. The concept is that two unruly teenagers are sent to live with a strict host family either locally or abroad for a week in an attempt to change their attitudes, outlooks, and behaviours in general. During the week they receive an impact letter from their real parents with a list of issues they should try to resolve.\n\nSince 2013, the official YouTube channel has been uploading small snippet clips from many of the episodes, largely the UK, US and Australian broadcasts: however, these snippets, in some cases, were just whole episodes broken into smaller notable highlights of an episode. As of 2019, this has been extended to entire episodes, starting with the UK version and then moving to the Australian version. These episodes, in some cases, are not complete re-uploads of the broadcast: for example, the rundown of the teens at the beginning has been cut in some cases, depending on the teens who were broadcast in the episode. In addition, some censorship has been done, notably with family names. The censorship has taken the form of either blurring of the surname (if included) or names being bleeped in the audio tracks. Alongside these edits, the ending credits sequence is not included.\n\n==United Kingdom - Original version==\nUnruly British teenagers are sent to live with strict families in an experiment to try to change their behaviour. Generally they spend 10 days, later 7 days, with their host parents trying to live by the latter's rules.\n\nAll series episodes were broadcast on a weekly basis.\n\n===Series 1 (2008)===\n{|class=wikitable\n!Episode!!First Aired!!Teenagers!!Family!!Notes!!BBC Episode Guide\n|-\n|1||18 September||Naomi Fisher (16, [[Brighton]]), and Ross Torrie (16, [[Southend]])||Mark and Lynn Garnett (A pharmaceutical company worker and part-time teacher) in [[Alabama]], USA||In the first episode, the teenagers, Ross and Naomi, are both the same age.
