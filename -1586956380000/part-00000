The three underscores are an syntax for a {{code|BlankNullSequence[]}}, for a sequence that can be null.\n\nA ReplaceRepeated {{code|//.}} operator can be used to apply this rule repeatedly, until no more change happens:\n<source lang=mathematica>\n{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 } //. sortRule\n(* = ReplaceRepeated[{ 9, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4 }, sortRule] *)\n(* = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9} *)\n</source>\n\nThe pattern matching system also easily gives rise to rule-based integration and derivation. The following are excerpts from the Rubi package of rules:<ref>{{cite web |title=Welcome to Rubi, the Rule-based Integrator |url=https://rulebasedintegration.org/ |website=Rule-based Integration}}</ref>\n<source lang=mathematica>\n(* Reciprocal rule *)\nInt[1/x_,x_Symbol] :=\n  Log[x];\n(* Power rule *)\nInt[x_^m_.,x_Symbol] :=\n  x^(m+1)/(m+1) /;\nFreeQ[m,x] && NeQ[m,-1]\n</source>\n\n=== Online features ===\n<!-- Yeah, this is when it gets wishy-wishy. -->\n\n== Implementations ==\nThe official, and reference, implementation of the Wolfram Language lies in Mathematica and associated online services.

Wolfram also added features for more complex tasks, such as 3D modelling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/|title=Wolfram Language & System Documentation Center|publisher=Reference.wolfram.com|accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\nA name was finally decided for the language in 2013, as Wolfram Research decided to make a version of the language engine free for [[Raspberry Pi]] users, and they needed to come up with a name for it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blog.wolfram.com/2013/11/21/putting-the-wolfram-language-and-mathematica-on-every-raspberry-pi/|title=Putting the Wolfram Language (and Mathematica) on Every Raspberry Pi\u2014Wolfram Blog|publisher=Blog.wolfram.com|accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref> It was included in the recommended software bundle that the [[Raspberry Pi Foundation]] provides for beginners, which caused some controversy due to the Wolfram language's [[Non-free software|proprietary]] nature.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/premium-mathematica-software-free-on-budget-raspberry-pi/|title=Premium Mathematica software free on budget Raspberry Pi - CNET|last=Sherr|first=Ian|date=2013-11-22|publisher=News.cnet.com|accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref> Plans to port the Wolfram language to the [[Intel Edison]] were announced after the board's introduction at [[CES 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heise.de/newsticker/meldung/Intels-Edison-Pentium-System-im-Format-einer-SD-Karte-2076917.html|title=Intels Edison: Pentium-System im Format einer SD-Karte &#124; heise online|author=Daniel AJ Sokolov|date=2014-11-22|publisher=Heise.de|accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref> In 2019, a link was added to make Wolfram libraries compatible with the [[Unity (game engine)|Unity]] game engine, giving game developers access to the language's high level functions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gamasutra.com/view/news/212709/The_Wolfram_Language_will_soon_be_integrated_into_Unity|title=The Wolfram Language will soon be integrated into Unity|date=2014-03-10|publisher=Gamasutra|accessdate=2015-11-05}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://community.wolfram.com/groups/-/m/t/312155|title=Is there a way to use Wolfram Language in Unity3D?|year=2017|publisher=Wolfram|accessdate=2017-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== Syntax ==\n\nThe Wolfram Language syntax is overall similar to the [[M-expression]] of 1960s [[LISP]], with support for [[infix operator]]s and \"function-notation\" function calls. \n\n=== Basics ===\nThe wolfram language writes basic arithmetic expressions using [[infix operator]]s.\n\n<source lang=mathematica>\n(* This is a comment. *)\n\n4 + 3\n(* = 7 *)\n\n1 + 2 * (3 + 4)\n(* = 15 *)\n(* Note that Multiplication can be omitted: 1 + 2 (3 + 4) *)\n\n(* Divisions return rational numbers: *)\n3 / 2\n(* = 3/2 *)\n</source>\n\nFunction calls are denoted with square brackets:\n\n<source lang=mathematica>\nSin[Pi]\n(* = 0 *)\n\n(* This is the function to convert rationals to floating points: *)\nN[3 / 2]\n(* = 1.5 *)\n\n\n</source>\n\nLists are enclosed in curly brackets:\n\n=== Syntax sugar ===\nThe language may deviate from the M-expression paradigm when an alternative, more human-friendly way of showing an expression is available:\n\n* A number of formatting rules are used in this language, including {{code|TeXForm}} for typeset expressions and {{code|InputForm}} for language input.\n* Functions can also be applied using the prefix expression {{code|@}} and the postfix expression {{code|//}}.\n* Derivatives can be denoted with an apostrophe {{code|'}}.\n* The infix operators themselves are considered \"sugar\".\n\nA {{code|FullForm}} formatter desugars the input:<ref>{{cite web |title=FullForm |url=https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/FullForm.html |website=Wolfram Language Documentation}}</ref>\n\n<source lang=mathematica>\nFullForm[1+2]\n(* = Plus[1, 2] *)\n</source>\n\n=== Functional programming ===\n[[Currying]] is supported.\n\n=== Pattern matching ===\nFunctions in the Wolfram Language are basically a case of simple patterns for replacement:\n\n<source lang=mathematica>\nF[x_] := x ^ 0\n</source>\n\nThe {{code|1=:=}} is a \"SetDelayed operator\", so that the x is not immediately looked for. {{code|x_}} is syntax sugar for {{code|Pattern[x, Blank[]]}}, i.e. a \"blank\" for any value to replace x in the rest of the evaluation.\n\nAn iteration of [[bubble sort]] is expressed as:\n<source lang=mathematica>\nsortRule := {x___,y_,z_,k___} /; y>z -> {x,z,y,k}\n(* Rule[Condition[List[PatternSequence[x, BlankNullSequence[]], Pattern[y, Blank[]], Pattern[z, Blank[]], PatternSequence[k, BlankNullSequence[]]], Greater[y, z]], List[x, z, y, k]] *)\n</source>\nThe {{code|/;}} operator is \"condition\", so that the rule only applies when {{code|y>z}}.

It is an [[oceanodromous]] species with a worldwide distribution, excluding [[polar regions]]. Other common names include '''Pacific oarfish''', '''king of herrings''', '''ribbonfish''', and '''streamer fish'''.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n''R. glesne'' is the world's longest [[bony fish]]. Its shape is ribbon-like, narrow laterally, with a [[dorsal fin]] along its entire length, stubby pectoral fins, and long, oar-shaped [[pelvic fin]]s, from which its common name is derived. Its coloration is silvery with dark markings, and its fins are red. Its physical characteristics and its undulating mode of swimming have led to speculation that it might be the source of many \"[[sea serpent]]\" sightings.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''R. glesne'' was first described by [[Peter Ascanius]] in 1772. The genus name, ''Regalecus'', signifies \"belonging to a king\"; the specific epithet ''glesne'' is from \"Glesnaes\", the name of a farm at Glesv\u00e6r (not far from Norway's second largest city of [[Bergen]]), where the [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was found.<ref name=USNatlMuseum />\n\nIts \"king of [[herring]]s\" nickname may derive from its crownlike appendages and from being sighted near shoals of herring, which fishermen thought were being guided by this fish.<ref name=grtbkan /> Its common name, oarfish, is probably an allusion to the shape of its pelvic fins, or else it may refer to the long slender shape of the fish itself.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe giant oarfish is found worldwide in the upper layers of the open ocean (the [[pelagic zone]]). It is believed to be [[oceanodromous]], following its primary food source.<ref name=CaribbeanJS /> It has been found as far north as [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] and as far south as [[52nd parallel south|52\u00b0S]], but is most common in the [[tropics]] to [[middle latitudes]]. It is thought to inhabit the sunlit [[epipelagic]] to dimly lit [[mesopelagic zone]]s, ranging as deeply as {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the surface.<ref name=Olney2005/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:King of herrings.png|left|thumb|1895 illustration of ''Regalecus glesne'']]\n[[File:Regalecus glesne skeleton.jpg|left|thumbnail|Skeleton]]\nThis species is the world's longest bony fish, reaching a record length of {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}; however, unconfirmed specimens of up to {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been reported.<ref name=McClain>{{Cite journal|last=McClain|first=Craig R.|last2=Balk|first2=Meghan A.|last3=Benfield|first3=Mark C.|last4=Branch|first4=Trevor A.|last5=Chen|first5=Catherine|last6=Cosgrove|first6=James|last7=Dove|first7=Alistair D.M.|last8=Gaskins|first8=Lindsay C.|last9=Helm|first9=Rebecca R.|date=2015-01-13|title=Sizing ocean giants: patterns of intraspecific size variation in marine megafauna|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=3|pages=e715|doi=10.7717/peerj.715|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4304853|pmid=25649000}}</ref><ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc /> It is commonly measured to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Fish measurement|in total length]].

The fin rays are soft and may number up to 400 or more. At the head of the fish, the rays are lengthened forming a distinctive red crest. Its pectoral and pelvic fins are nearly adjacent. The pectoral fins are stubby while the pelvic fins are long, single-rayed, and reminiscent of an oar in shape, widening at the tip. Its head is small with the protrusible jaw typical of lampriformes; it has 40 to 58 [[gill raker]]s, and no teeth.<ref name=Nelson_FOTW />\n\nThe organs of the giant oarfish are concentrated toward the head end of the body, possibly enabling it to survive losing large portions of its tail.<ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc /> It has no swim bladder. The liver of ''R. glesne'' is orange or red, the likely result of [[astaxanthin]] in its diet.<ref name=Fox /> The [[lateral line]] begins above and behind the eye then, descending to the lower third of the body, extends to the caudal tip.<ref name=Ruiz_Argentine />\n\nThe skin of ''R. glesne'' is scaleless but covered with [[tubercle]]s. The skin color is silver with streaks, spots or splotches of black or dark gray, and a bluish or brownish tinge on the head. Its fins, including its long dorsal fin and crest, are red, again probably resulting from its diet.<ref name=Fox />\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Regalecus glesne juvenile.png|thumb|left|''R. glesne'' juvenile]]\nLittle is known about oarfish behavior. It has been observed swimming by means of its dorsal fin, and also swimming in a vertical position. In 2010, scientists filmed a giant oarfish in the Gulf of Mexico swimming in the [[mesopelagic]] layer, the first footage of a reliably identified ''R. glesne'' in its natural setting. The footage was caught during a survey, using an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] in the vicinity of [[Thunder Horse PDQ]], and shows the fish swimming in a columnar orientation, tail downward.<ref name=GoMsighting/>\n\nIt feeds on [[krill]] and other small crustaceans, as well as small fish and squid. It is known to spawn from July to December. The eggs are {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} large,<ref name=MSIP /> and float near the surface until hatching.

It is an [[oceanodromous]] species with a worldwide distribution, excluding [[polar regions]]. Other common names include '''Pacific oarfish''', '''king of herrings''', '''ribbonfish''', and '''streamer fish'''.<ref name=iucn/>\n\n''R. glesne'' is the world's longest [[bony fish]]. Its shape is ribbon-like, narrow laterally, with a [[dorsal fin]] along its entire length, stubby pectoral fins, and long, oar-shaped [[pelvic fin]]s, from which its common name is derived. Its coloration is silvery with dark markings, and its fins are red. Its physical characteristics and its undulating mode of swimming have led to speculation that it might be the source of many \"[[sea serpent]]\" sightings.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''R. glesne'' was first described by [[Peter Ascanius]] in 1772. The genus name, ''Regalecus'', signifies \"belonging to a king\"; the specific epithet ''glesne'' is from \"Glesnaes\", the name of a farm at Glesv\u00e6r (not far from Norway's second largest city of [[Bergen]]), where the [[Type (biology)|type specimen]] was found.<ref name=USNatlMuseum />\n\nIts \"king of [[herring]]s\" nickname may derive from its crownlike appendages and from being sighted near shoals of herring, which fishermen thought were being guided by this fish.<ref name=grtbkan /> Its common name, oarfish, is probably an allusion to the shape of its pelvic fins, or else it may refer to the long slender shape of the fish itself.\n\n==Distribution==\nThe giant oarfish is found worldwide in the upper layers of the open ocean (the [[pelagic zone]]). It is believed to be [[oceanodromous]], following its primary food source.<ref name=CaribbeanJS /> It has been found as far north as [[72nd parallel north|72\u00b0N]] and as far south as [[52nd parallel south|52\u00b0S]], but is most common in the [[tropics]] to [[middle latitudes]]. It is thought to inhabit the sunlit [[epipelagic]] to dimly lit [[mesopelagic zone]]s, ranging as deeply as {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}} below the surface.<ref name=Olney2005/>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:King of herrings.png|left|thumb|1895 illustration of ''Regalecus glesne'']]\n[[File:Regalecus glesne skeleton.jpg|left|thumbnail|Skeleton]]\nThis species is the world's longest bony fish, reaching a record length of {{convert|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}; however, unconfirmed specimens of up to {{convert|11|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|17|m|ft|abbr=on}} have been reported.<ref name=McClain>{{Cite journal|last=McClain|first=Craig R.|last2=Balk|first2=Meghan A.|last3=Benfield|first3=Mark C.|last4=Branch|first4=Trevor A.|last5=Chen|first5=Catherine|last6=Cosgrove|first6=James|last7=Dove|first7=Alistair D.M.|last8=Gaskins|first8=Lindsay C.|last9=Helm|first9=Rebecca R.|date=2015-01-13|title=Sizing ocean giants: patterns of intraspecific size variation in marine megafauna|journal=PeerJ|language=en|volume=3|pages=e715|doi=10.7717/peerj.715|issn=2167-8359|pmc=4304853|pmid=25649000}}</ref><ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc /> It is commonly measured to {{convert|3|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[Fish measurement|in total length]]. The maximum recorded weight of a giant oarfish is {{convert|270|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc/>\n\nIts shape is ribbonlike, narrow laterally, with a dorsal fin along its entire length from between its eyes to the tip of its tail. The fin rays are soft and may number up to 400 or more. At the head of the fish, the rays are lengthened forming a distinctive red crest. Its pectoral and pelvic fins are nearly adjacent. The pectoral fins are stubby while the pelvic fins are long, single-rayed, and reminiscent of an oar in shape, widening at the tip. Its head is small with the protrusible jaw typical of lampriformes; it has 40 to 58 [[gill raker]]s, and no teeth.<ref name=Nelson_FOTW />\n\nThe organs of the giant oarfish are concentrated toward the head end of the body, possibly enabling it to survive losing large portions of its tail.<ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc /> It has no swim bladder. The liver of ''R. glesne'' is orange or red, the likely result of [[astaxanthin]] in its diet.<ref name=Fox /> The [[lateral line]] begins above and behind the eye then, descending to the lower third of the body, extends to the caudal tip.<ref name=Ruiz_Argentine />\n\nThe skin of ''R. glesne'' is scaleless but covered with [[tubercle]]s. The skin color is silver with streaks, spots or splotches of black or dark gray, and a bluish or brownish tinge on the head. Its fins, including its long dorsal fin and crest, are red, again probably resulting from its diet.<ref name=Fox />\n\n==Behavior==\n[[File:Regalecus glesne juvenile.png|thumb|left|''R. glesne'' juvenile]]\nLittle is known about oarfish behavior. It has been observed swimming by means of its dorsal fin, and also swimming in a vertical position. In 2010, scientists filmed a giant oarfish in the Gulf of Mexico swimming in the [[mesopelagic]] layer, the first footage of a reliably identified ''R. glesne'' in its natural setting. The footage was caught during a survey, using an [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] in the vicinity of [[Thunder Horse PDQ]], and shows the fish swimming in a columnar orientation, tail downward.<ref name=GoMsighting/>\n\nIt feeds on [[krill]] and other small crustaceans, as well as small fish and squid. It is known to spawn from July to December. The eggs are {{convert|2.5|mm|abbr=on|1}} large,<ref name=MSIP /> and float near the surface until hatching. Its larvae are also observed near the surface during this season.<ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc /> As an adult, it is believed to be solitary.\n\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Relationship with humans==\n[[File:Giant Oarfish.jpg|thumb|400px|United States navy trainees display a {{convert|23|ft|m|adj=on|sigfig=1}} giant oarfish discovered by their instructor on the beach of [[Naval Amphibious Base Coronado]] in 1996.<ref name=AllHands/>]]\n''R. glesne'' is not fished commercially, but is an occasional [[bycatch]] in commercial nets, and as such it has been marketed.<ref name=FishBase /><ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc />\n\nBecause they are not often seen and because of their size, elongated bodies, and appearance, giant oarfish are presumed to be responsible for some [[sea serpent]] sightings.<ref name=Ellis_Monsters/>  Formerly considered rare, the species is now suspected to be comparatively common,<ref name=Burton_WildlifeEncyc/> although sightings of healthy specimens in their natural habitat are unusual.\n\nThe giant oarfish and the related ''[[Regalecus russelii|R. russelii]]'' are sometimes known as \"earthquake fish\" because they are popularly believed to appear before and after an earthquake.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.livescience.com/40628-animals-predict-earthquakes-oarfish.html|title=Can Oarfish Predict Earthquakes?|author= Marc Lallanilla|date=22 October 2013|publisher=Livescience.com}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|url= http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20100306f3.html\n|title= Sea serpents' arrival puzzling, or portentous?\n|accessdate= 6 Mar 2010\n|first= Daiki\n|last= Yamamoto\n|date= 4 Mar 2010\n|publisher= Kyodo News\n|quote= TOYAMA \u2014 A rarely seen deep-sea fish regarded as something of a mystery has been giving marine experts food for thought recently after showing up in large numbers along the Sea of Japan coast.\n}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n;Citations\n{{Reflist|35em|refs=\n<ref name=iucn>{{cite journal|last=Smith-Vaniz|first=W.

The fricated alveolar and postalveolar series are tend to be realized as slightly retroflex preceding {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, though these variants are in free variation with the unretroflexed realizations. The plain alveolar and velar series are slightly fronted preceding ''i'' and ''e'', and slightly backed and rounded preceding {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n===Vowels===\nPlains Apache distinguishes four vowel qualities, much like the other Southern Athabaskan languages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[Close vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i~\u026a}} ''i''|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|u~o}} ''o''\n|-\n! [[Open-mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|\u025b}} ''e''\n|-\n! [[Open vowel|Low]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|a}}\n|}\nAdditionally, all vowels may be either short or long and nasal or oral. Length is indicated in the orthography by writing the vowel twice (e.g. ''k\u00f3\u00f3'', \"water\"); nasalization is indicated with an [[ogonek]] (e.g. ''n\u01eb\u0300\u01eb\u0300'', \"earth\"). When long, the realization of ''i'' tends to be closer to {{IPA|[i]}}, and when short, closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}}. An analogous alternation is true of ''o'' {{IPA|[u~o]}}, although this variation is more free, and is lexicalized by some speakers in certain words.\n\n===Syllable Structure===\nThe Plains Apache syllable is maximally CCV:C, e.g. ''st\u0142\u00e8\u00e8h'' \"pants\", though initial clusters are rare and must co-occur with a long vowel, making most syllables (C)V(:)(C), e.g. ''x\u00f2\u00f2\u0161'' \"cactus\" and ''s\u00e9\u00e9'' \"dust\". All consonants may appear in the syllable onset, although ''l'' and a null onset are not permitted word-initially; only ''d, g, \u0294, s, z, \u0161, \u017e, h, l,'' and ''\u0142'' may appear in the syllable coda, whether word-final or not.\n\n=== Tone ===\nPlains Apache has a [[register tone]] system with two levels, low and high. Low is written with a grave accent (e.g. ''b\u00ecs'', \"bank\"), and high is written with an acute accent (e.g. ''\u0161\u00e9\u0142'', \"kindness\"). Syllables with short vowels bear a single toneme, but those with long vowels have one toneme for each [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]] of the vowel, making for a total of four contours: high-high (e.g. ''t\u02bc\u01eb\u0301\u01eb\u0301\u0161'', \"bark\"), high-low (e.g. ''b\u00e9\u00e8-l\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300\u0294'', \"point\"), low-high (e.g. ''g\u00f2\u00f3\u0294'', \"snake\"), and low-low (e.g. ''g\u00e0\u00e0d'', \"spread of cedars\").\n\n== Morphology ==\n\n=== Nouns ===\nAlmost every noun in Plains Apache can optionally take a pronominal prefix to indicate its possessor. These prefixes are as follows (some of the prefixes have multiple forms in free variation; in these cases, the more common variant is listed first).\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!\n![[Grammatical person|First]]\n[[Grammatical person|person]]\n![[Grammatical person|Second]]\n[[Grammatical person|person]]\n![[Grammatical person|Third]]\n[[Grammatical person|person]]\n!Third person\n[[Indefinite pronoun|indefinite]]\n![[Fourth person|Fourth]]\n[[Fourth person|person]]\n|-\n![[Singular number|Singular]]\n|\u0161\u00ed-\n|d\u00ed-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |b\u00ed-\n~ m\u00ed-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |\u0294\u00ed-\n| rowspan=\"2\" |g\u00f3\u00f3-\n~ g\u00f3-\n|-\n![[Plural]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |d\u00e0x\u00ed- ~ d\u00e1-\n|}\nSome of these forms require further explanation. The indefinite third person may be used when the possessor is unknown, and is similar in meaning to \"someone's\" (e.g. ''\u0294\u00ed-b\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300s'' \"a hoop owned by some unknown person\"). The fourth person is reserved for possessors who are deemed to be in some way remote from the speaker, usually socially; compare ''b\u00ed-b\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300s'', which would refer to a hoop belonging to someone who the speaker is familiar with and interacts with frequently and informally, and ''g\u00f3\u00f3-b\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300s'', used for someone who the speaker has a purely formal relationship with and does not know well.\n\nThe noun bases to which these prefixes can be added are of one of three classes: primary, compound, and nominalized. Primary noun bases are mostly monosyllabic stems such as ''t'\u00e8\u00e8\u0161'' \"charcoal,\" though a few of them seem to consist of an unidentified prefix and a stem (e.g. ''d\u00e8\u00e8-\u00e9h'' \"antelope\"), and some others are simply unanalyzable polysyllables, perhaps originally onomatopoeic (e.g. ''\u0294\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300\u0294\u0105\u0300\u0294'' \"magpie\"). Many of the stem nouns have multiple different forms depending on their morphological context, with an absolute form when unpossessed, an inflected form when possessed, and a combining form in compounds or nominalized phrases. The formation of these is generally irregular, although certain patterns do exist, such as initial ''x'', ''s'', and ''\u0142'' becoming ''\u0263'', ''z'', and ''l'' when inflected (e.g. ''s\u00e0\u00e0'' > ''b\u00ed-z\u00e0\u00e0'' \"his language\") and a final V:h becoming V\u0294 (e.g. ''t'\u00e0\u00e0h'' > ''b\u00ed-t'\u00e1\u0294'' \"his feather\").\n\nSome stem nouns, especially those referring to body parts, are [[Inalienably possessed noun|inalienably possessed]], i.e. they cannot occur without a possessor prefix (e.g. ''b\u00ed-d\u00e0\u00e0h'' \"his lips,\" but not *''d\u00e0\u00e0h''). In these cases the indefinite prefix must be used if one wishes to talk about the object without specifying the possessor (''\u0294\u00ed-d\u00e0\u00e0h'' \"lips\"). In order to indicate [[alienable possession]] of these nouns, a second possessor prefix can be attached before the indefinite prefix, yielding forms like ''b\u00ed-\u0294\u00ed-k'\u00e0\u0294''  \"his fat (which comes from the body of something or someone else, but is now in his possession)\" contrasting with ''b\u00ed-k'\u00e0\u0294'' \"his fat (which is a part of his own body).\" Some of these nouns may change their meaning when preceded by ''\u0294\u00ed-'', such as ''\u0294\u00ed-b\u00e8\u0294'' \"milk\" versus ''b\u00ed-b\u00e8\u0294'' \"her breast\". Lastly, some can only take the indefinite prefix, effectively turning them into regular alienably possessed nouns starting with ''\u0294\u00ed-'' (e.g. ''\u0294\u00ed-d\u00e0\u00e0h'' \"enemy,\" but ''b\u00ed-\u0294\u00ed-d\u00e0\u00e0h'' \"his enemy,\" not *''b\u00ed-d\u00e0\u00e0h'').\n\nThe second kind of noun bases are compounds, which are formed from two noun stems and sometimes an enclitic of obscure meaning (e.g. ''b\u00ed-d\u00e9\u00e9-k\u00f2\u00f2'' \"his tears,\" from ''d\u00e9\u00e9'', combining form of \"eye,\" and ''k\u00f2\u00f2'', combining form of \"water\"). The third kind of noun bases are nominalized verbs or phrases, which may or may not include some kind of a relative enclitic. Examples include ''d\u00e1\u0142-ts'\u00e0\u00e0h'' \"zebra, tiger,\" from the identical verb meaning \"marks are on it,\" and ''h\u00e0-ts'\u00ed-\u0263\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300s-\u00e9'' \"badger,\" from the verb ''h\u00e0-ts'\u00ed-\u0263\u0105\u0300\u0105\u0300s'' \"he scratches out\" plus the relative enclitic ''-\u00e9'' \"he who.\"\n\n=== Verbs ===\nLike those of most other Athabaskan languages, Plains Apache verbs are highly morphologically complex, exhibiting polypersonal agreement, rich aspect marking, and the characteristic Athabaskan classifier system. Bittle (1963) identifies 14 positions in the verb template, divided into the verbal base (which defines the lexical meaning of the verb) and paradigmatic prefixes (which inflect the verb for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and voice). The following verb template table is reproduced from Bittle:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Position\n! colspan=\"2\" |Verbal base\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Paradigmatic prefixes\n|-\n!Theme\n!Adverbial prefixes\n|-\n!1\n|\n|\n|Indirect object\n|-\n!2\n|\n|Postposition\n|\n|-\n!3\n|\n|Adverbial prefixes\n|\n|-\n!4\n|Theme prefix\n|\n|\n|-\n!5\n|\n|\n|Iterative mode\n|-\n!6\n|\n|\n|Number prefix\n|-\n!7\n|\n|\n|Direct object\n|-\n!8\n|\n|\n|Deictic prefixes\n|-\n!9\n|\n|Adverbial prefixes\n|\n|-\n!10\n|\n|\n|Tense prefix\n|-\n!11\n|\n|\n|Modal prefixes\n|-\n!12\n|\n|\n|Subject pronoun\n|-\n!13\n|\n|\n|Classifier\n|-\n!14\n|Stem\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== Syntax ==\n{{Main|Southern Athabascan grammar#Typological overview}}\nLike other Southern Athabaskan languages, Plains Apache is generally head-final, with a predominant word order of [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|subject-object-verb]] and [[postpositions]] rather than prepositions. This is illustrated in the following example sentences:\n\n:{{interlinear| lang = apk\n|D\u00e8\u00e8n\u00e1\u00e1 k\u00f3\u00f3 \u0294\u00ed\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9\u0161\n|d\u00e8\u00e8n\u00e1\u00e1 k\u00f3\u00f3 \u0294\u00ed-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9\u0161\n|man water INDEF-CL-boil\n|'The man boils water'}}\n\n:{{interlinear| lang = apk\n|S\u00e9\u00e9 m\u00ed\u00edd\u017e\u01eb\u0301\u0294d\u0105\u0301\u0294 d\u00e0y\u00ec\u0263\u00edn\u00ed\u00ed\u0142\n|s\u00e9\u00e9 mi-d\u017e\u01eb\u0301\u0294-d\u0105\u0301\u0294 d\u00e0-yi-\u0263\u00ed-\u00f8-\u00f8-n\u00ed\u00ed\u0142\n|dirt 3SG-back-PP ADV-3OBJ-PROG-3SUBJ-CLF-throw|'He threw dirt on his back'}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apache]]\n* [[Southern Athabaskan languages]]\n* [[Kiowa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Bittle, William E.

As a member of the broader Athabaskan family, it has an extremely complex system of verbal morphology, often enabling entire sentences to be constructed with only a verb: for example, ''\u0161\u00ec\u0263\u00e0d\u00e0dl\u00f2h'', meaning \"He is going to laugh at me.\"\n\n==Phonology==\nThis article follows the orthography of Bittle (1963); where this differs from the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]], IPA is given on the left, and Bittle's transcription is given on the right in italics.\n===Consonants===\nPlains Apache has a large consonant inventory resembling that of its close relatives Navajo and Western Apache.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Bilabial consonant|Bilabial]]\n! colspan=\"3\" | [[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" |[[Postalveolar consonant|Postalveolar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n! rowspan=\"2\" | [[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-style=\"font-size: x-small;\"\n! plain\n!

The fricated alveolar and postalveolar series are tend to be realized as slightly retroflex preceding {{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}, though these variants are in free variation with the unretroflexed realizations. The plain alveolar and velar series are slightly fronted preceding ''i'' and ''e'', and slightly backed and rounded preceding {{IPA|/o/}}.\n\n===Vowels===\nPlains Apache distinguishes four vowel qualities, much like the other Southern Athabaskan languages.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n! scope=\"col\" |\n! scope=\"col\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[Close vowel|High]]\n|{{IPA|i~\u026a}} ''i''|| rowspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|u~o}} ''o''\n|-\n! [[Open-mid vowel|Mid]]\n|{{IPA|\u025b}} ''e''\n|-\n! [[Open vowel|Low]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |{{IPA|a}}\n|}\nAdditionally, all vowels may be either short or long and nasal or oral. Length is indicated in the orthography by writing the vowel twice (e.g. ''k\u00f3\u00f3'', \"water\"); nasalization is indicated with an [[ogonek]] (e.g. ''n\u01eb\u0300\u01eb\u0300'', \"earth\"). When long, the realization of ''i'' tends to be closer to {{IPA|[i]}}, and when short, closer to {{IPA|[\u026a]}}. An analogous alternation is true of ''o'' {{IPA|[u~o]}}, although this variation is more free, and is lexicalized by some speakers in certain words.\n\n===Syllable Structure===\nThe Plains Apache syllable is maximally CCV:C, e.g. ''st\u0142\u00e8\u00e8h'' \"pants\", though initial clusters are rare and must co-occur with a long vowel, making most syllables (C)V(:)(C), e.g. ''x\u00f2\u00f2\u0161'' \"cactus\" and ''s\u00e9\u00e9'' \"dust\". All consonants may appear in the syllable onset, although ''l'' and a null onset are not permitted word-initially; only ''d, g, \u0294, s, z, \u0161, \u017e, h, l,'' and ''\u0142'' may appear in the syllable coda, whether word-final or not.\n\n=== Tone ===\nPlains Apache has a [[register tone]] system with two levels, low and high.

Bittle (1963) identifies 14 positions in the verb template, divided into the verbal base (which defines the lexical meaning of the verb) and paradigmatic prefixes (which inflect the verb for person, number, tense, aspect, mood, and voice). The following verb template table is reproduced from Bittle:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Position\n! colspan=\"2\" |Verbal base\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Paradigmatic prefixes\n|-\n!Theme\n!Adverbial prefixes\n|-\n!1\n|\n|\n|Indirect object\n|-\n!2\n|\n|Postposition\n|\n|-\n!3\n|\n|Adverbial prefixes\n|\n|-\n!4\n|Theme prefix\n|\n|\n|-\n!5\n|\n|\n|Iterative mode\n|-\n!6\n|\n|\n|Number prefix\n|-\n!7\n|\n|\n|Direct object\n|-\n!8\n|\n|\n|Deictic prefixes\n|-\n!9\n|\n|Adverbial prefixes\n|\n|-\n!10\n|\n|\n|Tense prefix\n|-\n!11\n|\n|\n|Modal prefixes\n|-\n!12\n|\n|\n|Subject pronoun\n|-\n!13\n|\n|\n|Classifier\n|-\n!14\n|Stem\n|\n|\n|}\n\n== Syntax ==\n{{Main|Southern Athabascan grammar#Typological overview}}\nLike other Southern Athabaskan languages, Plains Apache is generally head-final, with a predominant word order of [[Subject\u2013object\u2013verb|subject-object-verb]] and [[postpositions]] rather than prepositions. This is illustrated in the following example sentences:\n\n:{{interlinear| lang = apk\n|D\u00e8\u00e8n\u00e1\u00e1 k\u00f3\u00f3 \u0294\u00ed\u0142b\u00e9\u00e9\u0161\n|d\u00e8\u00e8n\u00e1\u00e1 k\u00f3\u00f3 \u0294\u00ed-\u0142-b\u00e9\u00e9\u0161\n|man water INDEF-CL-boil\n|'The man boils water'}}\n\n:{{interlinear| lang = apk\n|S\u00e9\u00e9 m\u00ed\u00edd\u017e\u01eb\u0301\u0294d\u0105\u0301\u0294 d\u00e0y\u00ec\u0263\u00edn\u00ed\u00ed\u0142\n|s\u00e9\u00e9 mi-d\u017e\u01eb\u0301\u0294-d\u0105\u0301\u0294 d\u00e0-yi-\u0263\u00ed-\u00f8-\u00f8-n\u00ed\u00ed\u0142\n|dirt 3SG-back-PP ADV-3OBJ-PROG-3SUBJ-CLF-throw|'He threw dirt on his back'}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Apache]]\n* [[Southern Athabaskan languages]]\n* [[Kiowa]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* Bittle, William E.

The bird is also known as the '''American mourning dove''' or the '''rain dove''', and erroneously as the '''turtle dove''', and was once known as the '''Carolina pigeon''' or '''Carolina turtledove'''.<ref>Torres, J.K.

Knopf, New York, p. 730, {{ISBN|0517032880}}</ref> It is one of the most abundant and widespread of all North American birds. It is also a leading gamebird, with more than 20 million birds (up to 70&nbsp;million in some years) shot annually in the U.S., both for sport and for meat. Its ability to sustain its population under such pressure is due to its prolific breeding; in warm areas, one pair may raise up to six [[Offspring|broods]] of two young each in a single year. The wings make an unusual whistling sound upon take-off and landing, a form of [[sonation]]. The bird is a strong [[Bird flight|flier]], capable of speeds up to {{Convert|88|kph|abbr = on}}.<ref>{{cite journal|author = Bastin, E.W.|year = 1952|title = Flight-speed of the Mourning Dove|journal = Wilson Bulletin|volume = 64|issue = 1|page = 47|url = http://sora.unm.edu/node/127141}}</ref> It is the [[national bird]] of the [[British Virgin Islands]].\n\nMourning doves are light grey and brown and generally muted in color. Males and females are similar in appearance. The species is generally [[monogamous]], with two squabs (young) per brood. Both parents incubate and care for the young. Mourning doves eat almost exclusively seeds, but the young are fed [[crop milk]] by their parents.\n\n== Taxonomy ==\n{{Cladogram\n|caption=[[Cladogram]] showing the position of the mourning dove in the genus ''[[Zenaida]]''.<ref>{{ cite journal | last1=Banks | first1=R.C. | last2=Weckstein | first2=J.D. | last3=Remsen Jr | first3=J.V. | last4=Johnson | first4=K.P. | year=2013 | title=Classification of a clade of New World doves (Columbidae: Zenaidini) | journal=Zootaxa | volume=3669 | issue=2 | pages=184\u2013188 | doi=10.11646/zootaxa.3669.2.11 | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/256980440 }}</ref>\n|align=right\n|cladogram={{Cladex| style=font-size:80%;line-height:75%;width:220px;\n|label1=''Zenaida''&nbsp; \n|1={{clade\n   |1={{clade\n      |1={{clade\n         |1={{clade\n            |1=[[Mourning dove]]\n            |2=[[Socorro dove]]\n            }}\n         |2=[[Eared dove]]\n         }}\n      |2=[[Zenaida dove]]\n      }}\n   |2={{clade\n      |1=[[White-winged dove]]\n      |2=[[West Peruvian dove]]\n      }}\n   }}\n}}\n}}\n\nIn 1731 the English naturalists [[Mark Catesby]] described and illustrated the [[passenger pigeon]] and the mourning dove on successive pages of his ''The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands''.

On rare occasions, mourning doves have been seen flying over the Gulf of Mexico, but this appears to be exceptional. Mourning doves (Z. m. carolinensis) are native to the [[North Atlantic]] archipelago of [[Bermuda]], approximately {{convert|1070|km|0|abbr=on}} east-southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]] (the nearest landfall); {{convert|1236|km|0|abbr=on}} south of [[Cape Sable Island]], [[Nova Scotia]]; and {{convert|1538|km|0|abbr=on}} due north of the [[British Virgin Islands]], from which they had been migratory, but since the 1950s have become year-round ''residents''. <ref>[http://www.audubon.bm/birding/bermuda-birds/118-mourning-dove The Bermuda [[Audubon Society]]: ''Mourning Dove '' </ref>\n\nSpring migration north runs from March to May. Fall migration south runs from September to November, with immatures moving first, followed by adult females and then by adult males.<ref name=\"NRCS p2\" /> Migration is usually during the day, in flocks, and at low altitudes.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> However, not all individuals migrate. Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of [[bird feeder]]s.\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nMourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. [[Dust bath|Dustbathing]] is common as well.\n[[File:Zenaida macroura pair.jpg|thumb|Pair of doves in late winter in Minnesota]]\nOutside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Doucette, D.R. |author2=Reebs, S.G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1994|title = Influence of temperature and other factors on the daily roosting times of Mourning Doves in winter|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume = 72|pages = 1287\u201390|doi = 10.1139/z94-171|issue = 7}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Zenaida macroura MWNH 0568.JPG|thumb|Mourning dove egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]|alt=]]\n[[Courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|Courtship]] begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down.

Even in Canada some mourning doves remain through winter, sustained by the presence of [[bird feeder]]s.\n\n==Behaviour and ecology==\nMourning doves sunbathe or rainbathe by lying on the ground or on a flat tree limb, leaning over, stretching one wing, and keeping this posture for up to twenty minutes. These birds can also waterbathe in shallow pools or bird baths. [[Dust bath|Dustbathing]] is common as well.\n[[File:Zenaida macroura pair.jpg|thumb|Pair of doves in late winter in Minnesota]]\nOutside the breeding season, mourning doves roost communally in dense deciduous trees or in conifers. During sleep, the head rests between the shoulders, close to the body; it is not tucked under the shoulder feathers as in many other species. During the winter in Canada, roosting flights to the roosts in the evening, and out of the roosts in the morning, are delayed on colder days.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Doucette, D.R. |author2=Reebs, S.G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year = 1994|title = Influence of temperature and other factors on the daily roosting times of Mourning Doves in winter|journal = Canadian Journal of Zoology|volume = 72|pages = 1287\u201390|doi = 10.1139/z94-171|issue = 7}}</ref>\n\n===Breeding===\n[[File:Zenaida macroura MWNH 0568.JPG|thumb|Mourning dove egg, Collection [[Museum Wiesbaden]]|alt=]]\n[[Courtship#Courtship in the animal kingdom|Courtship]] begins with a noisy flight by the male, followed by a graceful, circular glide with outstretched wings and head down.

It often gathers at drinking spots around dawn and dusk.\n\nMourning doves eat almost exclusively [[seed]]s, which make up more than 99% of their diet.<ref name = \"Cornell\"/> Rarely, they will eat [[snail]]s or [[insect]]s. Mourning doves generally eat enough to fill their [[Crop (anatomy)|crops]] and then fly away to digest while resting. They often swallow grit such as fine [[gravel]] or [[sand]] to assist with [[digestion]]. The species usually forages on the ground, walking but not hopping.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" /> At bird feeders, mourning doves are attracted to one of the largest ranges of seed types of any North American bird, with a preference for rapeseed, corn, [[millet]], [[safflower]], and [[sunflower]] seeds. Mourning doves do not dig or scratch for seeds, though they will push aside ground litter; instead they eat what is readily visible.<ref name=\"NRCS p3\" /><ref name = \"Cornell\"/> They will sometimes perch on plants and eat from there.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\nMourning doves show a preference for the seeds of certain species of plant over others.

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]).

He played [[college football]] at [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] and the [[College of San Mateo]] as a [[quarterback]]. He was drafted by the Patriots in the seventh round of the [[2009 NFL Draft]]. Edelman primarily plays on offense and as a punt returner; he has also been pressed into service as a [[cornerback]] at times when the Patriots have been shorthanded on defense.\n\nEdelman is one of the most productive receivers in post-season history, ranking second overall (behind [[Jerry Rice]]) in both post-season receiving yards and post-season receptions.  He has played in four Super Bowls ([[Super Bowl XLVI|XLVI]], [[Super Bowl XLIX|XLIX]], [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] and [[Super Bowl LIII|LIII]]). In each of the last three, he led all wide receivers in receiving yards. He was named [[Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award|Super Bowl MVP]] for Super Bowl LIII, in which he had 10 catches for 141 yards receiving, more than half of his team's total receiving yardage. He holds the Super Bowl records for career punt returns (8) and first-half receptions in a single game (7).\n\n==Early years==\nEdelman was born in [[Redwood City, California]], to Angela (n\u00e9e Gole) and Frank Edelman, a mechanic who owns an A-1 Auto Tech.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/12659571 |title=Julian Edelman enjoys his moment |date=February 19, 2015 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> He has two siblings, Jason and Nicole.<ref>[http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 Julian Edelman profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131230846/http://www.patriots.com/team/roster/Julian-Edelman/1f41cf38-740b-4d2a-9109-7e13b48567e7 |date=January 31, 2012 }}, Patriots.com; accessed November 6, 2015.</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://search.ancestry.com/search/db.aspx?dbid=5247 |title=California Birth Index, 1905\u20131995 |publisher=Ancestry |access-date=February 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2014/01/16/julian-edelman-took-back-road-nfl/Qbv5QnIQh9BpRn9ZetrSRO/story.html |title=Julian Edelman took the 'back road' to the NFL |website=BostonGlobe.com |access-date=April 9, 2015}}</ref> Originally raised as a [[Christians|Christian]], his ancestry includes [[Greeks|Greek]], [[English people|English]], [[Scottish people|Scottish]], Irish, [[Ashkenazi Jewish]], and [[Germans|German]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |title=Edelman MOT? \u00bb Kaplan's Korner on Jews and Sports |date=September 21, 2009 |website=Njjewishnews.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108212449/http://njjewishnews.com/kaplanskorner/2009/09/21/edelman-mot/ |archive-date=November 8, 2014 |access-date=January 18, 2017}}</ref> His mother was born in [[Kitchener, Ontario]], Canada, to German parents who had lived in [[Belgium]].<ref name=\"relnt1\">Stated in ''Relentless: A Memoir'', Julian Edelman, 2017, Hachette Books</ref>\n\nHe was the quarterback for [[Woodside High School (California)|Woodside High School]] in [[Woodside, California]], and as a senior, he led the Wildcats to a 13\u20130 record in 2004.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.maxpreps.com/high-schools/woodside-wildcats-(woodside,ca)/football-fall-04/schedule.htm |title=Schedule \u2013 Woodside Wildcats 2004 Football (CA) |website=www.maxpreps.com |access-date=December 11, 2018}}</ref> During his high school career, Edelman had 2,237 yards and 29 touchdowns passing, in addition to 964 yards and 13 [[touchdown]]s rushing.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Yang |first=Nicole |url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/10/24/5-things-we-learned-from-julian-edelmans-new-memoir-relentless |title=5 things we learned from Julian Edelman's new memoir 'Relentless' |date=October 24, 2017 |work=Boston.com |access-date=December 25, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n==College career==\nAfter high school, Edelman spent a year attending the [[College of San Mateo]].
