For instance the [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]] word ''clhp\u2019xwlhtlhplhhskwts\u2019'' ({{IPA-sal|x\u026cp\u02bc\u03c7\u02b7\u026ct\u02b0\u026cp\u02b0\u026c\u02d0sk\u02b7\u02b0t\u0361s\u02bc|IPA}}), meaning \"he had had [in his possession] a [[Cornus canadensis|bunchberry]] plant\", has thirteen [[obstruent]] consonants in a row with no phonetic or phonemic vowels. The Salishan languages are a geographically continuous block, with the exception of the Nuxalk (Bella Coola), in the [[British Columbia Coast|Central Coast of British Columbia]], and the extinct [[Tillamook language]], to the south on the central coast of Oregon.\n\nThe terms ''Salish'' and ''Salishan'' are used interchangeably by [[linguists]] and [[anthropologists]] studying Salishan, but this is confusing in regular English usage. The name ''Salish'' or ''Selisch'' is the [[endonym]] of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead Nation]]. Linguists later applied the name Salish to related languages in the Pacific Northwest. Many of the peoples do not have self-designations ([[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]]) in their languages; they frequently have specific names for local dialects, as the local group was more important culturally than larger tribal relations.\n\nAll Salishan languages are considered critically [[endangered language|endangered]], some extremely so, with only three or four speakers left. Those languages considered [[extinct language|extinct]] are often referred to as 'sleeping languages,' in that no speakers exist currently. In the early 21st century, few Salish languages have more than 2,000 speakers. Fluent, daily speakers of almost all Salishan languages are generally over sixty years of age; many languages have only speakers over eighty. Salishan languages are most commonly written using the [[Americanist phonetic notation]] to account for the various vowels and consonants that do not exist in most modern alphabets.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Many groups have evolved their own distinctive uses of the Latin alphabet, however, such as the [[St'at'imc]].\n\n== Family division ==\nThe Salishan language family consists of twenty-three languages. Below is a list of Salishan languages, dialects, and subdialects. The genetic unity among the Salish languages is evident. Neighboring groups have communicated often, to the point that it is difficult to untangle the influence each dialect and language has upon others.\n\nA 1969 study found that \"language relationships are highest and closest among the Interior Division, whereas they are most distant among the Coast Division.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| publisher = Indiana University\n| last = Jorgensen\n| first = Joseph G.\n| title = Salishan language and culture\n| location = Bloomington, IN\n| series = Language Science Monographs\n| date = 1969\n| page = 105\n| url = \n}}</ref>\n\nThis list is a linguistic classification that may not correspond to political divisions. In contrast to classifications made by linguistic scholars, many Salishan groups consider their particular variety of speech to be a separate language rather than a [[dialect]].\n[[File:Salishan.svg|thumb|Distribution of Salishan languages at the beginning of the 19th century]]\n\n=== ''Bella Coola'' ===\n: 1.

Additionally, the Lummi, Semiahmoo, Songhees, and Sooke dialects of Northern Straits are also extinct.\n\n== Genetic relations ==\nNo relationship to any other language family is well established.\n\n[[Edward Sapir]] suggested that the Salishan languages might be related to the [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]] and [[Chimakuan languages]] in a hypothetical [[Mosan languages|Mosan]] family. This proposal persists primarily through Sapir's stature: with little evidence for such a family, no progress has been made in reconstructing it.<ref>Beck (2000).</ref>\n\nThe Salishan languages, principally [[Chehalis language|Chehalis]], contributed greatly to the vocabulary of the [[Chinook Jargon]].\n\n== Family features ==\n\n* post-velar [[vowel harmony|harmony]] (more areal)\n* presence of syllables without vowels\n* grammatical [[reduplication]]\n* nonconcatenation ([[infix]]es, [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], [[glottalization]])\n* tenselessness\n* nounlessness (controversial)\n\n== Syntax ==\n\nSalishan languages are known for their polysynthetic nature. A verb stem will often have at least one [[affix]], which is typically a suffix. These suffixes perform a variety of functions, such as [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]], [[causative]], [[Reciprocal construction|reciprocal]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]], and [[Applicative voice|applicative]]. Applicative affixes seem to be present on the verb when the direct object is central to the event being discussed, but is not the theme of the sentence. The direct object may be a recipient, for example.\n\nIt may also refer to a related noun phrase, like the goal a verb intends to achieve, or the instrument used in carrying out the action of the verb. In the sentence \u2018The man used the axe to chop the log with.\u2019, the axe is the instrument and is indicated in Salish through an applicative affix on the verb. Applicative affixes increase the number of affixes a verb can take on, that is, its syntactic valence. They are also known as \"transitivizers\" because they can change a verb from intransitive to transitive. For example, in the sentence 'I got scared.', 'scared' is intransitive. However, with the addition of an applicative affix, which is syntactically transitive, the verb in Salish becomes transitive and the sentence can come to mean \u2018I got scared of you.\u2019.\n\nAlthough there is a wide array of Salish languages, they all share some basic traits. All are verb initial languages, with VSO (verb-subject-object) being the most common word order. Some Salishan languages allow for VOS and SVO as well. There is no case marking, but central noun phrases will often be preceded by determiners while non-central NPs will take prepositions. Some Salishan languages are ergative, and many take unique object agreement forms in passive statements. Subject and object pronouns usually take the form of affixes that attach to the verb. All Salish languages are head-marking. Possession is marked on the possessed noun phrase as either a prefix or a suffix, while person is marked on predicates. In Central Salish languages like Tillamook and Shuswap, only one plain NP is permitted aside from the subject.\n\nThere are three general patterns of negation among the Salishan languages. The most common pattern involves a negative predicate in the form of an impersonal and intransitive stative verb, which occurs in sentence initial position. The second pattern involves a sentence initial negative particle that is often attached to the sentence's subject, and the last pattern simply involves a sentence initial negative particle without any change in inflectional morphology or a determiner/complementizer. In addition, there is a fourth restricted pattern that has been noted only in Squamish.\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n== Nounlessness ==\nSalishan languages (along with the [[Wakashan]] and the extinct [[Chimakuan]] languages) exhibit predicate/argument flexibility. All content words are able to occur as the head of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (including words with typically 'noun-like' meanings that refer to entities) or in an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] (including those with 'verb-like' meanings that refer to events). Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as [[Lushootseed]] '''''sbiaw''''' which means '(is a) coyote'. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed '''''\u0294ux\u030c\u02b7''''' means '(one that) goes'.\n\nThe following examples are from [[Lushootseed]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This has become controversial in recent years. David Beck of the University of Alberta contends that there is evidence for distinct lexical categories of 'noun' and 'verb' by arguing that, although any distinction is neutralised in predicative positions, words that can be categorised as 'verbs' are marked when used in syntactic argument positions. He argues that Salishan languages are omnipredicative, but only have 'uni-directional flexibility' (not 'bi-directional flexibility'), which makes Salishan languages no different from other omnipredicative languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Nahuatl]], which have a clear lexical noun-verb distinction.\n\nBeck does concede, however, that the Lushootseed argument ''ti \u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' ('the one who goes', shown in example sentence (1b) above) does represent an example of an unmarked 'verb' used as an argument and that further research may potentially substantiate [[Dale Kinkade|M. Dale Kinkade]]'s 1983 position that all Salishan content words are essentially 'verbs' (such as ''\u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' 'goes' and ''sbiaw'' 'is a coyote') and that the use of any content word as an argument involves an underlying relative clause. For example, with the determiner ''ti'' translated as 'that which', the arguments ''ti \u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' and ''ti sbiaw'' would be most literally translated as 'that which goes' and 'that which is a coyote' respectively.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Beck\n| first = David\n| title = Unidirectional flexibility and the noun-verb distinction in Lushootseed\n| accessdate = 2013-11-20\n| url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~dbeck/FlexDist.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Cable\n| first = Seth\n| title = Lexical Categories in the Salish and Wakashan Languages\n| accessdate = 2013-11-20\n| url = http://people.umass.edu/scable/PNWSeminar/handouts/Lex/Lexical-Categories.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kinkade\n| first = M.

They occupy the [[Pacific Northwest]], with all but two of them being concentrated together in a single large area. It is clear that these languages are related, but it's difficult to track the development of each because their histories are so interwoven. The different speech communities have interacted a great deal, making it nearly impossible to decipher the influences of varying dialects and languages on one another. However, there are several trends and patterns that can be historically traced to generalize the development of the Salishan languages over the years.\n\nThe variation between the Salishan languages seems to depend on two main factors: the distance between speech communities and the geographic barriers between them. The diversity between the languages corresponds directly to the distance between them. Closer proximity often entails more contact between speakers, and more linguistics similarities are the result. Geographic barriers like mountains impede contact, so two communities that are relatively close together may still vary considerably in their language use if there is a mountain dividing them.\n\nThe rate of change between neighboring Salishan languages often depends on their environments. If for some reason two communities diverge, their adaptation to a new environment can separate them linguistically from each other. The need to create names for tools, animals, and plants creates an array of new vocabulary that divides speech communities. However, these new names may come from borrowing from neighboring languages, in which case two languages or dialects can grow more alike rather than apart. Interactions with outside influences through trade and intermarriage often result in language change as well.\n\nSome cultural elements are more resilient to language change, namely, religion and folklore. Salishan language communities that have demonstrated change in technology and environmental vocabulary have often remained more consistent with their religious terminology. Religion and heavily ingrained cultural traditions are often regarded as sacred, and so are less likely to undergo any sort of change. Indeed, cognate lists between various Salishan languages show more similarities in religious terminology than they do in technology and environment vocabulary.  Other categories with noticeable similarities include words for body parts, colors, and numbers. There would be little need to change such vocabulary, so it's more likely to remain the same despite other changes between languages. The Coast Salishan languages are less similar to each other than are the Interior Salishan languages, probably because the Coast communities have more access to outside influences.\n\nAnother example of language change in the Salishan language family is word taboo, which is a cultural expression of the belief in the power of words.  Among the Coast languages, [[Taboo against naming the dead|a person's name becomes a taboo word immediately following their death]]. This taboo is lifted when the name of the deceased is given to a new member of his/her lineage. In the meantime, the deceased person's name and words that are phonetically similar to the name are considered taboo and can only be expressed via descriptive phrases. In some cases these taboo words are permanently replaced by their chosen descriptive phrases, resulting in language change.\n\n==Pragmatics==\n{{Original research section|date=December 2018}}\n{{Confusing section|reason=This section is not rigorous|date=February 2017}}\nAt least one Salish language, Lillooet Salish, differs from Indo-European languages in terms of [[pragmatics]]. Lillooet Salish does not allow presuppositions about a hearer's beliefs or knowledge during a conversation.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Presuppositions and Cross-Linguistic Variation\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lmatthewson/pdf/presupposition.pdf\n| series = Proceedings of the North East Linguistics Society 36\n| location = Amherst, MA\n| date = 2006\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Determiner systems and quantificational strategies: evidence from Salish\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/6111\n| publisher = University of British Columbia\n| date = 1996\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Pronouns, Presuppositions, and Semantic Variation\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/13054\n| series = Proceedings of SALT XVIII\n| date = 2008\n}}</ref> To demonstrate, it's useful to compare Lillooet Salish determiners with English determiners. English determiners take the form of the articles \u2018a\u2019, \u2018an\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019. The indefinite articles \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018an\u2019 refer to an object that is unfamiliar or that has not been previously referenced in conversation.  The definite article \u2018the\u2019 refers to a familiar object about which both the speaker and the listener share a common understanding. Lillooet Salish and several other Salish languages use the same determiner to refer to both familiar and unfamiliar objects in conversation. For example, when discussing a woman, Lillooet Salish speakers used [\u026c\u0259s\u026c\u00e1nay] (with [\u026c\u0259] serving as the determiner and [s\u026c\u00e1nay] meaning \u2018woman\u2019) to refer to the woman both when initially introducing her and again when referencing her later on in the conversation. Thus, no distinction is made between a unique object and a familiar one.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThis absence of varying determiners is a manifestation of the lack of presuppositions about a listener in Salish.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Using a definite article would presuppose a mental state of the listener: familiarity with the object in question. Similarly, a Salishan language equivalent of the English sentence \"It was John who called\" would not require the assumption that the listener knows that someone called. In English, such a sentence implies that someone called and serves to clarify who the caller was. In Salish, the sentence would be void of any implication regarding the listener's knowledge. Rather, only the speaker's knowledge about previous events is expressed.\n\nThe absence of presuppositions extends even to elements that seem to inherently trigger some kind of implication, such as \u2018again\u2019, \u2018more\u2019, \u2018stop\u2019, and \u2018also\u2019. For example, in English, beginning a conversation with a sentence like \"It also rained yesterday\" would probably be met with confusion from the listener. The word \u2018also\u2019 signifies an addition to some previously discussed topic about which both the speaker and the listener are aware. However, in Salish, a statement like \"It also rained yesterday\" is not met with the same kind of bewilderment. The listener's prior knowledge (or lack thereof) is not conventionally regarded by either party in a conversation. Only the speaker's knowledge is relevant.\n\nThe use of pronouns illustrates the disregard for presuppositions as well. For example, a sentence like \"She walked there, and then Brenda left\" would be acceptable on its own in Lillooet Salish. The pronoun \u2018she\u2019 can refer to Brenda and be used without the introduction that would be necessary in English.{{Explanation needed|date=February 2017}} It is key to note that presuppositions do exist in Salishan languages; they simply don't have to be shared between the speaker and listener the way they do in English and other Indo-European languages. The above examples demonstrate that presuppositions are present, but the fact that the listener doesn't necessarily have to be aware of them signifies that the presuppositions only matter to the speaker. They are indicative of prior information that the speaker alone may be aware of, and his/her speech reflects merely his/her perspective on a situation without taking into account the listener's knowledge. Although English values{{Further explanation needed|date=February 2017}} a common ground between a listener and speaker and thus requires that some presuppositions about another person's knowledge be made, Salish does not share this pragmatic convention.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[Stanley Evans (author)|Stanley Evans]] has written a series of crime fiction novels that use Salish lore and language.\n\nAn episode of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (\"[[Stargate SG-1 (season 2)#ep35|Spirits]]\", 2x13) features a culture of extraterrestrial humans loosely inspired by Pacific coastal First Nations culture, and who speak a language referred to as \"ancient Salish\".\n\nIn the video game ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', the Salish lore was used on certain history of Arcadia Bay as totem poles are seen on some areas. Including a segment from the first episode of its [[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm|prequel]] involving the raven.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Beck, David. (2000).

For instance the [[Nuxalk language|Nuxalk]] word ''clhp\u2019xwlhtlhplhhskwts\u2019'' ({{IPA-sal|x\u026cp\u02bc\u03c7\u02b7\u026ct\u02b0\u026cp\u02b0\u026c\u02d0sk\u02b7\u02b0t\u0361s\u02bc|IPA}}), meaning \"he had had [in his possession] a [[Cornus canadensis|bunchberry]] plant\", has thirteen [[obstruent]] consonants in a row with no phonetic or phonemic vowels. The Salishan languages are a geographically continuous block, with the exception of the Nuxalk (Bella Coola), in the [[British Columbia Coast|Central Coast of British Columbia]], and the extinct [[Tillamook language]], to the south on the central coast of Oregon.\n\nThe terms ''Salish'' and ''Salishan'' are used interchangeably by [[linguists]] and [[anthropologists]] studying Salishan, but this is confusing in regular English usage. The name ''Salish'' or ''Selisch'' is the [[endonym]] of the [[Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Nation|Flathead Nation]]. Linguists later applied the name Salish to related languages in the Pacific Northwest. Many of the peoples do not have self-designations ([[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]]) in their languages; they frequently have specific names for local dialects, as the local group was more important culturally than larger tribal relations.\n\nAll Salishan languages are considered critically [[endangered language|endangered]], some extremely so, with only three or four speakers left. Those languages considered [[extinct language|extinct]] are often referred to as 'sleeping languages,' in that no speakers exist currently. In the early 21st century, few Salish languages have more than 2,000 speakers. Fluent, daily speakers of almost all Salishan languages are generally over sixty years of age; many languages have only speakers over eighty. Salishan languages are most commonly written using the [[Americanist phonetic notation]] to account for the various vowels and consonants that do not exist in most modern alphabets.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}  Many groups have evolved their own distinctive uses of the Latin alphabet, however, such as the [[St'at'imc]].\n\n== Family division ==\nThe Salishan language family consists of twenty-three languages. Below is a list of Salishan languages, dialects, and subdialects. The genetic unity among the Salish languages is evident. Neighboring groups have communicated often, to the point that it is difficult to untangle the influence each dialect and language has upon others.\n\nA 1969 study found that \"language relationships are highest and closest among the Interior Division, whereas they are most distant among the Coast Division.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| publisher = Indiana University\n| last = Jorgensen\n| first = Joseph G.\n| title = Salishan language and culture\n| location = Bloomington, IN\n| series = Language Science Monographs\n| date = 1969\n| page = 105\n| url = \n}}</ref>\n\nThis list is a linguistic classification that may not correspond to political divisions. In contrast to classifications made by linguistic scholars, many Salishan groups consider their particular variety of speech to be a separate language rather than a [[dialect]].\n[[File:Salishan.svg|thumb|Distribution of Salishan languages at the beginning of the 19th century]]\n\n=== ''Bella Coola'' ===\n: 1.

Additionally, the Lummi, Semiahmoo, Songhees, and Sooke dialects of Northern Straits are also extinct.\n\n== Genetic relations ==\nNo relationship to any other language family is well established.\n\n[[Edward Sapir]] suggested that the Salishan languages might be related to the [[Wakashan languages|Wakashan]] and [[Chimakuan languages]] in a hypothetical [[Mosan languages|Mosan]] family. This proposal persists primarily through Sapir's stature: with little evidence for such a family, no progress has been made in reconstructing it.<ref>Beck (2000).</ref>\n\nThe Salishan languages, principally [[Chehalis language|Chehalis]], contributed greatly to the vocabulary of the [[Chinook Jargon]].\n\n== Family features ==\n\n* post-velar [[vowel harmony|harmony]] (more areal)\n* presence of syllables without vowels\n* grammatical [[reduplication]]\n* nonconcatenation ([[infix]]es, [[Metathesis (linguistics)|metathesis]], [[glottalization]])\n* tenselessness\n* nounlessness (controversial)\n\n== Syntax ==\n\nSalishan languages are known for their polysynthetic nature. A verb stem will often have at least one [[affix]], which is typically a suffix. These suffixes perform a variety of functions, such as [[Transitivity (grammar)|transitive]], [[causative]], [[Reciprocal construction|reciprocal]], [[Reflexive verb|reflexive]], and [[Applicative voice|applicative]]. Applicative affixes seem to be present on the verb when the direct object is central to the event being discussed, but isn't the theme of the sentence. The direct object may be a recipient, for example.\n\nIt may also refer to a related noun phrase, like the goal a verb intends to achieve, or the instrument used in carrying out the action of the verb. In the sentence \u2018The man used the axe to chop the log with.\u2019, the axe is the instrument and is indicated in Salish through an applicative affix on the verb. Applicative affixes increase the number of affixes a verb can take on, that is, its syntactic valence. They are also known as \"transitivizers\" because they can change a verb from intransitive to transitive. For example, in the sentence 'I got scared.', 'scared' is intransitive. However, with the addition of an applicative affix, which is syntactically transitive, the verb in Salish becomes transitive and the sentence can come to mean \u2018I got scared of you.\u2019.\n\nAlthough there is a wide array of Salish languages, they all share some basic traits. All are verb initial languages, with VSO (verb-subject-object) being the most common word order. Some Salishan languages allow for VOS and SVO as well. There is no case marking, but central noun phrases will often be preceded by determiners while non-central NPs will take prepositions. Some Salishan languages are ergative, and many take unique object agreement forms in passive statements. Subject and object pronouns usually take the form of affixes that attach to the verb. All Salish languages are head-marking. Possession is marked on the possessed noun phrase as either a prefix or a suffix, while person is marked on predicates. In Central Salish languages like Tillamook and Shuswap, only one plain NP is permitted aside from the subject.\n\nThere are three general patterns of negation among the Salishan languages. The most common pattern involves a negative predicate in the form of an impersonal and intransitive stative verb, which occurs in sentence initial position. The second pattern involves a sentence initial negative particle that is often attached to the sentence's subject, and the last pattern simply involves a sentence initial negative particle without any change in inflectional morphology or a determiner/complementizer. In addition, there is a fourth restricted pattern that has been noted only in Squamish.\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\n== Nounlessness ==\nSalishan languages (along with the [[Wakashan]] and the extinct [[Chimakuan]] languages) exhibit predicate/argument flexibility. All content words are able to occur as the head of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] (including words with typically 'noun-like' meanings that refer to entities) or in an [[argument (linguistics)|argument]] (including those with 'verb-like' meanings that refer to events). Words with noun-like meanings are automatically equivalent to [be + NOUN] when used predicatively, such as [[Lushootseed]] '''''sbiaw''''' which means '(is a) coyote'. Words with more verb-like meanings, when used as arguments, are equivalent to [one that VERBs] or [VERB+er]. For example, Lushootseed '''''\u0294ux\u030c\u02b7''''' means '(one that) goes'.\n\nThe following examples are from [[Lushootseed]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This has become controversial in recent years. David Beck of the University of Alberta contends that there is evidence for distinct lexical categories of 'noun' and 'verb' by arguing that, although any distinction is neutralised in predicative positions, words that can be categorised as 'verbs' are marked when used in syntactic argument positions. He argues that Salishan languages are omnipredicative, but only have 'uni-directional flexibility' (not 'bi-directional flexibility'), which makes Salishan languages no different from other omnipredicative languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Nahuatl]], which have a clear lexical noun-verb distinction.\n\nBeck does concede, however, that the Lushootseed argument ''ti \u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' ('the one who goes', shown in example sentence (1b) above) does represent an example of an unmarked 'verb' used as an argument and that further research may potentially substantiate [[Dale Kinkade|M. Dale Kinkade]]'s 1983 position that all Salishan content words are essentially 'verbs' (such as ''\u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' 'goes' and ''sbiaw'' 'is a coyote') and that the use of any content word as an argument involves an underlying relative clause. For example, with the determiner ''ti'' translated as 'that which', the arguments ''ti \u0294ux\u030c\u02b7'' and ''ti sbiaw'' would be most literally translated as 'that which goes' and 'that which is a coyote' respectively.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Beck\n| first = David\n| title = Unidirectional flexibility and the noun-verb distinction in Lushootseed\n| accessdate = 2013-11-20\n| url = https://www.ualberta.ca/~dbeck/FlexDist.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Cable\n| first = Seth\n| title = Lexical Categories in the Salish and Wakashan Languages\n| accessdate = 2013-11-20\n| url = http://people.umass.edu/scable/PNWSeminar/handouts/Lex/Lexical-Categories.pdf\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Kinkade\n| first = M.

They occupy the [[Pacific Northwest]], with all but two of them being concentrated together in a single large area. It is clear that these languages are related, but it's difficult to track the development of each because their histories are so interwoven. The different speech communities have interacted a great deal, making it nearly impossible to decipher the influences of varying dialects and languages on one another. However, there are several trends and patterns that can be historically traced to generalize the development of the Salishan languages over the years.\n\nThe variation between the Salishan languages seems to depend on two main factors: the distance between speech communities and the geographic barriers between them. The diversity between the languages corresponds directly to the distance between them. Closer proximity often entails more contact between speakers, and more linguistics similarities are the result. Geographic barriers like mountains impede contact, so two communities that are relatively close together may still vary considerably in their language use if there is a mountain dividing them.\n\nThe rate of change between neighboring Salishan languages often depends on their environments. If for some reason two communities diverge, their adaptation to a new environment can separate them linguistically from each other. The need to create names for tools, animals, and plants creates an array of new vocabulary that divides speech communities. However, these new names may come from borrowing from neighboring languages, in which case two languages or dialects can grow more alike rather than apart. Interactions with outside influences through trade and intermarriage often result in language change as well.\n\nSome cultural elements are more resilient to language change, namely, religion and folklore. Salishan language communities that have demonstrated change in technology and environmental vocabulary have often remained more consistent with their religious terminology. Religion and heavily ingrained cultural traditions are often regarded as sacred, and so are less likely to undergo any sort of change. Indeed, cognate lists between various Salishan languages show more similarities in religious terminology than they do in technology and environment vocabulary.  Other categories with noticeable similarities include words for body parts, colors, and numbers. There would be little need to change such vocabulary, so it's more likely to remain the same despite other changes between languages. The Coast Salishan languages are less similar to each other than are the Interior Salishan languages, probably because the Coast communities have more access to outside influences.\n\nAnother example of language change in the Salishan language family is word taboo, which is a cultural expression of the belief in the power of words.  Among the Coast languages, [[Taboo against naming the dead|a person's name becomes a taboo word immediately following their death]]. This taboo is lifted when the name of the deceased is given to a new member of his/her lineage. In the meantime, the deceased person's name and words that are phonetically similar to the name are considered taboo and can only be expressed via descriptive phrases. In some cases these taboo words are permanently replaced by their chosen descriptive phrases, resulting in language change.\n\n==Pragmatics==\n{{Original research section|date=December 2018}}\n{{Confusing section|reason=This section is not rigorous|date=February 2017}}\nAt least one Salish language, Lillooet Salish, differs from Indo-European languages in terms of [[pragmatics]]. Lillooet Salish does not allow presuppositions about a hearer's beliefs or knowledge during a conversation.<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Presuppositions and Cross-Linguistic Variation\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/lmatthewson/pdf/presupposition.pdf\n| series = Proceedings of the North East Linguistics Society 36\n| location = Amherst, MA\n| date = 2006\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Determiner systems and quantificational strategies: evidence from Salish\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = https://circle.ubc.ca/handle/2429/6111\n| publisher = University of British Columbia\n| date = 1996\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite book\n| last = Matthewson\n| first = Lisa\n| title = Pronouns, Presuppositions, and Semantic Variation\n| accessdate = 2015-10-18\n| url = https://ecommons.cornell.edu/handle/1813/13054\n| series = Proceedings of SALT XVIII\n| date = 2008\n}}</ref> To demonstrate, it's useful to compare Lillooet Salish determiners with English determiners. English determiners take the form of the articles \u2018a\u2019, \u2018an\u2019 and \u2018the\u2019. The indefinite articles \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018an\u2019 refer to an object that is unfamiliar or that has not been previously referenced in conversation.  The definite article \u2018the\u2019 refers to a familiar object about which both the speaker and the listener share a common understanding. Lillooet Salish and several other Salish languages use the same determiner to refer to both familiar and unfamiliar objects in conversation. For example, when discussing a woman, Lillooet Salish speakers used [\u026c\u0259s\u026c\u00e1nay] (with [\u026c\u0259] serving as the determiner and [s\u026c\u00e1nay] meaning \u2018woman\u2019) to refer to the woman both when initially introducing her and again when referencing her later on in the conversation. Thus, no distinction is made between a unique object and a familiar one.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nThis absence of varying determiners is a manifestation of the lack of presuppositions about a listener in Salish.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Using a definite article would presuppose a mental state of the listener: familiarity with the object in question. Similarly, a Salishan language equivalent of the English sentence \"It was John who called\" would not require the assumption that the listener knows that someone called. In English, such a sentence implies that someone called and serves to clarify who the caller was. In Salish, the sentence would be void of any implication regarding the listener's knowledge. Rather, only the speaker's knowledge about previous events is expressed.\n\nThe absence of presuppositions extends even to elements that seem to inherently trigger some kind of implication, such as \u2018again\u2019, \u2018more\u2019, \u2018stop\u2019, and \u2018also\u2019. For example, in English, beginning a conversation with a sentence like \"It also rained yesterday\" would probably be met with confusion from the listener. The word \u2018also\u2019 signifies an addition to some previously discussed topic about which both the speaker and the listener are aware. However, in Salish, a statement like \"It also rained yesterday\" is not met with the same kind of bewilderment. The listener's prior knowledge (or lack thereof) is not conventionally regarded by either party in a conversation. Only the speaker's knowledge is relevant.\n\nThe use of pronouns illustrates the disregard for presuppositions as well. For example, a sentence like \"She walked there, and then Brenda left\" would be acceptable on its own in Lillooet Salish. The pronoun \u2018she\u2019 can refer to Brenda and be used without the introduction that would be necessary in English.{{Explanation needed|date=February 2017}} It is key to note that presuppositions do exist in Salishan languages; they simply don't have to be shared between the speaker and listener the way they do in English and other Indo-European languages. The above examples demonstrate that presuppositions are present, but the fact that the listener doesn't necessarily have to be aware of them signifies that the presuppositions only matter to the speaker. They are indicative of prior information that the speaker alone may be aware of, and his/her speech reflects merely his/her perspective on a situation without taking into account the listener's knowledge. Although English values{{Further explanation needed|date=February 2017}} a common ground between a listener and speaker and thus requires that some presuppositions about another person's knowledge be made, Salish does not share this pragmatic convention.\n\n== In popular culture ==\n[[Stanley Evans (author)|Stanley Evans]] has written a series of crime fiction novels that use Salish lore and language.\n\nAn episode of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' (\"[[Stargate SG-1 (season 2)#ep35|Spirits]]\", 2x13) features a culture of extraterrestrial humans loosely inspired by Pacific coastal First Nations culture, and who speak a language referred to as \"ancient Salish\".\n\nIn the video game ''[[Life Is Strange]]'', the Salish lore was used on certain history of Arcadia Bay as totem poles are seen on some areas. Including a segment from the first episode of its [[Life Is Strange: Before the Storm|prequel]] involving the raven.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*Beck, David. (2000).

His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films.\nHis literary works are usually within the [[science fiction]], [[techno-thriller]], and [[medical fiction]] genres, and heavily feature technology. His novels often explore that technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with [[biotechnology]]. Many of his novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and scientific background. He wrote, among other works, ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' (1969), ''[[The Great Train Robbery (novel)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1975), ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'' (1980), ''[[Sphere (novel)|Sphere]]'' (1987), ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1990), ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'' (1992), ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1995), ''[[Airframe (novel)|Airframe]]'' (1996), ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'' (1999), ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'' (2002), ''[[State of Fear]]'' (2004), and ''[[Next (novel)|Next]]'' (2006).

Doubleday passed it on to New American Library, which published it in 1966. Crichton used the pen name John Lange because he planned to become a doctor and did not want his patients to worry he would use them for his plots. The name came from a fairy tale writer called [[Andrew Lang]]. Crichton added an \"e\" to the surname and substituted his own real first name, John, for Andrew.<ref name=\"israel\" /> The novel was successful enough to lead to a series of John Lange novels.<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite news| title= The versatile Crichton\n| author =Seligson, Marcia|work=  Chicago Tribune |date=8 June 1969| page= k6}} </ref> (Film rights were sold in 1969, but no movie resulted.<ref>{{cite news| title= No Gap Like the Generation Gap\n| author=Weiler, A.

Carr is sent to [[Nice, France]], where he has notable political connections, but is mistaken for an assassin and finds his life in jeopardy. Crichton wrote the book while traveling through Europe on a travel fellowship. He visited the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and then decided, \"any idiot should be able to write a [[potboiler]] set in Cannes and Monaco\", and wrote it in eleven days. He later described the book as \"no good\".<ref name=\"israel\" />\n\nHis third John Lange novel, ''[[Easy Go]]'' (1968), is the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant [[Egyptologist]] who discovers a concealed message while translating [[hieroglyphics]] informing him of an unnamed pharaoh whose tomb is yet to be discovered.  Crichton later said the book earned him $1,500.<ref>{{cite news| title=Author of 'Terminal Man' Building Nonterminal Career: CRICHTON|author=\nGELMIS, JOSEPH|  work=Los Angeles Times | date=4 Jan 1974|page= d12}}</ref>\n\nCrichton later said, \"My feeling about the Lange books is that my competition is in-flight movies.

The novel had a different tone to the Lange books; accordingly, Crichton used the pen name \"Jeffrey Hudson\", based on Sir [[Jeffrey Hudson]], a 17th-century dwarf in the court of [[Queen consort]] [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] of England. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php |title=Edgar Awards throughout time |publisher=TheEdgars.com |accessdate=2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\nThe novel would prove a turning point in Crichton's future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice.

''[[The Venom Business]]'' (1969) relates the story of a smuggler who uses his exceptional skill as a snake handler to his advantage by importing snakes to be used by drug companies and universities for medical research. The snakes are simply a ruse to hide the presence of rare Mexican artifacts. \n\nIn 1969, Crichton also wrote a review for ''[[The New Republic]]'' (as J.

The novel documented the efforts of a team of scientists investigating a deadly [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[microorganism]] that fatally clots human blood, causing death within two minutes. \n\nCrichton was inspired to write it after reading ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' by [[Len Deighton]] while studying in England.

In 1970, he published ''[[Five Patients]]'', a book which recounts his experiences of hospital practices in the late 1960s at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston, Massachusetts. <ref name=\"scalpel\"/><ref>For Michael Crichton, Medicine Is for Writing\nBy JOHN NOBLE WILFORD.

The book relates the experiences of Ralph Orlando, a construction worker seriously injured in a scaffold collapse; John O'Connor, a middle-aged dispatcher suffering from fever that has reduced him to a delirious wreck; Peter Luchesi, a young man who severs his hand in an accident; Sylvia Thompson, an airline passenger who suffers chest pains; and Edith Murphy, a mother of three who is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. \n\nIn ''Five Patients'', Crichton examines a brief history of medicine up to 1969 to help place hospital culture and practice into context, and addresses the costs and politics of American healthcare.\n\n===''Jasper Johns''===\nAs a personal friend of the artist [[Jasper Johns]], Crichton compiled many of his works in a [[coffee table book]], published as ''[[Jasper Johns (book)|Jasper Johns]]''.

Believed to be psychotic, he is investigated and electrodes are implanted in his brain.

''Eaters of the Dead'' is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript and was inspired by two sources. The first three chapters retell [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s personal account of his journey north and his experiences in encountering the [[Rus' people|Rus']], the early Ukrainian peoples, whilst the remainder is based upon the story of [[Beowulf]], culminating in battles with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a relict group of [[Neanderthals]].\n\n===''Coma'' and ''First Great Train Robbery''===\nCrichton wrote and directed the suspense film ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'' (1978), adapted from the 1977 novel of the same name by [[Robin Cook (novelist)|Robin Cook]], a friend of his. There are other similarities in terms of [[genre]] and the fact that both Cook and Crichton had medical degrees, were of similar age, and wrote about similar subjects. The film was a popular success.\n\nCrichton then wrote and directed an adaptation of his own book, ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]'' (1978) starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The film would go on to be nominated for Best Cinematography Award by the [[British Society of Cinematographers]], also garnering an [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] for Best Motion Picture by the Mystery Writers Association of America.\n\nIn 1979 it was announced that Crichton would direct a movie version of his novel ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' for the newly formed [[Orion Pictures]].<ref>Orion: A Humanistic Production Kilday, Gregg.

He had never worked that way before, usually writing the book then selling it.

His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he \"didn't know where to go with it\" and put off completing the book until a later date.

The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the [[Sphere (1998 film)|1998 film]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].\n\nIn 1987 Crichton was still hoping to make a film of ''Congo'' with Connery and Crichton himself directing, but this production did not work out.<ref>An author of pleasurable fear: Michael Crichton takes fiction where you wouldn't want to go Gorner, Peter.

The book, written like a glossary, with entries such as \"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\", \"Buying a Computer\", and \"Computer Crime\", was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with the hardship of using them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; \"In my experience, you assert control over a computer\u2014show it who's the boss\u2014by making it do something unique. That means programming it. ... If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel better about it ever afterwards\".<ref>Crichton, Michael.

He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as \"the [[hula hoop]]s of the '80s\", and saying \"already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.\" In a section of the book called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative [[Applesoft BASIC|Applesoft]] (for [[Apple II]]) and [[Microsoft BASICA|BASICA]] (for [[IBM PC]] compatibles) programs.\n\nCrichton started a company selling a computer program he had originally written to help him create budgets for his movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.com/programmer/|title=Programmer|publisher=michaelcrichton.com}}</ref>\n\n'''''<big>Travels</big>'''''\n\nA book of autobiographical writings, ''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]'' was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1988, Crichton was a visiting writer at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"WEBSITEBIO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.net/aboutmichaelcrichton-biography.html|title=Biography|website=MichaelCrichton.net}}</ref>\n===''Jurassic Park''===\n[[File:Jurassic Park for kids in Kletno PL.jpg|thumb|right|Crichton's novel ''Jurassic Park'', and its sequels, were made into films that became a major part of popular culture, with related parks established in places as far afield as [[Kletno]], Poland.]]\n\nIn 1990, Crichton published the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''. Crichton utilized the presentation of \"[[False document|fiction as fact]]\", used in his previous novels, ''Eaters of the Dead'' and ''The Andromeda Strain''.

The book was adapted into the [[Rising Sun (film)|1993 film]] directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Wesley Snipes]], released the same year as the adaption of ''Jurassic Park''.\n===''Disclosure''===\nHis next novel, ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'', published in 1994, addresses the theme of sexual harassment previously explored in his 1972 ''Binary''. Unlike that novel however, Crichton centers on sexual politics in the workplace, emphasizing an array of paradoxes in traditional gender functions by featuring a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive. As a result, the book has been criticized harshly by feminist commentators and accused of anti-feminism. Crichton, anticipating this response, offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \"role-reversal\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be seen as easily with a female protagonist. The novel was made into a [[Disclosure (film)|film]] the same year, directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]].\n===''ER''===\nCrichton was the creator and an executive producer of the television drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' based on his 1974 pilot script ''24 Hours''.

In ''[[A Case of Need]]'', one of his pseudonymous [[whodunit]] stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend's name from medical malpractice in a girl's death from a hack-job abortion.\n\nCrichton has used the literary technique known as the [[false document]]. ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' is a \"recreation\" of the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic'' [[Beowulf]]'' presented as a scholarly translation of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th century manuscript. ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' and'' [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]] ''incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams, computer output, [[DNA sequence]]s, footnotes and bibliography. ''[[The Terminal Man]]'' and ''[[State of Fear]]'' include authentic published scientific works which illustrate the premise point.\n\nCrichton often employs the premise of diverse experts or specialists assembled to tackle a unique problem requiring their individual talents and knowledge. The premise was used for ''The Andromeda Strain'', ''Sphere'', ''Jurassic Park'', and to a lesser extent, ''Timeline''. Sometimes the individual characters in this dynamic work in the private sector and are suddenly called upon by the government to form an immediate response team once some incident or discovery triggers their mobilization. This premise or plot device has been imitated and used by other authors and screenwriters in several books, movies and television shows since.\n\nAt the prose level, a Crichton trademark is the single-word paragraph. A dramatic question is answered by a single word on its own.\n\n== Video games ==\n''[[Amazon (video game)|Amazon]]'' is a [[graphical adventure]] game created by Crichton and produced by John Wells. [[Trillium Corporation|Trillium]] released it in the United States in 1984, and the game runs on [[Apple II]], [[Atari]] 8-bit, Atari ST, [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]]. ''Amazon'' sold more than 100,000 copies, making it a significant commercial success at the time. It featured plot elements similar to those previously used in ''Congo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=48|title=Home of the Underdogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Crichton founded Timeline Computer Entertainment with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David Smith]]. Despite signing a multi-title publishing deal with [[Eidos Interactive]], only one game was ever published, ''[[Timeline (video game)|Timeline]]''. Released on November 10, 2000, for the PC, the game received negative reviews.\n\n== Works ==\n=== Prose ===\n====Novels====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !!

Crichton was on the ''for the motion'' side with [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[Philip Stott]] against [[Gavin Schmidt]], [[Richard Somerville]], and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the audience was largely on the 'against the motion' side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided).<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\">{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/559-global-warming-is-not-a-crisis |title=Global Warming Is Not a Crisis |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Intelligence Squared |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> At the end of the debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer 'for the motion' side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /> Schmidt later described the debate in a [[RealClimate]] blog posting, \"Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all.\" While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of [[IPCC]] reports, the audience was \"apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (not so sure about Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, we were pretty dull.\" Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/adventures-on-the-east-side/ |title=RealClimate: Adventures on the East Side |author=Gavin Schmidt |date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=RealClimate |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the debate, although he admitted that man must have at some point contributed to [[global warming]] but not necessarily caused it, Crichton argued that most of the media and attention of the general public are being dedicated to the uncertain anthropogenic global warming scares instead of the more urgent issues like poverty.

His books have sold over 200 million copies worldwide, and over a dozen have been adapted into films.\nHis literary works are usually within the [[science fiction]], [[techno-thriller]], and [[medical fiction]] genres, and heavily feature technology. His novels often explore that technology and failures of human interaction with it, especially resulting in catastrophes with [[biotechnology]]. Many of his novels have medical or scientific underpinnings, reflecting his medical training and scientific background. He wrote, among other works, ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' (1969), ''[[The Great Train Robbery (novel)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1975), ''[[Congo (novel)|Congo]]'' (1980), ''[[Sphere (novel)|Sphere]]'' (1987), ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1990), ''[[Rising Sun (novel)|Rising Sun]]'' (1992), ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'' (1994), ''[[The Lost World (Crichton novel)|The Lost World]]'' (1995), ''[[Airframe (novel)|Airframe]]'' (1996), ''[[Timeline (novel)|Timeline]]'' (1999), ''[[Prey (novel)|Prey]]'' (2002), ''[[State of Fear]]'' (2004), and ''[[Next (novel)|Next]]'' (2006).

The robbery is planned scientifically with the help of a [[Critical path method|critical path analysis]] computer program, but unforeseen events get in the way.\n\nCrichton submitted it to Doubleday, where a reader liked it but did not feel it was for the company. Doubleday passed it on to New American Library, which published it in 1966. Crichton used the pen name John Lange because he planned to become a doctor and did not want his patients to worry he would use them for his plots. The name came from a fairy tale writer called [[Andrew Lang]]. Crichton added an \"e\" to the surname and substituted his own real first name, John, for Andrew.<ref name=\"israel\" /> The novel was successful enough to lead to a series of John Lange novels.<ref name=\"chicago\">{{cite news| title= The versatile Crichton\n| author =Seligson, Marcia|work=  Chicago Tribune |date=8 June 1969| page= k6}} </ref> (Film rights were sold in 1969, but no movie resulted.<ref>{{cite news| title= No Gap Like the Generation Gap\n| author=Weiler, A.

Carr is sent to [[Nice, France]], where he has notable political connections, but is mistaken for an assassin and finds his life in jeopardy. Crichton wrote the book while traveling through Europe on a travel fellowship. He visited the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and [[Monaco Grand Prix]], and then decided, \"any idiot should be able to write a [[potboiler]] set in Cannes and Monaco\", and wrote it in eleven days. He later described the book as \"no good\".<ref name=\"israel\" />\n\nHis third John Lange novel, ''[[Easy Go]]'' (1968), is the story of Harold Barnaby, a brilliant [[Egyptologist]] who discovers a concealed message while translating [[hieroglyphics]] informing him of an unnamed pharaoh whose tomb is yet to be discovered.  Crichton later said the book earned him $1,500.<ref>{{cite news| title=Author of 'Terminal Man' Building Nonterminal Career: CRICHTON|author=\nGELMIS, JOSEPH|  work=Los Angeles Times | date=4 Jan 1974|page= d12}}</ref>\n\nCrichton later said, \"My feeling about the Lange books is that my competition is in-flight movies.

The novel had a different tone to the Lange books; accordingly, Crichton used the pen name \"Jeffrey Hudson\", based on Sir [[Jeffrey Hudson]], a 17th-century dwarf in the court of [[Queen consort]] [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]] of England. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theedgars.com/edgarsDB/index.php |title=Edgar Awards throughout time |publisher=TheEdgars.com |accessdate=2013-11-19}}</ref>\n\nThe novel would prove a turning point in Crichton's future novels, in which technology is important in the subject matter, although this novel was as much about medical practice.

''[[The Venom Business]]'' (1969) relates the story of a smuggler who uses his exceptional skill as a snake handler to his advantage by importing snakes to be used by drug companies and universities for medical research. The snakes are simply a ruse to hide the presence of rare Mexican artifacts. \n\nIn 1969, Crichton also wrote a review for ''[[The New Republic]]'' (as J.

The novel documented the efforts of a team of scientists investigating a deadly [[extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] [[microorganism]] that fatally clots human blood, causing death within two minutes. \n\nCrichton was inspired to write it after reading ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' by [[Len Deighton]] while studying in England.

In 1970, he published ''[[Five Patients]]'', a book which recounts his experiences of hospital practices in the late 1960s at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] in Boston, Massachusetts. <ref name=\"scalpel\"/><ref>For Michael Crichton, Medicine Is for Writing\nBy JOHN NOBLE WILFORD.

The book relates the experiences of Ralph Orlando, a construction worker seriously injured in a scaffold collapse; John O'Connor, a middle-aged dispatcher suffering from fever that has reduced him to a delirious wreck; Peter Luchesi, a young man who severs his hand in an accident; Sylvia Thompson, an airline passenger who suffers chest pains; and Edith Murphy, a mother of three who is diagnosed with a life-threatening disease. \n\nIn ''Five Patients'', Crichton examines a brief history of medicine up to 1969 to help place hospital culture and practice into context, and addresses the costs and politics of American healthcare.\n\n===''Jasper Johns''===\nAs a personal friend of the artist [[Jasper Johns]], Crichton compiled many of his works in a [[coffee table book]], published as ''[[Jasper Johns (book)|Jasper Johns]]''. It was originally published in 1970 by Harry N.

Believed to be psychotic, he is investigated and electrodes are implanted in his brain.  The book continued the preoccupation in Crichton's novels with machine-human interaction and technology.<ref>Hollywood Today: Mike Crichton, a Skyscraper in Any Form\nNorma Lee Browning.

A considerable portion of the book was set in London.\n\nCrichton had become aware of the story when lecturing at Cambridge University.

''Eaters of the Dead'' is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript and was inspired by two sources. The first three chapters retell [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s personal account of his journey north and his experiences in encountering the [[Rus' people|Rus']], the early Ukrainian peoples, whilst the remainder is based upon the story of [[Beowulf]], culminating in battles with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a relict group of [[Neanderthals]].\n\n===''Coma'' and ''First Great Train Robbery''===\nCrichton wrote and directed the suspense film ''[[Coma (1978 film)|Coma]]'' (1978), adapted from the 1977 novel of the same name by [[Robin Cook (novelist)|Robin Cook]], a friend of his. There are other similarities in terms of [[genre]] and the fact that both Cook and Crichton had medical degrees, were of similar age, and wrote about similar subjects. The film was a popular success.\n\nCrichton then wrote and directed an adaptation of his own book, ''[[The First Great Train Robbery]]'' (1978) starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. The film would go on to be nominated for Best Cinematography Award by the [[British Society of Cinematographers]], also garnering an [[Edgar Allan Poe Award]] for Best Motion Picture by the Mystery Writers Association of America.\n\nIn 1979 it was announced that Crichton would direct a movie version of his novel ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' for the newly formed [[Orion Pictures]].<ref>Orion: A Humanistic Production Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times 5 Jan 1979: f13.</ref> This did not occur.\n\n===''Congo'' and ''Looker''===\nCrichton pitched the idea of a modern day ''[[King Solomon's Mines]]'' to [[20th Century Fox]] who paid him $1.5 million for the film rights to the novel, a screenplay and directorial fee for the movie, before a word had been written.  He had never worked that way before, usually writing the book then selling it.

Eventually a film version was made in 1995 by another director.\n\nIn 1984 [[Telarium]] released a [[graphic adventure]] based on ''Congo''.

His initial storyline began with American scientists discovering a 300-year-old spaceship underwater with stenciled markings in English. However, Crichton later realized that he \"didn't know where to go with it\" and put off completing the book until a later date. The novel was published in 1987.<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Gorner |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1987-06-24/features/8702160834_1_alien-scientists-ship |title=An Author Of Pleasurable Fear - tribunedigital-chicagotribune |publisher=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1987-06-24 |accessdate=2015-10-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt relates the story of psychologist Norman Johnson, who is required by the U.S. Navy to join a team of scientists assembled by the U.S. Government to examine an enormous alien spacecraft discovered on the bed of the Pacific Ocean, and believed to have been there for over 300 years. The novel begins as a science fiction story, but rapidly changes into a psychological thriller, ultimately exploring the nature of the human imagination. The novel was adapted into the [[Sphere (1998 film)|1998 film]] directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Dustin Hoffman]].\n\nIn 1987 Crichton was still hoping to make a film of ''Congo'' with Connery and Crichton himself directing, but this production did not work out.<ref>An author of pleasurable fear: Michael Crichton takes fiction where you wouldn't want to go Gorner, Peter.

The book, written like a glossary, with entries such as \"Afraid of Computers (everybody is)\", \"Buying a Computer\", and \"Computer Crime\", was intended to introduce the idea of personal computers to a reader who might be faced with the hardship of using them at work or at home for the first time. It defined basic computer jargon and assured readers that they could master the machine when it inevitably arrived. In his words, being able to program a computer is liberation; \"In my experience, you assert control over a computer\u2014show it who's the boss\u2014by making it do something unique. That means programming it. ... If you devote a couple of hours to programming a new machine, you'll feel better about it ever afterwards\".<ref>Crichton, Michael. ''[[Electronic Life]]'', Knopf, 1983, p. 44. {{ISBN|0-394-53406-9}}</ref> \n\nIn the book, Crichton predicts a number of events in the history of computer development, that computer networks would increase in importance as a matter of convenience, including the sharing of information and pictures that we see online today which the telephone never could. He also makes predictions for computer games, dismissing them as \"the [[hula hoop]]s of the '80s\", and saying \"already there are indications that the mania for twitch games may be fading.\" In a section of the book called \"Microprocessors, or how I flunked biostatistics at Harvard\", Crichton again seeks his revenge on the teacher who had given him abnormally low grades in college. Within the book, Crichton included many self-written demonstrative [[Applesoft BASIC|Applesoft]] (for [[Apple II]]) and [[Microsoft BASICA|BASICA]] (for [[IBM PC]] compatibles) programs.\n\nCrichton started a company selling a computer program he had originally written to help him create budgets for his movies.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.com/programmer/|title=Programmer|publisher=michaelcrichton.com}}</ref>\n\n'''''<big>Travels</big>'''''\n\nA book of autobiographical writings, ''[[Travels (book)|Travels]]'' was published in 1988.\n\nIn 1988, Crichton was a visiting writer at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"WEBSITEBIO\">{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelcrichton.net/aboutmichaelcrichton-biography.html|title=Biography|website=MichaelCrichton.net}}</ref>\n===''Jurassic Park''===\n[[File:Jurassic Park for kids in Kletno PL.jpg|thumb|right|Crichton's novel ''Jurassic Park'', and its sequels, were made into films that became a major part of popular culture, with related parks established in places as far afield as [[Kletno]], Poland.]]\n\nIn 1990, Crichton published the novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]''. Crichton utilized the presentation of \"[[False document|fiction as fact]]\", used in his previous novels, ''Eaters of the Dead'' and ''The Andromeda Strain''. In addition, [[chaos theory]] and its philosophical implications are used to explain the collapse of an amusement park in a \"biological preserve\" on [[Isla Nublar]], a fictional island to the west of Costa Rica.

They have been recreated using damaged dinosaur [[DNA]], found in mosquitoes that had sucked their blood and then became trapped and preserved in amber.\n\nCrichton originally had conceived a screenplay about a graduate student who recreates a dinosaur, but decided to put off exploring his fascination with dinosaurs and cloning until he began writing the novel.<ref>{{cite video |people=Michael Crichton |title=Michael Crichton on the Jurassic Park Phenomenon |medium=DVD |publisher=Universal |year=2001}}</ref> \n\n[[Steven Spielberg]] learned of the novel in October 1989 while he and Crichton were discussing a screenplay that would become the television series ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]''.

The book was adapted into the [[Rising Sun (film)|1993 film]] directed by [[Philip Kaufman]] and starring [[Sean Connery]] and [[Wesley Snipes]], released the same year as the adaption of ''Jurassic Park''.\n===''Disclosure''===\nHis next novel, ''[[Disclosure (novel)|Disclosure]]'', published in 1994, addresses the theme of sexual harassment previously explored in his 1972 ''Binary''. Unlike that novel however, Crichton centers on sexual politics in the workplace, emphasizing an array of paradoxes in traditional gender functions by featuring a male protagonist who is being sexually harassed by a female executive. As a result, the book has been criticized harshly by feminist commentators and accused of anti-feminism. Crichton, anticipating this response, offered a rebuttal at the close of the novel which states that a \"role-reversal\" story uncovers aspects of the subject that would not be seen as easily with a female protagonist. The novel was made into a [[Disclosure (film)|film]] the same year, directed by [[Barry Levinson]] and starring [[Michael Douglas]] and [[Demi Moore]].\n===''ER''===\nCrichton was the creator and an executive producer of the television drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' based on his 1974 pilot script ''24 Hours''.

In ''[[A Case of Need]]'', one of his pseudonymous [[whodunit]] stories, Crichton used first-person narrative to portray the hero, a Bostonian pathologist, who is running against the clock to clear a friend's name from medical malpractice in a girl's death from a hack-job abortion.\n\nCrichton has used the literary technique known as the [[false document]]. ''[[Eaters of the Dead]]'' is a \"recreation\" of the [[Old English language|Old English]] epic'' [[Beowulf]]'' presented as a scholarly translation of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s 10th century manuscript. ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'' and'' [[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]] ''incorporate fictionalized scientific documents in the form of diagrams, computer output, [[DNA sequence]]s, footnotes and bibliography. ''[[The Terminal Man]]'' and ''[[State of Fear]]'' include authentic published scientific works which illustrate the premise point.\n\nCrichton often employs the premise of diverse experts or specialists assembled to tackle a unique problem requiring their individual talents and knowledge. The premise was used for ''The Andromeda Strain'', ''Sphere'', ''Jurassic Park'', and to a lesser extent, ''Timeline''. Sometimes the individual characters in this dynamic work in the private sector and are suddenly called upon by the government to form an immediate response team once some incident or discovery triggers their mobilization. This premise or plot device has been imitated and used by other authors and screenwriters in several books, movies and television shows since.\n\nAt the prose level, a Crichton trademark is the single-word paragraph. A dramatic question is answered by a single word on its own.\n\n== Video games ==\n''[[Amazon (video game)|Amazon]]'' is a [[graphical adventure]] game created by Crichton and produced by John Wells. [[Trillium Corporation|Trillium]] released it in the United States in 1984, and the game runs on [[Apple II]], [[Atari]] 8-bit, Atari ST, [[Commodore 64]], and [[DOS]]. ''Amazon'' sold more than 100,000 copies, making it a significant commercial success at the time. It featured plot elements similar to those previously used in ''Congo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://homeoftheunderdogs.net/game.php?id=48|title=Home of the Underdogs}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Crichton founded Timeline Computer Entertainment with [[David A. Smith (computer scientist)|David Smith]]. Despite signing a multi-title publishing deal with [[Eidos Interactive]], only one game was ever published, ''[[Timeline (video game)|Timeline]]''. Released on November 10, 2000, for the PC, the game received negative reviews.\n\n== Works ==\n=== Prose ===\n====Novels====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! Year !! Title !!

Crichton was on the ''for the motion'' side with [[Richard Lindzen]] and [[Philip Stott]] against [[Gavin Schmidt]], [[Richard Somerville]], and Brenda Ekwurzel. Before the debate, the audience was largely on the 'against the motion' side (57% vs. 30%, with 13% undecided).<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\">{{cite web |url=http://intelligencesquaredus.org/debates/past-debates/item/559-global-warming-is-not-a-crisis |title=Global Warming Is Not a Crisis |date=March 14, 2007 |publisher=Intelligence Squared |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> At the end of the debate, there was a notable shift in the audience vote to prefer 'for the motion' side (46% vs. 42%, with 12% undecided), leaving the debate with the conclusion that Crichton's group won.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /> Schmidt later described the debate in a [[RealClimate]] blog posting, \"Crichton went with the crowd-pleasing condemnation of private jet-flying liberals (very popular, even among the private jet-flying Eastsiders present) and the apparent hypocrisy of people who think that global warming is a problem using any energy at all.\" While those against the motion had presented the agreed scientific consensus of [[IPCC]] reports, the audience was \"apparently more convinced by the entertaining narratives from Crichton and Stott (not so sure about Lindzen) than they were by our drier fare. Entertainment-wise it's hard to blame them. Crichton is extremely polished and Stott has a touch of the revivalist preacher about him. Comparatively, we were pretty dull.\" Even though Crichton inspired a lot of blog responses and it was considered one of his best rhetorical performances, reception to his message was mixed.<ref name=\"IntelligenceSquared\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/03/adventures-on-the-east-side/ |title=RealClimate: Adventures on the East Side |author=Gavin Schmidt |date=March 15, 2007 |publisher=RealClimate |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn the debate, although he admitted that man must have at some point contributed to [[global warming]] but not necessarily caused it, Crichton argued that most of the media and attention of the general public are being dedicated to the uncertain anthropogenic global warming scares instead of the more urgent issues like poverty.

The \"smoke\" that exits the gas washing bottle is, in fact, a sulfuric acid fog generated in a reaction.]]\n\n===Combustion routes===\nSulfur dioxide is the product of the burning of [[sulfur]] or of burning materials that contain sulfur:\n\n: S + O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SO<sub>2</sub>, \u0394H = \u2212297 kJ/mol\n\nTo aid combustion, liquefied sulfur (140\u2013150&nbsp;\u00b0C, 284-302&nbsp;\u00b0F) is sprayed through an atomizing nozzle to generate fine drops of sulfur with a large surface area. The reaction is [[exothermic]], and the combustion produces temperatures of 1000\u20131600&nbsp;\u00b0C (1832\u20132912&nbsp;\u00b0F).

These events can release millions of tonnes of SO<sub>2</sub>.\n\n===Reduction of higher oxides===\nSulfur dioxide can also be a byproduct in the manufacture of [[calcium silicate]] [[cement]]; [[Calcium sulfate|CaSO<sub>4</sub>]] is heated with [[coke (fuel)|coke]] and sand in this process:\n\n: 2 CaSO<sub>4</sub> + 2 SiO<sub>2</sub> + C \u2192 2 CaSiO<sub>3</sub> + 2 SO<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nUntil the 1970s, commercial quantities of sulfuric acid and cement were produced by this process in [[Whitehaven]], England. Upon being mixed with [[shale]] or [[marl]], and roasted, the sulfate liberated sulfur dioxide gas, used in sulfuric acid production, the reaction also produced calcium silicate, a precursor in cement production.<ref>[http://www.lakestay.co.uk/whitehavenmininghistory.html WHITEHAVEN COAST ARCHAEOLOGICAL SURVEY]. lakestay.co.uk (2007)</ref>\n\nOn a laboratory scale, the action of hot concentrated sulfuric acid on copper [[swarf|turnings]] produces sulfur dioxide.\n\n: Cu  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> \u2192 CuSO<sub>4</sub>  +  SO<sub>2</sub>  +  2 H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n===From sulfite===\nSulfite results from the reaction of aqueous base and sulfur dioxide.  The reverse reaction involves acidification of [[sodium metabisulfite]]:\n\n: H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  +  Na<sub>2</sub>S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>  \u2192  2 SO<sub>2</sub>  +  Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>  + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\n==Reactions==\n\n===Industrial reactions===\nTreatment of basic solutions with sulfur dioxide affords sulfite salts (e.g. [[sodium sulfite]]):\n\n: SO<sub>2</sub> + 2 NaOH \u2192 Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nFeaturing sulfur in the +4 oxidation state, sulfur dioxide is a [[reducing agent]].  It is oxidized by halogens to give the sulfuryl halides, such as [[sulfuryl chloride]]:\n\n: SO<sub>2</sub> + Cl<sub>2</sub> \u2192 SO<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>\n\nSulfur dioxide is the [[oxidising agent]] in the [[Claus process]], which is conducted on a large scale in [[oil refineries]].

It turns moist litmus pink (being acidic), then white (due to its bleaching effect). It may be identified by bubbling it through a [[dichromate]] solution, turning the solution from orange to green (Cr<sup>3+</sup> (aq)). It can also reduce ferric ions to ferrous.<ref name=Lucas >http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2017/rncan-nrcan/M34-20/M34-20-107-eng.pdf</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide can react with certain 1,3-[[diene]]s in a [[cheletropic reaction]] to form cyclic [[sulfone]]s. This reaction is exploited on an industrial scale for the synthesis of [[sulfolane]], which is an important solvent in the [[petrochemical industry]].\n\n: [[File:Cheletropic reaction of butadiene with SO2.svg|frameless|upright=0.7]]\n\nSulfur dioxide can bind to metal ions as a [[ligand]] to form [[metal sulfur dioxide complex]]es, typically where the transition metal is in oxidation state 0 or +1.  Many different bonding modes (geometries) are recognized, but in most cases, the ligand is monodentate, attached to the metal through sulfur, which can be either planar and pyramidal [[hapticity|\u03b7]]<sup>1</sup>.<ref name=Greenwood>{{Greenwood&Earnshaw2nd}}</ref>\n\n==Uses==\n\n===Precursor to sulfuric acid===\nSulfur dioxide is an intermediate in the production of sulfuric acid, being converted to [[sulfur trioxide]], and then to [[oleum]], which is made into sulfuric acid. Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.  As a preservative, it maintains the colorful appearance of the fruit and prevents [[Decomposition|rotting]]. It is also added to sulfured [[molasses]].\n\n===In winemaking===\nSulfur dioxide was first used in [[winemaking]] by the Romans, when they discovered that burning sulfur candles inside empty wine vessels keeps them fresh and free from vinegar smell.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|publisher=www.practicalwinery.com|date=1 Feb 2009|title=Practical Winery & vineyard Journal Jan/Feb 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928111625/http://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb09/page1.htm|archive-date=2013-09-28|df=}}</ref>\n\nIt is still an important compound in winemaking, and is measured in [[parts per million]] (''ppm'') in wine.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.

Sulfur dioxide for this purpose is made when sulfur combines with oxygen. The method of converting sulfur dioxide to sulfuric acid is called the [[contact process]]. Several billion kilograms are produced annually for this purpose.\n\n===As a preservative===\nSulfur dioxide is sometimes used as a [[preservative]] for dried [[apricot]]s, dried [[common fig|figs]], and other [[dried fruit]]s, owing to its [[antimicrobial]] properties, and is called [[E number|E]]220<ref>[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#h_3 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], The Food Standards Agency website.</ref> when used in this way in Europe.

Wines containing sulfur dioxide are typically labeled with \"containing [[sulfite]]s\".\n\nSulfur dioxide exists in wine in free and bound forms, and the combinations are referred to as total SO<sub>2</sub>. Binding, for instance to the carbonyl group of [[acetaldehyde]], varies with the wine in question. The free form exists in equilibrium between molecular SO<sub>2</sub> (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion, which is in turn in equilibrium with sulfite ion. These equilibria depend on the pH of the wine. Lower pH shifts the equilibrium towards molecular (gaseous) SO<sub>2</sub>, which is the active form, while at higher pH more SO<sub>2</sub> is found in the inactive sulfite and bisulfite forms. The molecular SO<sub>2</sub> is active as an antimicrobial and antioxidant, and this is also the form which may be perceived as a pungent odor at high levels. Wines with total SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 10 ppm do not require \"contains sulfites\" on the label by US and EU laws.  The upper limit of total SO<sub>2</sub> allowed in wine in the US is 350 ppm; in the EU it is 160 ppm for red wines and 210 ppm for white and ros\u00e9 wines. In low concentrations, SO<sub>2</sub> is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO<sub>2</sub> concentrations over 50 ppm, SO<sub>2</sub> becomes evident in the smell and taste of wine.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}\n\nSO<sub>2</sub> is also a very important compound in winery sanitation.  Wineries and equipment must be kept clean, and because bleach cannot be used in a winery due the risk of [[cork taint]],<ref>[http://www.extension.purdue.edu/extmedia/FS/FS-50-W.pdf Chlorine Use in the Winery]. Purdue University</ref> a mixture of SO<sub>2</sub>, water, and citric acid is commonly used to clean and sanitize equipment. [[Ozone]] (O<sub>3</sub>) is now used extensively for sanitizing in wineries due to its efficacy, and because it does not affect the wine or most equipment.<ref>[https://www.practicalwinery.com/janfeb00/ozone.htm Use of ozone for winery and environmental sanitation], Practical Winery & Vineyard Journal.</ref>\n\n===As a reducing agent===\nSulfur dioxide is also a good [[Reducing agent|reductant]]. In the presence of water, sulfur dioxide is able to decolorize substances.  Specifically, it is a useful reducing [[bleach]] for [[paper]]s and delicate materials such as clothes.  This bleaching effect normally does not last very long. [[Oxygen]] in the atmosphere reoxidizes the reduced dyes, restoring the color.  In municipal wastewater treatment, sulfur dioxide is used to treat chlorinated wastewater prior to release.  Sulfur dioxide reduces free and combined chlorine to [[chloride]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Tchobanoglous |first=George |title=Wastewater Engineering |edition=3rd |location=New York |publisher=McGraw Hill |year=1979 |isbn=0-07-041677-X }}</ref>\n\nSulfur dioxide is fairly soluble in water, and by both IR and Raman spectroscopy; the hypothetical sulfurous acid, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, is not present to any extent.

National Council for Science and the Environment. Washington DC</ref> Sulfur dioxide emissions are a precursor to [[acid rain]] and atmospheric particulates. Due largely to the [[United States|US]] EPA's [[Acid Rain Program]], the U.S. has had a 33% decrease in emissions between 1983 and 2002.  This improvement resulted in part from [[flue-gas desulfurization]], a technology that enables SO<sub>2</sub> to be chemically bound in [[power plant]]s burning sulfur-containing [[coal]] or [[Petroleum|oil]]. In particular, [[calcium oxide|calcium oxide (lime)]] reacts with sulfur dioxide to form [[calcium sulfite]]:\n\n: CaO + SO<sub>2</sub> \u2192  CaSO<sub>3</sub>\n\nAerobic oxidation of the CaSO<sub>3</sub> gives CaSO<sub>4</sub>, [[anhydrite]].

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

According to the 19th century Franciscan friar and historian [[Donato Fabianich]], the monastery of [[St. Catharines|Saint Catherine]] was founded around this time by the Knin dignitaries and nobility which were first settled there by Mladen \u0160ubi\u0107.<ref>Donato Fabianich, Storia dei fratri minori dai primordi della joro istituzione in Dal\u00b7 mazia e Bossina, fino ai giorni nostri, I, Zadar 1863, pp. 94.</ref> Their rule over Knin came to an end at the [[Battle of Bliska]] in 1322, after which the Angevin king [[Charles I of Hungary|Charles Robert]] arrived in the city and imprisoned the former lord [[Mladen II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=35}} Upon the departure of the king to Hungary, the noble [[Ivan Nelipi\u0107]] quickly seized Knin, and from there expelled the king's men from Croatia. Thus, these territories ''de facto'' continued to remain outside the monarchy, and the [[Nelipi\u0107 noble family]] made Knin their permanent seat and ruled their territories as \"Princes of Knin\".\n\nAfter successfully warring against their enemies, the Dalmatian cities and nobility under [[George II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir|Juraj II \u0160ubi\u0107 of Bribir]] (who was imprisoned in the castle's dungeons), as well as the royal forces commanded by the [[Ban of Slavonia|Slavonian ban]] ''Mikac Prodani\u0107'',<ref>Miha Madijev, cap.

The previous bishop had likely been expelled, where the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] Mihailo took his place, and was also given the office of the king's chancellor. These actions provoked a retaliation of king [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], whose armies besieged Knin in September 1390. The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]].

A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

Although the city is only some 50&nbsp;km (31&nbsp;mi) from the Adriatic Sea, an arm of the Mediterranean, the proximity of the Dinaric Alps to the north alters its climate. Knin is particularly known for its hot summers: temperatures reaching 40&nbsp;\u00b0C (104&nbsp;\u00b0F) are not uncommon in July and August. The January average temperature is about 4&nbsp;\u00b0C and in August is about 24&nbsp;\u00b0C\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Knin (1971\u20132000, extremes 1949\u20132017)\n|width = auto\n|metric first = Y\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high C = 20.5\n|Feb record high C = 22.3\n|Mar record high C = 27.6\n|Apr record high C = 29.2\n|May record high C = 34.2\n|Jun record high C = 39.3\n|Jul record high C = 40.9\n|Aug record high C = 42.3\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 31.6\n|Nov record high C = 27.6\n|Dec record high C = 21.6\n|year record high C = 42.3\n| Jan high C = 8.9\n| Feb high C = 10.4\n| Mar high C = 14.1\n| Apr high C = 17.4\n| May high C = 23.0\n| Jun high C = 26.6\n| Jul high C = 30.1\n| Aug high C = 30.3\n| Sep high C = 25.4\n| Oct high C = 19.9\n| Nov high C = 13.7\n| Dec high C = 9.9\n|year high C = 19.1\n|Jan mean C = 4.0\n|Feb mean C = 5.1\n|Mar mean C = 8.2\n|Apr mean C = 11.5\n|May mean C = 16.6\n|Jun mean C = 20.1\n|Jul mean C = 23.0\n|Aug mean C = 22.5\n|Sep mean C = 18.0\n|Oct mean C = 13.3\n|Nov mean C = 8.2\n|Dec mean C = 5.0\n|year mean C = 13.0\n| Jan low C = -0.2\n| Feb low C = 0.7\n| Mar low C = 3.3\n| Apr low C = 6.5\n| May low C = 10.6\n| Jun low C = 13.8\n| Jul low C = 16.2\n| Aug low C = 16.0\n| Sep low C = 12.2\n| Oct low C = 8.3\n| Nov low C = 3.8\n| Dec low C = 0.9\n|year low C = 7.7\n|Jan record low C = -18.3\n|Feb record low C = -18.4\n|Mar record low C = -14.0\n|Apr record low C = -4.1\n|May record low C = -0.4\n|Jun record low C = 4.3\n|Jul record low C = 8.1\n|Aug record low C = 6.8\n|Sep record low C = 1.0\n|Oct record low C = -3.3\n|Nov record low C = -8.5\n|Dec record low C = -15.4\n|year record low C = -18.4\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 75.9\n|Feb precipitation mm = 69.8\n|Mar precipitation mm = 74.7\n|Apr precipitation mm = 92.0\n|May precipitation mm = 90.5\n|Jun precipitation mm = 81.1\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43.7\n|Aug precipitation mm = 61.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 108.1\n|Oct precipitation mm = 114.3\n|Nov precipitation mm = 112.3\n|Dec precipitation mm = 101.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1025.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n| Jan precipitation days = 10.7\n| Feb precipitation days = 9.2\n| Mar precipitation days = 9.6\n| Apr precipitation days = 11.8\n| May precipitation days = 11.4\n| Jun precipitation days = 10.8\n| Jul precipitation days = 6.4\n| Aug precipitation days = 7.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 8.8\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.0\n| Dec precipitation days = 11.0\n|year precipitation days = 118.4\n|unit snow days = 1.0 cm\n|Jan snow days = 1.3\n|Feb snow days = 1.2\n|Mar snow days = 0.2\n|Apr snow days = 0.0\n|May snow days = 0.0\n|Jun snow days = 0.0\n|Jul snow days = 0.0\n|Aug snow days = 0.0\n|Sep snow days = 0.0\n|Oct snow days = 0.0\n|Nov snow days = 0.3\n|Dec snow days = 0.5\n|year snow days = 3.5\n|Jan humidity = 69.0\n|Feb humidity = 63.5\n|Mar humidity = 62.2\n|Apr humidity = 63.1\n|May humidity = 63.6\n|Jun humidity = 62.1\n|Jul humidity = 56.1\n|Aug humidity = 58.3\n|Sep humidity = 65.8\n|Oct humidity = 69.2\n|Nov humidity = 70.1\n|Dec humidity = 70.3\n|year humidity = 64.4\n|Jan sun = 120.9\n|Feb sun = 146.9\n|Mar sun = 182.9\n|Apr sun = 189.0\n|May sun = 244.9\n|Jun sun = 270.0\n|Jul sun = 325.5\n|Aug sun = 297.6\n|Sep sun = 234.0\n|Oct sun = 182.9\n|Nov sun = 123.0\n|Dec sun = 108.5\n|year sun =\n| source 1 = [[Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service]]<ref name= DHMZ >{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/k1/k1_2/knin.pdf\n| title = Knin Climate Normals\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref><ref name=monthlyvalues>{{cite web\n| url = http://klima.hr/klima.php?id=k1&param=srednjak&Grad=knin\n| title = Mjese\u010dne vrijednosti za Knin u razdoblju 1949\u22122014\n| language = Croatian\n| accessdate = 3 December 2015\n| publisher = Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service}}</ref>\n|date=August 2014}}\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Knin population.png|thumb|Knin population 1857-2018]]\n[[File:Knin i Dinara.jpg|thumb|right|View of Knin and the [[Dinara]] mountain]]\n[[File:Kninska crkva u izgradnji.JPG|thumb|Our Lady of the Great Croatian Baptismal Vow church]]\n[[File:Arhitektura Bizanta u Kninu.JPG|thumb|Serbian Orthodox church in Knin]]\n\n[[Croatian Bureau of Statistics]] estimated the population of Knin municipality on December 31, 2018 to stand at 11,590.<ref>[https://www.dzs.hr/Hrv_Eng/Pokazatelji/Gradovi%20u%20statistici.xlsx Gradovi u statistici], Croatian Bureau of Statistics, published on 31/10/2019</ref> This represents a steep decline: just seven years earlier, in the [[2011 Census of Croatia|2011 census]], Knin municipality had a population of 15,388, while Knin (town) had a population of 10,493.<ref name=\"census2011\"/> In the 2001 census, the population of Knin was 11,128 (town) and 15,190 (whole municipality).

NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

Around 1040, at the behest of the Croatian kings, a seat of the royal bishop was established in the nearby royal village of Biskupija (Kosovo), in the church of Saint Mary. The first \"bishop of the Croats\" is named ''Marko Giudice'', and he and his successors were attached to the royal court as preachers and king's \"special bishops\" until 1102.<ref>''[[Illyricum sacrum]]'', IV (Venice, 1775)</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=23}}\n\nIn the second half of the 11th century, Knin became a more permanent royal residence of king [[Demetrius Zvonimir of Croatia|Demetrius Zvonimir]] around 1080.

At that point, it came into possession of the Hungarian [[Arpad dynasty]], and since then, it ceased to be a permanent royal residence but remained as a political and administrative center of the kingdom.

The city, along with other territories were returned to Sigismund in 1393. Upon his return from the disastrous [[battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396, the king spent a month in Knin to consolidate his holdings and state affairs of Dalmatia and Croatia, issuing various decrees together with his ban [[Nicholas II Garai|Nikola Gorjanski]].{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=60}} In 1401, the city was besieged by the Bosnian king [[Stephen Ostoja]], who encamped in the adjacent Knin field (Kninsko polje), and remained there until the following year. The newly crowned king [[Ladislaus of Naples]] attained support from the castellan of Knin and issued his first decree there in 1403.\n\nBecause of frequent harassment, the citizens of Knin had to pay tribute to the duke [[Hrvoje Vuk\u010di\u0107 Hrvatini\u0107]], and for a short while, the city seemed to have been directly under his rule. The presence of [[Franciscans]] is for the first time mentioned in the 15th century, which were located in the old Saint Mary's church and monastery in the city. Apart from them, other religious buildings are mentioned such as the church of the [[Holy Spirit]].<ref name=\"academia.edu\"/>\n\nIts strategic position played an important role in many wars and power changes \u2013 the Republic of Venice often reflected on its importance as a key castle and the main entrance to Dalmatia, which it attempted to obtain during the 15th century.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=64}} During these years both the city, the ban and his dignitaries played a crucial role in the struggle for dominance over the coastal cities with Venice. In 1430 Knin and the Church of St. Bartolomeo in Kapitul were the centre of the \"Union and Brotherhood of the Croats\" ({{lang-la|unio et fraternitas Croatorum}}), a congregation of [[Croatian nobility|Croatian nobles]] formed by 12 [[counties of Croatia]] in order to \"preserve the fame and old customs of the Croatian Kingdom\".<ref>Mladen An\u010di\u0107: \"Desetlje\u0107e od 1091. do 1102. u zrcalu vrela\" (Summary: The decade between 1091 and 1102 according to the sources), Povijesni prilozi 17/1998, p. 253</ref><ref>Damir Karbi\u0107: Hrvatski plemi\u0107ki rod i obi\u010dajno pravo, p. 109-111</ref>\n\nIt was in 1420 that the Nelipi\u0107 noble family again regained their former role in Croatia with the emergence of [[Ivani\u0161 Nelipi\u0107]], which again distanced these territories from the crown. These possessions were later acquired after Ivani\u0161's death in 1435 by [[Ivan Frankopan|An\u017e]] of the [[House of Frankopan]] through the marriage with the Nelipi\u0107 nobles. Knin and the surrounding possessions were restored to the crown upon An\u017e's death in 1437.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=68}} In 1454 an attempt between the Bosnian king and the Venetians was made to acquire the city, which was referenced as \"capital and foremost place of Croatia\" in their letters.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=72}}\n\nDuring the reign of king [[Matthias Corvinus]], the bishops of Knin were selected as the king's principal orators abroad in collecting the help needed against the invading [[Ottoman Empire]]. The bishop was thus first secretly involved at the [[pope]] to solicit financial aid for Matthias' military campaign. The city's distant surroundings quickly became a target for Ottoman raids. As the raids were becoming more frequent, one of them reached Knin, where a Franciscan monastery has been recorded to have been destroyed in 1469.\n\nIn 1493, the first direct attempt of siege by the Ottomans was undertaken, which was followed by ban [[John Corvinus]] and his deputies invading and pillaging the Ottoman territories from the city. The Republic of Venice started to financially support the city's defences in fear for its possessions in Dalmatia. In 1501, three Ottoman spies were caught and imprisoned by the vice-ban. They were sent by the [[Sanjak of Bosnia|Sanjak-bey of Bosnia]], and had infiltrated Knin posing as friars that were on their way to sell [[vestment]]s to the market. They were to investigate the situation in the Zadar surrounding.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=82}}\n\n[[File:KninPagano1525.png|thumb|right|280px|Knin castle, settlement and Kapitul around 1525, after Ottoman conquest from the map of Dalmatia from [[Matteo Pagano]]]]\nThe last major conflict around Knin before the truce was in September 1502 when 2,000 Ottoman cavalrymen looted the area.{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=84}} On 20 August 1503 King [[Vladislaus II of Hungary|Vladislaus II]] concluded a 7-year peace treaty with Sultan [[Bayezid II]]. The armistice was generally respected by all sides,<ref>[[Ive Ma\u017euran]]: Povijest Hrvatske od 15. stolje\u0107a do 18. stolje\u0107a, p. 44-45</ref> during which Knin's defensive positions were strengthened in 1504. A period of severe famine started in 1505 that affected entire Dalmatia. In 1510 the plague halved Knin's population.\n\nIn 1510 around 1,000 Ottoman [[Ak\u0131nc\u0131]] raided the countryside of Knin. There had been word that viceban of Croatia was captured on that occasion. Baltazar Ba\u0107an ({{lang-hu|Boldizs\u00e1r Batthy\u00e1ny}}), viceban of Slavonia, together with forces from the Zagreb Bishopry, managed to lift the siege of Knin in January 1513. Next year in February the Ottomans laid siege on Knin with 10,000 men from the Sanjak of Bosnia, but were unable to take the city and lost 500 troops. Knin's burg and outskirts were burned on this occasion.<ref>Vjekoslav Klai\u0107: Povijest Hrvata od najstarijih vremena do svr\u0161etka XIX. stolje\u0107a, Knjiga \u010detvrta, Zagreb, 1988, p. 302</ref>{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=88}} These clashes left Knin devastated and there was no news about the city for five years. Local population was decimated by war, hunger, plague and migration to safer places, and its economy was hindered by the seizure of crops and livestock. Due to Knin's strategic value, King [[Louis II of Hungary|Louis II]] responded to requests from captains of Knin, Skradin and Ostrovica and promised reinforcements of 1,000 infantry and 1,000 cavalrymen. However, it is unlikely that these forces arrived to the endangered towns.\n\nOn May 29, 1522, [[Siege of Knin|after the final siege]] of the Knin castle, it fell to the [[Ottoman Empire]],{{sfn|Gunja\u010da|1960|p=89}} and Croats left the town in large numbers.

After the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] in 1805, the French Empire gained the city and incorporated it into the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. By 1813, the Austrians regained control over the town. By the end of the 19th century, as a part of the [[Habsburg]] domain of Dalmatia, Knin grew steadily, becoming an important commercial as well as road and railway center. In 1867, Knin became a part of [[Dalmatia]] \u2013 a territorial entity within [[Cisleithania]]. After the [[First World War]] Knin became a part of the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]] in 1918, which subsequently became part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] ([[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] after 1929).\n\n===Modern===\n[[File:Spomenik hrvatske pobjede Oluja 95 16 obljetnica vojnoredarstvene operacije Oluja 04082011 5047-2.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of the Croatian Victory \"Storm '95\"]]\n{{Expand section|date=June 2016}}\nFrom October 1990,<ref name=\"The war\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|title=Kronologija Domovinskog rata u Lici i Sjevernoj Dalmaciji|accessdate=26 December 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125151650/http://www.hic.hr/ratni-zlocini/hrvatska/dalmacija/kronologija.htm|archivedate=25 November 2014}}</ref> eight months before Croatia [[Croatian War of Independence|declared independence]] (June 25, 1991) from [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], Knin became the main stronghold for the [[Serbs]] in the [[Kninska Krajina|Knin region]], eventually becoming the capital city of the internationally unrecognised [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] in 1991.<ref name=\"Knin-Domovinski Rat\">[http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20051126063710/http://www.knin.hr/stranice/o_kninu/domovinski_rat.asp Knin-Domovinski Rat]</ref> The leaders of ''Krajina'' were Knin locals: [[Milan Marti\u0107]] and [[Milan Babi\u0107]], both convicted for [[ethnic cleansing]] of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina by [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]].<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\">{{cite web|url=http://www.icty.org/x/cases/martic/tjug/en/070612_summary_en.pdf|title=Summary of Judgement for Milan Marti\u0107|accessdate=18 May 2011|publisher=[[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]}}</ref> Widespread acts of murder and violence, detention and intimidation became pervasive throughout the RSK territory from 1992 to 1995.<ref name=\"ICTY judgment\" /> During that time 93,9% of Croats were expelled from the town and municipality of Knin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://narod.hr/kultura/19-ozujka-1993-knin-znate-li-da-su-srbi-protjerali-iz-grada-i-okolice-cak-94-hrvata|title=18. o\u017eujka 1993.

NK Dinara's colours were black and white until 2005 when the club changed its colours to red, white and blue. NK Dinara plays in the 4th division in Croatia ([[1. \u017dupanijska liga \u0160ibensko-kninska]]). The logo of NK Dinara is red, white, and blue (in that order) with the letter \"D\" in the middle of the logo.\n\nKnin has a sports association which was formed in 1998. [[Basketball]] is also popular in Knin. The Croatian National basketball team has played a match in Knin. They played against [[Israel]] in 1999 where Croatia won the match 78:68. Other sports played in Knin are [[Rugby football|rugby]], [[team handball|handball]], [[volleyball]], [[kickboxing]], [[karate]], [[tennis]]  and [[taekwondo]].\n\n==Transport==\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2015}}\n[[File:Station Knin.JPG|thumb|right|Knin railway station building]]\nThe most important intercity roadway in Knin is the Croatian [[D1 (Croatia)|state route D1]]. The route makes for easy access of Knin from the major coastal city of [[Split (city)|Split]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} The section of D1 from Knin to [[A1 (Croatia)|A1]] highway will be upgraded to the expressway level in following years (with [[B1 (Croatia)|B1]] expressway).\n\nKnin is also an important railway junction as the railroads from the rest of Dalmatia and its cities of [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]] and [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]] pass through Knin, going north to the capital city of Croatia, [[Zagreb]], via [[M604 railway (Croatia)|M604 railway]]. There are four lines meeting in Knin station: to [[Perkovi\u0107, Croatia|Perkovi\u0107]] (and then to Split or [[\u0160ibenik railway station|\u0160ibenik]]), to Zadar, to [[Ogulin]] (and onwards to [[Karlovac]], Zagreb) and to [[Martin Brod]] (and [[Biha\u0107]], Sisak, Zagreb). Only the former three lines offer passenger transport. The latter route, Knin-Biha\u0107-Zagreb, passes through Bosnian territory, crossing the border many times, thus it is not used for passenger transport since the beginning of the war in 1991. However, it is the shortest route between Knin and Zagreb, and as such was electrified in 1984 (the [[overhead line|catenary]] being subsequently destroyed by war operations in the early 1990s). [[Railway electrification system|Electrification]] had started from [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] inland towards the coast and had only reached Knin, so today the Knin station sidings are equipped with overhead catenary, but lines leaving the town are not.\n[[File:\u017deljezni\u010dki-kolodvor-postaja-Knin-05082016-02-roberta-f.jpg|thumb|right|Knin railway station's platforms, notice the lack of catenary wires, and the presence of the poles only]]\n\n==Towns and villages in the municipality==\n\n*[[Golubi\u0107, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Golubi\u0107]]\n*Knin\n*[[Kninsko Polje]]\n*[[Kova\u010di\u0107, Croatia|Kova\u010di\u0107]]\n*[[Ljuba\u010d, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Ljuba\u010d]]\n*[[O\u0107estovo]]\n*[[Plavno, Croatia|Plavno]]\n*[[Pola\u010da, \u0160ibenik-Knin County|Pola\u010da]]\n*[[Potkonje]]\n*[[Radljevac]]\n*[[Strmica, Croatia|Strmica]]\n*[[Vrpolje, Knin|Vrpolje]]\n*[[\u017dagrovi\u0107]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Croatia}}\n* [[Church of Saint Anthony, Knin]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite web|ref={{harvid|ICJ|3 February 2015}}|title=Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v.

The earliest references to this site show that a small hunting lodge was present here in the late 18th century. The inner library room still retains original Jacobean carving over the fireplace and is believed to be the earliest remaining feature from the hunting lodge days.\n\nWoodhall Lodge or Wood Corner, as it was then known, became the property of one Thomas Hotchkin of Rutland, Lord of the Manor of Thimbleby and Woodhall. Hotchkin had inherited many manors throughout Rutland and Lincolnshire but Woodhall Lodge was his particular favourite and where he spent most of his time. Half a mile to the west of the grounds, close to the present Kinema, Thomas Hotchkin had built a spa bath in the late 1830s, having by chance discovered the healing properties of the iodine-rich water in a disused mine shaft on his land. In 1842 White's Directory describes Woodhall Spa as \"a modern watering place \u2026 with just over 300 souls\" and Thomas Hotchkin as living in Woodhall Lodge, \"a neat mansion near the spa'.\n\nAfter his passing, four further generations of the Hotchkin Family lived in Woodhall Lodge. At some point during the last century, it was renamed as the Old Manor or Manor House. During the residence of Thomas Hotchkin's great grandson, [[Stafford Hotchkin|Stafford Vere Hotchkin]] (1876\u20131953), who helped to redesign the adjacent world-rated golf course which bears his name, there were major additions to the building. Around 1905 the south-west corner and east wings were built, greatly enlarging the footprint of the property, leaving the front entrance wholly Georgian, whilst, to the left and right are the Edwardian additions. The magnificent sweeping staircase, the beautiful hallway and Queens Room fireplaces, and the mahogany panelled entrance to the library all date from this period of high elegance. In 1965, Thomas Hotchkin\u2019s great great grandson, Neil Stafford Hotchkin (1914\u20132004), sold the property to the National Farmers Union and it was converted into offices as the company\u2019s regional headquarters.  Around twenty five years later, it was sold to a local businessman, who continued to run it as offices for various Lincolnshire companies. In 2013 new owners renamed it Woodhall Spa Manor and it now serves as a wedding and event venue.\n\n====The Tower-on-the-Moor====\n[[File:WSGC Tower by 3rd.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tower as seen from [[Woodhall Spa Golf Club]]]]\nThe Tower-on-the-Moor, an octagonal, four-storey, red brick-built tower, is the stair turret of what is believed to have been a hunting lodge, built in the mid&ndash;15th century for [[Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell]] whose fortified house, [[Tattershall Castle (Lincolnshire)|Tattershall Castle]], was located {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} to the south.<ref name=BLB>{{cite web|title=British Listed Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-195247-the-tower-on-the-moor-woodhall-spa|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> It is a Grade II* [[Listed Building]]<ref name=BLB/> and a scheduled [[Ancient Monument]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1017216|desc=Tower on the Moor|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>  Documentary sources indicate that the tower was partly dismantled in 1472, when bricks from the Tower on the Moor were used for repairs at Tattershall Castle.<ref>(Scheduling Report)</ref><ref>Simpson, W.D.

It is a notable feature of the course and has been adopted as the emblem of the golf club.\n\n==Geography==\nWoodhall Spa lies at the southwestern edge of the Central Lincolnshire Vale, between the Rivers [[River Witham|Witham]] and [[River Bain|Bain]]. The village is largely flat rising gently towards the east, and is surrounded towards the north and east by a mixture of ancient and planted woodland. To the south west can be found many sand and gravel excavation pits, some still in use and some abandoned, many of which are now protected nature reserves. Much of the land on which the village is built was once extensive [[heathland]] with a light [[fluvial]] sandy soil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Lincolnshire Vale|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:RJ7X4imxWT8J:www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/jca44_tcm6-4932.pdf+woodhall+spa+soil&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiXQrL5ZtSlooIMFSxzjh9uCQEYtwe0ALsLnZmQSJvcolURfzWGO3FjF6jNDu7y-KrapxavBy1UwgU_WyH1PkfruUFkjNtT0K2WiUYGSn3I0BmeSp0Mkgbn8Am16JxvMEOrXFMN&sig=AHIEtbSvPb3pcxraCfKpp4tUlpUQkTY8Aw|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> Well-preserved areas of heathland can be seen at Moor Farm Nature Reserve on Wellsyke Lane, where plants include [[tormentil]], [[bell heather]] and [[climbing corydalis]].\n\nThe abundance of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] in the soil around Woodhall Spa explains the formation of acidic heathland, in a county otherwise characterised by calcareous bedrock and naturally [[alkaline]] soils.

The earliest references to this site show that a small hunting lodge was present here in the late 18th century. The inner library room still retains original Jacobean carving over the fireplace and is believed to be the earliest remaining feature from the hunting lodge days.\n\nWoodhall Lodge or Wood Corner, as it was then known, became the property of one Thomas Hotchkin of Rutland, Lord of the Manor of Thimbleby and Woodhall. Hotchkin had inherited many manors throughout Rutland and Lincolnshire but Woodhall Lodge was his particular favourite and where he spent most of his time. Half a mile to the west of the grounds, close to the present Kinema, Thomas Hotchkin had built a spa bath in the late 1830s, having by chance discovered the healing properties of the iodine-rich water in a disused mine shaft on his land. In 1842 White's Directory describes Woodhall Spa as \"a modern watering place \u2026 with just over 300 souls\" and Thomas Hotchkin as living in Woodhall Lodge, \"a neat mansion near the spa'.\n\nAfter his passing, four further generations of the Hotchkin Family lived in Woodhall Lodge. At some point during the last century, it was renamed as the Old Manor or Manor House. During the residence of Thomas Hotchkin's great grandson, [[Stafford Hotchkin|Stafford Vere Hotchkin]] (1876\u20131953), who helped to redesign the adjacent world-rated golf course which bears his name, there were major additions to the building. Around 1905 the south-west corner and east wings were built, greatly enlarging the footprint of the property, leaving the front entrance wholly Georgian, whilst, to the left and right are the Edwardian additions. The magnificent sweeping staircase, the beautiful hallway and Queens Room fireplaces, and the mahogany panelled entrance to the library all date from this period of high elegance. In 1965, Thomas Hotchkin\u2019s great great grandson, Neil Stafford Hotchkin (1914\u20132004), sold the property to the National Farmers Union and it was converted into offices as the company\u2019s regional headquarters.  Around twenty five years later, it was sold to a local businessman, who continued to run it as offices for various Lincolnshire companies. In 2013 new owners renamed it Woodhall Spa Manor and it now serves as a wedding and event venue.\n\n====The Tower-on-the-Moor====\n[[File:WSGC Tower by 3rd.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tower as seen from [[Woodhall Spa Golf Club]]]]\nThe Tower-on-the-Moor, an octagonal, four-storey, red brick-built tower, is the stair turret of what is believed to have been a hunting lodge, built in the mid&ndash;15th century for [[Ralph de Cromwell, 3rd Baron Cromwell]] whose fortified house, [[Tattershall Castle (Lincolnshire)|Tattershall Castle]], was located {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} to the south.<ref name=BLB>{{cite web|title=British Listed Buildings|url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-195247-the-tower-on-the-moor-woodhall-spa|publisher=British Listed Buildings|accessdate=28 April 2011}}</ref> It is a Grade II* [[Listed Building]]<ref name=BLB/> and a scheduled [[Ancient Monument]].<ref>{{NHLE|num=1017216|desc=Tower on the Moor|accessdate=26 June 2017}}</ref>  Documentary sources indicate that the tower was partly dismantled in 1472, when bricks from the Tower on the Moor were used for repairs at Tattershall Castle.<ref>(Scheduling Report)</ref><ref>Simpson, W.D.

It is a notable feature of the course and has been adopted as the emblem of the golf club.\n\n==Geography==\nWoodhall Spa lies at the southwestern edge of the Central Lincolnshire Vale, between the Rivers [[River Witham|Witham]] and [[River Bain|Bain]]. The village is largely flat rising gently towards the east, and is surrounded towards the north and east by a mixture of ancient and planted woodland. To the south west can be found many sand and gravel excavation pits, some still in use and some abandoned, many of which are now protected nature reserves. Much of the land on which the village is built was once extensive [[heathland]] with a light [[fluvial]] sandy soil.<ref>{{cite web|title=Central Lincolnshire Vale|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:RJ7X4imxWT8J:www.naturalengland.org.uk/Images/jca44_tcm6-4932.pdf+woodhall+spa+soil&hl=en&gl=uk&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESiXQrL5ZtSlooIMFSxzjh9uCQEYtwe0ALsLnZmQSJvcolURfzWGO3FjF6jNDu7y-KrapxavBy1UwgU_WyH1PkfruUFkjNtT0K2WiUYGSn3I0BmeSp0Mkgbn8Am16JxvMEOrXFMN&sig=AHIEtbSvPb3pcxraCfKpp4tUlpUQkTY8Aw|publisher=Natural England|accessdate=28 May 2011}}</ref> Well-preserved areas of heathland can be seen at Moor Farm Nature Reserve on Wellsyke Lane, where plants include [[tormentil]], [[bell heather]] and [[climbing corydalis]].\n\nThe abundance of [[sand]] and [[gravel]] in the soil around Woodhall Spa explains the formation of acidic heathland, in a county otherwise characterised by calcareous bedrock and naturally [[alkaline]] soils.

The village also has a long history of coal mining. A {{convert|65|ft|adj=on}} rock feature called the Old Man O'Mow in one of the quarried areas is believed to be the site of an ancient cairn.\n\nThe village was served by a [[Mow Cop and Scholar Green railway station|railway station]], opened by the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] on 9 October 1848 and closed in 1964.\n\n==The Castle==\nThe most dominant feature of the village is [[Mow Cop Castle]], a [[folly]] of a ruined castle at the summit of the hill, built in 1754. Both Mow Cop Castle and the Old Man O'Mow are under the management of the [[National Trust]], and on the route of the [[Cheshire Gritstone Trail]], a long-distance walking route.\n\n==Birthplace of Primitive Methodism==\nMow Cop is noteworthy as the birthplace of the [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodist]] movement. Starting in 1800, [[Hugh Bourne]] from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and [[William Clowes (Primitive Methodist)|William Clowes]] from [[Burslem]] began holding open-air [[prayer meeting]]s. On 31 May 1807, a large 14-hour [[camp meeting]] was held, leading to the founding of the Primitive Methodist Church in 1810. These camp meetings became a regular feature at Mow Cop, being held to celebrate the 100th, 150th and 200th [[anniversary|anniversaries]] of the first camp.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farndale|first=W.

This novel was filmed by the BBC in the 1970s, and later released in a restored HD DVD in 2014.  Mow Cop and its castle also feature in Alan Garner's 1966 photo-story book for children, ''The Old Man of Mow''.\n\nThe castle has also been a magnet for artists, and can be seen in everything from local watercolour and oil paintings and postcards, to ceramics made in the nearby Potteries. An engraving of it also featured on a Royal Mail stamp book in 1981.\n\n==Running & Cycling==\nSince the late 20th century, Mow Cop has been known for its Killer Mile, a one-mile running race from the railway level crossing on the western side of the hill up to the castle.

It is {{convert|24|mi}} south of Manchester and {{convert|6|mi}} north of Stoke-on-Trent, on a steep hill of the same name rising up to {{convert|335|m}} above sea level.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mow Cop - Trig Point |url=http://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/mountaindetails.php?rf=2826|publisher=Hill Bagging|access-date=29 April 2016}}</ref> The village is among the westernmost hills of the [[Staffordshire Moorlands]], with the [[Cheshire Plain]] directly to the west. For population details taken at the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]], see [[Kidsgrove]].\n\n==Geography==\nThe {{convert|335|m|adj=on}} hill on which the village lies upon is a [[moorland]] ridge composed of [[sandstone]] and [[Millstone Grit]] rising eastwards above the Cheshire Plain. It is at the western edge of the Staffordshire Moorlands, forming the upland fringe of the southern [[Pennines]], most of which are in the [[Peak District|Peak District National Park]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web |title=Potteries and Churnet Valley|url=http://www.snh.org.uk/wwo/sharinggoodpractice/CCI/cci/westmidlands/064.htm|publisher=Scottish Natural Heritage|access-date=3 May 2016 |archivedate=2 June 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602021346/http://www.snh.org.uk/wwo/sharinggoodpractice/CCI/cci/westmidlands/064.htm}}</ref> On a clear day, the hill offers views extending to the [[West Pennine Moors]], Welsh mountains (including [[Snowdonia]]), [[Shropshire Hills]] and [[Cannock Chase]].\n\n==History==\nThe name is first recorded as ''Mowel'' around 1270 AD, and is believed to derive from either the [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] ''M\u016bga-hyll'', meaning \"heap-hill\", with ''copp'' = \"head\" added later, or the [[Common Celtic]] ancestor of Welsh ''moel'' (= hill), with Anglo-Saxon ''copp'' added later.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kent |first=Jeff |author-link1=Jeff Kent (author) |date=2013 |title=Staffordshire's 1,000-Foot Peaks |publisher=Witan Books |isbn=978-0-9927505-0-3 }}</ref>\n\nAt the village's summit, men once quarried stone to make into [[querns]], used since the [[Iron Age]] for milling corn; this trade ended during the [[Victorian period]]. The village also has a long history of coal mining. A {{convert|65|ft|adj=on}} rock feature called the Old Man O'Mow in one of the quarried areas is believed to be the site of an ancient cairn.\n\nThe village was served by a [[Mow Cop and Scholar Green railway station|railway station]], opened by the [[North Staffordshire Railway]] on 9 October 1848 and closed in 1964.\n\n==The Castle==\nThe most dominant feature of the village is [[Mow Cop Castle]], a [[folly]] of a ruined castle at the summit of the hill, built in 1754. Both Mow Cop Castle and the Old Man O'Mow are under the management of the [[National Trust]], and on the route of the [[Cheshire Gritstone Trail]], a long-distance walking route.\n\n==Birthplace of Primitive Methodism==\nMow Cop is noteworthy as the birthplace of the [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodist]] movement. Starting in 1800, [[Hugh Bourne]] from [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and [[William Clowes (Primitive Methodist)|William Clowes]] from [[Burslem]] began holding open-air [[prayer meeting]]s. On 31 May 1807, a large 14-hour [[camp meeting]] was held, leading to the founding of the Primitive Methodist Church in 1810. These camp meetings became a regular feature at Mow Cop, being held to celebrate the 100th, 150th and 200th [[anniversary|anniversaries]] of the first camp.<ref>{{cite book|last=Farndale|first=W. E.|title=The Secret of Mow Cop: A New Appraisal of the Origins of Primitive Methodism|publisher=Epworth Press|location=London|year=1950}}</ref>\n\n==In the arts==\nThe village and castle are featured prominently in the 1973 novel ''[[Red Shift (novel)|Red Shift]],'' by [[Alan Garner]]. This novel was filmed by the BBC in the 1970s, and later released in a restored HD DVD in 2014.  Mow Cop and its castle also feature in Alan Garner's 1966 photo-story book for children, ''The Old Man of Mow''.\n\nThe castle has also been a magnet for artists, and can be seen in everything from local watercolour and oil paintings and postcards, to ceramics made in the nearby Potteries. An engraving of it also featured on a Royal Mail stamp book in 1981.\n\n==Cycling==\nSince the late 20th century, Mow Cop has been known for its Killer Mile, a one-mile road-cycling race from the railway level crossing on the western side of the hill up to the castle. The race was first organized in the early 1980s by John Britton.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mowcop.info/killermile/killermile.htm |title=Killer Mile |website=www.mowcop.info |publisher=Mow Cop Residents Association |access-date=30 June 2015}}</ref> The climb is also well known among local cyclists and features in the ''100 Greatest Cycling Climbs in Britain''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Simon|title=100 greatest cycling climbs: A road cyclist's guide to Britain's hills|date=2010|publisher=Frances Lincoln|location=London|isbn=9780711231207}}</ref>\n\n==Notable residents==\n<!--include only those persons with WP articles that support residency; alphabetical order by surname, please-->\n* [[Ralph Barlow]] (1876 in Mow Cop \u2013 1897), footballer who played for [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] in the mid-1890s.\n* [[Emmanuel Foster]] (1921\u20131965), English footballer, played for Mow Cop, [[Stoke City F.C.]] and [[Stafford Rangers F.C.]]\n* [[Alan Jones (footballer born 1945)|Alan Jones]] (born 1945), former director of [[Port Vale F.C.]]\n* [[Jack Simcock]] (1929\u20132012), artist, known for \"a long series of bleak, sombre oils on board\" of the Mow Cop area where he lived.\n* [[Allen Tankard|Allen John Tankard]] (born 1969), English former footballer who played 519 league games, 275 for Port Vale.

The airport is managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, and takes up 528 ha. The airport serves as the main point of entry to West Kalimantan. The airport serves domestic flights to and from several cities and towns in Indonesia and some limited flights to [[Kuching]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the neighboring [[Malaysia]]. The name of the airport is derived from Lieutenant Colonel Supadio, an [[Indonesian Air Force]] officer who served Pangkowilud II Banjarmasin, which oversees the Sungai Durian Airbase (the previous name of the airport). Lieutenant Colonel Supadio died in an airplane crash with Colonel (PNB) Nurtanio in Bandung in 1966. The airport area and runway is also shared with the '''Supadio Airbase''' a Type B airbase of the [[Indonesian Air Force|TNI-AU]] (Indonesian Air Force). It served as the homebase of the Skuadron Udara 1 of the Indonesian Air Force, which consists of a fleet of 18 [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\nThe airport previously suffered from overcapacity. A major renovation,  which involves the building of a larger and more spacious terminal between 2014 and 2017 dramatically increased the airport's capacity. After the renovation, the airport now has four jet bridges and is able to accommodate 3.8&nbsp;million passengers annually. The renovation included the widening and extension of the runway to 2,500-meters, building a new and higher [[Air traffic control]] tower and widening the airport's apron to accommodate more and larger aircraft.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Supadio Airport tower.jpg|thumb|Supadio Airport new [[Air traffic control]] tower]]\n[[File:Supadioairport1.jpg|thumb|Airport terminal interior]]\nThe airport was originally built in the 1940s and was previously named as Sei Durian Airport.\n \nAfter obtaining an agreement with the [[Pontianak Sultanate]], the Pontianak Sultanate decided to give up some land to be used the Dutch colonial government in building a airfield. The Dutch government began to carry out research around the Sei Durian area to decide where to build the airstrip. Finally, the Dutch decided to build the airstrips in Sei Durian due to the consideration of strategic factors of defense. At that time, the Dutch government was involved in [[World War II]] against the [[Empire of Japan]].\n \nUnfortunately, before the construction of the airstrip started, the Dutch colonial administration capitulated to the Japanese Government. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military government decided to proceed building the airstrip, considering its strategic importance. The Japanese stationed several of its military airplanes in Sei Durian over the course of the war. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the airstrip was briefly retaken by the Dutch colonial government, before finally taken over by the new Indonesian government. Over the course of the year, the Indonesian government developed the airport, resulting in its present state.\n\nAt the height of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], several aircraft of the [[Indonesian Air Force]] were stationed on Sei Durian Airport, owing to its proximity with Malaysia in subsequent developments, the history of the Sungai Durian Airbase has undergone many series of change processes, ranging from changes in status or air force base type or renaming changes. After hostility ceased, the airbase was upgraded from a Type C Airbase to a Type B Airbase. Currently, Supadio Airport houses the Skuadron Udara 1 of the [[Indonesian Air Force]], composing of a fleet of [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the airport was renamed Supadio Airport. In the 1970s, the first international flight to [[Kuching]] in neighbouring [[Sarawak]] started, operated by [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]. In the 1980s, flights to Singapore started, operated by [[Garuda Indonesia]]. In late-October 1989, [[Malaysia Airlines]] also started flight to [[Pontianak]] from [[Kuching]]. All of these international flights discontinued in 1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis but the routes to Kuching however has been resumed in mid-1999, operated by 3 different airlines consecutively namely Batavia Air, Kalstar and Xpress Air which suspended services shortly after Wings Air operated the route. Together with Airasia, both airlines operate 14 weekly flights between Pontianak and Kuching. Between early to mid 2010s, there were also short-lived flights to [[Singapore]] (operated by Batavia Air) and [[Johor Bahru]] (by Xpress Air). Flight to [[Kuala Lumpur]] also commenced in late-March 2015, operated by [[AirAsia]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[AirAsia]] | [[Kuala Lumpur

The airport is managed by PT. Angkasa Pura II, and takes up 528 ha. The airport serves as the main point of entry to West Kalimantan. The airport serves domestic flights to and from several cities and towns in Indonesia and some limited flights to [[Kuching]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the neighboring [[Malaysia]]. The name of the airport is derived from Lieutenant Colonel Supadio, an [[Indonesian Air Force]] officer who served Pangkowilud II Banjarmasin, which oversees the Sungai Durian Airbase (the previous name of the airport). Lieutenant Colonel Supadio died in an airplane crash with Colonel (PNB) Nurtanio in Bandung in 1966. The airport area and runway is also shared with the '''Supadio Airbase''' a Type B airbase of the [[Indonesian Air Force|TNI-AU]] (Indonesian Air Force). It served as the homebase of the Skuadron Udara 1 of the Indonesian Air Force, which consists of a fleet of 18 [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\nThe airport previously suffered from overcapacity. A major renovation,  which involves the building of a larger and more spacious terminal between 2014 and 2017 dramatically increased the airport's capacity. After the renovation, the airport now has four jet bridges and is able to accommodate 3.8&nbsp;million passengers annually. The renovation included the widening and extension of the runway to 2,500-meters, building a new and higher [[Air traffic control]] tower and widening the airport's apron to accommodate more and larger aircraft.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Supadio Airport tower.jpg|thumb|Supadio Airport new [[Air traffic control]] tower]]\n[[File:Supadioairport1.jpg|thumb|Airport terminal interior]]\nThe airport was originally built in the 1940s and was previously named as Sei Durian Airport.\n \nAfter obtaining an agreement with the [[Pontianak Sultanate]], the Pontianak Sultanate decided to give up some land to be used the Dutch colonial government in building a airfield. The Dutch government began to carry out research around the Sei Durian area to decide where to build the airstrip. Finally, the Dutch decided to build the airstrips in Sei Durian due to the consideration of strategic factors of defense. At that time, the Dutch government was involved in [[World War II]] against the [[Empire of Japan]].\n \nUnfortunately, before the construction of the airstrip started, the Dutch colonial administration capitulated to the Japanese Government. During the Japanese occupation, the Japanese military government decided to proceed building the airstrip, considering its strategic importance. The Japanese stationed several of its military airplanes in Sei Durian over the course of the war. After the Japanese surrendered in 1945, the airstrip was briefly retaken by the Dutch colonial government, before finally taken over by the new Indonesian government. Over the course of the year, the Indonesian government developed the airport, resulting in its present state.\n\nAt the height of the [[Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation]], several aircraft of the [[Indonesian Air Force]] were stationed on Sei Durian Airport, owing to its proximity with Malaysia in subsequent developments, the history of the Sungai Durian Airbase has undergone many series of change processes, ranging from changes in status or air force base type or renaming changes. After hostility ceased, the airbase was upgraded from a Type C Airbase to a Type B Airbase. Currently, Supadio Airport houses the Skuadron Udara 1 of the [[Indonesian Air Force]], composing of a fleet of [[BAE Hawk|Hawk 109/209]].\n\nIn the 1980s, the airport was renamed Supadio Airport. In the 1970s, the first international flight to [[Kuching]] in neighbouring [[Sarawak]] started, operated by [[Merpati Nusantara Airlines]]. In the 1980s, flights to Singapore started, operated by [[Garuda Indonesia]]. In late-October 1989, [[Malaysia Airlines]] also started flight to [[Pontianak]] from [[Kuching]]. All of these international flights discontinued in 1998 due to the Asian Financial Crisis but the routes to Kuching however has been resumed in mid-1999, operated by 3 different airlines consecutively namely Batavia Air, Kalstar and Xpress Air which suspended services shortly after Wings Air operated the route. Together with Airasia, both airlines operate 14 weekly flights between Pontianak and Kuching. Between early to mid 2010s, there were also short-lived flights to [[Singapore]] (operated by Batavia Air) and [[Johor Bahru]] (by Xpress Air). Flight to [[Kuala Lumpur]] also commenced in late-March 2015, operated by [[AirAsia]].\n\n==Airlines and destinations==\n\n===Passenger===\n{{Airport-dest-list\n| [[AirAsia]] | [[Kuala Lumpur

In 2012 tender to overlay 2,250 meters runway has been done, and in early 2013 overlay will be done. Multiyears project to expand runway to 2,500 meters began in 2013. Before, in 2010\u20132011 runway has been widened from 30 meters to 45 meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://industri.kontan.co.id/news/angkasa-pura-ii-segera-perluas-bandara-supadio/2013/01/03 |title=Angkasa Pura II segera perluas bandara Supadio |date=3 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe new terminal was now being constructed and expected to be finished totally by 2016. The project would be separated into 2 phase. Phase I involves building a temporary terminal with an area of 13.000 m2 and could accommodate over 1.5&nbsp;million people over a year. This temporary building would be located adjacent to the existing terminal, Phase 2 involves demolishing of existing terminal building and building a new terminal building as an extension of the building in phase I. In total, the new Supadio Airport terminal would have an area of 32.000 m2 and could accommodate 2.5&nbsp;million people a year.<ref>http://bisnis.news.viva.co.id/news/read/556851-bangun-terminal-baru-bandara-supadio--angkasa-pura-ii-rogoh-rp370-m</ref>\n\n==Military use==\nSupadio International Airport is also used by Aviation Squadron 51 (Skadron Udara 51), which operates the [[CAIG Wing Loong]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.janes.com/article/78147/indonesia-acquires-four-wing-loong-i-uavs-from-china |title=Indonesia acquires four Wing Loong I UAVs from China |first=Ridzwan |last=Rahmat |date=25 February 2018 |publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]] |quote=Aviation Squadron 51 is based near the city of Pontianak in West Kalimantan, and the unit shares a runway with the Supadio International Airport.}}</ref>\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\n* On 19 January 1973, [[Douglas DC-3|Douglas C-47B]] PK-EHC of [[Trans Nusantara Airways]] crashed on landing and was destroyed in the subsequent fire.

[[Mecklenburgisch dialect|Mecklenburgian]]: ''Swerin'') is the [[Capital city|capital]] and [[List of cities and towns in Germany|second-largest city]] of the northeastern [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. It has a population of about 100,000.<ref>http://www.svz.de/lokales/zeitung-fuer-die-landeshauptstadt/eine-wachsende-grossstadt-id14346686.html</ref>\n\nSchwerin was first mentioned in 1018 as ''Wendenburg'' and was granted [[town privileges|city rights]] in 1160 by [[Henry the Lion]], thus it is the [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|oldest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. It is globally known for its [[Romanticism|romantic]] [[Schwerin Palace]], situated on an island in [[Lake Schwerin]]. The palace was one of the main residences of the [[List of rulers of Mecklenburg|dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg]] until 1918 and is the official seat of the [[Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|state parliament]] since 1990. The city also has a largely intact [[Altstadt|old town]], thanks to only minor damage in World War II.\n\nSchwerin is located within the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] and close to [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]], and to nearby [[regiopolis]]es of [[Rostock]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]. Major industries and employers include high technology, machine building, healthcare, government agencies, railway supply, consumer goods and tourism. Schwerin has three academic colleges, the FHM, HdBA and the Design School.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nSchwerin is enclosed by lakes. The largest of these lakes, the ''[[Lake Schwerin|Schweriner See]]'', has an area of 60&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In the middle part of these lakes there was a settlement of the Slavic [[Obotrites|Obotrite]] (dated back to the 11th century). The area was called ''Zuarin'' ([[Polabian language|Polabian]] ''Zwierzyn''), and the name Schwerin is derived from that designation. In 1160, [[Henry the Lion]] defeated the Obotrites and captured Schwerin. The town was later expanded into a powerful regional centre. A castle was built on this site, and expanded to become a ducal palace. It is supposedly haunted by the small, impious ghost, called [[Peterm\u00e4nnchen]] (''\"Peterman\"'').\n\nIn 1358, Schwerin became a part of the Duchy of [[Mecklenburg]], making it the seat of the duchy from then on. About 1500, the construction of the Schwerin Palace began, as a residence for the dukes. After the division of Mecklenburg (1621), Schwerin became the capital of the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Between 1765 and 1837, the town of [[Ludwigslust]] served as the capital, until Schwerin was reinstated.\n\n===Recent times===\nIn the mid-1800s, many residents from Schwerin moved to the United States, many to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Today Milwaukee and Schwerin are sister cities. After 1918, and during the [[German Revolution]], resulting in the fall of all the [[German monarchies]], the Grand Duke abdicated. Schwerin became capital of the [[Free State of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] thereafter.\n\nAt the end of [[World War II]], on 2 May 1945, Schwerin was taken by United States troops. It was turned over to the British on 1 June 1945, and one month later, on 1 July 1945,<ref>Some evidence{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} calls into doubt the date on which the British withdrew to the predesignated occupation zone. Local residents claim that the British forces did not relinquish control of Schwerin until later in the year, probably November, following a brief artillery exchange across lake Schwerin between the British and the Soviets. Allegedly there were no deaths.</ref> it was handed over to the Soviet forces, as the British and American forces pulled back from the [[line of contact]] to the predesignated occupation zones.\n\nSchwerin was then in the Soviet Occupation Zone which was to become the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). Initially, it was the capital of the State of Mecklenburg which at that time included the western part of [[Pomerania]] ([[Vorpommern]]). After the states were dissolved in the GDR, in 1952, Schwerin served as the capital of the Schwerin district (Bezirk Schwerin).\n \nAfter reunification in 1990, the former state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was recreated as one of the ''[[States of Germany|Bundesl\u00e4nder]]''. [[Rostock]] was a serious contender for state capital but the decision went in favour of Schwerin.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe urban area of Schwerin is divided into 18 local districts,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwerin.de/kultur-tourismus/stadtportrait/stadtteile/|title=Stadtteile|website=www.schwerin.de|language=de|access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref> each with a local council. The districts consist of one or more districts. The local councilors have between 5 and 15 members depending on the number of inhabitants.\n\nThey are determined by the city council for the duration of the election period of the city council after each municipal election. The local councilors are to hear important matters concerning the district and have a right of initiative. However, the final decisions are made by the city council of the city as a whole.\n\nThe eighteen current districts are the following:\n\nDistrict 1: [[Schelfstadt]], Werdervorstadt, Schelfwerder\n\nDistrict 2: Altstadt (Old Town), Feldstadt, Paulsstadt, Lewenberg\n\nDistrict 3: Grosser Dreesch (former Dreesch I)\n\nDistrict 4: Neu Zippendorf (former Dreesch II)\n\nDistrict 5: Mue\u00dfer Holz (former Dreesch III)\n\nDistrict 6: Gartenstadt, Ostorf (formerly Haselholz, Ostorf)\n\nDistrict 7: Lankow\n\nDistrict 8: Weststadt\n\nDistrict 9: Krebsf\u00f6rden\n\nDistrict 10: W\u00fcstmark, G\u00f6hrener Tannen\n\nDistrict 11: G\u00f6rries\n\nDistrict 12: Friedrichsthal\n\nDistrict 13: Neum\u00fchle, Sacktannen\n\nDistrict 14: Warnitz\n\nDistrict 15: Wickendorf\n\nLocality 16: Medewege\n\nLocality 17: Zippendorf\n\nLocality 18: Mue\u00df\n\n==Twin towns - sister cities==\n{{main|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\nSchwerin is twinned with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.schwerin.de/kultur-tourismus/Information/stadtportrait/staedtepartnerschaften/|website=schwerin.de|publisher=Schwerin|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=15em}}\n*{{flagicon|USA}} [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]], United States\n*{{flagicon|DEN}} [[Odense Municipality|Odense]], Denmark\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Pi\u0142a]], Poland\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Reggio Emilia]], Italy\n*{{flagicon|EST}} [[Tallinn]], Estonia\n*{{flagicon|FIN}} [[Vaasa]], Finland\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Municipality|V\u00e4xj\u00f6]], Sweden\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Wuppertal]], Germany\n{{div col end}}\n*{{flagicon|BUL}} [[Vidin]], Bulgaria\n\n== Transport ==\nCity buses and trams are run by NVS (Nahverkehr Schwerin).<ref>[http://www.nahverkehr-schwerin.de/ NVS (Nahverkehr Schwerin)]</ref>\n\n[[Schwerin Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) is connected by [[Ludwigslust\u2013Wismar railway|rail to Berlin]], [[Hagenow Land\u2013Schwerin railway|Hamburg]] and [[Bad Kleinen\u2013Rostock railway|Rostock]].\n\n== Main sights ==\n* The landmark of the city is the [[Schwerin Palace]], located on an island in the lake of the same name ([[Schweriner See]]). It was, for centuries, the residence of the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg|Dukes of Mecklenburg]] and today is the seat of the ''[[Landtag]]'' (state parliament).\n* [[Schwerin Cathedral]], built in 1260\u20131416 in [[Brick Gothic]] style.\n* The ''Alter Garten'' (Old Garden) square, surrounded by buildings such as the 18th-century ''Altes Palais'' (Old Palace), the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] ''[[Staatliches Museum Schwerin]]'' (State Art Museum, built in 1877\u20131882), and the ''[[Mecklenburg State Theatre|Staatstheater]]'' (City Theater, erected in 1886).\n* The town hall (18th century).\n* [[Schelfkirche]] (Saint Nicolai Church), originally built 1238, but rebuilt in 1713 after destruction by a storm.\n* [[Fernsehturm Schwerin-Zippendorf|TV Tower Schwerin-Zippendorf]].\n\n=== Museums ===\n* The [[Staatliches Museum Schwerin|Staatliches Museum Schwerin-Kunstsammlungen]] (State Art Museum) houses a remarkable collection of 17th-century Dutch paintings and German art from medieval and renaissance masters up to the present day. There are also a collection of Greek vases, the notable collection of Paintings of Jean-Baptiste Oudry, a collection of sculptures of Houdon, German 18th-century court paintings, and works by such modern artists as [[Max Liebermann]], Franz Stuck, Marcel Duchamp etc. The Graphic cabinet houses rich collections of Dutch and German drawings and prints (Jan van Goyen, D\u00fcrer, Cranach, Rembrandt, Merian) and a notable collection of coloured graphics from the time of the GDR.\n* The [[State Museum of Technology]] (''Technische Museum''), housed in the former ''Marstall'' (Royal Stables). In 2012 the Technische Museum moved to the city of Wismar located 40&nbsp;km north of Schwerin.\n\n== Crime rate ==\nAccording to the official 2007 Crime Report for Germany, Schwerin was the only German city with a crime rate over 17,000 total offenses committed per 100,000 inhabitants;<ref>[http://www.bmi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Broschueren/2008/Polizeiliche_Kriminalstatistik_2007_de.pdf?__blob=publicationFile Official Police Report for Germany], cf. p. 17.</ref> thus being 1st in the list of Germany's most dangerous cities. The larger cities, such as [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], or [[Bremen]], all have crime rates ranging from 14,000 to 16,000 total offenses committed per 100,000 people. However, Schwerin is the only city where riding a bus (or tram) without a ticket and social security fraud is counted towards the crime rate, significantly boosting the

cities and towns in Germany|second-largest city]] of the northeastern [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. It has a population of about 100,000.<ref>http://www.svz.de/lokales/zeitung-fuer-die-landeshauptstadt/eine-wachsende-grossstadt-id14346686.html</ref>\n\nSchwerin was first mentioned in 1018 as ''Wendenburg'' and was granted [[town privileges|city rights]] in 1160 by [[Henry the Lion]], thus it is the [[List of cities in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|oldest city of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. It is globally known for its [[Romanticism|romantic]] [[Schwerin Palace]], situated on an island in [[Lake Schwerin]]. The palace was one of the main residences of the [[List of rulers of Mecklenburg|dukes and grand dukes of Mecklenburg]] until 1918 and is the official seat of the [[Landtag of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|state parliament]] since 1990. The city also has a largely intact [[Altstadt|old town]], thanks to only minor damage in World War II.\n\nSchwerin is located within the [[Hamburg Metropolitan Region]] and close to [[Berlin/Brandenburg Metropolitan Region]], and to nearby [[regiopolis]]es of [[Rostock]] and [[L\u00fcbeck]]. Major industries and employers include high technology, machine building, healthcare, government agencies, railway supply, consumer goods and tourism. Schwerin has three academic colleges, the FHM, HdBA and the Design School.\n\n==History==\n===Early years===\nSchwerin is enclosed by lakes. The largest of these lakes, the ''[[Lake Schwerin|Schweriner See]]'', has an area of 60&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In the middle part of these lakes there was a settlement of the Slavic [[Obotrites|Obotrite]] (dated back to the 11th century). The area was called ''Zuarin'' ([[Polabian language|Polabian]] ''Zwierzyn''), and the name Schwerin is derived from that designation. In 1160, [[Henry the Lion]] defeated the Obotrites and captured Schwerin. The town was later expanded into a powerful regional centre. A castle was built on this site, and expanded to become a ducal palace. It is supposedly haunted by the small, impious ghost, called [[Peterm\u00e4nnchen]] (''\"Peterman\"'').\n\nIn 1358, Schwerin became a part of the Duchy of [[Mecklenburg]], making it the seat of the duchy from then on. About 1500, the construction of the Schwerin Palace began, as a residence for the dukes. After the division of Mecklenburg (1621), Schwerin became the capital of the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]]. Between 1765 and 1837, the town of [[Ludwigslust]] served as the capital, until Schwerin was reinstated.\n\n===Recent times===\nIn the mid-1800s, many residents from Schwerin moved to the United States, many to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]. Today Milwaukee and Schwerin are sister cities. After 1918, and during the [[German Revolution]], resulting in the fall of all the [[German monarchies]], the Grand Duke abdicated. Schwerin became capital of the Free State of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern thereafter.\n\nAt the end of [[World War II]], on 2 May 1945, Schwerin was taken by United States troops. It was turned over to the British on 1 June 1945, and one month later, on 1 July 1945,<ref>Some evidence{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} calls into doubt the date on which the British withdrew to the predesignated occupation zone. Local residents claim that the British forces did not relinquish control of Schwerin until later in the year, probably November, following a brief artillery exchange across lake Schwerin between the British and the Soviets. Allegedly there were no deaths.</ref> it was handed over to the Soviet forces, as the British and American forces pulled back from the [[line of contact]] to the predesignated occupation zones.\n\nSchwerin was then in the Soviet Occupation Zone which was to become the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] (GDR). Initially, it was the capital of the State of Mecklenburg which at that time included the western part of [[Pomerania]] ([[Vorpommern]]). After the states were dissolved in the GDR, in 1952, Schwerin served as the capital of the Schwerin district (Bezirk Schwerin).\n \nAfter reunification in 1990, the former state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern was recreated as one of the ''[[States of Germany|Bundesl\u00e4nder]]''. [[Rostock]] was a serious contender for state capital but the decision went in favour of Schwerin.\n\n== Geography ==\nThe urban area of Schwerin is divided into 18 local districts,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.schwerin.de/kultur-tourismus/stadtportrait/stadtteile/|title=Stadtteile|website=www.schwerin.de|language=de|access-date=2017-07-26}}</ref> each with a local council. The districts consist of one or more districts.

The larger cities, such as [[Berlin]], [[Frankfurt am Main]], or [[Bremen]], all have crime rates ranging from 14,000 to 16,000 total offenses committed per 100,000 people. However, Schwerin is the only city where riding a bus (or tram) without a ticket and social security fraud is counted towards the crime rate, significantly boosting the
