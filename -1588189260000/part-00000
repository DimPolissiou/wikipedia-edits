For example, an organization may have ten people who can perform the role of ''project manager'', although traditionally each project only has one project manager at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of ''project manager'' may also be able to perform the role of ''business analyst'' and ''tester''.\n\n;''R = Responsible'' (also ''Recommender'')\n: Those who do the work to complete the task.<ref name=\"pmiforum\">{{cite book |last1= Smith |first1= Michael |last2=Erwin |first2=James |title = Role & Responsibility Charting (RACI) | publisher= Project Management Forum | year= 2005 | page= 5 | url = https://pmicie.org/images/downloads/raci_r_web3_1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822181406/https://pmicie.org/images/downloads/raci_r_web3_1.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2018}}</ref> There is at least one role with a participation type of ''responsible'', although others can be delegated to assist in the work required (see also ''RASCI'' below for separately identifying those who participate in a supporting role).\n\n;''A = Accountable'' (also ''Approver'' or ''final approving authority'')\n: The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, the one who ensures the prerequisites of the task are met and who delegates the work to those ''responsible''.<ref name=\"pmiforum\" /> In other words, an ''accountable'' must sign off (approve) work that ''responsible'' provides.

Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types.

Specifying that a resource does not participate can be as beneficial to a task's completion as specifying those who do participate.\n\n=== DACI ===\n:Another version that has been used to centralize decision making, and clarify who can re-open discussions.<ref>{{cite book |last= Kendrick |first= Tom |title= Results without authority: controlling a project when the team doesn't report to you |publisher= AMACOM Books, division of the American Management Association |year= 2006 |page= [https://archive.org/details/resultswithoutau00tomk/page/106 106] |isbn= 0-8144-7343-1 |url= https://archive.org/details/resultswithoutau00tomk/page/106 }}</ref>\n\n:; ''Driver''\n:: A single ''driver'' of overall project like the person steering a car.\n\n:; ''Approver''\n:: One or more ''approver''s who make most project decisions, and are responsible if it fails.\n\n:; ''Contributors''\n:: Are the worker-bees who are responsible for deliverables; and with whom there is two-way communication.\n\n:; ''Informed''\n:: Those who are impacted by the project and are provided status and informed of decisions; and with whom there is one-way communication.\n\n=== RAPID ===\n:Another tool used to clarify decision roles and thereby improve decision making, is '''RAPID''', which was created by and is a registered trademark of [[Bain & Company]].\n\n:; ''Recommend''\n:: The ''Recommend'' role typically involves 80 percent of the work in a decision. The recommender gathers relevant input and proposes a course of action\u2014sometimes alternative courses, complete with pros and cons so that the decision maker's choices are as clear, simple and timely as possible.\n\n:; ''Agree''\n:: The ''Agree'' role represents a formal approval of a recommendation. The 'A' and the 'R' should work together to come to a mutually satisfactory proposal to bring forward to the Decider. But not all decisions will need an Agree role, as this is typically reserved for those situations where some form of regulatory or compliance sign-off is required.\n\n:; ''Perform''\n:: The ''Perform'' role defines who is accountable for executing or implementing the decision once it is made. Best-practice companies typically define P's and gather input from them early in the process\n\n:; ''Input''\n:: The ''Input'' role provides relevant information and facts so that the Recommender and Decider can assess all the relevant facts to make the right decision. However, the 'I' role is strictly advisory. Recommenders should consider all input, but they don't have to reflect every point of view in the final recommendation.\n\n:; ''Decide''\n:: The ''Decide'' role is for the single person who ultimately is accountable for making the final decision, committing the group to action and ensuring the decision gets implemented.\n\n=== RATSI ===\n:Another tool used in organization design or roles analysis.\n\n:; ''Responsibility''\n:: Identify who is in charge of making sure the work is done.\n\n:; ''Authority''\n:: Identify who has final decision power on the work.\n\n:; ''Task''\n:: Identify who actually does the work.\n\n:; ''Support''\n:: Identify who is involved to provide support to the work.\n\n:; ''Informed''\n:: Identify who is informed that the work has been done (or will be started)\n\n=== DRASCI ===\n:A variant of RASCI developed by three Whitehall theorists (Kane, Jackson, Gilbert). This scheme is adapted for use in matrix management environments, and differs only from RASCI in having an additional role of ''Driver'' and a narrower definition of ''Support'':\n\n:; ''Driver''\n:: An individual or party that assists those who are ''Responsible'' for delivering a task by both producing supporting collateral and setting timescales for delivery in line with the overarching aim of the individual or party who is ''Accountable'' for the overall accomplishment of the objective. The distinction between ''Driver'' and ''Support'' lies in that the former reinforces and clarifies the parameters of the task on behalf of those who are ''Accountable'', while the latter refers to those who help those who are ''Responsible'' in reaching a given goal.\n\n=== PDQA ===\n: A version developed at U Tokyo and MIT for model-based project management.  The PDQA set of roles corresponds to demand for capabilities of teams. Roles include those for work on scope, handling of dependencies as coordination, and exception handling through error detection and decisions across a project organization.

For example, an organization may have ten people who can perform the role of ''project manager'', although traditionally each project only has one project manager at any one time; and a person who is able to perform the role of ''project manager'' may also be able to perform the role of ''business analyst'' and ''tester''.\n\n;''R = Responsible'' (also ''Recommender'')\n: Those who do the work to complete the task.<ref name=\"pmiforum\">{{cite book |last1= Smith |first1= Michael |last2=Erwin |first2=James |title = Role & Responsibility Charting (RACI) | publisher= Project Management Forum | year= 2005 | page= 5 | url = https://pmicie.org/images/downloads/raci_r_web3_1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180822181406/https://pmicie.org/images/downloads/raci_r_web3_1.pdf |archivedate=22 August 2018}}</ref> There is at least one role with a participation type of ''responsible'', although others can be delegated to assist in the work required (see also ''RASCI'' below for separately identifying those who participate in a supporting role).\n\n;''A = Accountable'' (also ''Approver'' or ''final approving authority'')\n: The one ultimately answerable for the correct and thorough completion of the deliverable or task, the one who ensures the prerequisites of the task are met and who delegates the work to those ''responsible''.<ref name=\"pmiforum\" /> In other words, an ''accountable'' must sign off (approve) work that ''responsible'' provides.

Outside of this exception, it is generally recommended that each role in the project or process for each task receive, at most, just one of the participation types.

He or she has a right of veto; his or her advice is binding.\n\n:; ''Suggest''\n:\n:: The person/function consulted to give advice based upon recognized expertise. The advice is non-binding.\n\n:; ''Informed''\n:\n:: The person/function who must be informed of the result of the activity.\n\n=== RASCI or RASIC ===\n:This is an expanded version<ref>{{cite book |last= Hightower |first= Rose |title= Internal controls policies and procedures |publisher= John Wiley & Sons |year= 2008 |page= 83 | isbn= 0-470-28717-9}}</ref> of the standard RACI, less frequently known as ''RASCI'',<ref>{{cite book |last= Baker |first= Dean |title= Multi-Company Project Management: Maximizing Business Results Through Strategic Collaboration |publisher= J Ross | year = 2009 |page= 58 |isbn= 1-60427-035-7}}</ref> breaking the ''responsible'' participation into:\n\n:; ''Responsible''\n:\n::Those responsible for the task, who ensure that it is done as per the ''approver''\n\n:; ''Support''\n:: Resources allocated to ''responsible''.

The recommender gathers relevant input and proposes a course of action\u2014sometimes alternative courses, complete with pros and cons so that the decision maker's choices are as clear, simple and timely as possible.\n\n:; ''Agree''\n:: The ''Agree'' role represents a formal approval of a recommendation. The 'A' and the 'R' should work together to come to a mutually satisfactory proposal to bring forward to the Decider. But not all decisions will need an Agree role, as this is typically reserved for those situations where some form of regulatory or compliance sign-off is required.\n\n:; ''Perform''\n:: The ''Perform'' role defines who is accountable for executing or implementing the decision once it is made. Best-practice companies typically define P's and gather input from them early in the process\n\n:; ''Input''\n:: The ''Input'' role provides relevant information and facts so that the Recommender and Decider can assess all the relevant facts to make the right decision. However, the 'I' role is strictly advisory. Recommenders should consider all input, but they don't have to reflect every point of view in the final recommendation.\n\n:; ''Decide''\n:: The ''Decide'' role is for the single person who ultimately is accountable for making the final decision, committing the group to action and ensuring the decision gets implemented.\n\n=== RATSI ===\n:Another tool used in organization design or roles analysis.\n\n:; ''Responsibility''\n:: Identify who is in charge of making sure the work is done.\n\n:; ''Authority''\n:: Identify who has final decision power on the work.\n\n:; ''Task''\n:: Identify who actually does the work.\n\n:; ''Support''\n:: Identify who is involved to provide support to the work.\n\n:; ''Informed''\n:: Identify who is informed that the work has been done (or will be started)\n\n=== DRASCI ===\n:A variant of RASCI developed by three Whitehall theorists (Kane, Jackson, Gilbert). This scheme is adapted for use in matrix management environments, and differs only from RASCI in having an additional role of ''Driver'' and a narrower definition of ''Support'':\n\n:; ''Driver''\n:: An individual or party that assists those who are ''Responsible'' for delivering a task by both producing supporting collateral and setting timescales for delivery in line with the overarching aim of the individual or party who is ''Accountable'' for the overall accomplishment of the objective. The distinction between ''Driver'' and ''Support'' lies in that the former reinforces and clarifies the parameters of the task on behalf of those who are ''Accountable'', while the latter refers to those who help those who are ''Responsible'' in reaching a given goal.\n\n=== PDQA ===\n: A version developed at U Tokyo and MIT for model-based project management.  The PDQA set of roles corresponds to demand for capabilities of teams. Roles include those for work on scope, handling of dependencies as coordination, and exception handling through error detection and decisions across a project organization.  PDQA is used in agent based modeling to simulate the supply of these capabilities by teams in projects.<ref> Moser, B. R., & Wood, R. T. (2015). Design of Complex Programs as Sociotechnical Systems.

The game is played in rounds; each round begins with a four-player minigame, the results of which determine how many spaces each player moves forward on the board. Each tile on the board also has an effect. These include moving forward/going backward some number of steps, stealing/losing/gaining tokens, playing a single/two-player/free-for-all minigame, the ability to spend earned tokens, and a raffle game to earn redemption tickets with cherry, orange, or banana raffle tickets. When on a \"store\" tile, the player can spend tokens to move steps forward, move others backward, buy raffle tickets, multiply the amount of spaces moved next turn, or gamble to earn more tokens.\n\nThe three spaces before the goal space are special raffle spaces (cherry, orange, and banana, respectively). In addition to functioning as a raffle space for the first player that reaches them (and as a token space thereafter), a player must place a certain rank or better in a minigame (3rd, 2nd, and 1st, for the cherry, orange, and banana tiles, respectively) in order to progress to the next space while on these tiles. If a player attains 1st place in a minigame while on the banana space, they advance to the goal space.\n\nOnce a player has reached the end, the game is over and players will receive redemption tickets based on how far they got on the board. These can then be used to buy each minigame separately, which can be played in short tournaments outside the main game.

{"title_page": "Bl\u00e5vandshuk", "text_new": "{{no footnotes|date=March 2013}}\n[[File:Skallingen.jpeg|thumb|right|]]\n\n'''Bl\u00e5vandshuk''' is a headland on the [[North Sea]] coast of [[Jutland]] northwest of [[Esbjerg]], and is the westernmost point of metropolitan [[Denmark]]. The [[Bl\u00e5vand Lighthouse]] is the westernmost located building in Denmark.\n\nBefore January 1, 2007, Bl\u00e5vandshuk was also the name of a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') that contained the headland. The municipality covered an area of 223&nbsp;km\u00b2, and had a total population of 4,378 (2005).  Its latest mayor was Hans Chr. Thoning, a member of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Liberal Party) [[Politics of Denmark|political party]]. The main town and site of its municipal council was the town of Oksb\u00f8l.\n\nBecause Bl\u00e5vandshuk is on the coast and has a [[peninsula]] (''Skallingen'') which stretches to the southeast, it is surrounded by much water.  To the northwest is the [[North Sea]].  To the southeast of ''Skallingen'' is Fan\u00f8 Bay (''Fan\u00f8 Bugt'') and the island [[Fan\u00f8]].  Beyond Fan\u00f8 Bay is the [[Wadden Sea]].  To the northeast of ''Skallingen'' lies Ho Bay (''Ho Bugt'') and the small island of [[Langli (island)|Langli]].\n\n''Skallingen'' and the waters off its coast are protected, a part of the Wadden Sea wildlife reserve and protection area being discussed as a potential [[national park]].  Located on ''Skallingen''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s southwestern coast is Denmark's last [[land mine|minefield]], left over from [[World War II|Second World War]], when 1,389,289 landmines were placed in Denmark by the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation forces]] as part of their [[Defense (military)|defence line]].

The [[Bl\u00e5vand Lighthouse]] is the westernmost located building in Denmark.\n\nBefore January 1, 2007, Bl\u00e5vandshuk was also the name of a municipality ([[Danish language|Danish]], ''[[Commune (subnational entity)|kommune]]'') that contained the headland. The municipality covered an area of 223&nbsp;km\u00b2, and had a total population of 4,378 (2005).  Its latest mayor was Hans Chr. Thoning, a member of the [[Venstre (Denmark)|Venstre]] (Liberal Party) [[Politics of Denmark|political party]]. The main town and site of its municipal council was the town of Oksb\u00f8l.\n\nBecause Bl\u00e5vandshuk is on the coast and has a [[peninsula]] (''Skallingen'') which stretches to the southeast, it is surrounded by much water.  To the northwest is the [[North Sea]].  To the southeast of ''Skallingen'' is Fan\u00f8 Bay (''Fan\u00f8 Bugt'') and the island [[Fan\u00f8]].  Beyond Fan\u00f8 Bay is the [[Wadden Sea]].  To the northeast of ''Skallingen'' lies Ho Bay (''Ho Bugt'') and the small island of [[Langli (island)|Langli]].\n\n''Skallingen'' and the waters off its coast are protected, a part of the Wadden Sea wildlife reserve and protection area being discussed as a potential [[national park]].  Located on ''Skallingen''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s southwestern coast is Denmark's last [[land mine|minefield]], left over from [[World War II|Second World War]], when 1,389,289 landmines were placed in Denmark by the [[Occupation of Denmark|German occupation forces]] as part of their [[Defense (military)|defence line]]. Approximately 10,000 of these mines, two-thirds of which are anti-personnel mines, remain in a closed-off area on the peninsula. Demining efforts are hampered by the shifting sands that can bury mines several meters underground, and the drift of the sea which has moved the beach some 200 meters to the east since the end of the war.
