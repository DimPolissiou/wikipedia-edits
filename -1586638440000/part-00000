Shocker began his career in the [[Border League (baseball)|Border League]] where he played as a catcher.<ref name=\"Trachtenberg, Leo pp.88\">[[#Trac95|Trachtenberg, Leo]], pp. 88</ref> In 1913, when he played for the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] team in the [[Border League (baseball)|Border League]], he broke one of his fingers on his right hand; when the finger healed it became hooked which allowed him to throw a breaking ball as well as his spitter.<ref name=\"Trachtenberg, Leo pp.88\" /> As a prelude to his major league career, Shocker was demoted by the Yankees for seasoning and improvement, and he spent most of the 1916 season playing for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)]] in the [[International League]], where he posted a marvelous 15\u20133 record and strung together 54 consecutive scoreless innings. His scoreless inning streak and 1.31 ERA for the campaign both still stand as International League records. He was called up by the Yankees and played with them through the 1917 season. That winter, [[Miller Huggins]] engineered a trade of Shocker to the Browns which he very much came to regret. However, Shocker rejoined Huggins and the Yankees in 1925. In March of 1918 his draft number came up and he reported for service on May 31 of that year.<ref name=\"Huhn, Rick pp.69\">[[#Huhn07|Huhn, David]], pp. 69</ref><ref name=\"Faber, Charles pp.68\">[[#Fab14|Faber, Charles]], pp. 68</ref>. After he served overseas he returned to the Browns in April 1919.<ref name=\"Faber, Charles pp.68\"/>\n\nThe right-handed hurler had four consecutive 20-win seasons with the Browns in the early 1920s, during which he was one of the dominant pitchers in baseball. Urban was the last Yankees pitcher to legally throw a [[spitball]], as he and a handful of other pitchers were grandfathered to continue the practice after it was banned by baseball in 1920.\n\nShocker lived with a heart condition so severe some books say he had to sleep either sitting or standing up. By the early fall of 1927, he was too ill to maintain his place in the starting lineup.\n\nHis career totals for 412 [[games]] include a 187\u2013117 record, a .615 [[winning percentage]], 317 [[games started]], 200 [[complete games]], 28 [[shutouts]], 72 [[games finished]], 25 [[save (baseball)|save]]s, and an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 3.17 in 2,681.2 [[innings pitched]]. He compiled a career .209 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (167-798) with 89 [[runs scored]] and 70 [[RBI]]. He was a good fielding pitcher in his era, committing only 15 errors in 769 [[total chances]] for a .980 [[fielding percentage]].\n\nAfter his release from the Yankees in 1928, Shocker entered an exhibition tournament in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]].

He played in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) for the [[New York Yankees]] and [[History of the St. Louis Browns|St. Louis Browns]] between 1916 and 1928.<ref name=\"sabr\">{{sabrbio|b63431c6|Joseph Wancho|October 30, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Complete\">{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/players/s/shockur01.shtml|title=Urban Shocker Statistics and History|accessdate=October 30, 2019|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]}}</ref>\n\nShocker, known as one of the last legal [[spitball]] pitchers, led the [[American League]] (AL) - and set the Browns record - in 1921 with 27 wins, and won at least 20 games 4 seasons in a row from 1920 to 1923.<ref name=\"Complete\"/> At the time of his retirement he was the Browns all time leader in wins with 126 and shutouts with 23.<ref name=\"Orioles Team Pitching Records\">{{citeweb|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/BAL/leaders_pitch.shtml|work=[[Baseball-Reference.com]]|title=Baltimore Orioles Pitching Career Records|accessdate=October 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nShocker was born in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] to Anna and William Shockor<ref name=\"sabr\"/> and relocated to [[Michigan]] some time later. Shocker began his career in the [[Border League (baseball)|Border League]] where he played as a catcher.<ref name=\"Trachtenberg, Leo pp.88\">[[#Trac95|Trachtenberg, Leo]], pp. 88</ref> In 1913, when he played for the [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] team in the [[Border League (baseball)|Border League]], he broke one of his fingers on his right hand; when the finger healed it became hooked which allowed him to throw a breaking ball as well as his spitter.<ref name=\"Trachtenberg, Leo pp.88\"/> As a prelude to his major league career, Shocker was demoted by the Yankees for seasoning and improvement, and he spent most of the 1916 season playing for the [[Toronto Maple Leafs (International League)]] in the [[International League]], where he posted a marvelous 15\u20133 record and strung together 54 consecutive scoreless innings. His scoreless inning streak and 1.31 ERA for the campaign both still stand as International League records. He was called up by the Yankees and played with them through the 1917 season. That winter, [[Miller Huggins]] engineered a trade of Shocker to the Browns which he very much came to regret. However, Shocker rejoined Huggins and the Yankees in 1925. In March of 1918 his draft number came up and he reported for service on May 31 of that year.<ref name=\"Huhn, Rick pp.69\">[[#Huhn07|Huhn, David]], pp. 69</ref><ref name=\"Faber, Charles pp.68\">[[#Fab14|Faber, Charles]], pp. 68</ref>. After he served overseas he returned to the Browns in April 1919.<ref name=\"Faber, Charles pp.68\"/>\n\nThe right-handed hurler had four consecutive 20-win seasons with the Browns in the early 1920s, during which he was one of the dominant pitchers in baseball. Urban was the last Yankees pitcher to legally throw a [[spitball]], as he and a handful of other pitchers were grandfathered to continue the practice after it was banned by baseball in 1920.\n\nShocker lived with a heart condition so severe some books say he had to sleep either sitting or standing up. By the early fall of 1927, he was too ill to maintain his place in the starting lineup.\n\nHis career totals for 412 [[games]] include a 187\u2013117 record, a .615 [[winning percentage]], 317 [[games started]], 200 [[complete games]], 28 [[shutouts]], 72 [[games finished]], 25 [[save (baseball)|save]]s, and an [[Earned run average|ERA]] of 3.17 in 2,681.2 [[innings pitched]]. He compiled a career .209 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] (167-798) with 89 [[runs scored]] and 70 [[RBI]]. He was a good fielding pitcher in his era, committing only 15 errors in 769 [[total chances]] for a .980 [[fielding percentage]].\n\nAfter his release from the Yankees in 1928, Shocker entered an exhibition tournament in [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]]. He pitched in one game on August 6, 1928 against a team from [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] and fared poorly in that outing.\n\nAround this time, he contracted [[pneumonia]] and was hospitalized shortly thereafter. On September 9, 1928 Shocker died in Denver as the result of heart failure exacerbated by the disease.<ref>{{citenews|url=https://bklyn.newspapers.com/image/58006731/?terms=urban%2Bshocker|title=Urban Shocker, Old Yanks Star, Dies in Denver|newspaper=[[The Brooklyn Eagle]]|date=September 10, 1928|accessdate=October 30, 2019|page=24}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual saves leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual strikeout leaders]]\n* [[List of Major League Baseball annual wins leaders]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n*{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AVNfBgAAQBAJ&newbks=1&source=gbs_navlinks_s|title=Spitballers: The Last Legal Hurlers of the Wet One|last=Faber|first=Charles|year=2014|isbn=9780786482627|publisher=McFarland|accessdate=October 30, 2019|ref=Fab14}}\n* {{citebook|last=Huhn|first=Rick|title=The Sizzler: George Sisler, Baseball's Forgotten Great|year=2013|publisher=University of Missouri Press|isbn=0826264212|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bgqf8L3RMhYC&newbks=1&newbks|ref=Huhn07}}\n* {{citebook|last=Spatz|first=Lyle|title=1921: The Yankees, the Giants, and the Battle for Baseball Supremacy in New York|year=2010|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn= 9780803229945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULK-Fz_irbAC&source=gbs_navlinks_s|ref=Spat10}}\n* {{citebook|last=Trachtenberg|first=Leo|title=The Wonder Team: The True Story of the Incomparable 1927 New York Yankees|year=1995|publisher=Popular Press|isbn= 9780879726782 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6phOhlHUH8kC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&hl=en|ref=Trac95}}\n\n\n\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Urban Shocker}}\n{{Baseballstats |mlb=|espn=|br=s/shockur01|fangraphs=1011918|brm=shocke001urb}}\n*{{Findagrave}}\n\n{{1927 New York Yankees}}\n{{New York Yankees Opening Day starting pitchers}}\n{{AL wins champions}}\n{{AL strikeout champions}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shocker, Urban}}\n[[Category:1890 births]]\n[[Category:1928 deaths]]\n[[Category:Major League Baseball pitchers]]\n[[Category:New York Yankees players]]\n[[Category:St. Louis Browns players]]\n[[Category:Baseball players from Ohio]]\n[[Category:Windsor (minor league baseball) players]]\n[[Category:Ottawa Senators (baseball) players]]\n[[Category:Toronto Maple Leafs (International League) players]]\n[[Category:American League strikeout champions]]\n[[Category:American League wins champions]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Cleveland]]\n[[Category:Deaths from pneumonia]]\n[[Category:Infectious disease deaths in Colorado]]\n", "name_user": "Jprg1966", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_Shocker"}
