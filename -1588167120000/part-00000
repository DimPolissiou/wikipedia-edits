It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''. While the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), sought to \"short-circuit\" a developing \"bureaucracy of analytic reason\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), this book was intended to be a \"positive exercise\" in [[Psychical nomadism|nomadology]] and [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] philosophy<ref name=foreward>{{cite book|author=Brian Massumi|chapter=Translator's Foreword: Pleasures of Philosophy|title=A Thousand Plateaus|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|date=1987|page=xi}}</ref> - philosophy with [[Utilitarianism|utility]] that freely moves between addressed subject matters.\n\nThe book has been considered to be a major statement of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]], especially starting in the late 20th century. [[Brian Massumi]]'s English translation was published in 1987, a year after the twelfth \"plateau\" was published separately in English as ''Nomadology: The War Machine'' (New York: [[Semiotext(e) | Semiotext[e]]], 1986).\n\n== Summary ==\nLike the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), ''A Thousand Plateaus'', as the second volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', is politically and terminologically provocative,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stivale, Charles J.|title=The Literary Element in \"Mille Plateaux\": The New Cartography of Deleuze and Guattari|journal=Substance|volume=13|issue=44\u201345|date=1984|pages=20\u201334|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=3684772|doi=10.2307/3684772}}</ref> but focuses more so on systematic, environmental and spatial philosophy. [[Deleuze and Guattari]] discuss concepts such as the [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]], [[performativity]] in language, smooth and striated [[space]], the state as [[State-space representation|systematic variables]] and as the [[State (polity)|capitalist and centralized]] apparatus, [[face]] and ''faciality'', the [[body without organs]], [[Minority (philosophy)|minority]] languages and literature, [[Branching (linguistics)|binary branching]] structures in language, [[deterritorialization]] and [[reterritorialization]], [[Arborescent|arborescence]], [[pragmatics]], [[Line of flight|lines of flight]], [[assemblage (philosophy)|assemblages]], events of ''becoming'', [[strata (linguistics)|strata]], [[social stratification|stratification]] and destratification, the war machine, [[Semiotics|the signified, signifier and sign]], [[abstract machine| abstract machines]], and [[coding (social sciences)|coding]].<ref name=\"Melehy\">{{cite book |author1=Melehy, Hassan|author2=Deleuze, Gilles |author3=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |pages=589\u2013610|chapter=Index |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>\n\nThe book is written in a non-linear, allusive fashion. The reader is explicitly warned not to set down roots and read ''A Thousand Plateaus'' in order, but to choose a new \"plateau\" or page and begin again \"from ground zero\" at each plateau, as long as they read the introduction first and the conclusion last.<ref name=dg1993 />{{rp|25}}\n\n=== Discussed figures and subjects ===\nIn ''plateaux'' (chapters) of the book, they discuss [[Psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]]s ([[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Carl Jung|Jung]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]&mdash;who trained Guattari,<ref name=\"dg1987\" />{{rp|x}} and [[Melanie Klein]]), composers ([[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin|Chopin]], [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]], [[Wolfgang Mozart|Mozart]], [[Pierre Boulez]], and [[Olivier Messiaen]]), artists ([[Paul Klee|Klee]], [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]], and [[Jackson Pollock|Pollock]]), philosophers ([[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]], [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]], [[Henri Bergson|Bergson]], [[Friederich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Soren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], and [[Gilbert Simondon]]), historians ([[Ibn Khaldun]], [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]], and [[Fernand Braudel]]), and linguists ([[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky]], [[William Labov|Labov]], [[Emile Benveniste|Benveniste]], [[Gustave Guillaume|Guillaume]], [[J.

In between are thirteen chapters or ''plateaux'', each dated non-linearly, sometimes precisely (\"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics), sometimes less so (\"10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals\"). In the sixth chapter, \"Year Zero: Faciality\" (''visag\u00e9it\u00e9''), the notion of face is discussed as an \"overcoding\" of body,<ref name=\"dg1987\"/>{{rp|170}} but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (''paysag\u00e9it\u00e9'').<ref name=\"dg1987\">{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>{{rp|174}}\n\n:Dismantling the face is no mean affair. Madness is a definite danger: Is it by chance that schizos lose their sense of the face, their own and others', their sense of the landscape, and the sense of language and its dominant significations all at the same time?

In \"1874: Three Novellas\", they discuss [[Henry James]]' ''[[In the Cage]]'' (1898) and \"The Story of the Abyss and the Spyglass\" by [[Pierrette Fleutiaux]], but they also evoke [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]]'s essay ''[[The Crack-Up]]'' (1945) (which Deleuze previously discussed in ''[[The Logic of Sense]]''), because as a famous novelist, his depression and frustration in the essay is dramatized.<ref name=dg1993>{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>{{rp|192-207}} The works of [[Franz Kafka]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Henry Miller]], [[D.

Whereas ''Anti-Oedipus'' created binaries such as molar/molecular, paranoid/schizophrenic, and [[deterritorialization]]/[[reterritorialization]], ''A Thousand Plateaus'' shows how such distinctions are operations on the surface of a deeper field with more complicated and multidimensional dynamics.

It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''. While the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), sought to \"short-circuit\" a developing \"bureaucracy of analytic reason\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), this book was intended to be a \"positive exercise\" in [[Psychical nomadism|nomadology]] and [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] philosophy<ref name=foreward>{{cite book|author=Brian Massumi|chapter=Translator's Foreword: Pleasures of Philosophy|title=A Thousand Plateaus|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|date=1987|page=xi}}</ref> - philosophy with [[Utilitarianism|utility]] that freely moves between addressed subject matters.\n\nThe book has been considered to be a major statement of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]], especially starting in the late 20th century. [[Brian Massumi]]'s English translation was published in 1987, a year after the twelfth \"plateau\" was published separately in English as ''Nomadology: The War Machine'' (New York: [[Semiotext(e) | Semiotext[e]]], 1986).\n\n== Summary ==\nLike the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), ''A Thousand Plateaus'', as the second volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', is politically and terminologically provocative,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stivale, Charles J.|title=The Literary Element in \"Mille Plateaux\": The New Cartography of Deleuze and Guattari|journal=Substance|volume=13|issue=44\u201345|date=1984|pages=20\u201334|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=3684772|doi=10.2307/3684772}}</ref> but focuses more so on systematic, environmental and spatial philosophy. [[Deleuze and Guattari]] discuss concepts such as the [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizome]], [[performativity]] in language, smooth and striated [[space]], the state as [[State-space representation|systematic variables]] and as the [[State (polity)|capitalist and centralized]] apparatus, [[face]] and ''faciality'', the [[body without organs]], [[Minority (philosophy)|minority]] languages and literature, [[Branching (linguistics)|binary branching]] structures in language, [[deterritorialization]] and [[reterritorialization]], [[Arborescent|arborescence]], [[pragmatics]], [[Line of flight|lines of flight]], [[assemblage (philosophy)|assemblages]], events of ''becoming'', [[strata (linguistics)|strata]], [[social stratification|stratification]] and destratification, the war machine, [[Semiotics|the signified, signifier and sign]], [[abstract machine| abstract machines]], and [[coding (social sciences)|coding]].<ref name=\"Melehy\">{{cite book |author1=Melehy, Hassan|author2=Deleuze, Gilles |author3=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |pages=589\u2013610|chapter=Index |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>\n\nThe book is written in a non-linear, allusive fashion.

In between are thirteen chapters or ''plateaux'', each dated non-linearly, sometimes precisely (\"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics), sometimes less so (\"10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals\"). In the sixth chapter, \"Year Zero: Faciality\" (''visag\u00e9it\u00e9''), the notion of face is discussed as an \"overcoding\" of body,<ref name=\"dg1987\"/>{{rp|170}} but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (''paysag\u00e9it\u00e9'').<ref name=\"dg1987\">{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>{{rp|174}}\n\n:Dismantling the face is no mean affair.

Nevertheless, the Official Seal of the city was still conceived from the \"''Tabak Ko''\" legend and was officially adopted through Municipal Council Resolution No. 29 on February 23, 1966.\n\n==History==\n\n===Spanish Period===\nAccording to the ''Estado Geografico Estadistico Historico'' written in 1805 by Father De Huerta, the recorded history of the city began in 1587 through the [[missionary work]] of the first [[Franciscan]] Fathers. In 1616, Fr.

Due to the continuous attacks by the [[Moro people|Moro]] raiders, the natives migrated to San Vicente and San Carlos, and started the foundation of the first [[poblacion]] in 1703, while the fishermen of the town transferred to the shores of the bay of what is now known as [[Barangay]] Cormidal. Under the administration of the first town executive, a church was built in Cormidal in 1731. Records on the elected ''Capitan municipal'' (town mayor) started only in 1731 with Martin Aguirre listed as the first mayor of Tabaco.<ref name=\"Fortune\"/>\n\nIn 1811, a terrible [[typhoon]] called Baguiong Oguis or White Typhoon brought havoc to the town. This was followed in 1814 by the most destructive eruption of the [[Mayon Volcano]], which showered the areas with ashes and stone. These two events rendered many residents homeless and left the fields unproductive for many years after. It took a full decade for the people to recover, at which time they built a cemetery and laid the foundation of the present church which was completed in 17 years.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\n===American period and independence===\nThe Americans landed at Tabaco on February 9, 1900, under the command of Col. Walter Howe. Despite the well-documented courage and [[patriotism]] of the Tabaque\u00f1os, the residents of Tabaco, the superior armaments and well-trained soldiers of the [[U.S. Army|American army]] hastened its conquest of Tabaco and adjoining towns, starting the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] in the area.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\nWith the restoration of peace after World War II, the Tabaque\u00f1os started rebuilding their lives and their land. By the time the Philippines gained [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|independence]] in 1946, Tabaco was once again a thriving town.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\n===Other catastrophic events===\nAnother catastrophe to hit the town was [[Typhoon Trix (1952)|Typhoon Trix]] in 1952, which completely submerged Natunawan Island.

Senate Bill No. 2244 was sponsored by Senators [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]] and [[Franklin Drilon]] as its counterpart in the Senate. The Republic Act No. 9020 converted the Municipality of Tabaco into a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component city]] of the Province of Albay. It was signed into law by the president of the Philippines [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on February 5, 2001.

Retrieved on 2012-04-20.</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nIt is not true that Tabaco got its name from \"''Tabak ko''\" which means \"my [[Bolo knife|bolo]]\", but from [[tobacco]] (in Spanish \"''Tabaco''\"), a primary product of the city in the pre-Hispanic period. Nevertheless, the Official Seal of the city was still conceived from the \"''Tabak Ko''\" legend and was officially adopted through Municipal Council Resolution No. 29 on February 23, 1966.\n\n==History==\n\n===Spanish Period===\nAccording to the ''Estado Geografico Estadistico Historico'' written in 1805 by Father De Huerta, the recorded history of the city began in 1587 through the [[missionary work]] of the first [[Franciscan]] Fathers. In 1616, Fr. Pedro De Alcareso became the first permanent parish priest and established a [[parish church|church]] dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]], the [[patron saint]] of the city.<ref name=\"Historical\">[http://www.tabacocity.com.ph/Tourism/LocalHeritage.php \"Historical Tabaco\"]. Tabaco City Official Website. Retrieved on 2012-04-20.</ref>\n\nThe first inhabitants settled along the seashore and engaged in fishing and crude farming. Due to the continuous attacks by the [[Moro people|Moro]] raiders, the natives migrated to San Vicente and San Carlos, and started the foundation of the first [[poblacion]] in 1703, while the fishermen of the town transferred to the shores of the bay of what is now known as [[Barangay]] Cormidal. Under the administration of the first town executive, a church was built in Cormidal in 1731. Records on the elected ''Capitan municipal'' (town mayor) started only in 1731 with Martin Aguirre listed as the first mayor of Tabaco.<ref name=\"Fortune\"/>\n\nIn 1811, a terrible [[typhoon]] called Baguiong Oguis or White Typhoon brought havoc to the town. This was followed in 1814 by the most destructive eruption of the [[Mayon Volcano]], which showered the areas with ashes and stone. These two events rendered many residents homeless and left the fields unproductive for many years after. It took a full decade for the people to recover, at which time they built a cemetery and laid the foundation of the present church which was completed in 17 years.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\n===American period and independence===\nThe Americans landed at Tabaco on February 9, 1900, under the command of Col. Walter Howe. Despite the well-documented courage and [[patriotism]] of the Tabaque\u00f1os, the residents of Tabaco, the superior armaments and well-trained soldiers of the [[U.S. Army|American army]] hastened its conquest of Tabaco and adjoining towns, starting the [[History of the Philippines (1898\u20131946)|American rule]] in the area.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\nWith the restoration of peace after World War II, the Tabaque\u00f1os started rebuilding their lives and their land. By the time the Philippines gained [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|independence]] in 1946, Tabaco was once again a thriving town.<ref name=\"Historical\"/>\n\n===Other catastrophic events===\nAnother catastrophe to hit the town was [[Typhoon Trix (1952)|Typhoon Trix]] in 1952, which completely submerged Natunawan Island. A 1964 fire razed the commercial center, and in 1970, another destructive storm, [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]], slashed through the town.<ref name=\"Fortune\">{{cite web |url=http://oasis.fortunecity.com/acapulco/215/region5/albay/tabaco.htm |title=Tabaco Town, Albay Province, Region V, Philippines |accessdate=17 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020815/http://oasis.fortunecity.com/acapulco/215/region5/albay/tabaco.htm |archivedate=11 July 2011 |df= }}</ref>\n\n===Cityhood===\nThen Representative Krisel Lagman-Luistro introduced House Bill No. 7851, upgrading the municipality of Tabaco into a [[Cities of the Philippines|component city]] of the Province of Albay. Senate Bill No. 2244 was sponsored by Senators [[Sergio Osme\u00f1a III]] and [[Franklin Drilon]] as its counterpart in the Senate. The Republic Act No. 9020 converted the Municipality of Tabaco into a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component city]] of the Province of Albay. It was signed into law by the president of the Philippines [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] on February 5, 2001. The municipality was finally converted into a city after the plebiscite conducted on March 4, 2001.\n\n==Geography==\nThe City of Tabaco is located on the eastern coast of [[Albay]] [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] with an area of {{convert|117.14|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

{"title_page": "Namespace", "text_new": "{{selfref|For the use of namespaces in Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Namespace]].}}\n{{for|a feature of the Linux kernel|Linux namespaces}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''namespace''' is a set of symbols (''names'') that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily [[Identifier|identified]].\n\nNamespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts. As an analogy, consider a system of [[Anthroponymy|naming of people]] where each person has a proper name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just \"Jane\" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the \"global\" namespace of all people, the full name must be used.\n\nProminent examples for namespaces include [[file system]]s, which assign names to files.<ref>{{cite conference\n |first1=Atul \n |last1=Adya \n |first2=William \n |last2=Bolosky \n |first3=Miguel \n |last3=Castro \n |first4=Gerald \n |last4=Cermak \n |first5=Ronnie \n |last5=Chaiken \n |first6=John \n |last6=Douceur \n |first7=Jon \n |last7=Howell \n |first8=Jacob \n |last8=Lorch \n |first9=Marvin \n |last9=Theimer \n |first10=Roger \n |last10=Wattenhofer \n |title=FARSITE: Federated, Available, and Reliable Storage for an Incompletely Trusted Environment \n |conference=Proc.

[[Operating system]]s can partition kernel resources by isolated namespaces to support virtualization [[OS-level virtualisation|containers]].\n\nIn a similar manner, [[Directory (computing)|hierarchical file systems]] organize files in directories. Each directory is a separate namespace, so that the directories \"letters\" and \"invoices\" may both contain a file \"to_jane\".\n\nIn [[computer programming]], namespaces are typically employed for the purpose of grouping symbols and identifiers around a particular functionality and to avoid [[name collision]]s between multiple identifiers that share the same name.\n\nIn networking, the [[Domain Name System]] organizes websites (and other resources) into [[hierarchical namespace]]s.\n\n==Name conflicts==\nElement names are defined by the developer. This often results in a conflict when trying to mix XML documents from different XML applications.\n\nThis XML carries [[HTML table]] information:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"xml\">\n<table>\n    <tr>\n        <td>Apples</td>\n        <td>Oranges</td>\n    </tr>\n</table>\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThis XML carries information about a [[table (furniture)|table]] (i.e. a piece of furniture):\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"xml\">\n<table>\n    <name>African Coffee Table</name>\n    <width>80</width>\n    <length>120</length>\n</table>\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIf these XML fragments were added together, there would be a name conflict.

Or, to access Web-related classes and members, use the System{{Not a typo|.}}Web namespace.}}</ref>\n\nAs a rule, names in a namespace cannot have more than one meaning;  that is, different meanings cannot share the same name in the same namespace. A namespace is also called a [[context (computing)|context]], because the same name in different namespaces can have different meanings, each one appropriate for its namespace.\n\nFollowing are other characteristics of namespaces:\n* Names in the namespace can represent objects as well as [[concept]]s, be the namespace a [[natural language|natural or ethnic language]], a [[constructed language]], the [[technical terminology]] of a profession, a [[dialect]], a [[sociolect]], or an artificial language (e.g., a [[programming language]]).\n* In the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], identifiers that appear in namespaces have a short (local) name and a unique long \"qualified\" name for use outside the namespace.\n* Some compilers (for languages such as [[C++]]) combine namespaces and names for internal use in the compiler in a process called ''[[name mangling]]''.\n\nAs well as its abstract language technical usage as described above, some languages have a specific keyword used for explicit namespace control, amongst other uses. Below is an example of a namespace in C++:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <iostream>\n\n// This is how one brings a name into the current scope.  In this case, it's\n// bringing them into global scope.\nusing std::cout;\nusing std::endl;\n\nnamespace box1 {\n    int box_side = 4;\n}\n\nnamespace box2 {\n    int box_side = 12;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int box_side = 42;\n    cout << box1::box_side << endl;  // Outputs 4.\n    cout << box2::box_side << endl;  // Outputs 12.\n    cout << box_side << endl;  // Outputs 42.\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Computer-science considerations===\nA namespace in computer science (sometimes also called a '''name scope'''), is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique [[identifier]]s or [[symbol]]s (i.e. names). An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace. The same identifier can be independently defined in multiple namespaces. That is, an identifier defined in one namespace may or may not have the same meaning as the same identifier defined in another namespace. Languages that support namespaces specify the rules that determine to which namespace an identifier (not its definition) belongs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/namespace.html |title=A namespace is \"a logical grouping of the names used within a program.\"| publisher=Webopedia.com| date=| accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThis concept can be illustrated with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign ID numbers to their employees. X should not have two employees with the same ID number, and likewise for Y; but it is not a problem for the same ID number to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the ID number is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.\n\nIn large [[computer program]]s or documents it is common to have hundreds or thousands of identifiers. Namespaces (or a similar technique, see [[#Emulating namespaces|Emulating namespaces]]) provide a mechanism for hiding local identifiers. They provide a means of grouping logically related identifiers into corresponding namespaces, thereby making the system more [[modularity (programming)|modular]].\n\n[[Data storage device]]s and many modern [[programming language]]s support namespaces. Storage devices use directories (or folders) as namespaces. This allows two files with the same name to be stored on the device so long as they are stored in different directories. In some programming languages (e.g. [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), the identifiers naming namespaces are themselves associated with an enclosing namespace. Thus, in these languages namespaces can nest, forming a namespace [[tree (data structure)|tree]]. At the root of this tree is the unnamed '''global namespace'''.\n\n====Use in common languages====\n;C++\nIn [[C++]], a namespace is defined with a namespace block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/ |title=Namespaces allow to group entities like classes, objects and functions under a name. |publisher=Cplusplus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nnamespace abc {\n    int bar;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nWithin this block, identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared. Outside of this block, the namespace specifier must be prefixed. For example, outside of <code>namespace abc</code>, <code>bar</code> must be written <code>abc::bar</code> to be accessed. C++ includes another construct that makes this verbosity unnecessary. By adding the line\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nusing namespace abc;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nto a piece of code, the prefix <code>abc::</code> is no longer needed.\n\nIdentifiers that are not explicitly declared within a namespace are considered to be in the global namespace.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nint foo;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThese identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared, or, since the global namespace is unnamed, the namespace specifier <code>::</code> can be prefixed. For example, <code>foo</code> can also be written <code>::foo</code>.\n\nNamespace resolution in C++ is hierarchical. This means that within the hypothetical namespace <code>food::soup</code>, the identifier <code>chicken</code> refers to <code>food::soup::chicken</code>. If <code>food::soup::chicken</code> doesn't exist, it then refers to <code>food::chicken</code>. If neither <code>food::soup::chicken</code> nor <code>food::chicken</code> exist, <code>chicken</code> refers to <code>::chicken</code>, an identifier in the global namespace.\n\nNamespaces in C++ are most often used to avoid [[naming collision]]s. Although namespaces are used extensively in recent C++ code, most older code does not use this facility because it did not exist in early versions of the language. For example, the entire [[C++ Standard Library]] is defined within <code>namespace std</code>, but before standardization many components were originally in the global namespace. A programmer can insert the <code>using</code> directive to bypass namespace resolution requirements and obtain backwards compatibility with older code that expects all identifiers to be in the global namespace. However the use of the <code>using</code> directive for reasons other than backwards compatibility (e.g., convenience) is considered to be against good code practices.\n\n;Java\nIn [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the idea of a namespace is embodied in [[Java package]]s. All code belongs to a package, although that package need not be explicitly named. Code from other packages is accessed by prefixing the package name before the appropriate identifier, for example <code>class String</code> in <code>package [[java.lang]]</code> can be referred to as <code>java.lang.String</code> (this is known as the [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]]). Like C++, Java offers a construct that makes it unnecessary to type the package name (<code>import</code>). However, certain features (such as [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]]) require the programmer to use the fully qualified name.\n\nUnlike C++, namespaces in Java are not hierarchical as far as the syntax of the language is concerned. However, packages are named in a hierarchical manner. For example, all packages beginning with <code>java</code> are a part of the [[Java platform]]\u2014the package {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.lang|java/lang}} contains classes core to the language, and {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.lang.reflect|java/lang/reflect}} contains core classes specifically relating to reflection.\n\nIn Java (and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and others), namespaces/packages express semantic categories of code. For example, in C#, <code>namespace System</code> contains code provided by the system (the [[.NET Framework]]). How specific these categories are and how deep the hierarchies go differ from language to language.\n\n[[function (programming)|Function]] and [[class (computer science)|class]] [[scope (programming)|scope]]s can be viewed as implicit namespaces that are inextricably linked with visibility, accessibility, and [[object lifetime]].\n\n;C#\nNamespaces are heavily used in C# language. All .NET Framework classes are organized in namespaces, to be used more clearly and to avoid chaos. Furthermore, custom namespaces are extensively used by programmers, both to organize their work and to avoid [[naming collision]]s.\nWhen referencing a class, one should specify either its fully qualified name, which means namespace followed by the class name,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nSystem.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\nint i = System.Convert.ToInt32(\"123\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nor add a '''using''' statement. This, eliminates the need to mention the complete name of all classes in that namespace.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nusing System;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\nint i = Convert.ToInt32(\"123\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above examples, '''System''' is a namespace, and '''Console''' and '''Convert''' are classes defined within '''System'''.\n\n;Python\nIn [[Python (programming language)|Python]], namespaces are defined by the individual modules, and since modules can be contained in hierarchical packages, then namespaces are hierarchical too.<ref>{{cite web|title=6. Modules|url=https://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html|work=The Python Tutorial|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces |title=Python Scopes and Namespaces |publisher=Docs.python.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\nIn general when a module is imported then the names defined in the module are defined via that module's namespace, and are accessed in from the calling modules by using the fully qualified name.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# assume module a defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : class1\nimport modulea\n\nmodulea.func1()\nmodulea.func2()\na = modulea.class1()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe <code>from ... import ...</code> statement can be used to insert the relevant names directly into the calling module's namespace, and those names can be accessed from the calling module without the qualified name:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# assume modulea defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : class1\nfrom modulea import func1\n\nfunc1()\nfunc2() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name modulea.func2()\na = class1() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name modulea.class1()\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSince this directly imports names (without qualification) it can overwrite existing names with no warnings.\n\nA special form of the statement is <code>from ... import *</code> which imports all names defined in the named package directly in the calling module's namespace. Use of this form of import, although supported within the language, is generally discouraged as it pollutes the namespace of the calling module and will cause already defined names to be overwritten in the case of name clashes.\n\nPython also supports <code>import x as y</code> as a way of providing an alias or alternative name for use by the calling module:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.arange(1000)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n;XML namespace <!-- This section is linked from [[XML]] -->\n{{Main|XML namespace}}\n\nIn [[XML]], the XML namespace specification enables the names of elements and attributes in an XML document to be unique, similar to the role of namespaces in programming languages. Using XML namespaces, XML documents may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary.\n\n;PHP <!-- This section is linked from [[PHP]] -->\nNamespaces were introduced into [[Php|PHP]] from version 5.3 onwards. Naming collision of classes, functions and variables can be avoided.\nIn [[PHP]], a namespace is defined with a namespace block.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\n# File phpstar/foobar.php\n\nnamespace phpstar;\n\n\nclass FooBar {\n\n    public function foo() -> void {\n        echo 'Hello world, from function foo';\n    }\n\n    public function bar() -> void {\n        echo 'Hello world, from function bar';\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nWe can reference a PHP namespace with the following different ways:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\n# File index.php\n\n# Include the file\ninclude \"phpstar/foobar.php\";\n\n# Option 1: directly prefix the class name with the namespace\n$obj_foobar = new \\phpstar\\FooBar();\n\n# Option 2: import the namespace\nuse phpstar\\FooBar;\n$obj_foobar = new FooBar();\n\n# Option 2a: import & alias the namespace\nuse phpstar\\FooBar as FB;\n$obj_foobar = new FB();\n\n# Access the properties and methods with regular way\n$obj_foobar->foo();\n$obj_foobar->bar();\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Emulating namespaces===\nIn programming languages lacking language support for namespaces, namespaces can be emulated to some extent by using an [[identifier naming convention]]. For example, [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries such as [[Libpng]] often use a fixed prefix for all functions and variables that are part of their exposed interface. Libpng exposes identifiers such as:\n\n png_create_write_struct\n png_get_signature\n png_read_row\n png_set_invalid\n\nThis [[naming conventions (programming)|naming convention]] provides reasonable assurance that the [[identifier]]s are unique and can therefore be used in larger programs without [[naming collision]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&seqNum=286 |title=Why I Hate Namespaces |author=Danny Kalev |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709115609/http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&seqNum=286 |archivedate=2016-07-09 }}</ref> Likewise, many packages originally written in [[Fortran]] (e.g., [[BLAS]], [[LAPACK]]) reserve the first few letters of a function's name to indicate which group it belongs to.\n\nThis technique has several drawbacks:\n* It doesn't scale well to nested namespaces; identifiers become excessively long since all uses of the identifiers must be [[fully qualified name|fully namespace-qualified]].\n* Individuals or organizations may use dramatically inconsistent naming conventions, potentially introducing unwanted obfuscation.\n* Compound or \"query-based\" operations on groups of identifiers, based on the namespaces in which they are declared, are rendered unwieldy or unfeasible.\n* In languages with restricted identifier length, the use of prefixes limits the number of characters that can be used to identify what the function does. This is a particular problem for packages originally written in [[Fortran|FORTRAN 77]], which offered only 6 characters per identifier. For example, the name of the [[BLAS]] function <code>DGEMM</code> function indicates that it operates on double-precision numbers (\"D\") and general matrices (\"GE\"), and only the last two characters show what it actually does: matrix-matrix multiplication (the \"MM\").\n\nThere are several advantages:\n* No special software tools are required to locate names in source-code files. A simple program like [[grep]] suffices.\n* There are no namespace name conflicts.\n* There is no need for name-mangling, and thus no potential incompatibility problems.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|namespace}}\n* 11-Digit [[Delivery point]] [[ZIP code]]\n* [[Binomial nomenclature]] (genus-species in [[biology]])\n* [[Chemical nomenclature]]\n* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]]\n* [[Digital object identifier]]\n* [[Domain Name System]]\n* [[Identity (object-oriented programming)]]\n* [[Library of Congress Classification]]\n* [[Star catalogue]]s and [[astronomical naming conventions]]\n* [[XML namespace]]\n* [[Argument-dependent name lookup]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Namespace}}\n[[Category:Naming conventions]]\n", "text_old": "{{selfref|For use in Wikipedia, see [[Wikipedia:Namespace]].}}\n{{for|a feature of the Linux kernel|Linux namespaces}}\n\nIn [[computing]], a '''namespace''' is a set of symbols (''names'') that are used to identify and refer to objects of various kinds. A namespace ensures that all of a given set of objects have unique names so that they can be easily [[Identifier|identified]].\n\nNamespaces are commonly structured as hierarchies to allow reuse of names in different contexts. As an analogy, consider a system of [[Anthroponymy|naming of people]] where each person has a proper name, as well as a family name shared with their relatives. If the first names of family members are unique only within each family, then each person can be uniquely identified by the combination of first name and family name; there is only one Jane Doe, though there may be many Janes. Within the namespace of the Doe family, just \"Jane\" suffices to unambiguously designate this person, while within the \"global\" namespace of all people, the full name must be used.\n\nProminent examples for namespaces include [[file system]]s, which assign names to files.<ref>{{cite conference\n |first1=Atul \n |last1=Adya \n |first2=William \n |last2=Bolosky \n |first3=Miguel \n |last3=Castro \n |first4=Gerald \n |last4=Cermak \n |first5=Ronnie \n |last5=Chaiken \n |first6=John \n |last6=Douceur \n |first7=Jon \n |last7=Howell \n |first8=Jacob \n |last8=Lorch \n |first9=Marvin \n |last9=Theimer \n |first10=Roger \n |last10=Wattenhofer \n |title=FARSITE: Federated, Available, and Reliable Storage for an Incompletely Trusted Environment \n |conference=Proc.

[[Operating system]]s can partition kernel resources by isolated namespaces to support virtualization [[OS-level virtualisation|containers]].\n\nIn a similar manner, [[Directory (computing)|hierarchical file systems]] organize files in directories. Each directory is a separate namespace, so that the directories \"letters\" and \"invoices\" may both contain a file \"to_jane\".\n\nIn [[computer programming]], namespaces are typically employed for the purpose of grouping symbols and identifiers around a particular functionality and to avoid [[name collision]]s between multiple identifiers that share the same name.\n\nIn networking, the [[Domain Name System]] organizes websites (and other resources) into [[hierarchical namespace]]s.\n\n==Name conflicts==\nElement names are defined by the developer.

A namespace is also called a [[context (computing)|context]], because the same name in different namespaces can have different meanings, each one appropriate for its namespace.\n\nFollowing are other characteristics of namespaces:\n* Names in the namespace can represent objects as well as [[concept]]s, be the namespace a [[natural language|natural or ethnic language]], a [[constructed language]], the [[technical terminology]] of a profession, a [[dialect]], a [[sociolect]], or an artificial language (e.g., a [[programming language]]).\n* In the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], identifiers that appear in namespaces have a short (local) name and a unique long \"qualified\" name for use outside the namespace.\n* Some compilers (for languages such as [[C++]]) combine namespaces and names for internal use in the compiler in a process called ''[[name mangling]]''.\n\nAs well as its abstract language technical usage as described above, some languages have a specific keyword used for explicit namespace control, amongst other uses. Below is an example of a namespace in C++:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\n#include <iostream>\n\n// This is how one brings a name into the current scope.  In this case, it's\n// bringing them into global scope.\nusing std::cout;\nusing std::endl;\n\nnamespace box1 {\n    int box_side = 4;\n}\n\nnamespace box2 {\n    int box_side = 12;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int box_side = 42;\n    cout << box1::box_side << endl;  // Outputs 4.\n    cout << box2::box_side << endl;  // Outputs 12.\n    cout << box_side << endl;  // Outputs 42.\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Computer-science considerations===\nA namespace in computer science (sometimes also called a '''name scope'''), is an abstract container or environment created to hold a logical grouping of unique [[identifier]]s or [[symbol]]s (i.e. names). An identifier defined in a namespace is associated only with that namespace. The same identifier can be independently defined in multiple namespaces. That is, an identifier defined in one namespace may or may not have the same meaning as the same identifier defined in another namespace. Languages that support namespaces specify the rules that determine to which namespace an identifier (not its definition) belongs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/N/namespace.html |title=A namespace is \"a logical grouping of the names used within a program.\"| publisher=Webopedia.com| date=| accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n\nThis concept can be illustrated with an analogy. Imagine that two companies, X and Y, each assign ID numbers to their employees. X should not have two employees with the same ID number, and likewise for Y; but it is not a problem for the same ID number to be used at both companies. For example, if Bill works for company X and Jane works for company Y, then it is not a problem for each of them to be employee #123. In this analogy, the ID number is the identifier, and the company serves as the namespace. It does not cause problems for the same identifier to identify a different person in each namespace.\n\nIn large [[computer program]]s or documents it is common to have hundreds or thousands of identifiers. Namespaces (or a similar technique, see [[#Emulating namespaces|Emulating namespaces]]) provide a mechanism for hiding local identifiers. They provide a means of grouping logically related identifiers into corresponding namespaces, thereby making the system more [[modularity (programming)|modular]].\n\n[[Data storage device]]s and many modern [[programming language]]s support namespaces. Storage devices use directories (or folders) as namespaces. This allows two files with the same name to be stored on the device so long as they are stored in different directories. In some programming languages (e.g. [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]]), the identifiers naming namespaces are themselves associated with an enclosing namespace. Thus, in these languages namespaces can nest, forming a namespace [[tree (data structure)|tree]]. At the root of this tree is the unnamed '''global namespace'''.\n\n====Use in common languages====\n;C++\nIn [[C++]], a namespace is defined with a namespace block.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/namespaces/ |title=Namespaces allow to group entities like classes, objects and functions under a name. |publisher=Cplusplus.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nnamespace abc {\n    int bar;\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nWithin this block, identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared. Outside of this block, the namespace specifier must be prefixed. For example, outside of <code>namespace abc</code>, <code>bar</code> must be written <code>abc::bar</code> to be accessed. C++ includes another construct that makes this verbosity unnecessary. By adding the line\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nusing namespace abc;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nto a piece of code, the prefix <code>abc::</code> is no longer needed.\n\nIdentifiers that are not explicitly declared within a namespace are considered to be in the global namespace.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cpp\">\nint foo;\n</syntaxhighlight>\nThese identifiers can be used exactly as they are declared, or, since the global namespace is unnamed, the namespace specifier <code>::</code> can be prefixed. For example, <code>foo</code> can also be written <code>::foo</code>.\n\nNamespace resolution in C++ is hierarchical. This means that within the hypothetical namespace <code>food::soup</code>, the identifier <code>chicken</code> refers to <code>food::soup::chicken</code>. If <code>food::soup::chicken</code> doesn't exist, it then refers to <code>food::chicken</code>. If neither <code>food::soup::chicken</code> nor <code>food::chicken</code> exist, <code>chicken</code> refers to <code>::chicken</code>, an identifier in the global namespace.\n\nNamespaces in C++ are most often used to avoid [[naming collision]]s. Although namespaces are used extensively in recent C++ code, most older code does not use this facility because it did not exist in early versions of the language. For example, the entire [[C++ Standard Library]] is defined within <code>namespace std</code>, but before standardization many components were originally in the global namespace. A programmer can insert the <code>using</code> directive to bypass namespace resolution requirements and obtain backwards compatibility with older code that expects all identifiers to be in the global namespace. However the use of the <code>using</code> directive for reasons other than backwards compatibility (e.g., convenience) is considered to be against good code practices.\n\n;Java\nIn [[Java (programming language)|Java]], the idea of a namespace is embodied in [[Java package]]s. All code belongs to a package, although that package need not be explicitly named. Code from other packages is accessed by prefixing the package name before the appropriate identifier, for example <code>class String</code> in <code>package [[java.lang]]</code> can be referred to as <code>java.lang.String</code> (this is known as the [[fully qualified name|fully qualified class name]]). Like C++, Java offers a construct that makes it unnecessary to type the package name (<code>import</code>). However, certain features (such as [[reflection (computer science)|reflection]]) require the programmer to use the fully qualified name.\n\nUnlike C++, namespaces in Java are not hierarchical as far as the syntax of the language is concerned. However, packages are named in a hierarchical manner. For example, all packages beginning with <code>java</code> are a part of the [[Java platform]]\u2014the package {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.lang|java/lang}} contains classes core to the language, and {{Javadoc:SE|package=java.lang.reflect|java/lang/reflect}} contains core classes specifically relating to reflection.\n\nIn Java (and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and others), namespaces/packages express semantic categories of code. For example, in C#, <code>namespace System</code> contains code provided by the system (the [[.NET Framework]]). How specific these categories are and how deep the hierarchies go differ from language to language.\n\n[[function (programming)|Function]] and [[class (computer science)|class]] [[scope (programming)|scope]]s can be viewed as implicit namespaces that are inextricably linked with visibility, accessibility, and [[object lifetime]].\n\n;C#\nNamespaces are heavily used in C# language. All .NET Framework classes are organized in namespaces, to be used more clearly and to avoid chaos. Furthermore, custom namespaces are extensively used by programmers, both to organize their work and to avoid [[naming collision]]s.\nWhen referencing a class, one should specify either its fully qualified name, which means namespace followed by the class name,\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nSystem.Console.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\nint i = System.Convert.ToInt32(\"123\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nor add a '''using''' statement. This, eliminates the need to mention the complete name of all classes in that namespace.\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"c#\">\nusing System;\n\nConsole.WriteLine(\"Hello World!\");\nint i = Convert.ToInt32(\"123\");\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nIn the above examples, '''System''' is a namespace, and '''Console''' and '''Convert''' are classes defined within '''System'''.\n\n;Python\nIn [[Python (programming language)|Python]], namespaces are defined by the individual modules, and since modules can be contained in hierarchical packages, then namespaces are hierarchical too.<ref>{{cite web|title=6. Modules|url=https://docs.python.org/tutorial/modules.html|work=The Python Tutorial|publisher=Python Software Foundation|accessdate=25 October 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.python.org/tutorial/classes.html#python-scopes-and-namespaces |title=Python Scopes and Namespaces |publisher=Docs.python.org |date= |accessdate=2011-07-26}}</ref>\nIn general when a module is imported then the names defined in the module are defined via that module's namespace, and are accessed in from the calling modules by using the fully qualified name.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# assume module a defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : class1\nimport modulea\n\nmodulea.func1()\nmodulea.func2()\na = modulea.class1()\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\nThe <code>from ... import ...</code> statement can be used to insert the relevant names directly into the calling module's namespace, and those names can be accessed from the calling module without the qualified name:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\n# assume modulea defines two functions : func1() and func2() and one class : class1\nfrom modulea import func1\n\nfunc1()\nfunc2() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name modulea.func2()\na = class1() # this will fail as an undefined name, as will the full name modulea.class1()\n</syntaxhighlight>\nSince this directly imports names (without qualification) it can overwrite existing names with no warnings.\n\nA special form of the statement is <code>from ... import *</code> which imports all names defined in the named package directly in the calling module's namespace. Use of this form of import, although supported within the language, is generally discouraged as it pollutes the namespace of the calling module and will cause already defined names to be overwritten in the case of name clashes.\n\nPython also supports <code>import x as y</code> as a way of providing an alias or alternative name for use by the calling module:\n\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"python\">\nimport numpy as np\n\na = np.arange(1000)\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n;XML namespace <!-- This section is linked from [[XML]] -->\n{{Main|XML namespace}}\n\nIn [[XML]], the XML namespace specification enables the names of elements and attributes in an XML document to be unique, similar to the role of namespaces in programming languages. Using XML namespaces, XML documents may contain element or attribute names from more than one XML vocabulary.\n\n;PHP <!-- This section is linked from [[PHP]] -->\nNamespaces were introduced into [[Php|PHP]] from version 5.3 onwards. Naming collision of classes, functions and variables can be avoided.\nIn [[PHP]], a namespace is defined with a namespace block.\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\n# File phpstar/foobar.php\n\nnamespace phpstar;\n\n\nclass FooBar {\n\n    public function foo() -> void {\n        echo 'Hello world, from function foo';\n    }\n\n    public function bar() -> void {\n        echo 'Hello world, from function bar';\n    }\n}\n</syntaxhighlight>\nWe can reference a PHP namespace with the following different ways:\n<syntaxhighlight lang=\"php\">\n# File index.php\n\n# Include the file\ninclude \"phpstar/foobar.php\";\n\n# Option 1: directly prefix the class name with the namespace\n$obj_foobar = new \\phpstar\\FooBar();\n\n# Option 2: import the namespace\nuse phpstar\\FooBar;\n$obj_foobar = new FooBar();\n\n# Option 2a: import & alias the namespace\nuse phpstar\\FooBar as FB;\n$obj_foobar = new FB();\n\n# Access the properties and methods with regular way\n$obj_foobar->foo();\n$obj_foobar->bar();\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n===Emulating namespaces===\nIn programming languages lacking language support for namespaces, namespaces can be emulated to some extent by using an [[identifier naming convention]]. For example, [[C (programming language)|C]] libraries such as [[Libpng]] often use a fixed prefix for all functions and variables that are part of their exposed interface. Libpng exposes identifiers such as:\n\n png_create_write_struct\n png_get_signature\n png_read_row\n png_set_invalid\n\nThis [[naming conventions (programming)|naming convention]] provides reasonable assurance that the [[identifier]]s are unique and can therefore be used in larger programs without [[naming collision]]s.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&seqNum=286 |title=Why I Hate Namespaces |author=Danny Kalev |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709115609/http://www.informit.com/guides/content.aspx?g=cplusplus&seqNum=286 |archivedate=2016-07-09 }}</ref> Likewise, many packages originally written in [[Fortran]] (e.g., [[BLAS]], [[LAPACK]]) reserve the first few letters of a function's name to indicate which group it belongs to.\n\nThis technique has several drawbacks:\n* It doesn't scale well to nested namespaces; identifiers become excessively long since all uses of the identifiers must be [[fully qualified name|fully namespace-qualified]].\n* Individuals or organizations may use dramatically inconsistent naming conventions, potentially introducing unwanted obfuscation.\n* Compound or \"query-based\" operations on groups of identifiers, based on the namespaces in which they are declared, are rendered unwieldy or unfeasible.\n* In languages with restricted identifier length, the use of prefixes limits the number of characters that can be used to identify what the function does. This is a particular problem for packages originally written in [[Fortran|FORTRAN 77]], which offered only 6 characters per identifier. For example, the name of the [[BLAS]] function <code>DGEMM</code> function indicates that it operates on double-precision numbers (\"D\") and general matrices (\"GE\"), and only the last two characters show what it actually does: matrix-matrix multiplication (the \"MM\").\n\nThere are several advantages:\n* No special software tools are required to locate names in source-code files. A simple program like [[grep]] suffices.\n* There are no namespace name conflicts.\n* There is no need for name-mangling, and thus no potential incompatibility problems.\n\n==See also==\n{{Wiktionary|namespace}}\n* 11-Digit [[Delivery point]] [[ZIP code]]\n* [[Binomial nomenclature]] (genus-species in [[biology]])\n* [[Chemical nomenclature]]\n* [[Dewey Decimal Classification]]\n* [[Digital object identifier]]\n* [[Domain Name System]]\n* [[Identity (object-oriented programming)]]\n* [[Library of Congress Classification]]\n* [[Star catalogue]]s and [[astronomical naming conventions]]\n* [[XML namespace]]\n* [[Argument-dependent name lookup]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Namespace}}\n[[Category:Naming conventions]]\n", "name_user": "Ravenpuff", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Better hatnote", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Namespace"}
