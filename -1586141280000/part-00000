The six Ciudad Mujer centers, located throughout the country, offer services from 15 Salvadoran government agencies in one location. These include job training and financial loans to offer a chance for [[economic independence]].

The band members include Gary Stringer on vocals, [[Jesse Wood]] on guitar (replacing original guitarist Kenwyn House in 2014) and Jack Bessant on bass.\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1993, while Bessant and Stringer were looking for band members, House met up with Dominic Greensmith (from [[Barnstaple]], [[Devon]]) in [[London]], and discussed forming a band. The foursome finally got together, and started to [[jam]], producing the extremely rare \"Purple Tape\" [[demo (music)|demo]].\n\nAfter recording a couple of tracks, the band spent much of 1994 touring and building up a fan base. They signed to S2, an offshoot of [[Sony]]. Their first [[single (music)|single]] \"Good Feeling\" was released on an [[independent label]], but financed by Sony, then as an official Sony S2 release in early 1995. This paved the way for \"Naked\", which was used in a [[Television|TV]] advert for the Sony [[MiniDisc]].\n\n===Commercial success===\nDuring their touring in 1994 and 1995, Reef supported [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Soundgarden]], amongst others.\n\nBoth the \"Good Feeling\" and \"Naked\" singles came from Reef's 1995 release, their now [[music recording sales certification|gold]] debut album ''Replenish''. The album was recorded in the remote Cornish Sawmills recording studio and in a studio in Bath.\n\nHot on the heels of ''Replenish'', in summer 1995, came a non-album, four-track single release entitled \"Weird\". It was a very non-commercial track and Reef had said the release was aimed at the fans. \"Sunrise Shakers\", one of the B-sides to \"Weird\", was later featured in snowboarding film ''Day Tripper'', by independent film maker Christian Stevenson. Stevenson, known for his films about extreme and free sports, was later to direct a promotional video for Reef, for their \"Sweety\" single in 1999.\n\nThe follow-up to ''Replenish'' was 1997's ''Glow'', which was more diverse, with the band using different instruments and creating a more interesting style. ''Glow'' was recorded under the direction of [[The Black Crowes]]' producer, George Drakoulious, and engineered by Jim Scott, in Los Angeles. It spawned the hit singles \"Place Your Hands\", \"Come Back Brighter\", \"Consideration\" and \"Yer Old\" which increased Reef's profile in the UK and abroad. On the week of its release, ''Glow'' went straight to number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\n\"Place Your Hands\", released on 21 October 1996, was Reef's most successful single to date, reaching number 6 in the UK singles chart.\n\nIn early 1999 Reef released their third album ''Rides'', recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles. They swapped instruments on some tracks, with Stringer and Greensmith playing guitar and Bessant singing on one song. Working again with Glow producer George Drakoulias, the band also enlisted the skills of David Campbell (father of American artist [[Beck]]) for the string arrangements. Rose Stone of [[Sly and the Family Stone]] fame features as a backing singer.  \nThe album was very well received by critics, but commercially could not match the earlier success of its predecessor ''Glow''.\n\n===Later work===\nThe fourth album and most commercial work yet, ''Getaway'' (Sony) was released in 2000, and was produced by Al Clay, who has also produced for the Pixies and Stereophonics. \"Set The Record Straight\" was the highlight of the album, and this track was also used as the theme tune for the [[BBC Television]] drama series ''[[Red Cap (TV series)#Red Cap (2001-2004)|Red Cap]]'', starring [[Tamzin Outhwaite]].\n\nThe \"Superhero\" single released in the same year, features a [[music video|video]] of an impromptu gig held at Bessant's [[Hoxton Square]] flat, in London, in the summer of that year. Bessant was vacating the property and used the opportunity to hold a small gig with a select guest list, predominantly from the music industry.\n\nThe third and final release from Getaway, was \"All I Want,\" a ballad, and substantially different from the first two releases. Despite good airplay on Radio 2, the single only peaked at number 51 in the UK charts.\n\nLate 2000 saw Reef facing legal action from the American company South Cone Inc. for infringement of their trademark, Reef Brazil (as found on sandals and footwear), on the basis that T-shirts, and other merchandising such as stickers, caps and keyrings could cause confusion in the marketplace. The South Cone action failed on account of their mark actually being REEF BRAZIL rather than REEF, and because their primary business and reputation was with the sale of sandals and footwear. Also important to the outcome was the fact that Reef (the band) were using the T-shirts and other items as marketing for the band rather than trying to promote the T-shirts (or any other clothing, including footwear) as a commodity in themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk |title=Intellectual Property Office - Welcome to the Intellectual Property Office |publisher=Ipo.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> Reef (the band) were awarded \u00a31000.\n\nDuring 2001, after a low key tour supporting [[Texas (band)|Texas]], they took a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. Whilst they had a lot of new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled ''Together - The Best of Reef'' released in January 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release \"a kiss of death.\"<ref>[http://www.bath.ac.uk/students-union/impact/dev/frontend/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507151052/http://www.bath.ac.uk/students-union/impact/dev/frontend/index.php |date=7 May 2006 }}</ref>\n\nIn January 2003, their original drummer Greensmith quit the band on the eve of a major UK tour, and as the greatest hits were released. He was replaced by the relatively unknown Nathan Curran. Curran had also drummed for [[Basement Jaxx]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] act, [[Lady Sovereign]].\n\nIt was on this tour that the Live [[DVD]] was recorded at [[Bristol]]'s [[Carling Academy]].

The band members include Gary Stringer on vocals, [[Jesse Wood]] on guitar (replacing original guitarist Kenwyn House in 2014) and Jack Bessant on bass.\n\n==Career==\n\nIn 1993, while Bessant and Stringer were looking for band members, House met up with Dominic Greensmith (from [[Barnstaple]], [[Devon]]) in [[London]], and discussed forming a band. The foursome finally got together, and started to [[jam]], producing the extremely rare \"Purple Tape\" [[demo (music)|demo]].\n\nAfter [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] a couple of tracks, the band spent much of 1994 touring and building up a fan base. They signed to S2, an offshoot of [[Sony]]. Their first [[single (music)|single]] \"Good Feeling\" was released on an [[independent label]], but financed by Sony, then as an official Sony S2 release in early 1995. This paved the way for \"Naked\", which was used in a [[Television|TV]] advert for the Sony [[MiniDisc]] in which a record company executive hears the track on MiniDisc and throws it out of the window disapprovingly. It is picked up by a young man outside, who listens to it and likes it (demonstrating the format's durability). There has been some disapproval of the band's participation in this campaign,{{whosays|date=November 2018}}{{cn|date=November 2018}} but in interviews they have emphasised that they were a young band and were offered a chance that any young band would not resist.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\n===Commercial success===\nDuring their touring in '94 and '95 Reef supported [[Paul Weller (singer)|Paul Weller]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Soundgarden]], amongst others.\n\nBoth the Good Feeling and Naked singles came from Reef's 1995 release, their now [[music recording sales certification|gold]] debut album ''Replenish''. The album was recorded in the remote Cornish Sawmills [[recording studio]] and in a studio in Bath.\n\n\"We wanted our first album, ''Replenish'', to be a really honest statement. Four people playing in a room and getting something that\u2019s totally their own. It was recorded in the most basic way possible. Minimal room sounds. Up until recently, all I used for effects was a wah-pedal and I only used that on two songs,\" said guitarist Kenwyn House.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}\n\nHot on the heels of Replenish, in summer 1995, came a non-album, four-track single release entitled \"Weird\". It was a very non-commercial track and Reef had said the release was aimed at the fans. \"Sunrise Shakers\", one of the B-sides to \"Weird\", was later featured in snowboarding film Day Tripper, by independent film maker Christian Stevenson. Stevenson, known for his films about extreme and free sports, was later to direct a promotional video for Reef, for their \"Sweety\" single in 1999.\n\nThe follow-up to ''Replenish'' was 1997's ''Glow'', which was more diverse, with the band using different [[musical instrument|instruments]] and creating a more interesting style. ''Glow'' was recorded under the direction of [[The Black Crowes]]' [[record producer]], George Drakoulious and engineered by Jim Scott, in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. It spawned the [[chart-topper|hit]] singles \"Place Your Hands\", \"Come Back Brighter\", \"Consideration\" and \"Yer Old\" which increased Reef's profile in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and abroad. On the week of its release, ''Glow'' went straight to number 1 in the [[UK Albums Chart]].\n\n\"Place Your Hands\", released on 21 October 1996, was Reef's most successful single to date, reaching number 6 in the UK singles chart. The song explains the grief that Stringer felt following the death of his grandfather, and easing the pain of death. The video for \"Place Your Hands\", directed by David Mould, features the band members on pulleys and wires to create an energetic aerial display.\n\nDuring their touring in late 1996, Reef were supported by [[Feeder (band)|Feeder]], who were at the time laying the foundations for their own career.\n\nIn early 1999 Reef released their third album ''Rides'', recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, the same studios used by The Beach Boys for Pet Sounds and Michael Jackson for Thriller. They swapped [[musical instrument|instruments]] on some tracks, with Stringer and Greensmith playing [[guitar]] and Bessant singing on one song. Working again with Glow producer George Drakoulias, the band also enlisted the skills of David Campbell (father of American artist [[Beck]]) for the string arrangements. Rose Stone of Sly and the Family Stone fame features as a backing singer. Jack told NME magazine that the album was showing a more mature side to Reef but they were still having fun, using slide guitars, and trying to achieve a \"filmic\" feel to some tracks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/the-rakes/905 |title=Up On The Reef &#124; News |publisher=Nme.Com |date=1999-01-28 |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref>  The album was very well received by [[music press|critics]], but commercially could not match the earlier success of its predecessor ''Glow''.\n\n===Later work===\nThe fourth album and most commercial work yet, ''Getaway'' (Sony) was released in 2000, and was produced by Al Clay, who has also produced for the Pixies and Stereophonics. \"Set The Record Straight\" was the highlight of the album, and this track was also used as the [[theme tune]] for the [[BBC Television]] drama series ''[[Red Cap (TV series)#Red Cap (2001-2004)|Red Cap]]'', starring [[Tamzin Outhwaite]].\n\nThe \"Superhero\" single released in the same year, features a [[music video|video]] of an impromptu [[concert|gig]] held at Bessant's [[Hoxton Square]] flat, in London, in the summer of that year. Bessant was vacating the property and used the opportunity to hold a small gig with a select guest list, predominantly from the [[music industry]]. One notable guest was [[Andrea Corr]], whilst also in attendance were [[BBC Radio 1]], plus [[Kerrang!]] and [[NME]] [[magazine]]s.\n\nThe third and final release from Getaway, was \"All I Want,\" a ballad, and substantially different from the first two releases. Despite good airplay on Radio 2, the single only peaked at number 51 in the UK charts. The video features the members of the band stranded in a drifting lifeboat, drawing straws for who would sacrifice themselves to save the others.\n\nLate 2000 saw Reef facing legal action from the [[United States|U.S.]] company South Cone Inc. for infringement of their trademark, Reef Brazil (as found on sandals and footwear), on the basis that T-shirts, and other merchandising such as stickers, caps and keyrings could cause confusion in the marketplace. The South Cone action failed on account of their mark actually being REEF BRAZIL rather than REEF, and because their primary business and reputation was with the sale of sandals and footwear. Also important to the outcome was the fact that Reef (the band) were using the T-shirts and other items as marketing for the band rather than trying to promote the T-shirts (or any other clothing, including footwear) as a commodity in themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk |title=Intellectual Property Office - Welcome to the Intellectual Property Office |publisher=Ipo.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> Reef (the band) were awarded \u00a31000.\n\nDuring 2001, after a low key tour supporting [[Texas (band)|Texas]], they took a long summer break, in North Devon, to write new material for their fifth album. The self-financed sessions were deliberately performed at arm's length from their [[record label]] and the [[music industry]] in general, and Reef enjoyed the opportunity to return to their earlier, more basic approach to making [[music]]. In an interview to the BBC Jack said \"It's a harder sound, like when we first came out - a deep sound, heavy, I really like that.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Peter Henley |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/reef_iv.shtml |title=BBC News - Hampshire & Isle of Wight |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-10-11 |accessdate=2011-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210033120/http://www.bbc.co.uk/southampton/music/reef_iv.shtml |archive-date=10 December 2004 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Whilst they had a lot of new material, Sony forced Reef to only use around a third of this material as part of a greatest hits offering entitled ''Together - The Best of Reef'' released in January 2003.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} Jack Bessant denounced the complete lack of support from Sony and Kenwyn House called the release \"a kiss of death.\"<ref>[http://www.bath.ac.uk/students-union/impact/dev/frontend/index.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507151052/http://www.bath.ac.uk/students-union/impact/dev/frontend/index.php |date=7 May 2006 }}</ref> Many [[fan (person)|fans]] felt the new material had been some of their best work for some time.\n\nAt the end of 2001 Reef played the [[Surfers Against Sewage]] Christmas Ball, in [[Bournemouth]]. They had previously played the SAS summer ball in 1995 in [[Newquay]].\n\nIn January 2003, their original drummer Greensmith quit the band on the eve of a major UK tour, and as the greatest hits were released. He was replaced by the relatively unknown Nathan Curran. Curran had also drummed for [[Basement Jaxx]] and [[Rhythm and blues|R&B]] act, [[Lady Sovereign]].\n\nIt was on this tour that the Live [[DVD]] was recorded at [[Bristol]]\u2019s [[Carling Academy]]. Around this time Reef also appeared on the BBC's [[re:covered]]  programme covering [[Black Sabbath]]\u2019s \"[[War Pigs (song)|War Pigs]]\", which appeared as a [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] to \"Waster\", Reef's last single, and their only single on the Snapper Music [[record label]].\n\nHeadlining the Falmouth Regatta Week, on 15 August 2003, was to be the final live Reef appearance, before the band split up. In total they have had eight UK Top 20 singles.\n\n\"Place Your Hands\" remains a party and [[compilation album|compilation]] favourite. Reef played a small parody of this for [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]] ''[[TFI Friday]]'' show in the late nineties, for a feature called \u2018It\u2019s Your Letters\u2019. Evans claimed that the band had contacted him to stop playing the clip, as fans were apparently singing along at gigs, but these allegations were largely unfounded. However Evans later denied the claims stating he was misquoted. Indeed, the band had written to Evans, however Gary Stringer explained it differently, \"We don\u2019t want people to think that\u2019s all we\u2019re about\" and went on \"... he\u2019s gone on telly and said we storm offstage whenever someone in the crowd sings that version of it. But no-one ever does sing that version.

Her self-titled YouTube channel, where she posts vlogs and beauty tutorials, currently has over 800,000 subscribers.\n\n== Early life ==\nChrissy Costanza was born on August 23, 1995, in [[New Jersey]] into an Italian American family. She has a brother named Michael (Mikey) Costanza. Growing up, it was one of her dreams to become a musician. She met current band members Dan Gow and Will Ferri through a mutual friend.\n\n== Career ==\n{{Off topic|date=October 2018}}\n\n=== 2011 ===\nCostanza was introduced to [[Dan Gow]] and [[Will Ferri]] through a mutual friend in 2011, joining their band. Singers had been in and out of the band before her. Their Manager Mike Ferri (Will's brother, member of band We are the in Crowd) suggested the name, the name was inspired by a quote from ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'', \"So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past\" and as the book ''The Great Gatsby'' was their first common interest, they went with the name, Against The Current soon started to write original songs, whose lyrics were mostly written by Costanza. They also started to post covers of popular songs on YouTube.\n\n=== 2012 ===\nAgainst The Current released their first single \"Thinking\" in 2012.
