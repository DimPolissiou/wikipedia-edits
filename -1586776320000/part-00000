Founded in 1968 by prominent British royal descendants Oswell E. Spencer and Edward Ashford, along with Dr. James Marcus, it is portrayed in the series as a major international player in pharmaceutical goods and medical supplies, along with more clandestine operations utilizing [[genetic engineering]]. Their legitimate status is only a front for their secret research of \"bio-organic weapons\" (B.O.W.s), developed through the use of a unique virus discovered by the company founders.<ref>''Resident Evil Zero BradyGames Official Strategy Guide'', page 19.</ref> The company is also presented as having a more public face, producing cosmetics, consumer products, and foods. Umbrella established multiple secret research facilities to help develop various bio-weapons. Its most prominent research facility is located in the [[Arklay Mountains]], just outside [[Raccoon City]], which was able to develop the \"T-virus\", a powerful [[mutagen]] that could dramatically alter living and recently dead organisms. The virus leaked and contaminated most of the Arklay Facility and its surrounding area, setting the stage for the first ''Resident Evil'' game. Following the destruction of Raccoon City, all of Umbrella's assets were frozen by the U.S. Government and its trading rights were revoked, effectively terminating its operations. However, it did not stop the rise of several [[bioterrorist]] organizations around the world, some of them making use of its research, leading to the foundation of B.S.A.A. In ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', it is revealed that Umbrella has been reinstated and seemingly reformed as a mercenary group.\n\n====Oswell E. Spencer====\n: Voiced by (English): Adam D.

In the series, he is the owner and co-founder of the Umbrella Corporation, a [[pharmaceutical drug]] company that secretly manufactures bio-organic weapons.<ref name=\"Ash\">Alexander Ashford: \"My father, Edward, discovered the mother virus in cooperation with Lord Spencer, who was also a nobleman. They studied it for the purpose of military use.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), December 3, 2003.</ref> His colleagues, James Marcus and Edward Ashford, join his company, but they show more interest in studying the newly discovered Progenitor virus.<ref name=\"Ash\"/> Eventually, Edward Ashford dies, and Spencer seizes control of the company and its research by sending his subordinates, Albert Wesker and William Birkin, to assassinate Marcus.<ref name=\"James Marcus 2002\">James Marcus: \"Ten years ago, Spencer had me assassinated.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil Zero'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), November 11, 2002.</ref><ref>Alexander Ashford: \"If nothing is done, Umbrella will be taken over by Spencer.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), December 3, 2003.</ref> Spencer conducts some of his company\u2019s research in the Arklay Research Facility, located in the Arklay Mountains. He hires George Trevor, a famous architect, to construct a mansion to conceal the facility.<ref>George Trevor: \"There are only two people that know the secret of this mansion, Sir Spencer and myself. If they kill me, Sir Spencer will be the only person that knows the secret.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil Remake'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), April 30, 2002.</ref> Spencer's plans progress smoothly, until Marcus returns from the dead,<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> and begins to seek revenge with the help of his test subjects. Marcus destroys one of Spencer\u2019s luxury trains, and causes a viral outbreak in the Arklay Research Facility.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">James Marcus: \"It was I who scattered the T-Virus in the mansion, needless to say I contaminated the train too.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil Zero'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), November 11, 2002.</ref> The outbreak spreads throughout the region, sparking the events of ''Resident Evil Zero'' and the original ''Resident Evil''. The virus subsequently spreads to Raccoon City during the events of ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', prompting the U.S. government to attempt to contain the outbreak by ordering the destruction of the city.<ref>Leon Kennedy: \"Not taking any chances, the President of the United States ordered a contingency plan&nbsp;\u2014 to sterilize Raccoon City.\" Capcom, Resident Evil 4, Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), January 11, 2005.</ref> After the city's destruction, Spencer attempts to disguise the incident as a government conspiracy by hiring top lawyers and false witnesses. His actions prolong the legal proceedings, and allow the Umbrella Corporation to stay afloat for five more years. Ultimately, Wesker betrays Spencer by handing over secret documents to the U.S. government,<ref>Albert Wesker: \"My dear Spencer. How the mighty have fallen. Your Umbrella has folded and now you are a fugitive in the same world you once sought to control. We shall meet again before the conclusion of this drama. Then you will learn of the history I will write for this world.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles'', Capcom, Nintendo Wii, (in English), November 30, 2007.</ref> and seals Spencer's doom by personally testifying against him in court. Umbrella's business license is summarily suspended, and the U.S. government works swiftly to dismantle the remains of the organization.<ref>Leon Kennedy: \"With the whole affair gone public, the United States government issued an indefinite suspension of business decree to Umbrella. Soon its stock prices crashed and for all intents and purposes Umbrella was finished.\" Capcom, ''Resident Evil 4'', Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), January 11, 2005.</ref> After Umbrella's public fall from grace, Spencer retreats to his mansion in Europe.

In ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', Nikolai is one of the few surviving operatives from the Delta platoon, along with Carlos and Mikhail. He disappears after an event in the first half of the game and is presumed dead until another encounter with him. It is revealed that Nikolai is in fact one of the Supervisors UBCS operatives, assigned to watch and gather combat data as their comrades fight against Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai's fate depends on decisions made by the player, resulting in either his escape or death, either at the hand of Jill or the Nemesis. In the ''Resident Evil 3'' remake, Nicholai is changed to a mole implanted within the UBCS for an unnamed organization. Hired to mitigate the company's efforts to contain the T-Virus outbreak, he murders research staff and tries to gain and destroy a virus vaccine. In the final confrontation with Jill and Carlos, he is injured and left behind in Raccoon City.

She first appears in ''Resident Evil 2'', running away and hiding in Raccoon City during the outbreak. She manages to find Leon and Claire, who protect her while trying to escape the city. Sherry is a playable character in some parts of the game but she is completely unarmed and can only avoid the monsters. Her father has been transformed into a monstrous creature by the G-virus and infects her, but Claire gives Sherry an anti-virus, which prevents her from mutating. Sherry assists Leon and Claire in boarding a secret underground train, and successfully escapes Raccoon City before it is destroyed. Sherry also appears in ''Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles'' in chapters that recapitulate the events of ''Resident Evil 2''. She returns as an adult in ''Resident Evil 6'' as a government agent escorting [[Jake Muller]] and seems to have acquired great healing abilities from the remnants of the G-virus in her body. During the course of the game, she helps Jake deal with the fact that Albert Wesker is his father. She also learns from Leon S. Kennedy that her superior, Derek C. Simmons, is the man responsible for the U.S. President's death. She and Jake subsequently ally with Leon, Chris Redfield and their partners in thwarting Carla Radames' plans.\n\n=====Derek C. Simmons=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[David Lodge (voice actor)|David Lodge]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Takayuki Sug\u014d]] (''RE6'')\nDerek Clifford Simmons is the primary antagonist of Leon's campaign in ''Resident Evil 6''. Simmons is the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and a close friend to Adam Benford. He is the leader of a secret organization known as \"The Family\", which uses its vast political influence to maintain world order. Simmons worries that Benford's plan to declassify the Raccoon City incident will create civil unrest around the world and tarnish the United States' reputation. He coerces Helena into infecting the president with the C-virus, and later causes viral outbreaks in Tall Oaks. Simmons is later betrayed by Carla Radames and infected with the C-virus. Simmons spontaneously switches between mutations as he fights Leon and Helena to the Quad Tower, where he finally falls to his death. A unique feature of Simmons' mutation is that he could absorb zombies to add more mass to his body, which took the form of a giant insect as a result.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 3 | quote = The Family has been manipulating the course of human development for a long time. Their ostensible goal is to maintain stability in the world, but its true motivation lies in exploiting events to benefit its members. For now, they believe maintaining that stability is contingent upon keeping the United States at the top of the pyramid of world power. If the truth about the U.S. government's connections to Umbrella's bioweapons program were to get out, it would destabilize the world and remove America from the top of that hierarchy of power. Derek sets into motion a plan that will launch a bioterrorist attack and assassinate the president, thus preserving The Family's designs on power and stability.}}</ref>\n\n====Secret Service====\n=====Helena Harper=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Mayumi Sako]] (''RE6'')\n: Facial model by: [[Natasha Alam]]\nHelena Harper is an agent in the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Security Service]] (USSS) and the personal bodyguard of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Adam Benford.

At the time of the 2004 Terragrigia Panic, Raymond was an inexperienced cadet in the FBC. Injured by Veltro's Farfarello, he was rescued by the more experienced agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. Retreating back to the conference room where FBC Commissioner Morgan Lansdale was residing, Raymond stumbled upon a telephone conversation Lansdale was having with the Veltro leader, Jack Norman. Raymond became increasingly suspicious of his commanding officer, and knew that he was somehow involved with the bio-terrorist attack. However, he was unable to act on these suspicions, as the city was evacuated and destroyed soon after. At some point after this attack, Raymond became an informant for BSAA leader Clive R. O'Brian, operating as his mole within the FBC. O'Brian and Vester devised a plan to oust Lansdale as the architect of the Terragrigia attack through engineering the \"return\" of Veltro. Vester would pose as Jack Norman, and O'Brian used a mountain airbase to create the illusion that the terrorist group had resurfaced. In doing so, the two hoped to collect enough evidence to expose Lansdale. During the Queen Zenobia incident, O'Brian let slip that agents Jessica Sherawat and Chris Redfield were captured by Veltro aboard the Zenobia. Intercepting this information, Lansdale sent Vester and his partner Rachael to the ship to determine if the BSAA agents supposedly on board the vessel would pose any threat to him. Vester and O'Brian agreed to push forward the schedule of their plan. After boarding the ship, Vester, with and without his Veltro disguise, encountered Luciani and Valentine on the ship's bridge, making his presence known. Soon after, Agents Sherawat and Redfield boarded the vessel. Just as Raymond was about to reveal Lansdale's secrets to the group, Lansdale's mole, Jessica Sherawat, shot Raymond in the chest, causing him to fall from the balcony. Though Raymond was wearing a bulletproof vest and was unharmed by Jessica's shot, he faked his death while in her presence and whispered critical information about the conspiracy and her true identity. He later resurfaced and helped a gravely injured Luciani escape the sinking ship. Unbeknown to Parker, both Raymond and Jessica were agents of the pharmaceutical division of TRICELL, which had promoted the development of T-Abyss. The two met in a cafe in an unnamed European country, where Vester provided Sherawat with a sample of the T-Abyss.\n\n====Strategic Command====\n=====Bruce McGivern=====\n: Voiced by (English): Raj Ramayya (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroaki Hirata]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nWhen a large amount of a recently developed hybrid viral agent known as the \"T+G Virus\" was stolen from the Umbrella Pharmaceuticals Development Center in [[Paris]] by a former Umbrella researcher, Bruce McGivern was sent in by the U.S. government to retrieve the virus and neutralize the threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on board an Umbrella-owned luxury ocean liner, the ''Spencer Rain'', whose entire personnel on board have been infected with the T-virus stolen by the same former researcher, Morpheus D. Duvall, in September 2002. A member of the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]], McGivern is cocky and brash, and has a tendency to adopt a \"shoot first, ask questions later\" policy, with little regard for the consequences following his actions. This has often left him in many hostile situations, although in the end, he always somehow comes out on top. Confronted at the very beginning of the game by Duvall, he is saved by Chinese secret agent Fong Ling who throws a grenade at Morpheus (regardless of Bruce's life), seriously wounding the terrorist. He later works with her in order to stop Duvall's plan of unleashing the virus, bringing the fight to an underwater Umbrella secret laboratory which they ultimately destroy as Bruce kills a greatly mutated Duvall. At first at odds with Fong Ling, she and Bruce become closer as the story progresses, particularly after he saves her from an attempt on her life by her own government through the use of satellites armed with lasers. At the end of the game, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\n====MSS====\n=====Fong Ling=====\n: Voiced by (English): Claire O'Connor (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kae Araki]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nA Chinese intelligence agent employed by the [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]], Fong is infamous for her cold and stoic demeanor. Upon learning of her brother's involvement in anti-government activism, Fong arrested him. Following his arrest, Fong's brother was swiftly executed, although she never questioned the actions of her boss and remained absolutely loyal, stopping at nothing to accomplish her objectives. She is sent by the Chinese government to the Umbrella-owned luxury liner ''Spencer Rain'' to stop former Umbrella scientist Morpheus Duvall's plans and retrieve the sample of the virus he stole from an Umbrella's lab in Paris. Initially apathetic towards the presence of a rival operative, Bruce McGivern, going so far as to throw a grenade at Duvall who was holding him at gunpoint, she allies with him in order to stop Duvall. At some point, the Chinese government betrays her and attempts to kill her through the use of satellites armed with lasers. But Bruce saves her. Though greatly shaken by this event, she decides to complete her mission and to keep working for her employers afterward. And from that moment on, she becomes closer to Bruce. After killing Duvall and destroying an Umbrella secret laboratory underwater, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===NGOs===\nA [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) is an organization that is neither a part of a recognized government nor a conventional for-profit business.\n\n====TerraSave====\nTerraSave is a non-governmental human rights organization introduced in ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]''.\n\n=====Moira Burton=====\n: Voiced by (English): Marcella Lentz-Pope (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ayumi Fujimura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nMoira is the eldest daughter of STARS veteran, Barry Burton. In ''Resident Evil: Revelations 2'', Moira and her TerraSave co-workers including Claire Redfield are captured and taken to an abandoned prison facility supervised by Alex Wesker. Moira is a secondary character in Claire's portion of the game. She refuses to use firearms after accidentally wounding her sister with a handgun as a child. Instead, Moira uses tools, such as crowbars, to break open boxes and to attack enemies. She is estranged from her father. Eventually while fighting a mutated Neil Fisher, who betrayed the Terra Save group, Moira overcomes her fear of using a gun in order to save Claire if the player selects this option, which is canon. Moira is separated from Claire and saved by Evgeny, a Russian man who later chooses death once his daughter is dead. Moira then returns to save her father and friends from Alex Wesker, who is now fully mutated. Alex, however, lives on through possessing to some degree Natalia, who had become Moira's adoptive sister.\n\n=====Neil Fisher=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Eiji Hanawa (''Revelations 2'')\n\nNeil Fisher is a high-ranking member of TerraSave and senior officer of Claire Redfield. He was also involved with the organization's operations during the [[Resident Evil: Revelations|Terragrigia incident]], where he met and looked after a young Natalia Korda. However, unknown to other TerraSave members, Neil was affiliated with the FBC, primarily its director Morgan Lansdale. After it was disbanded during the events of ''Resident Evil: Revelations'', Neil plans to start another bioterrorist attack to justify the return of the FBC. To achieve this end, he contacts Alex Wesker and helps her organize the kidnapping of several members of TerraSave for experimentation with her T-Phobos virus. In return, he would receive a vial of Albert Wesker's Uroboros virus to start his bioterrorist attack. After helping Alex procure Natalia for the purposes of transferring her mind into the girl's body, she betrays Neil by injecting the virus into his body and sends him down to the lower levels of her tower, to fight Claire and Moira Burton. Mutating into a hulking beast, he is killed during their fight when shot at point-blank range in the head by either Claire or Moira (canonically the latter).\n\n====Neo-Umbrella====\n=====Carla Radames=====\n{{see also|Ada Wong}}\n\nCarla Radames is the primary antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''. She is the founder and leader of Neo-Umbrella, a terrorist organization that  strives on destroying  the current world order. Radames, a former government researcher, is the creator of the C-virus, a powerful mutagen capable of turning humans into capable and competent bio-organic weapons. Derek Simmons performs experiments on Carla which ultimately turn her into a clone of Ada Wong. While Carla possesses Ada's physical appearance and mannerisms, she still retains her original psyche. She also harbors a deep resentment towards Simmons, whom she believes stole her research and lifework. Radames personally oversees the bio-terror attacks in Europe, the United States, and China. She exacts revenge on Simmons by having her henchmen infect him with a potent dosage of the C-virus, which turns him into ravenous monster. She is fatally shot by a helicopter sent by the Family, but thanks to injecting herself with an enhanced C-virus, Radames mutated into a formless mass. She is eventually confronted and killed by Ada Wong.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 4 | quote = Carla Radames was responsible for the discovery of the C-Virus, and a close confidant of Derek C.

He chases after the intruder Ethan Winters inside a plantation mansion, or the \"Dulvey Haunted House\" as it is also referred to. Jack is a middle-aged man and a member of the Baker family who are victims of Eveline, and have captured Ethan's wife, Mia. The Bakers were thought to have vanished from the local community in Dulvey, Louisiana.\n\nNot long after the game was announced, Jack became known for his various one-liners such as \"Welcome to the family, son!\" heard in the various demo footage.<ref name=\"demo2\">{{cite news |last=Relph |first=Lauren |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-7-first-hour-true-ending-walkthrough |title=How to get the true ending in Resident Evil 7: First Hour demo for Xbox One and PC |work=Windows Central |date=2017-01-07 |accessdate=2017-01-22 }}</ref> Jack relentlessly pursues Ethan from area to area, being very strong and somehow appears to be nearly unstoppable. He uses a variety of weapons and can attack you even after being set ablaze when a car bursts into flames inside a garage. To prove to Ethan he is not human, he also takes his gun and seemingly dies after blowing his own head off, only to rise again and continue pursuing Ethan. Jack also murders a policeman who had come across Ethan after they entered the garage. During one such encounter, Ethan ultimately defeats Jack one last time after he has majorly mutated, but Jack later appears in a dream like scene as a normal man due to Ethan having used the serum to cure him. He still dies along with the rest of the Bakers, however, and is honored by Ethan when he says they were also victims of the tragedy that was Eveline. He returned as a major enemy in ''End of Zoe'' which is a [[downloadable content]] chapter that takes place after the main game.

They were responsible for the deaths of a local camera crew, but were really doing all of this to outsiders because Eveline had taken control of them, and before their infection, the Bakers were just an ordinary family. Marguerite was first shown in the various footage that was unveiled during 2016, including a clip featuring the scene where her family have the main protagonist Ethan Winters seated at the dinner table. Marguerite was more prominently featured in the ''Lantern'' demo, following Mia, Ethan's wife. She can summon insects to swarm together and attack Ethan, but he defeats her nonetheless. When she follows Mia, Mia must hide rather than face her in a battle.

Lucas later forces Clancy (a cameraman) and Ethan to navigate a series of areas filled with traps, and monsters, as he mocks their progress. Clancy is killed after engaging a trap, and Ethan watches a tape that reveals how his death occurred to ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate. Lucas survives the events because he is never faced in combat. He also appears in the downloadable content \"Banned Footage\" chapters, but these side quests predate the main story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-24-resident-evil-7-dlc-begins-rolling-out-next-week-on-ps4|title=Resident Evil 7 DLC begins rolling out next week on PS4|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref> However, a new sub-chapter entitled ''Not a Hero'' is set after the main game.

During some scenes, Alex is clearly seen in her mutated form as well, and controls the \"Afflicted\". Alex had captured Natalia to experiment on her, intending to transfer her own consciousness into Natalia's body. Regardless of the ending achieved by the player in ''Revelations 2'', good or bad, Alex manages, possibly to different degrees, to transfer her mind into Natalia's body and take over it. In the bonus episode \"Little Miss\", which takes place before Barry's arrival to the island, players assume control of Natalia and her mysterious evil twin as they look for the toy bear Lottie. This reveals Alex had already started her experience and her mind was present in Natalia's subconscious as the \"evil twin\".\n\n====Ark Thompson====\n: Voiced by: [[Patrick Harlan]] (''Resident Evil: Survivor'')\n\nArk Thompson is an acquaintance of Leon S.

She then begs for forgiveness, saying she will avenge her sister after she and Leon kill Simmons, and releases Deborah as she falls to her death into the darkness below. At the end of Leon and Helena's campaign, Helena visits Deborah's grave at a cemetery.\n\n====Ethan Winters====\n: Voiced by (English): Todd Soley (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hidenobu Kiuchi]] (''RE7'')\nEthan is the protagonist of the game ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Ethan is an American systems engineer looking for his missing wife, Mia. Mia went missing over 3 years ago after she sent a video message to Ethan, talking about how much she was looking forward to coming home. Ethan then suddenly receives a disturbing video message and an email from Mia, so he tells an unknown friend that he is heading out to search for her in Dulvey, Louisiana. This leads him to a derelict plantation mansion, that also happens to be the home of the deranged Baker family, who have been driven insane due to being infected with the Mold from Eveline.\n\nAfter viewing a tape he finds regarding a camera crew being attacked in the same house, he soon finds his wife in a hidden area lying in a cell, but Mia acts peculiar as they look for a way out, and disappears. She then attacks Ethan with a kitchen knife. The ensuing chaos leads to Mia throwing Ethan through a wall. However, he manages to \"kill\" her using an ax and pistol. Eventually, she gets up, corners Ethan, and pins him to the wall by his hand with a screwdriver, then cuts off Ethan's pinned hand. Ethan knocks Mia out, and then suddenly, a man attacks Ethan and knocks him out, taking both Ethan and Mia back inside the house. Ethan's severed hand is reattached by a woman named Zoe (the only sane member of the Baker family) and then later, Ethan manages to become untied at the dinner table due to a police officer ringing a telephone, which distracted the Bakers, who were planning to torture him for refusing to eat with them. Ethan manages to fully mend his hand but learns that the Bakers cannot be \"killed\" very easily.\n\nMia, as it turns out, is also infected by Eveline, as is Zoe, and therefore not dead. Although Mia and Zoe have to find a way to escape as well. However, Zoe explains that they need to be cured first using a serum as they cannot leave until this is fulfilled. Ethan also encounters other abnormal monsters created by Eveline, such as the creatures called the Molded. But escaping the premises is made extremely difficult, as the Bakers relentlessly pursue him, and Ethan has to protect himself using whatever means he can find, so he can ultimately overcome each family member.\n\nEthan attempts to get in contact with a military group for his rescue while learning more about Eveline as an \"E-Series\" Bioweapon. After Ethan is assisted by the military group via chopper and finally puts a stop to Eveline, he and Mia are rescued by Chris Redfield, who is working with the newly reformed Umbrella Corporation. At the conclusion of the ''End of Zoe'' sub-chapter, Ethan talks to Zoe by phone and she finds out he kept his promise to send help, and Zoe is cured.\n\n====Evgeny Rebic====\n:Voiced by (English): Walter Rego (''Revelations 2'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ben Hiura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nRebic is an old [[Russians|Russian]] man Claire and Moira meet on the island they are trapped on in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. He is a miner who is not happy that they are potentially alerting the afflicted to his hideout; Moira ends up doing this by mistake while later spending time with him after her near death experience that resulted in her being away from Claire for 6 months. Although Evegeny is just a bit part character in the main game, he is the co-op partner of Moira in \"The Struggle\" bonus episode, and uses a rifle to shoot wild animals (for food) and kill enemies. He rescued Moira beneath all the debris that fell on her, but does not call her by that name afterwards, and he teaches her to hunt for herself, while they are putting up with one another's whining. He later learns his missing daughter named Irina is already dead and feeling unwell, Evgeny chooses to die in the underground, with Evgeny and Moira revealing their names to each other just before he passes. His body is eventually found by Barry and Natalia.\n\n====Eveline====\n: Voiced by (English): Patricia McNeely (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), Paula Rhodes (''RE7'' (Young))\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Yuri Tabata (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), [[Sumire Morohoshi]] (''RE7'' (Young))\n\nEveline is the main antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Considered as an \"E-Class\" B.O.W. codenamed \"E-001\", Eveline is a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] human created by a mysterious group called \"The Connections\" with the help from H.C.F (one of the companies owned by Albert Wesker) by fusing a Progenitor-enhanced fungus called Mutamycete into her genome during embryonic stage. Designed for the company's NEXBAS (Next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) initiative, the project was designed to create a B.O.W. capable of blending in with the population, neutralizing combatants without direct contact and converting enemies into allies. Ultimately, the project folded due to reservations regarding methodology and the difficultly of controlling the resultant product B.O.W., particularly in comparison to other projects. Eveline was the first successful E-Class prototype. She infected people using mold and fungus, allowing her to create a legion of people that she perceived as her \"family\", and thereby command and convert them into the \"Molded\". Due to the bioweapon's destructive abilities and mind control capabilities,  E-Class project materials were sought after by rival companies.  This state of affairs resulted in Mia Winters and Alan Droney, members of The Connections, travelling with Eveline upon a cargo ship bound for a facility in Central America.  When a hurricane hit the ship, Eveline became unstable.  Eveline infected Alan, and turned the crew into the Molded. Mia has no choice but to track Eveline and kill the former crew. Mia was helpless as Eveline killed Alan and subsequently infected her.  Mia attempted to send Ethan a second video message prior to the ship's destruction, wish him a happy life and urging him not to search for her.\n\nEveline and Mia were both later found and taken in by the Baker family, who happened upon the husk of the cargo ship in the Louisiana bayou. Eveline infected the Baker family within the month, on which put them under her control. Two years after, Eveline's mind and body were deteriorating rapidly due to lack of her medication and the degenerative effects of her condition, prompting her to demand the Bakers to add more people to her family by kidnapping or killing them. Zoe Baker was the only one not affected by Eveline's mind control while brother Lucas Baker was subsequently cured and pretended to work with his family, cognizant that Eveline was a threat.\n\nAfter Ethan arrived at the Baker family residence, he was helped by Zoe. When he finally learned of Eveline's origins, he used the equipment in the lab deep in the nearby Salt Mines to develop a necrotoxin using Eveline's DNA, which was capable of killing her. He succeeded on injecting Eveline with the necroxtoin, in the process learning that Eveline's true form is actually that of an old woman, demonstrating that rapid aging was an unintended byproduct of the project, as had been implied by internal project documents. After Eveline is injected with the necrotoxin, she mutated into a giant grotesque form as her powers spiral out of control. With the help from the reformed Umbrella Corporation and Chris Redfield, Ethan succeeded in fully killing Eveline before being rescued.\n\n====Jake Muller====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Troy Baker]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Namikawa]] (''RE6'')\n: Motion capture: [[Troy Baker]], Daniel Southworth (stunt double)\n\nJake Muller is the son of the Albert Wesker, a eugenicist, virologist and bioterrorist, who formerly worked for Umbrella. It is believed that Wesker was not aware of his sons existence, as Jake's Mother left shortly after being impregnated by him. Jake, later works as a freelance mercenary in order to support his mother, whom dies of an unknown chronic disease shortly after Jake receives money for her treatment. Jake was caught up in an act of bioterrorism while operating in anti-government operations in the fictional  Eastern European republic of Edonia. His mercenary comrades are infected with the C-virus, but Jake's specialized blood resists the infection. Soon after, he meets US government agent Sherry Birkin \u2013 whose father, William Birkin, was coincidentally Albert's research partner. Sherry and Jake take part in the subsequent battle between the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance and the mutated mercenaries.<ref name=\"Jake's story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/bio6/story_jake.html|title=CAPCOM\uff1aBIOHAZARD 6 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 - STORY|work=capcom.co.jp}}</ref> With his blood resistant to the downside-effects of mutagenic viruses like his father, Jake also inherited several of his father's signature abilities such as increased strength, speed, healing, and advanced combat skills. He demands a large sum of money from the BSAA, in order to sample a pint of his blood to be synthesize for vaccination to combat the C-virus. He and Sherry are captured by Carla Radames, a doppelg\u00e4nger of Ada Wong, and held captive in Lanshiang, China. They escape during the C-virus outbreak in the city six months later. Over the course of the story of ''RE6'', Jake comes to terms with both the knowledge of his father's actions and of his death at the hands of Chris Redfield three years earlier. After the ordeal, Jake starts a new life fighting BOWs in an underdeveloped country with his real identity covered up by the BSAA.\n\n====Joe Baker====\n:Voiced by (English): Gage Maverik (''RE7'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[K\u014dsei Hirota]] (''RE7'')\nJoe Baker is the main protagonist in the ''End of Zoe'' [[downloadable content]] chapter, for ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-biohazards-not-a-hero-end-of-zoe-d/1100-6454102/|title=Resident Evil 7: Biohazard's Not A Hero, End Of Zoe DLC Further Detailed With New Trailer|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=17 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The brother of Jack Baker, he lives in the nearby swamplands near the Baker estate, though is isolated from the rest of the family and unaffected by Eveline's control. During the chapter, Joe discovers his niece, Zoe, shortly after the events of the main game and tries to find a cure to free her from Eveline's influence. To do so, he battles against the remnants of the molded creatures created by the Bakers and a mysterious creature chasing after them, later revealed to be a resurrected Jack. Joe ultimately kills his brother and is able to cure Zoe, after which they are found and extracted by the Umbrella Corps. Although he can use firearms, Joe mostly fights with his bare hands, though later acquires an Umbrella Corps glove to increase his strength prior to his final battle with Jack.\n\n====Katherine Warren====\nKatherine Warren is the daughter of Raccoon City's Mayor, Michael Warren. Left behind in Raccoon City by her father, she is left in the care of Chief Brian Irons. Driven insane by the outbreak, Irons instead murders Katherine, planning to stuff her body and keep it as part of his taxidermy collection. Warren's body appears in both versions of ''Resident Evil 2'' and its retelling ''The Darkside Chronicles''.

A member of an unnamed organization, possibly a former rival of Umbrella, Mia was tasked with escorting a bio-weapon called Eveline to another facility. However, the tanker is attacked and crashes in a [[Louisiana]]n swamp. Found by the Baker family, Eveline infects them, planning to start a family of its own, hence the reason Mia and the Bakers were its earliest known victims. However, Mia also briefly serves as an antagonist due to being infected by Eveline, causing her to attack her husband shortly after he found her in a holding cell beneath the house. Mia is seemingly \"killed\" by her husband in self-defense after having an axe plunged into her neck, but despite this, she isn't truly dead because of Eveline.\n\nBoth Mia and Ethan are taken by Jack Baker, and Mia recovers off screen. From that point on, Mia works with a woman called Zoe (who is revealed to be a Baker) and Ethan tries to save them by receiving hints from Zoe when she telephones him, while Ethan is having to deal with constant attacks perpetrated by the other Bakers. In some parts of the game, Mia is playable too, but sometimes she has to hide rather than confront enemies. After using a cure created by Zoe to kill Jack, Ethan must use the remaining vial to save either Mia or Zoe. Depending on a choice made by the player, Ethan can either cure Mia and attempt to escape with her, or choose Zoe, leaving her behind. After Ethan and the person he chose to save is attacked, the player once again takes control of Mia, searching the tanker for him. After freeing him, Mia will start to become possessed by Eveline again. Depending on the player's earlier decision, Mia will separate herself from Ethan to save him or allow Eveline to take control of her, forcing Ethan to kill her. If the former plays out, she will be recovered by [[Umbrella Corps]] mercenaries, reuniting with Ethan as the game ends.\n\n====Natalia Korda====\n: Voiced by (English): Gabriella Pastore (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (''Revelations 2'')\nA young girl who is a playable character in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. Natalia accompanies [[Barry Burton]] immediately when he arrives on an island to search for his missing daughter, Moira. Natalia explains that she is an orphan due to the death of her parents. Natalia can find items that are hidden, detect the presence of invisible or off-screen enemies (indicated by a glowing effect) and go through small passageways to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Since Natalia cannot use any firearms, she can pick up bricks to throw at any monsters, but often has to evade the monsters.\n\nAlex Wesker targets Natalia throughout the course of the plot in order to [[mind uploading|mind transfer herself]] into her, believing she is not \"true\" like she is. Alex (when in a grotesque form near the climax of the game), causes Natalia's fear to reach its highest on her wrist bracelet, but it is not explained what happens to Natalia. In a prequel segment, '''Dark Natalia''' joined Natalia to help find \"Lottie\", Natalia's beloved teddy bear, and she then begins her association with Barry, now having the ability to see any monsters that Barry cannot always notice. In the true ending, it was revealed prior to Alex mutating into her third and final form that she was able to transfer her mind into Natalia's body up until the young girl's body had been fully taken over by Alex, in 2013. Barry adopts Natalia after Alex is killed, but she is seen reading a piece by [[Franz Kafka]] then smiling, so Alex succeeded to some degree.\n\n====Robert Kendo====\n:Voiced by (English): Gary Krawford (RE2), Jason C. Miller (DC)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Hideki Tanaka (REmake 2)\nRobert Kendo is the owner of a gun store in Raccoon City. He and his brother Joseph are responsible for creating the Samurai Edge pistols used by S.T.A.R.S. members.  In the original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', he briefly appears in the opening of Scenario A, allowing the player to stay in his gunshop for protection. However, zombies soon break in and devour Kendo, leaving a weapon for the player to pick up. In the remake, Robert confronts Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong as they attempt to pass through the shop to reach the sewers. It's also revealed he has a daughter, Emma, who he tries to protect from the outbreak. However, she is infected and Robert is forced to kill her. Kendo also appears in the game's ''The Ghost Survivors'' DLC as the player character in \"No Time to Mourn\". A non-canonical scenario, it follows him as he attempts to escape Raccoon City.<ref>https://www.altchar.com/games-news/586950/resident-evil-2-remake-will-get-three-free-dlc-stories</ref><ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/resident-evil-2-the-ghost-survivors-detailed-ahead-of-the-free-dlcs-launch-this-friday/</ref> He also appears in ''The Darkside Chronicles'', though is killed offscreen before he encounters either Leon or Claire.\n\n====Steve Burnside====\n: Voiced by: Bill Houston (''Code Veronica''), [[Sam Riegel]] (''The Darkside Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Steve Burnside|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|Sut\u012bbu B\u0101nsaido}} is [[Claire Redfield]]'s partner in the game ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. Steve was imprisoned in the Rockfort Island's facility alongside his father, a former Umbrella employee. He escapes from his cell during the viral outbreak. At first, Steve is hesitant to trust Claire and only cooperates with her reluctantly, but later becomes more open and attached to her after he is forced to kill his own father, who has become a zombie during the outbreak. Steve and Claire eventually end up in Umbrella's Antarctic Facility, where he is captured by Alexia and used as a test subject for the T-Veronica virus. Claire meets a chained Steve, who mutates into a monster and attacks Claire; in this form, he is nearly invulnerable to damage, and wields a giant, ceremonial axe. While running from Steve, Claire is attacked by one of Alexia's tentacles. Steve, seeing this, regains control of his mind and cuts the tentacle apart, freeing Claire. In retaliation, Alexia strikes him with one of the tentacles, inflicting a mortal wound. His failing body finally rejects the mutation, and he changes back. He dies in Claire's arms, just after professing his love to her. He was later taken by Albert Wesker due to the T-Veronica virus in his body, and also hinted that he might come back to life. In ''The Darkside Chronicles'' it is revealed that Wesker contacted the drug baron Javier Hidalgo and took a sample of T-Veronica from Steve's corpse in order to sell the virus for Hidalgo's ailing daughter, Manuela.\n\n====Zoe Baker====\n: Voiced by (English): Giselle Gilbert (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016b Kobayashi]] (''RE7'')\n: Face model: [[Ananda Jacobs]] (''RE7'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anandajacobs.com/about|title=About \u2014 Ananda Jacobs|website=anandajacobs.com|accessdate=June 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZoe is the youngest member of the Baker family in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' set in 2017, and despite being infected by Eveline like the rest of her family, Zoe is somewhat normal, and serves as a supporting character. Zoe gets in contact with Ethan Winters by telephone several times, asking Ethan if \"Daddy\" gave him a hard time, as well as giving him tips on how to advance through the area. She was also the person who attached Ethan's severed hand back on after his wife Mia had cut it off, when she temporarily turned crazy. Working alongside of Mia thereafter, Zoe explains to Ethan that due to being infected, a serum needs to be given to each of them before they can escape too. Unfortunately, Ethan has to use one of the two vials to stop the heavily mutated Jack Baker when he returned yet again to try to finish off Ethan, leaving only one dosage remaining. The player can then choose to cure either Mia or Zoe, leading to an alternate story playing out: If Mia is selected, Zoe stays behind to die with the rest of her family, displaying anger over the fact that she felt she never had a future. It is unknown if she is alive during this path, but she is seen during Ethan and Jack's conversation scene. If Zoe is chosen to be cured, she and Ethan try to escape. However, they are both attacked by Eveline, during which Zoe is engulfed by her, killing her.\n\nIn the ''Daughters'' [[downloadable content]] sub-chapter, players control Zoe Baker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameranx.com/features/id/93190/article/resident-evil-7-daughters-dlc-how-to-unlock-all-the-endings/ |title=Resident Evil 7: Daughters DLC {{!}} How to Unlock All The Endings |website=gameranx.com}}</ref> just as her father rescues Mia and Eveline out in the swamp. Jack brings Eveline into their home during stormy weather to rest up in Lucas' bedroom, but as Zoe is about to change her wet clothes, Eveline looks up, saying, \"They're mine now!\" and then runs off, laughing maniacally. The power goes out at the same time. Eveline has begun converting the Bakers to her cause, as Zoe finds her mother has gone crazy and attempts to attack her. Jack tries to hold off Marguerite and tells Zoe to get rope from the garage, but by the time she comes back upstairs with it, Jack has already turned, trying to drown Marguerite in the bathtub, and Zoe has to escape through the recreation room as he gives chase. She also witnesses her father dragging Lucas along a hallway.

He takes one hostage, but he later gets killed by Jack. Joe fist fights his way through a marsh to locate a cure.

Founded in 1968 by prominent British royal descendants Oswell E. Spencer and Edward Ashford, along with Dr. James Marcus, it is portrayed in the series as a major international player in pharmaceutical goods and medical supplies, along with more clandestine operations utilizing [[genetic engineering]]. Their legitimate status is only a front for their secret research of \"bio-organic weapons\" (B.O.W.s), developed through the use of a unique virus discovered by the company founders.<ref>''Resident Evil Zero BradyGames Official Strategy Guide'', page 19.</ref> The company is also presented as having a more public face, producing cosmetics, consumer products, and foods. Umbrella established multiple secret research facilities to help develop various bio-weapons. Its most prominent research facility is located in the [[Arklay Mountains]], just outside [[Raccoon City]], which was able to develop the \"T-virus\", a powerful [[mutagen]] that could dramatically alter living and recently dead organisms. The virus leaked and contaminated most of the Arklay Facility and its surrounding area, setting the stage for the first ''Resident Evil'' game. Following the destruction of Raccoon City, all of Umbrella's assets were frozen by the U.S. Government and its trading rights were revoked, effectively terminating its operations. However, it did not stop the rise of several [[bioterrorist]] organizations around the world, some of them making use of its research, leading to the foundation of B.S.A.A. In ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'', it is revealed that Umbrella has been reinstated and seemingly reformed as a mercenary group.\n\n====Oswell E. Spencer====\n: Voiced by (English): Adam D.

The virus subsequently spreads to Raccoon City during the events of ''Resident Evil 2'' and ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', prompting the U.S. government to attempt to contain the outbreak by ordering the destruction of the city.<ref>Leon Kennedy: \"Not taking any chances, the President of the United States ordered a contingency plan&nbsp;\u2014 to sterilize Raccoon City.\" Capcom, Resident Evil 4, Capcom, Nintendo GameCube, (in English), January 11, 2005.</ref> After the city's destruction, Spencer attempts to disguise the incident as a government conspiracy by hiring top lawyers and false witnesses. His actions prolong the legal proceedings, and allow the Umbrella Corporation to stay afloat for five more years. Ultimately, Wesker betrays Spencer by handing over secret documents to the U.S. government,<ref>Albert Wesker: \"My dear Spencer. How the mighty have fallen. Your Umbrella has folded and now you are a fugitive in the same world you once sought to control. We shall meet again before the conclusion of this drama.

He is eventually located by Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine prior to the events of ''Resident Evil 5'', but is swiftly killed by Wesker before the two can reach him. His first name is written as ''Oswell'' in the original version, but misspelled as \"Ozwell\" in the English version.\n\n====UBCS====\nOne of Umbrella's subsidiaries is UBCS (Umbrella Biohazard Countermeasure Service), a [[private military company]] with a highly trained security force composed of mostly war criminals and exiled soldiers<ref name=dm/> and capable of rescue and reconnaissance paramilitary operations.

After she becomes infected by the T-virus after a battle with [[Nemesis (Resident Evil)|the Nemesis]], he recovers a vaccine to treat her and successful in escapes the city alongside Jill. In the remake, Carlos' role as a playable character is expanded upon, including a brief excursion to the Raccoon City Police Department. He also appears as a playable character in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', where the events of ''Resident Evil 3'' are revisited in the \"Raccoon's Destruction\" scenario.\n\nIn the Resident Evil movie franchise, specifically in the second film, ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', he is briefly infected with the T-virus, but [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] is able to find a sample of the antivirus in time to cure him. In the third film, he and Alice parted company five years ago when Alice sought to protect her allies from the Umbrella satellites tracking her, but they meet again when he is travelling with a convoy led by Claire Redfield. When Carlos is bitten during an attempt to capture Alice, he volunteers to mount a suicide run on the umbrella complex tracking Alice after it takes a series of prisoners from the convoy, reasoning that there is no time to get a sample of the antivirus before the infection becomes permanent, taking a fuel tanker into the mass of zombies surrounding the base and then setting off a series of bombs, taking out a sizeable number of zombies and breaching the complex defenses.\n\n=====Mikhail Victor=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Benedict Campbell]] (''RE3''), [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] (''REmake 3'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Naoki Tamanoi (''REmake 3'')\n: Motion capture performance by: [[William Hope (actor)|William Hope]] (''REmake 3'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Mikhail Victor|\u30df\u30cf\u30a4\u30eb\u30fb\u30f4\u30a3\u30af\u30c8\u30fc\u30eb|Mihairu Vikut\u014dru}} is the leader of the UBCS Delta platoon that both Nicholai and Carlos are members of. According to his backstory, Mikhail is from [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia, and had originally served in the army before joining a rebel group. Mikhail was eventually arrested by Russian government forces and convicted for acts of terrorism. He was then coerced into leading the UBCS in exchange for his men's freedom.<ref name=rearchives>''Resident Evil Archives'', 2005, Capcom</ref> In the game, he appears already wounded, choosing to sacrifice his own life to save Jill and Carlos as he dies after being blown apart by his own grenade in a failed attempt to destroy the Nemesis. In an early draft of the story, Mikhail was originally scripted to be Nicholai's older brother, hence their common nationality and close ages (his original name was Mikhail Ginovaef).<ref name=rearchives/> Mihail also appears in the game's remake, maintaining the same role as the original game.

According to his backstory, Nicholai is from [[Moscow]] and served in the Russian [[Spetsnaz]] before joining the UBCS. He also has an unspoken rivalry with HUNK. In ''Resident Evil 3: Nemesis'', Nikolai is one of the few surviving operatives from the Delta platoon, along with Carlos and Mikhail. He disappears after an event in the first half of the game and is presumed dead until another encounter with him. It is revealed that Nikolai is in fact one of the Supervisors UBCS operatives, assigned to watch and gather combat data as their comrades fight against Umbrella's bio-weapons. Nicholai's fate depends on decisions made by the player, resulting in either his escape or death, either at the hand of Jill or the Nemesis. In the ''Resident Evil 3'' remake, Nicholai is changed to a mole implanted within the UBCS for an unnamed organization. Hired to mitigate the company's efforts to contain the T-Virus outbreak, he murders research staff and tries to gain and destroy a virus vaccine. In the final confrontation with Jill and Carlos, he is injured and left behind in Raccoon City. The English localization of ''[[Resident Evil Survivor]]'' features a document supposedly authored by Nicholai after the events of ''Nemesis''. The file is different in the original Japanese version and the Chinese localization of the PC port. The third entry of the document (the portion dated after the events of ''Nemesis'') was actually authored by the \"Umbrella B.O.W. Development Staff\", rather than Nikolai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projectumbrella.net/articles/Report-After-Raccoon-Citys-Collapse|title=Report After Raccoon City's Collapse|work=projectumbrella.net}}</ref> Nicholai also appears in ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak]]'' in the final scenario \"Decisions, Decisions\", which depicts the character conducting another mission occurring during the same time period as the second half of ''Resident Evil 3''. He is mentioned in ''The Umbrella Chronicles'', where he is referred to by the codename \"Silver Fox\". Nicholai's role in ''Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City'' was stopping Wolfpack from completing their mission objective.\n\nThe character was adapted for the film ''Resident Evil: Apocalypse'', although the film features a more heroic depiction of Nicholai, which differs from the game's original antagonistic portrayal of the character. In the film's novelization, he was renamed Nicholai Sokolov.

At the command room, they met Morgan Lansdale, who was collaborating with Jack Norman, and in the midst of betraying him. After that, the group escaped the city. In 2005, Parker and Jill followed Chris and Jessica's last known coordinates to a stranded cruise ship named ''Queen Zenobia'' in the Mediterranean Sea. They realized that the entire crew of the Queen Zenobia had been turned into monstrous bio organic weapons named Ooze and are forced to fight for their lives. On the ship's bridge, they are surprised to meet none other than Vester who claims to be there by orders of the FBC. After Jessica is revealed to be a traitor, she sets the Queen Zenobia to self-destruct. Parker was later seen dangling above end then falling into a series of explosions after the floor he was standing on collapsed.

Chris becomes disillusioned and disappears after recovering. Piers tracks down Chris and successfully convinces him to rejoin the BSAA to avenge his dead comrades. They are deployed to Lanshiang, China and tasked to stop a bio-terrorism attack. The duo are eventually led to an underwater laboratory that is being used to create powerful bio-organic weapons. Piers is severely injured during their final battle with the B.O.W., Haos, and injects himself with the C-virus to continue fighting. After he and Chris manage to defeat the Haos, they then attempt to escape the laboratory during its self-destruction sequence, but after realizing that he is beginning to succumb to the C-virus, Piers seals Chris inside an escape pod in order to ensure his survival, while he stays behind during the laboratory's destruction to prevent himself from mutating any further, sacrificing himself in the process. Right before his death, Piers manages to save Chris from the still-alive Haos by killing it as it attempts to destroy the escape pod Chris is in.

She first appears in ''Resident Evil 2'', running away and hiding in Raccoon City during the outbreak. She manages to find Leon and Claire, who protect her while trying to escape the city. Sherry is a playable character in some parts of the game but she is completely unarmed and can only avoid the monsters. Her father has been transformed into a monstrous creature by the G-virus and infects her, but Claire gives Sherry an anti-virus, which prevents her from mutating. Sherry assists Leon and Claire in boarding a secret underground train, and successfully escapes Raccoon City before it is destroyed. Sherry also appears in ''Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles'' in chapters that recapitulate the events of ''Resident Evil 2''. She returns as an adult in ''Resident Evil 6'' as a government agent escorting [[Jake Muller]] and seems to have acquired great healing abilities from the remnants of the G-virus in her body. During the course of the game, she helps Jake deal with the fact that Albert Wesker is his father. She also learns from Leon S. Kennedy that her superior, Derek C.

Simmons is the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and a close friend to Adam Benford. He is the leader of a secret organization known as \"The Family\", which uses its vast political influence to maintain world order. Simmons worries that Benford's plan to declassify the Raccoon City incident will create civil unrest around the world and tarnish the United States' reputation. He coerces Helena into infecting the president with the C-virus, and later causes viral outbreaks in Tall Oaks. Simmons is later betrayed by Carla Radames and infected with the C-virus. Simmons spontaneously switches between mutations as he fights Leon and Helena to the Quad Tower, where he finally falls to his death. A unique feature of Simmons' mutation is that he could absorb zombies to add more mass to his body, which took the form of a giant insect as a result.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 3 | quote = The Family has been manipulating the course of human development for a long time.

For now, they believe maintaining that stability is contingent upon keeping the United States at the top of the pyramid of world power. If the truth about the U.S. government's connections to Umbrella's bioweapons program were to get out, it would destabilize the world and remove America from the top of that hierarchy of power. Derek sets into motion a plan that will launch a bioterrorist attack and assassinate the president, thus preserving The Family's designs on power and stability.}}</ref>\n\n====Secret Service====\n=====Helena Harper=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Mayumi Sako]] (''RE6'')\n: Facial model by: [[Natasha Alam]]\nHelena Harper is an agent in the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Security Service]] (USSS) and the personal bodyguard of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] Adam Benford.

At the time of the 2004 Terragrigia Panic, Raymond was an inexperienced cadet in the FBC. Injured by Veltro's Farfarello, he was rescued by the more experienced agents Parker Luciani and Jessica Sherawat. Retreating back to the conference room where FBC Commissioner Morgan Lansdale was residing, Raymond stumbled upon a telephone conversation Lansdale was having with the Veltro leader, Jack Norman. Raymond became increasingly suspicious of his commanding officer, and knew that he was somehow involved with the bio-terrorist attack. However, he was unable to act on these suspicions, as the city was evacuated and destroyed soon after. At some point after this attack, Raymond became an informant for BSAA leader Clive R. O'Brian, operating as his mole within the FBC. O'Brian and Vester devised a plan to oust Lansdale as the architect of the Terragrigia attack through engineering the \"return\" of Veltro. Vester would pose as Jack Norman, and O'Brian used a mountain airbase to create the illusion that the terrorist group had resurfaced. In doing so, the two hoped to collect enough evidence to expose Lansdale. During the Queen Zenobia incident, O'Brian let slip that agents Jessica Sherawat and Chris Redfield were captured by Veltro aboard the Zenobia. Intercepting this information, Lansdale sent Vester and his partner Rachael to the ship to determine if the BSAA agents supposedly on board the vessel would pose any threat to him. Vester and O'Brian agreed to push forward the schedule of their plan. After boarding the ship, Vester, with and without his Veltro disguise, encountered Luciani and Valentine on the ship's bridge, making his presence known. Soon after, Agents Sherawat and Redfield boarded the vessel. Just as Raymond was about to reveal Lansdale's secrets to the group, Lansdale's mole, Jessica Sherawat, shot Raymond in the chest, causing him to fall from the balcony. Though Raymond was wearing a bulletproof vest and was unharmed by Jessica's shot, he faked his death while in her presence and whispered critical information about the conspiracy and her true identity. He later resurfaced and helped a gravely injured Luciani escape the sinking ship. Unbeknown to Parker, both Raymond and Jessica were agents of the pharmaceutical division of TRICELL, which had promoted the development of T-Abyss. The two met in a cafe in an unnamed European country, where Vester provided Sherawat with a sample of the T-Abyss.\n\n====Strategic Command====\n=====Bruce McGivern=====\n: Voiced by (English): Raj Ramayya (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Hiroaki Hirata]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nWhen a large amount of a recently developed hybrid viral agent known as the \"T+G Virus\" was stolen from the Umbrella Pharmaceuticals Development Center in [[Paris]] by a former Umbrella researcher, Bruce McGivern was sent in by the U.S. government to retrieve the virus and neutralize the threat in the [[Atlantic Ocean]] on board an Umbrella-owned luxury ocean liner, the ''Spencer Rain'', whose entire personnel on board have been infected with the T-virus stolen by the same former researcher, Morpheus D. Duvall, in September 2002. A member of the [[United States Strategic Command|USSTRATCOM]], McGivern is cocky and brash, and has a tendency to adopt a \"shoot first, ask questions later\" policy, with little regard for the consequences following his actions. This has often left him in many hostile situations, although in the end, he always somehow comes out on top. Confronted at the very beginning of the game by Duvall, he is saved by Chinese secret agent Fong Ling who throws a grenade at Morpheus (regardless of Bruce's life), seriously wounding the terrorist. He later works with her in order to stop Duvall's plan of unleashing the virus, bringing the fight to an underwater Umbrella secret laboratory which they ultimately destroy as Bruce kills a greatly mutated Duvall. At first at odds with Fong Ling, she and Bruce become closer as the story progresses, particularly after he saves her from an attempt on her life by her own government through the use of satellites armed with lasers. At the end of the game, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===People's Republic of China===\n====MSS====\n=====Fong Ling=====\n: Voiced by (English): Claire O'Connor (''Dead Aim'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Kae Araki]] (''Namco \u00d7 Capcom'')\n\nA Chinese intelligence agent employed by the [[Ministry of State Security (China)|Ministry of State Security of the People's Republic of China]], Fong is infamous for her cold and stoic demeanor. Upon learning of her brother's involvement in anti-government activism, Fong arrested him. Following his arrest, Fong's brother was swiftly executed, although she never questioned the actions of her boss and remained absolutely loyal, stopping at nothing to accomplish her objectives. She is sent by the Chinese government to the Umbrella-owned luxury liner ''Spencer Rain'' to stop former Umbrella scientist Morpheus Duvall's plans and retrieve the sample of the virus he stole from an Umbrella's lab in Paris. Initially apathetic towards the presence of a rival operative, Bruce McGivern, going so far as to throw a grenade at Duvall who was holding him at gunpoint, she allies with him in order to stop Duvall. At some point, the Chinese government betrays her and attempts to kill her through the use of satellites armed with lasers. But Bruce saves her. Though greatly shaken by this event, she decides to complete her mission and to keep working for her employers afterward. And from that moment on, she becomes closer to Bruce. After killing Duvall and destroying an Umbrella secret laboratory underwater, it is implied that Bruce and Fong will start a relationship.\n\n===NGOs===\nA [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) is an organization that is neither a part of a recognized government nor a conventional for-profit business.\n\n====TerraSave====\nTerraSave is a non-governmental human rights organization introduced in ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]''.\n\n=====Moira Burton=====\n: Voiced by (English): Marcella Lentz-Pope (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Ayumi Fujimura]] (''Revelations 2'')\n\nMoira is the eldest daughter of STARS veteran, Barry Burton. In ''Resident Evil: Revelations 2'', Moira and her TerraSave co-workers including Claire Redfield are captured and taken to an abandoned prison facility supervised by Alex Wesker. Moira is a secondary character in Claire's portion of the game. She refuses to use firearms after accidentally wounding her sister with a handgun as a child. Instead, Moira uses tools, such as crowbars, to break open boxes and to attack enemies. She is estranged from her father. Eventually while fighting a mutated Neil Fisher, who betrayed the Terra Save group, Moira overcomes her fear of using a gun in order to save Claire if the player selects this option, which is canon. Moira is separated from Claire and saved by Evgeny, a Russian man who later chooses death once his daughter is dead. Moira then returns to save her father and friends from Alex Wesker, who is now fully mutated. Alex, however, lives on through possessing to some degree Natalia, who had become Moira's adoptive sister.\n\n=====Neil Fisher=====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Yuri Lowenthal]] (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Eiji Hanawa (''Revelations 2'')\n\nNeil Fisher is a high-ranking member of TerraSave and senior officer of Claire Redfield. He was also involved with the organization's operations during the [[Resident Evil: Revelations|Terragrigia incident]], where he met and looked after a young Natalia Korda. However, unknown to other TerraSave members, Neil was affiliated with the FBC, primarily its director Morgan Lansdale. After it was disbanded during the events of ''Resident Evil: Revelations'', Neil plans to start another bioterrorist attack to justify the return of the FBC. To achieve this end, he contacts Alex Wesker and helps her organize the kidnapping of several members of TerraSave for experimentation with her T-Phobos virus. In return, he would receive a vial of Albert Wesker's Uroboros virus to start his bioterrorist attack. After helping Alex procure Natalia for the purposes of transferring her mind into the girl's body, she betrays Neil by injecting the virus into his body and sends him down to the lower levels of her tower, to fight Claire and Moira Burton. Mutating into a hulking beast, he is killed during their fight when shot at point-blank range in the head by either Claire or Moira (canonically the latter).\n\n====Neo-Umbrella====\n=====Carla Radames=====\n{{see also|Ada Wong}}\n\nCarla Radames is the primary antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''. She is the founder and leader of Neo-Umbrella, a terrorist organization that  strives on destroying  the current world order. Radames, a former government researcher, is the creator of the C-virus, a powerful mutagen capable of turning humans into capable and competent bio-organic weapons. Derek Simmons performs experiments on Carla which ultimately turn her into a clone of Ada Wong. While Carla possesses Ada's physical appearance and mannerisms, she still retains her original psyche. She also harbors a deep resentment towards Simmons, whom she believes stole her research and lifework. Radames personally oversees the bio-terror attacks in Europe, the United States, and China. She exacts revenge on Simmons by having her henchmen infect him with a potent dosage of the C-virus, which turns him into ravenous monster. She is fatally shot by a helicopter sent by the Family, but thanks to injecting herself with an enhanced C-virus, Radames mutated into a formless mass. She is eventually confronted and killed by Ada Wong.<ref>{{cite video game | title = [[Resident Evil 6]] | developer = [[Capcom]] | publisher = Capcom | date = 2012-10-02 | platform =[[Xbox 360]]  | level = Ada - Chapter 4 | quote = Carla Radames was responsible for the discovery of the C-Virus, and a close confidant of Derek C.

He chases after the intruder Ethan Winters inside a plantation mansion, or the \"Dulvey Haunted House\" as it is also referred to. Jack is a middle-aged man and a member of the Baker family who are victims of Eveline, and have captured Ethan's wife, Mia. The Bakers were thought to have vanished from the local community in Dulvey, Louisiana.\n\nNot long after the game was announced, Jack became known for his various one-liners such as \"Welcome to the family, son!\" heard in the various demo footage.<ref name=\"demo2\">{{cite news |last=Relph |first=Lauren |url=http://www.windowscentral.com/resident-evil-7-first-hour-true-ending-walkthrough |title=How to get the true ending in Resident Evil 7: First Hour demo for Xbox One and PC |work=Windows Central |date=2017-01-07 |accessdate=2017-01-22 }}</ref> Jack relentlessly pursues Ethan from area to area, being very strong and somehow appears to be nearly unstoppable. He uses a variety of weapons and can attack you even after being set ablaze when a car bursts into flames inside a garage. To prove to Ethan he is not human, he also takes his gun and seemingly dies after blowing his own head off, only to rise again and continue pursuing Ethan. Jack also murders a policeman who had come across Ethan after they entered the garage. During one such encounter, Ethan ultimately defeats Jack one last time after he has majorly mutated, but Jack later appears in a dream like scene as a normal man due to Ethan having used the serum to cure him. He still dies along with the rest of the Bakers, however, and is honored by Ethan when he says they were also victims of the tragedy that was Eveline. He returned as a major enemy in ''End of Zoe'' which is a [[downloadable content]] chapter that takes place after the main game.

They were responsible for the deaths of a local camera crew, but were really doing all of this to outsiders because Eveline had taken control of them, and before their infection, the Bakers were just an ordinary family. Marguerite was first shown in the various footage that was unveiled during 2016, including a clip featuring the scene where her family have the main protagonist Ethan Winters seated at the dinner table. Marguerite was more prominently featured in the ''Lantern'' demo, following Mia, Ethan's wife. She can summon insects to swarm together and attack Ethan, but he defeats her nonetheless. When she follows Mia, Mia must hide rather than face her in a battle. Like her other family members, she spouts a lot of profanity.\n\n=====Lucas Baker=====\n: Voiced by (English): Jesse Pimentel (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Setsuji Sat\u014d]] (''RE7'')\n\nLucas Baker is a primary antagonist in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' and a member of the Baker family. According to Sewer Gators producer Andre Stickland, he was the \"bad seed\" of the family. Lucas and his family had been missing since 2014, but are encountered by the protagonist Ethan Winters whilst he searches their derelict house for his missing wife, Mia. Lucas later forces Clancy (a cameraman) and Ethan to navigate a series of areas filled with traps, and monsters, as he mocks their progress. Clancy is killed after engaging a trap, and Ethan watches a tape that reveals how his death occurred to ensure that he does not suffer a similar fate. Lucas survives the events because he is never faced in combat. He also appears in the downloadable content \"Banned Footage\" chapters, but these side quests predate the main story.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-01-24-resident-evil-7-dlc-begins-rolling-out-next-week-on-ps4|title=Resident Evil 7 DLC begins rolling out next week on PS4|first=Tom|last=Phillips|date=24 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref> However, a new sub-chapter entitled ''Not a Hero'' is set after the main game.

During some scenes, Alex is clearly seen in her mutated form as well, and controls the \"Afflicted\". Alex had captured Natalia to experiment on her, intending to transfer her own consciousness into Natalia's body. Regardless of the ending achieved by the player in ''Revelations 2'', good or bad, Alex manages, possibly to different degrees, to transfer her mind into Natalia's body and take over it. In the bonus episode \"Little Miss\", which takes place before Barry's arrival to the island, players assume control of Natalia and her mysterious evil twin as they look for the toy bear Lottie. This reveals Alex had already started her experience and her mind was present in Natalia's subconscious as the \"evil twin\".\n\n====Ark Thompson====\n: Voiced by: [[Patrick Harlan]] (''Resident Evil: Survivor'')\n\nArk Thompson is an acquaintance of Leon S.

Mia went missing over 3 years ago after she sent a video message to Ethan, talking about how much she was looking forward to coming home. Ethan then suddenly receives a disturbing video message and an email from Mia, so he tells an unknown friend that he is heading out to search for her in Dulvey, Louisiana. This leads him to a derelict plantation mansion, that also happens to be the home of the deranged Baker family, who have been driven insane due to being infected with the Mold from Eveline.\n\nAfter viewing a tape he finds regarding a camera crew being attacked in the same house, he soon finds his wife in a hidden area lying in a cell, but Mia acts peculiar as they look for a way out, and disappears. She then attacks Ethan with a kitchen knife. The ensuing chaos leads to Mia throwing Ethan through a wall. However, he manages to \"kill\" her using an ax and pistol. Eventually, she gets up, corners Ethan, and pins him to the wall by his hand with a screwdriver, then cuts off Ethan's pinned hand. Ethan knocks Mia out, and then suddenly, a man attacks Ethan and knocks him out, taking both Ethan and Mia back inside the house. Ethan's severed hand is reattached by a woman named Zoe (the only sane member of the Baker family) and then later, Ethan manages to become untied at the dinner table due to a police officer ringing a telephone, which distracted the Bakers, who were planning to torture him for refusing to eat with them. Ethan manages to fully mend his hand but learns that the Bakers cannot be \"killed\" very easily.\n\nMia, as it turns out, is also infected by Eveline, as is Zoe, and therefore not dead. Although Mia and Zoe have to find a way to escape as well. However, Zoe explains that they need to be cured first using a serum as they cannot leave until this is fulfilled. Ethan also encounters other abnormal monsters created by Eveline, such as the creatures called the Molded. But escaping the premises is made extremely difficult, as the Bakers relentlessly pursue him, and Ethan has to protect himself using whatever means he can find, so he can ultimately overcome each family member.\n\nEthan attempts to get in contact with a military group for his rescue while learning more about Eveline as an \"E-Series\" Bioweapon. After Ethan is assisted by the military group via chopper and finally puts a stop to Eveline, he and Mia are rescued by Chris Redfield, who is working with the newly reformed Umbrella Corporation.

He later learns his missing daughter named Irina is already dead and feeling unwell, Evgeny chooses to die in the underground, with Evgeny and Moira revealing their names to each other just before he passes. His body is eventually found by Barry and Natalia.\n\n====Eveline====\n: Voiced by (English): Patricia McNeely (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), Paula Rhodes (''RE7'' (Young))\n: Voiced by (Japanese): Yuri Tabata (''RE7'' (Old Woman)), [[Sumire Morohoshi]] (''RE7'' (Young))\n\nEveline is the main antagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''. Considered as an \"E-Class\" B.O.W. codenamed \"E-001\", Eveline is a [[Genetic engineering|genetically]] [[Human enhancement|enhanced]] human created by a mysterious group called \"The Connections\" with the help from H.C.F (one of the companies owned by Albert Wesker) by fusing a Progenitor-enhanced fungus called Mutamycete into her genome during embryonic stage. Designed for the company's NEXBAS (Next-generation experimental battlefield superiority) initiative, the project was designed to create a B.O.W. capable of blending in with the population, neutralizing combatants without direct contact and converting enemies into allies. Ultimately, the project folded due to reservations regarding methodology and the difficultly of controlling the resultant product B.O.W., particularly in comparison to other projects. Eveline was the first successful E-Class prototype. She infected people using mold and fungus, allowing her to create a legion of people that she perceived as her \"family\", and thereby command and convert them into the \"Molded\". Due to the bioweapon's destructive abilities and mind control capabilities,  E-Class project materials were sought after by rival companies.  This state of affairs resulted in Mia Winters and Alan Droney, members of The Connections, travelling with Eveline upon a cargo ship bound for a facility in Central America.  When a hurricane hit the ship, Eveline became unstable.  Eveline infected Alan, and turned the crew into the Molded. Mia has no choice but to track Eveline and kill the former crew. Mia was helpless as Eveline killed Alan and subsequently infected her.  Mia attempted to send Ethan a second video message prior to the ship's destruction, wish him a happy life and urging him not to search for her.\n\nEveline and Mia were both later found and taken in by the Baker family, who happened upon the husk of the cargo ship in the Louisiana bayou. Eveline infected the Baker family within the month, on which put them under her control. Two years after, Eveline's mind and body were deteriorating rapidly due to lack of her medication and the degenerative effects of her condition, prompting her to demand the Bakers to add more people to her family by kidnapping or killing them. Zoe Baker was the only one not affected by Eveline's mind control while brother Lucas Baker was subsequently cured and pretended to work with his family, cognizant that Eveline was a threat.\n\nAfter Ethan arrived at the Baker family residence, he was helped by Zoe. When he finally learned of Eveline's origins, he used the equipment in the lab deep in the nearby Salt Mines to develop a necrotoxin using Eveline's DNA, which was capable of killing her. He succeeded on injecting Eveline with the necroxtoin, in the process learning that Eveline's true form is actually that of an old woman, demonstrating that rapid aging was an unintended byproduct of the project, as had been implied by internal project documents. After Eveline is injected with the necrotoxin, she mutated into a giant grotesque form as her powers spiral out of control. With the help from the reformed Umbrella Corporation and Chris Redfield, Ethan succeeded in fully killing Eveline before being rescued.\n\n====Jake Muller====\n: Voiced by (English): [[Troy Baker]] (''RE6'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Daisuke Namikawa]] (''RE6'')\n: Motion capture: [[Troy Baker]], Daniel Southworth (stunt double)\n\nJake Muller is the son of the Albert Wesker, a eugenicist, virologist and bioterrorist, who formerly worked for Umbrella. It is believed that Wesker was not aware of his sons existence, as Jake's Mother left shortly after being impregnated by him. Jake, later works as a freelance mercenary in order to support his mother, whom dies of an unknown chronic disease shortly after Jake receives money for her treatment. Jake was caught up in an act of bioterrorism while operating in anti-government operations in the fictional  Eastern European republic of Edonia. His mercenary comrades are infected with the C-virus, but Jake's specialized blood resists the infection. Soon after, he meets US government agent Sherry Birkin \u2013 whose father, William Birkin, was coincidentally Albert's research partner. Sherry and Jake take part in the subsequent battle between the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance and the mutated mercenaries.<ref name=\"Jake's story\">{{cite web|url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/bio6/story_jake.html|title=CAPCOM\uff1aBIOHAZARD 6 \u516c\u5f0f\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8 - STORY|work=capcom.co.jp}}</ref> With his blood resistant to the downside-effects of mutagenic viruses like his father, Jake also inherited several of his father's signature abilities such as increased strength, speed, healing, and advanced combat skills. He demands a large sum of money from the BSAA, in order to sample a pint of his blood to be synthesize for vaccination to combat the C-virus. He and Sherry are captured by Carla Radames, a doppelg\u00e4nger of Ada Wong, and held captive in Lanshiang, China. They escape during the C-virus outbreak in the city six months later. Over the course of the story of ''RE6'', Jake comes to terms with both the knowledge of his father's actions and of his death at the hands of Chris Redfield three years earlier. After the ordeal, Jake starts a new life fighting BOWs in an underdeveloped country with his real identity covered up by the BSAA.\n\n====Joe Baker====\n:Voiced by (English): Gage Maverik (''RE7'')\n:Voiced by (Japanese): [[K\u014dsei Hirota]] (''RE7'')\nJoe Baker is the main protagonist in the ''End of Zoe'' [[downloadable content]] chapter, for ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-7-biohazards-not-a-hero-end-of-zoe-d/1100-6454102/|title=Resident Evil 7: Biohazard's Not A Hero, End Of Zoe DLC Further Detailed With New Trailer|first=Chris|last=Pereira|date=17 October 2017|publisher=}}</ref> The brother of Jack Baker, he lives in the nearby swamplands near the Baker estate, though is isolated from the rest of the family and unaffected by Eveline's control. During the chapter, Joe discovers his niece, Zoe, shortly after the events of the main game and tries to find a cure to free her from Eveline's influence. To do so, he battles against the remnants of the molded creatures created by the Bakers and a mysterious creature chasing after them, later revealed to be a resurrected Jack. Joe ultimately kills his brother and is able to cure Zoe, after which they are found and extracted by the Umbrella Corps. Although he can use firearms, Joe mostly fights with his bare hands, though later acquires an Umbrella Corps glove to increase his strength prior to his final battle with Jack.\n\n====Katherine Warren====\nKatherine Warren is the daughter of Raccoon City's Mayor, Michael Warren. Left behind in Raccoon City by her father, she is left in the care of Chief Brian Irons. Driven insane by the outbreak, Irons instead murders Katherine, planning to stuff her body and keep it as part of his taxidermy collection. Warren's body appears in both versions of ''Resident Evil 2'' and its retelling ''The Darkside Chronicles''. She appears in the remake's ''Ghost Survivors'' DLC story \"Runaway\", which takes place outside of the main series canon.<ref>https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3546471/capcom-offers-details-resident-evil-2-dlc-ghost-survivors/</ref>\n\n====Lisa Trevor====\n{{Nihongo|Lisa Trevor|\u30ea\u30b5\u30fb\u30c8\u30ec\u30f4\u30a1\u30fc|Risa Torev\u0101}} is a character and enemy in the remake of ''Resident Evil'' and ''The Umbrella Chronicles''.<ref>Damien Waples, \"The Infected: Lisa Trevor,\" ''Resident Evil: The Umbrella Chronicles Prima's Official Game Guide'' (Roseville: Random House, Inc., 2007), 27.</ref> Lisa Trevor is the daughter of George Trevor, the architect behind Ozwell Spencer's Arklay Mansion and the Queen Zenobia cruiser, and his wife Jessica.

A member of an unnamed organization, possibly a former rival of Umbrella, Mia was tasked with escorting a bio-weapon called Eveline to another facility. However, the tanker is attacked and crashes in a [[Louisiana]]n swamp. Found by the Baker family, Eveline infects them, planning to start a family of its own, hence the reason Mia and the Bakers were its earliest known victims. However, Mia also briefly serves as an antagonist due to being infected by Eveline, causing her to attack her husband shortly after he found her in a holding cell beneath the house. Mia is seemingly \"killed\" by her husband in self-defense after having an axe plunged into her neck, but despite this, she isn't truly dead because of Eveline.\n\nBoth Mia and Ethan are taken by Jack Baker, and Mia recovers off screen. From that point on, Mia works with a woman called Zoe (who is revealed to be a Baker) and Ethan tries to save them by receiving hints from Zoe when she telephones him, while Ethan is having to deal with constant attacks perpetrated by the other Bakers. In some parts of the game, Mia is playable too, but sometimes she has to hide rather than confront enemies. After using a cure created by Zoe to kill Jack, Ethan must use the remaining vial to save either Mia or Zoe. Depending on a choice made by the player, Ethan can either cure Mia and attempt to escape with her, or choose Zoe, leaving her behind. After Ethan and the person he chose to save is attacked, the player once again takes control of Mia, searching the tanker for him. After freeing him, Mia will start to become possessed by Eveline again. Depending on the player's earlier decision, Mia will separate herself from Ethan to save him or allow Eveline to take control of her, forcing Ethan to kill her. If the former plays out, she will be recovered by [[Umbrella Corps]] mercenaries, reuniting with Ethan as the game ends.\n\n====Natalia Korda====\n: Voiced by (English): Gabriella Pastore (''Revelations 2'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Aoi Y\u016bki]] (''Revelations 2'')\nA young girl who is a playable character in ''[[Resident Evil: Revelations 2]]''. Natalia accompanies [[Barry Burton]] immediately when he arrives on an island to search for his missing daughter, Moira. Natalia explains that she is an orphan due to the death of her parents. Natalia can find items that are hidden, detect the presence of invisible or off-screen enemies (indicated by a glowing effect) and go through small passageways to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Since Natalia cannot use any firearms, she can pick up bricks to throw at any monsters, but often has to evade the monsters.\n\nAlex Wesker targets Natalia throughout the course of the plot in order to [[mind uploading|mind transfer herself]] into her, believing she is not \"true\" like she is. Alex (when in a grotesque form near the climax of the game), causes Natalia's fear to reach its highest on her wrist bracelet, but it is not explained what happens to Natalia. In a prequel segment, '''Dark Natalia''' joined Natalia to help find \"Lottie\", Natalia's beloved teddy bear, and she then begins her association with Barry, now having the ability to see any monsters that Barry cannot always notice. In the true ending, it was revealed prior to Alex mutating into her third and final form that she was able to transfer her mind into Natalia's body up until the young girl's body had been fully taken over by Alex, in 2013. Barry adopts Natalia after Alex is killed, but she is seen reading a piece by [[Franz Kafka]] then smiling, so Alex succeeded to some degree.\n\n====Robert Kendo====\n:Voiced by (English): Gary Krawford (RE2), Jason C. Miller (DC)\n:Voiced by (Japanese): Hideki Tanaka (REmake 2)\nRobert Kendo is the owner of a gun store in Raccoon City. He and his brother Joseph are responsible for creating the Samurai Edge pistols used by S.T.A.R.S. members.  In the original ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', he briefly appears in the opening of Scenario A, allowing the player to stay in his gunshop for protection. However, zombies soon break in and devour Kendo, leaving a weapon for the player to pick up. In the remake, Robert confronts Leon S. Kennedy and Ada Wong as they attempt to pass through the shop to reach the sewers. It's also revealed he has a daughter, Emma, who he tries to protect from the outbreak. However, she is infected and Robert is forced to kill her. Kendo also appears in the game's ''The Ghost Survivors'' DLC as the player character in \"No Time to Mourn\". A non-canonical scenario, it follows him as he attempts to escape Raccoon City.<ref>https://www.altchar.com/games-news/586950/resident-evil-2-remake-will-get-three-free-dlc-stories</ref><ref>https://www.gamesradar.com/resident-evil-2-the-ghost-survivors-detailed-ahead-of-the-free-dlcs-launch-this-friday/</ref> He also appears in ''The Darkside Chronicles'', though is killed offscreen before he encounters either Leon or Claire.\n\n====Steve Burnside====\n: Voiced by: Bill Houston (''Code Veronica''), [[Sam Riegel]] (''The Darkside Chronicles'')\n\n{{Nihongo|Steve Burnside|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30d6\u30fb\u30d0\u30fc\u30f3\u30b5\u30a4\u30c9|Sut\u012bbu B\u0101nsaido}} is [[Claire Redfield]]'s partner in the game ''Resident Evil Code: Veronica''. Steve was imprisoned in the Rockfort Island's facility alongside his father, a former Umbrella employee. He escapes from his cell during the viral outbreak. At first, Steve is hesitant to trust Claire and only cooperates with her reluctantly, but later becomes more open and attached to her after he is forced to kill his own father, who has become a zombie during the outbreak. Steve and Claire eventually end up in Umbrella's Antarctic Facility, where he is captured by Alexia and used as a test subject for the T-Veronica virus. Claire meets a chained Steve, who mutates into a monster and attacks Claire; in this form, he is nearly invulnerable to damage, and wields a giant, ceremonial axe. While running from Steve, Claire is attacked by one of Alexia's tentacles. Steve, seeing this, regains control of his mind and cuts the tentacle apart, freeing Claire. In retaliation, Alexia strikes him with one of the tentacles, inflicting a mortal wound. His failing body finally rejects the mutation, and he changes back. He dies in Claire's arms, just after professing his love to her. He was later taken by Albert Wesker due to the T-Veronica virus in his body, and also hinted that he might come back to life. In ''The Darkside Chronicles'' it is revealed that Wesker contacted the drug baron Javier Hidalgo and took a sample of T-Veronica from Steve's corpse in order to sell the virus for Hidalgo's ailing daughter, Manuela.\n\n====Zoe Baker====\n: Voiced by (English): Giselle Gilbert (''RE7'')\n: Voiced by (Japanese): [[Y\u016b Kobayashi]] (''RE7'')\n: Face model: [[Ananda Jacobs]] (''RE7'')<ref>{{cite web|url=https://anandajacobs.com/about|title=About \u2014 Ananda Jacobs|website=anandajacobs.com|accessdate=June 7, 2019}}</ref>\n\nZoe is the youngest member of the Baker family in ''[[Resident Evil 7: Biohazard]]'' set in 2017, and despite being infected by Eveline like the rest of her family, Zoe is somewhat normal, and serves as a supporting character. Zoe gets in contact with Ethan Winters by telephone several times, asking Ethan if \"Daddy\" gave him a hard time, as well as giving him tips on how to advance through the area. She was also the person who attached Ethan's severed hand back on after his wife Mia had cut it off, when she temporarily turned crazy. Working alongside of Mia thereafter, Zoe explains to Ethan that due to being infected, a serum needs to be given to each of them before they can escape too. Unfortunately, Ethan has to use one of the two vials to stop the heavily mutated Jack Baker when he returned yet again to try to finish off Ethan, leaving only one dosage remaining. The player can then choose to cure either Mia or Zoe, leading to an alternate story playing out: If Mia is selected, Zoe stays behind to die with the rest of her family, displaying anger over the fact that she felt she never had a future. It is unknown if she is alive during this path, but she is seen during Ethan and Jack's conversation scene. If Zoe is chosen to be cured, she and Ethan try to escape. However, they are both attacked by Eveline, during which Zoe is engulfed by her, killing her.\n\nIn the ''Daughters'' [[downloadable content]] sub-chapter, players control Zoe Baker<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameranx.com/features/id/93190/article/resident-evil-7-daughters-dlc-how-to-unlock-all-the-endings/ |title=Resident Evil 7: Daughters DLC {{!}} How to Unlock All The Endings |website=gameranx.com}}</ref> just as her father rescues Mia and Eveline out in the swamp. Jack brings Eveline into their home during stormy weather to rest up in Lucas' bedroom, but as Zoe is about to change her wet clothes, Eveline looks up, saying, \"They're mine now!\" and then runs off, laughing maniacally. The power goes out at the same time. Eveline has begun converting the Bakers to her cause, as Zoe finds her mother has gone crazy and attempts to attack her. Jack tries to hold off Marguerite and tells Zoe to get rope from the garage, but by the time she comes back upstairs with it, Jack has already turned, trying to drown Marguerite in the bathtub, and Zoe has to escape through the recreation room as he gives chase. She also witnesses her father dragging Lucas along a hallway. This canonical prequel chapter is strategy based, as Zoe must flee from rather than fight her parents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.primagames.com/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard/tips/resident-evil-7-how-get-true-ending-daughters-dlc-tape|title=Resident Evil 7 - How to Get the True Ending of the Daughters DLC Tape|website=Prima Games}}</ref> There's two possible endings: Zoe can either enter the trailer after finding out the passcode number from the attic to learn of the location of a key item, and finds Mia in her trailer, as well as an important note she wrote, or she can use the car keys given to her by her mother, which results in a poor ending due to the player choosing the \"wrong path\" for Zoe.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2017/05/02/resident-evil-7-walkthrough-how-to-get-best-ending-banned-footage-vol-2/|title=Resident Evil 7 Daughters walkthrough: how to get the best ending in Banned Footage Vol 2 DLC|date=2 May 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nHer uncle Joe finds Zoe and two Umbrella operatives who claim they are trying to save her. He takes one hostage, but he later gets killed by Jack. Joe fist fights his way through a marsh to locate a cure. He injects Zoe with some serum he took off a dead soldier, but it only partially heals her. Out in the swamp, he has to get the other half, and ultimately kill his brother, the very much alive, but horribly mutated Jack.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].\n\n[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east\u2013west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.\nDespite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name=\"Toll Road Revenue\">{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B\u20131 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]]]]\nAustin's airport is [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

The first segment was opened in November 2006, which was located east of [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] at Austin's southeast corner on [[State Highway 71 (Texas)|State Highway 71]]. Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

With an aggressive marketing campaign and relatively low price for a Swiss-made watch, it gained instant popularity in its home market.
