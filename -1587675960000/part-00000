This is where new student Steven Karp ([[Jay Baruchel]]) takes his love interest Lizzie ([[Carla Gallo]]) on their first date. Karp tries to heckle Nugent during his speech in an attempt to impress Lizzie, with disastrous results. FOX didn't like the idea of Nugent and his political views appearing on this show, so the episode was re-shot and re-edited as \"Oh, So You Have a Boyfriend?\" which aired without any Ted Nugent content whatsoever.

{"title_page": "Coaching tree", "text_new": "{{more footnotes|date=January 2011}}\nA '''coaching tree''' is similar to a [[family tree]] except that it shows the relationships of [[Coach (sport)|coaches]] instead of family members. There are several ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.\n\nIn October 2018, [[The Washington Post]] published their own article about NFL coaching trees, mapping out the roots, influences and origins of every active NFL head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/sports/nfl-coaching-trees-connecting-every-active-coach/|title=Branching out: Mapping the roots, influences and origins of every active head coach|first=Adam|last=Kilgore|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 12, 2018|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCoaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Coaching Trees.GIF]]\n\n==Philosophical tree connections==\nCoaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:\n\n*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Bill Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant coaches under him who have went on to become head coaches in both the NFL and college, and then sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* '''[[Bill Belichick]]'''\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.

There are several ways to define a relationship between two coaches. The most common way to make the distinction is if a coach worked as an assistant on a particular head coach's staff for at least a season then that coach can be counted as being a branch on the head coach's coaching tree. Coaching trees can also show philosophical influence from one head coach to an assistant.\n\nCoaching trees are common in the [[National Football League]] and most coaches in the NFL can trace their lineage back to a certain head coach for whom they previously worked as an assistant.\n\nThe phrase \"coaching tree\" has also grown to refer colloquially to any idea or set of ideas originated by an individual or group. For example, an individual may claim an original idiom or phrase as part of his or her coaching tree if used by another individual.\n\nCoaching trees are becoming more prominent in today's NFL culture. They are often referenced by various media outlets, such as ESPN.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/s/westcoast/history.html|title=All roads lead to Walsh...sort of|work=ESPN.com|first=Len|last= Pasquarelli}}</ref>\n\n==Example==\nIn 1998, half of the active head coaches in the [[National Football League]] could be traced to [[Bill Walsh (American football coach)|Bill Walsh]] and [[Tom Landry]].  Of those fifteen coaches, four (plus Walsh and Landry) had coached a [[Super Bowl]] winning team.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = Maxwell\n | first = John\n | authorlink = John C.

The Colts later hired [[Frank Reich]]. The only three NFL head coaches who couldn't be connected to either Parcells or Belichick, according to this said article, were the following coaches: [[Andy Reid]] of the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], [[Matt Nagy]] of the [[Chicago Bears]], and [[Doug Pederson]] of the [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. Incidentally, both Pederson and Nagy were once former assistants under Reid before becoming head coaches. Additionally, before Reich became head coach of the Colts, he served as Pederson's offensive coordinator of the Eagles, and helped Philadelphia win [[Super Bowl LII]]. Therefore, Reich is connected to Reid through Pederson.\n\nIn October 2018, [[The Washington Post]] published their own article about NFL coaching trees, mapping out the roots, influences and origins of every active NFL head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/sports/nfl-coaching-trees-connecting-every-active-coach/|title=Branching out: Mapping the roots, influences and origins of every active head coach|first=Adam|last=Kilgore|publisher=Washington Post|date=October 12, 2018|accessdate=April 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nCoaching tree examples (shown visually below) include Bill Walsh, [[Marty Schottenheimer]], and Bill Parcells.\n{{Clear}}\n[[File:Coaching Trees.GIF]]\n\n==Philosophical tree connections==\nCoaching trees can also show a philosophical relationship between a mentor head coach and their prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Below is a list of current and former head coaches and who they primarily developed their philosophy under:\n\n*[[Norv Turner]]: Most recently, Turner worked as an offensive coordinator under [[Mike Nolan]] in [[San Francisco 49ers|San Francisco]]. However, Nolan previously worked under Turner when he was the head coach with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] as a defensive coordinator 1997-1999. Also, before getting his first head coaching job with the [[Washington Redskins|Redskins]] in 1994, Turner worked under both [[John Robinson (football coach)|John Robinson]] in [[Los Angeles Rams|Los Angeles]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] in [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]].<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7475052_ITM Turner article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Wade Phillips]]: Coached under [[Marty Schottenheimer]], but primarily learned his philosophy from his father, [[Bum Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/5076766.html|title=Cowboys' Phillips makes name for himself in coaching|first=Dale|last= Robertson|date= August 23, 2007|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Jon Gruden]]: Worked under [[Mike Holmgren]] in [[Green Bay Packers|Green Bay]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/2007-09-07-2975455381_x.htm|title=Seahawks' Holmgren has what former protege Gruden wants with Bucs|work=[[USA Today]]|date=September 7, 2007|first=Gregg|last= Bell|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Tony Dungy]]: Dungy is listed above as part of the Schottenheimer coaching tree and was a Defensive Coordinator under Dennis Green. However, Dungy attributes most of his coaching style from tutelage under [[Chuck Noll]]. Noll learned much of his own philosophy from [[Paul Brown]]. Noll coached Dungy as a player and also gave him his first NFL position as the defensive backs coach of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. Dungy later became the defensive coordinator for the Steelers.<ref>[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2007/07/28/dungy-drops-chuck-nolls-name-again/ Dungy article]{{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref>\n*[[Todd Haley]]: Coached under [[Bill Parcells]] and learned his philosophy from him for many years before joining [[Ken Whisenhunt]] in Arizona, in 2007.\n*[[Steve Spagnuolo]]: While Spagnuolo is credited under [[Tom Coughlin]] and Bill Parcells tree, he studied and learned much of his style and system during his tenure in [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]] under [[Jim Johnson (American football)|Jim Johnson]] and [[Andy Reid]]. Spagnuolo took Johnson's style of play to [[New York Giants|New York]] where he gained national attention for his scheming and personnel packages that helped shut down [[New England Patriots|New England]] in the [[Super Bowl XLII|Super Bowl]], one of the biggest upsets in NFL history. He then took that defense to [[St. Louis Rams|St. Louis]].\n*[[Jack Del Rio]]: Del Rio worked under [[Marvin Lewis]] on the [[Baltimore Ravens|Ravens]]' defensive staff. However, Del R\u00edo got his coaching start from [[Mike Ditka]] in [[New Orleans Saints|New Orleans]], and then worked as defensive coordinator under [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]] in [[Carolina Panthers|Carolina]] before being hired by [[Jacksonville Jaguars|Jacksonville]] in [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|2003]].\n\nAdditionally, many college football coaches worked as assistants for head coaches on the tree. For instance, [[Bill Belichick]] can claim [[Kirk Ferentz]], [[Nick Saban]], and [[Charlie Weis]] as descendants of his tree, though they are not included in the graphic above.\n*Bum Phillips coached under Gillman with the Oilers, and was chosen by Gillman to succeed him upon Gillman's stepping down from the head coaching job of the Houston Oilers.\n\n==The Bill Belichick Tree==\n\nThe Bill Belichick coaching tree is far reaching<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/22235093/connecting-all-2018-nfl-head-coaches-bill-parcells-bill-belichick|title=The Bill & Bill League: How nearly every coach traces to two men|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stadiumtalk.com/s/bill-belichicks-coaching-tree-14f9b4e309524d4d|title=Bill Belichick's Coaching Tree|website=www.stadiumtalk.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/extra-points/2015/01/03/bill_belichicks_coaching_tree_has_branches_both_fu|title=Bill Belichick\u2019s Coaching Tree Has Branches Both Lush and Barren {{!}} Boston.com|website=www.boston.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> due to the 17 assistant coaches under him who have went on to become head coaches in both the NFL and college, and then sprouted their own trees leading to  over 100 total offshoots which include 13 active NFL head coaches.\n* '''[[Bill Belichick]]'''\n\n**[[Nick Saban]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fanbuzz.com/college-football/sec/alabama/nick-saban-coaching-tree/|title=Nick Saban\u2019s Coaching Tree May Be His Greatest Achievement|last=Pinak|first=Patrick|date=2019-12-26|website=FanBuzz - Sports News - NFL {{!}} NCAA {{!}} NBA {{!}}  WWE|language=en|access-date=2020-04-13}}</ref> [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (1995\u20131999), [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]] (2000\u20132004),  [[Miami Dolphins]] (2005\u20132006),[[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] (2007\u2013present)\n***[[Dean Pees]], [[Kent State Golden Flashes football|Kent State]] (1998\u20132003)\n*** [[Bobby Williams]], [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2000\u20132002)\n**** [[Don Treadwell]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2011\u20132013)\n**** [[Ben McAdoo]], [[New York Giants]] (2016\u20132017)\n*** [[Mark Dantonio]], [[Cincinnati Bearcats football|Cincinnati]] (2004\u20132006), [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] (2007\u20132020) \n****[[Dan Enos]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] (2010\u20132014)\n**** [[Pat Narduzzi]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers football|Pittsburgh]] (2015\u2013present)\n***** [[Josh Conklin]], [[Wofford Terriers football|Wofford]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Brad Salem]], [[Augustana College (Illinois)]] (2005\u20132009)\n*** [[Scott Linehan]], [[St. Louis Rams]] (2006\u20132008) \n*** [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]], [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football|Louisiana Tech]] (2007\u20132009), [[Tennessee Volunteers football|Tennessee]] (2010\u20132012)\n**** [[Tommy Spangler]], [[Presbyterian Blue Hose football|Presbyterian]] (2017\u2013present)\n****[[Justin Wilcox (American football)|Justin Wilcox]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]] (2017\u2013present) \n***** [[Beau Baldwin]], [[Cal Poly Mustangs football|Cal Poly]] (2020\u2013present)\n**** [[Frank Scelfo]], [[Southeastern Louisiana Lions football|Southeastern Louisiana]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Sam Pittman]], [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] (2020-present)\n*** [[Josh McDaniels]], [[Denver Broncos]] (2009\u20132010) (first served under Saban)\n*** [[Michael Haywood|Mike Haywood]], [[Miami RedHawks football|Miami (OH)]] (2009\u20132010), [[Texas Southern Tigers football|Texas Southern]] (2016\u20132018)\n*** [[Jimbo Fisher]], [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2010\u20132017), [[Texas A&M Aggies football|Texas A&M]] (2018\u2013present)\n**** [[Mark Stoops]], [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] (2013\u2013present)\n***** [[Neal Brown]], [[Troy Trojans football|Troy]] (2015\u20132018); [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (2019\u2013present)\n***** [[Dean Hood]], [[Murray State Racers football|Murray State]] (2019-present)\n**** [[Randy Sanders]], [[East Tennessee State Buccaneers football|East Tennessee State]] (2018\u2013present)\n*** [[Jason Garrett]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] (2011\u20132019)\n*** [[Curt Cignetti]], [[IUP Crimson Hawks football|IUP]] (2011\u20132016), [[Elon Phoenix football|Elon]] (2017\u20132018), [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] (2019\u2013present)\n*** [[Pat Shurmur]], [[Cleveland Browns]] (2011\u20132012), [[New York Giants]] (2018\u20132019)\n**** [[Mark Whipple]], [[UMass Minutemen football|UMass]] (2014\u20132018)\n*** [[Will Muschamp]], [[Florida Gators football|Florida]] (2011\u20132014), [[South Carolina Gamecocks football|South Carolina]] (2016\u2013present) \n**** [[D.

[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards). Fields and plantations, which may easily be harmed, may usually not be crossed except in the winter. It is also possible to establish outdoor recreation routes on private land, based on an agreement on the rights of use or by official proceedings in accordance with the Outdoor Recreation Act, for example.<ref name=\"Ministry of the Environment\">{{Cite book |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/handle/10138/159060 |title=Everyman's rights and the code of conduct on private land |date=December 2015 |publisher=Ministry of the Environmentnd |isbn=9789521144561 |access-date=2015-12-01}}</ref>\n\nOne may stay or set up camp temporarily in the countryside, a reasonable distance from homes, pick mineral samples, wild berries, mushrooms and flowers (as long as they are not protected species). One may [[Angling|fish with a rod and line]] (only still waters), row, sail or use a motorboat on waterways (with certain restrictions), and swim or bathe in both inland waters and the sea. One can walk, ski and ice fish on frozen lakes, rivers and the sea. Income from selling picked berries or mushrooms is tax-free.

However, the exact definition remains mostly uncodified and based on the principle of ''[[nulla poena sine lege]]'' (what is not illegal cannot be punished).\n\n==== Norway ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nEveryone in Norway enjoys the right of access to, and passage through, uncultivated land in the countryside. The right is an old [[consuetudinary]] law called the ''allemannsrett'' (lit. the everyman's right), that was codified in 1957 with the implementation of the Outdoor Recreation Act.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.regjeringen.no/en/doc/Laws/Acts/Outdoor-Recreation-Act.html?id=172932 |title=Outdoor Recreation Act |date=28 June 1957 |publisher=regjeringen.no |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref> It is based on respect for the countryside, and all visitors are expected to show consideration for farmers and landowners, other users and the environment. In Norway the terms ''utmark'' and ''innmark'' divide areas where the right to roam is valid (''utmark'', literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out Field]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (''innmark'', \"land inside [the boundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies ''innmark'' thoroughly,<ref>\"g\u00e5rdsplass, hustomt, dyrket mark, engsl\u00e5tt, kulturbeite og skogplantefelt og liknende omr\u00e5der hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier eller bruker. Udyrkede, mindre grunnstykker som ligger i dyrket mark eller engsl\u00e5tt eller er gjerdet inn sammen med slikt omr\u00e5de, regnes ogs\u00e5 som innmark. Det samme gjelder omr\u00e5der for industrielt eller annen s\u00e6rlig \u00f8yemed hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier, bruker eller andre.\"{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}<!-- This extended quotation should be rendered in english on this en:wp --></ref> and all areas not covered by this definition are defined as ''utmark'', generally speaking uninhabited and uncultivated areas. Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref>\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

Restrictions apply for [[nature reserve]]s and other protected areas. It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon''). The ''hemfridszon's'' size depends on conditions but can be as large as 70 metres from an ordinary dwelling house.<ref name=\"NaturBB\" /> To better protect access to water and the right to walk along beaches, it is since 1975 generally not permitted to build a new house near (generally 100 m) from a beach and/or shoreline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lagen.nu/1998:808#K7 |title=Milj\u00f6balk (1998:808) (MB) |publisher=Lagen.nu |access-date=2011-09-29}}</ref>\n\nFishing remains essentially private\u2014apart from on the biggest five lakes and the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]], [[\u00d6resund|the Sound]], [[Kattegat]] and [[Skagerrak]].

Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref> The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.

[[Mass trespass of Kinder Scout|Kinder Scout was the site of a mass trespass in 1932.]]]]\nThe '''freedom to roam''', or \"'''everyman's right'''\", is the general public's right to access certain public or privately owned land, lakes, and rivers for [[recreation]] and [[exercise]]. The right is sometimes called the '''right of public access to the wilderness''' or the \"'''right to roam'''\".\n\nIn [[Scotland]], [[Finland]], [[Iceland]], [[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Austria]], [[Czech Republic]] and [[Switzerland]], the freedom to roam takes the form of general public rights which are sometimes codified in law. The access is ancient in parts of [[Northern Europe]] and has been regarded as sufficiently basic that it was not formalised in law until modern times. However, the right usually does not include any substantial economic exploitation, such as hunting or logging, or disruptive activities, such as making fires and driving offroad vehicles.\n\nIn [[England]] and [[Wales]] public access rights apply only to certain categories of mainly uncultivated land.\n\n==Europe==\n=== Nordic countries ===\nAncient traces provide evidence of the freedom to roam in many European countries, suggesting such a freedom was once a common norm.  Today, the right to roam has survived in perhaps its purest form in Estonia, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden. Here the right has been won through practice over hundreds of years<ref>[http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann]{{in lang|no}} {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213175343/http://www.caplex.no/Web/Magazine.aspx?id=allemann|date=February 13, 2006}}</ref> and it is not known when it changed from mere 'common practice' to become a commonly recognised right.  A possible explanation as to why the right has survived mainly in these five countries is that [[feudalism]] and [[serfdom]] were not established there.{{citation needed|reason=source for that as explanation?|date=September 2012}} Another factor is the survival of large areas of unenclosed forest. Elsewhere in [[Europe]] land was gradually enclosed for private use and enjoyment, with [[commons|commoners' rights]] (for instance, rights to gather fuel or graze animals) largely eliminated.\n\n[[File:Telt.jpg|thumb|left|Camping in a forest in [[Femundsmarka National Park]], Norway]]\nToday these rights underpin opportunities for outdoor recreation in several of the Nordic countries, providing the opportunity to hike across or camp on another's land (e.g. in Sweden for one or two nights), boating on someone else's waters, and picking [[wildflower]]s, [[mushroom]]s and berries. However, with these rights come responsibilities; that is, an obligation neither to harm, disturb, litter, nor to damage [[wildlife]] or crops.\n\nAccess rights are most often for travel on foot. Rights to fish, hunt or take any other product are usually constrained by other customs or laws. Building a fire is often prohibited (though in Sweden and Norway fires are allowed with proper safety precautions).  Making [[noise pollution|noise]] is discouraged. In some countries, putting up a [[tent]] in the [[forest]] for one night is allowed, but not the use of a [[Travel trailer|caravan]]. Access does not extend to built up or developed land (such as [[house]]s, [[garden]]s) and does not necessarily include commercial exploitation of the land. For example, workers picking berries may be legal only with the landowner's permission.\n\nThere are some significant differences in the rules of different countries. In [[Denmark]], there is a more restricted freedom to roam on privately held land. All dunes and beaches and all publicly owned forests are open to roaming. Uncultivated, unfenced areas are open to daytime roaming irrespective of ownership status. Privately owned forest have access by roads and tracks only.\n\n==== Finland ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\nIn Finland, the freedom to roam and related rights are called ''\"{{lang|fi|jokamiehenoikeus}}\"'' in [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and ''\"{{lang|sv|allemansr\u00e4tten}}\"'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] (lit. \"the everyman's right\"), similar to other Nordic countries. Everyone may walk, ski, ride a horse or cycle freely in the countryside where this does not harm the natural environment or the landowner, except in gardens or in the immediate vicinity of people's homes (yards).

In Norway the terms ''utmark'' and ''innmark'' divide areas where the right to roam is valid (''utmark'', literally something like \"land outside [the boundaries]\"/\"[Out Field]\") and where it is invalid or restricted (''innmark'', \"land inside [the boundaries]\"/\"[In Field]\"). The law specifies ''innmark'' thoroughly,<ref>\"g\u00e5rdsplass, hustomt, dyrket mark, engsl\u00e5tt, kulturbeite og skogplantefelt og liknende omr\u00e5der hvor allmennhetens ferdsel vil v\u00e6re til utilb\u00f8rlig fortrengsel for eier eller bruker. Udyrkede, mindre grunnstykker som ligger i dyrket mark eller engsl\u00e5tt eller er gjerdet inn sammen med slikt omr\u00e5de, regnes ogs\u00e5 som innmark.

Cultivated land may only be crossed when frozen and covered in snow.\n\nThere are some basic rules that must be followed when camping in Norway:\n\n* People are allowed to camp at least 150 meters away from the nearest inhabited house or cottage.\n* [[Campfire]]s are not allowed in the forest areas from 15 April to 15 September.\n* Tourists are allowed to stay in one spot for only one day. After that, it is necessary to specifically ask for permission from the landowner. This rule excludes the mountains and the national parks.\n\nIn later years the right has come under pressure particularly around the [[Oslofjord|Oslo Fjord]] and in popular areas of Southern Norway. These areas are popular sites for holiday homes and many owners of coastal land want to restrict public access to their property. As a general rule, building and partitioning of property is prohibited in a 100-meter zone closest to the sea, but local authorities in many areas have made liberal use of their ability to grant exemptions from this rule. However, even if a land owner has been permitted to build closer to the shore, he may not restrict people from walking along the shore. Fences and other barriers to prevent public access are not permitted (but yet sometimes erected, resulting in heavy fines).\n\n[[Canoeing]], [[kayaking]], [[rowing (sport)|rowing]] and [[sailing]] in rivers, lakes, and ocean are allowed. Motorised boats are only permitted in salt water. All waters are open for swimming \u2013 with the exception of lakes that are [[drinking water]] reservoirs (see for instance [[Maridalsvannet]]).\n\nWild berry foraging is part of the right. Picking cloudberries may, however, be restricted on privately owned land in northern parts of Norway.\n\nHunting rights belong to the landowner, and thus hunting is not included in the right of free access. In freshwater areas such as rivers and lakes, the fishing rights belong to the landowner. Freshwater fishing  may only be conducted with the permission of the landowner and by those in possession of a fishing licence. Different rules apply for children under the age of 16. Children under the age of 16 have the right to fish without a licence, a right codified in 1992. This right was tried and upheld in a ruling from the Norwegian Supreme Court in 2004. <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Free_State_of_Bavaria|title=Constitution of the Free State of Bavaria}}</ref>\n\nIn salt water areas there is free access to sports fishing using boats or from the shoreline. All fishing is subject to legislation to, among other things, protect biological diversity, and this legislation stipulates rules regarding the use of gear, seasons, bag or size limits and more.\n\n==== Sweden ====\nIn [[Sweden]] ''allemansr\u00e4tten'' (lit. \"the everyman's right\") is a freedom granted by the [[Constitution of Sweden]].

It also gives the right to pick wild flowers, mushrooms and berries (provided one knows they are not legally protected), but not to hunt in any way. Swimming in any lake and putting an unpowered boat on any water is permitted unless explicitly forbidden. Visiting beaches and walking by a shoreline is permitted, providing it is not a part of a garden or within the immediate vicinity of a residence (legally defined as the ''hemfridszon'').

Since 1975 the right to roam in forests is guaranteed by Federal law. In particular, walking, running, hiking, and resting are automatically allowed to the public in most forest areas. However, horse riding, bike riding, and camping are not, and may only be practised with the land owner's permission.  A large proportion of the forest area in Austria is owned by government bodies such as the ''\u00d6sterreichische Bundesforste'', but the same restrictions still apply. In some circumstances forests may be closed to the public for environmental reasons. The situation in mountainous areas is less clear, and differs from state to state. Some states, such as [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], and [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]] guarantee a right to roam in mountainous areas (usually defined as above the tree line), for all recreational activities. In other states, such as Tyrol, Lower Austria, and Burgenland, no explicit right to roam exists and land owners reserve the right to deny access. In practice, however, such restrictions are rarely enforced, since mountain tourism is an important industry in Austria.\n<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |title=Wegefreiheit im Wald und im Berggebiet |website=AV-Rechts-Infotext 2004 |publisher=Austrian Alpine Club |language=German |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100420/http://www.rockprojects.com/download/OEAV_Rechts_Infotext_2004.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29}}</ref>\n\n===Czech Republic===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2018}}\n\n{{See also|Czech Hiking Markers System}}\n[[File:Robl\u00edn, turistick\u00e1 trasa.jpg|thumb|[[Czech Hiking Markers System]] for [[trail blazing]] has been adopted in Central Europe and elsewhere]]\nThe old legal institute of \"right of the way\" (imbedded in the Civil Code) has its roots in [[Austria-Hungary]] law. This legal institution is applied when one land owner has a need to go through alien lands for access to his own land.\n\nThe Nature and Countryside Preservation Act, gives a legal right to roam through country (\"ve\u0159ejn\u00e1 p\u0159\u00edstupnost krajiny\", public accessibility of countryside or wilderness \u2013 excluding parcels owned by a [[natural person]]). Some types of land are excluded from compulsory public accessibility: settled and building grounds, courtyards, gardens, orchards, vineyards, hop gardens, grounds destined for animal husbandry. Fields and arable land are excluded during seasons when herbage or soil would be damaged, pasture lands are excluded during cattle grazing.\nIn national natural preserves, national natural monuments, national parks and in the first zones of landscape protected areas, state authorities can restrict public access (ordinarily only to roads or only to marked routes). Special acts can exclude also other areas (e. g. military areas, rail tracks etc.).\n\nAccording to Forest Act, forests are publicly accessible (\"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed lesa\", common use of forest \u2013 including private ones) and citizens have a legal right to enter the forests. The right of gathering dry twigs lying on the ground and berries for personal purpose is also guaranteed. However, biking, sledge riding, skiing and horseback riding are allowed only on forest roads. Public motor vehicle riding is prohibited (highroads going through forest are not considered as parts of the forest \u2013 because they are not considered as \"forest land\" in land ragistration). Common use of forest can be restricted by the owner in military forests, protected areas, forest nurseries, forest orchards, deer parks, pheasantries etc.\n\nThe Road Act defines ''obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed pozemn\u00edch komunikac\u00ed'' (common use of roads \u2013 some road can be excluded), The Water Act defines \"obecn\u00e9 u\u017e\u00edv\u00e1n\u00ed povrchov\u00fdch vod\" (common use of surface waters).\n\n===Switzerland ===\nThe freedom to roam is guaranteed in [[Switzerland]] by the [[Swiss Civil Code]]. However, some [[cantons of switzerland|cantons]] have more detailed regulations concerning the rights of access of otherwise not authorised people.\n\nThe Swiss Civil Code provides that forest and pasture are accessible freely for everyone, as long as there is no excessive usage. Except in special cases like the protection of young forest or [[biotope]]s it is not allowed to fence in forest areas. This also applies to private property. Certain activities related to excessive usage and the potential to cause damage, such as events in the woods, or access with cars, may be dependent on special authorisation. Similar regulations are in place for land which is not usable (e.g. stretches of water, rock, snow and ice), regardless of the land being unowned (i.e. being under the control of the canton and not able to be claimed as private property) or privately owned. The canton may also choose to restrict the freedom to roam in order to protect nature (e.g. the gathering of mushrooms, berries, wood, etc. in forests).\n\n===Germany===\nIn Germany a limited right to roam, called ''Jedermannsrecht'', is guaranteed by federal law.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The Federal Nature Conservation Act, the Federal Forest Act and the Federal Water Management Act allow everyone access to open landscape, uncultivated land, forests and water bodies, including cycling and horse-riding on tracks and paths. The right may be further regulated through state law.\n\n====Bavaria====\nThe [[Constitution of Bavaria]] guarantees everyone \"the enjoyment of natural beauty and recreation in the outdoors, in particular the access to forests and mountain meadows, the use of waterways and lakes and the appropriation of wild fruits\".{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} The right is nicknamed ''Schwammerlparagraph''(mushroom clause). The article also oblige \"every person to treat nature and the landscape with care\". \"The state and the municipalities shall be entitled and obliged to maintain free access to mountains, lakes, rivers and other beautiful sceneries and to create free access by restricting property rights and to create hiking trails and recreational parks\"\n\n\n=== United Kingdom ===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], outside Scotland, access to much uncultivated and unenclosed land was restricted prior the enactment of the [[Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000]]. Access to land in England and Wales is still more limited than in Northern Europe, and some other European countries, while access is very limited in Northern Ireland. Property was formerly protected in England and Wales mostly to preserve the landowner's hunting or fishing rights. The [[Ramblers' Association]], which works to increase the rights of walkers in the United Kingdom, was a driving force behind this legislation.\n\n==== England and Wales ====\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn [[England]] and Wales, after a polarised debate about the merits, rights and benefits of private landowners and public recreation, in 2000 the Government legislated to introduce a limited ''right to roam'', without compensation for landowners. The Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CROW) was gradually implemented from 2000 onwards to give the general public the conditional right to walk in certain areas of the English and Welsh countryside: principally [[downland]], [[moorland]], [[heathland]] and coastal land. Forests and woodlands are excluded, other than  publicly owned forests, which have a similar right of access by virtue of a voluntary dedication made by the [[Forestry Commission]]. Developed land, gardens and certain other areas are specifically excluded from the right of access. Agricultural land is accessible if it falls within one of the categories described above. People exercising the right of access have certain duties to respect other people's rights to manage the land, and to protect nature.\n\nThe new rights were introduced region by region through England and Wales, with completion in 2005. Maps showing accessible areas have been produced. Traditionally the public could walk on established [[Footpath (right of way)|public footpaths]] and [[bridleways]], on [[common land]] and on the [[foreshore]], and land owners could prevent access to other areas (or charge a fee for access).\n\nAngling interests successfully lobbied for the exclusion of rivers in England and Wales from CROW, leaving other river users such as [[swimmer]]s and [[canoeing|canoeists]] with access restricted to less than 2% of navigable water. The [[British Canoe Union]] is running the [[Rivers Access Campaign]], to highlight the level of restrictions the public face in gaining access to inland waterways in England and Wales.\n\nMuch of the [[Dartmoor National Park]] has been designated as 'Access Land', although it remains privately owned, since the Dartmoor Commons Act 1985, with no restrictions on where walkers can roam.<ref>[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/localact1985/pdf/ukla_19850037_en.pdf Dartmoor Commons Act 1985] on the OPSI website</ref> Because of the 1985 Act, Dartmoor was largely unaffected by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which established similar rights in other rural parts of the country, but in 2006, this Act opened up much of the remaining restricted land to walkers.\n\n==== Scotland ====\nIn Scotland the [[Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003]] comprehensively codified into [[Scots law]] the ancient tradition of the right to universal access to the land in Scotland.  The act specifically establishes a right to be on land for recreational, educational and certain other purposes and a right to cross land. The rights exist only if they are exercised responsibly, as specified in the [[Scottish Outdoor Access Code]].\n\nAccess rights apply to any non-motorised activities, including walking, cycling, horse-riding and wild camping. They also allow access on inland water for canoeing, rowing, sailing and swimming.\nThe rights confirmed in the Scottish legislation are greater than the limited rights of access created in England and Wales by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 (CRoW).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |title=Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000: Fact Sheets |date=2000-03-07 |publisher=Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813102505/http://www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/cl/bill/factsheet/index.htm#1 |archive-date=2006-08-13 |access-date=2006-12-09}}</ref>\n\n====Northern Ireland====\nAccess rights in Northern Ireland have been described as being \"the most regressive and restrictive access legislation in Europe.
