Despite being in his testimonial season Phillips never figured regularly again for City.\n\nIn the summer of 2006, Phillips moved across the city to bitter rivals [[Bristol Rovers F.C.]] This was after Phillips made a \"come and get me\" plea to [[Swindon Town]] manager [[Dennis Wise]] through ex-City teammate [[Lee Peacock]]. Wise chose to pursue [[Petr Brezovan]] instead.\n\nPhillips took over the number one jersey at Bristol Rovers, taking over from [[Scott Shearer]] and helped Rovers secure a play-off spot in the 2006/07 season with Phillips earning praise, and winning Player of the Year. Phillips won [[League Two]]'s player of the month for November after not conceding any league goals during that month. He also won the Football League's Golden Glove competition after keeping the most clean sheets for the 2006\u201307 season.\n\nSteve was in Turkey hoping to sign a contract with Turkish Super League Division Three team [[Ankara Demirspor]]. There was also interest from Turkish side [[Ankarag\u00fcc\u00fc]] who already have English influences with former Manchester City striker [[Darius Vassell]] and former Luton Town winger [[Ian Henderson (footballer)|Ian Henderson]] on their books. However, a contract was rejected from both teams, and he has returned to Rovers.\n\nOn 26 August 2009, Phillips signed for [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] on a one-month loan deal, which was soon extended. In November 2009, he joined League 2 side [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe]] on a two-month loan with a view to make the move permanent. Phillips made his Crewe Alexandra debut against Morecambe in a 2\u20131 home loss. On 6 January 2010, Phillips extended his loan with Crewe until the end of the season. He established himself as number one, but missed the last three games of the season through a shoulder injury.\n\nAlong with 14 other players, he was released by Rovers at the end of the 2009\u201310 season,<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_rovers/8682314.stm\n|title= Defender Aaron Lescott goes in Bristol Rovers clear-out\n|date=14 May 2010\n|accessdate=15 May 2010\n|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> and, after his successful loan period, he was signed by Crewe. He quickly established himself in the Alex team and was part of the 2011\u201312 side promoted to League One. In an effort to keep hold of his first choice goalkeeper, Crewe manager Steve Davis offered Phillips a player/coach role in 2012.\n\nAfter losing his first team place to youngster Ben Garratt, Phillips left the club at the end of the 2013\u201314 season to take up a coaching role with Shepton Mallet. He will also play non-league football with local club [[Nantwich Town F.C.|Nantwich Town]].<ref>{{cite news\n|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Crewe-Alex-Phillips-offered-coaching-role-lure/story-16355937-detail/story.html\n|title= Crewe Alex: Phillips offered coaching role lure to stay at Crewe\n|date=13 June 2012\n|accessdate=11 August 2012\n|publisher=This is Staffordshire}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2015, he joined [[Bath City F.C.|Bath City]].\nIn 2016, he joined Mangotsfield United\n\nIn September 2017, Phillips joined [[EFL League Two|League Two]] side [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] as interim goalkeeping coach following the departure of Sam Shulberg.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ytfc.net/news/2017/september/news--first-team-make-goalkeeper-coach-alterations/ |title=First-team make alteration to backroom staff |publisher=Yeovil Town F.C. |date=7 September 2017 |accessdate=7 September 2017 }}</ref>\n\n==Honours==\n;[[Bristol Rovers F.C.|Bristol Rovers]]\n*[[Football League Trophy]] runner up 2007\n*[[Football League Two]] play-off winner [[2007 Football League Two play-off Final|2007]]\n\n;[[Bristol rovers\n*[[Football League Two]] play-off Final winner [[2012 Football League Two play-off Final|2012]]\n*[[Football League Trophy]] winner [[2013 Football League Trophy Final|2013]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aylesburyunitedfc.co.uk/players/steve-phillips/ Steve Phillips] at aylesburyunitedfc.co.uk\n*{{Soccerbase}}\n*[http://www.bristolrovers.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,10328~1021933,00.html Bristol Rovers Supporters Club Player of the Year]\n\n{{2003\u201304 Football League Second Divison Team of the Year}}\n{{Bristol Rovers F.C.
