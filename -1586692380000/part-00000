Vetrivel ([[Vijayakanth]]) is their elder son and is widely respected by the villagers for his good deeds. Gowri ([[Simran (actress)|Simran]]) is the daughter of Ramakrishnan, a school teacher in the same village. Gowri returns to village after completing education from city and at first misunderstands Vetrivel as an employee in Paramasivam's home. Later she gets to know that Vetrivel is the son of Paramasivam. Slowly Vetrivel and Gowri start liking each other. Paramasivam and Parvathy also plans to get them married.\n\nSubramani ([[Karan (actor)|Karan]]) is the younger brother of Vetrivel and he returns to the village after his completion of studies. One day, Subramani slips from a mountain nearby while taking photographs of a water fall. Gowri hears his voice and rushes to the spot along with other people and Subramani is rescued by the villagers. This makes Subramani to fall for Gowri and he expresses his intention of marrying Gowri to Vetrivel. Vetrivel is so kind towards his brother and he decides to sacrifice his love for the sake of his brother. Vetrivel also convinces Paramasivam and Parvathy to get married Subramani first although he is the younger son. Gowri is shocked knowing about the marriage plans but accepts just because of the respect she has towards Vetrivel's words. Subramani and Gowri get married.\n\nChinna ([[Charle]]) works in Paramasivam's home and he could not tolerate Vetrivel's sacrifice. One day Chinna drinks and confesses the truth to Vetrivel's Parents. They decide to get Vetrivel married immediately to Rasathi ([[Radhika Chowdry]]), who is Parvathy's relative. But Rasathi's father Maniyaandar ([[Anandaraj]]) and grandfather Angaala Thevar ([[Radha Ravi]]) have vengeance over Parvathy and Paramasivam and they wanted them to be killed.\n\nPonnambalam who also lives in the same village does not like Vetrivel and he informs Subramani that Vetrivel and Gowri are in illegitimate relationship which angers Subramani. But suddenly Gowri vomits and faints. Ramakrishnan,Father of Gowri informs everyone happily that Gowri should be pregnant. But Subramani is shocked as he has decided to have kids only after Vetrivel gets married. Now Subramani also doubts the relationship between his brother Vetrivel and Gowri. He shouts at Vetrivel and Vetrivel leaves the home after hearing painful words from his brother.\n\nParamasivam and Parvathy get angry seeing Subramani's activities and scold him. Also a flashback is told where Vetrivel is the son of Vasudevar Ayya (also Vijayakanth) who was a wealthy man in the village. Paramasivam worked as a driver in Parvathy's home and they marry each other. This angers Parvathy's father Angaala Thevar and her brother Maniyaandar, and they try to kill the couple. They run to Vasudevar Ayya's village for help and Vasudevar Ayya saves them. But Angaala Thevar and Maniyaandar kill Vasudevar Ayya. Now Vasudevar Ayya orders them to stay out of village and hands over his son Vetrivel and all the properties to Paramasivam and Parvathy.\n\nIn the meantime, doctor checks Gowri and informs that she is not pregnant.

{"title_page": "Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement", "text_new": "{{short description|Units of measurement in Jewish religious texts}}\n'''Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement''' were used primarily by ancient [[Israelites]] and appear frequently within the [[Hebrew Bible]] as well as in later [[rabbinic]] writings, such as the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]]. These units of measurement continue to be used in functions regulating  Jewish contemporary life. The specificity of some of the units used and which are encompassed under these systems of measurement (whether in linear distance, weight or volume of capacity) have given rise, in some instances, to disputes, owing to the discontinuation of their Hebrew names and their replacement by other names in modern usage.\n\nNote: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable [[halakha|halachic value]], in terms of conversion to and from contemporary systems of measurement.\n\n== Contemporary unit conversion ==\n\nWhile documentation on each unit's relation to another's is plentiful, there is much debate, both within Judaism and in [[Jewish studies|academia]], about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other [[system of measurement|measurement systems]]. Classical definitions, such as that an ''etzba'' was seven [[barley]]corns laid side by side, or that a ''log'' was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.\nNevertheless, the entire system of measurement bears profound resemblance to the [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Babylonian]] and to a lesser extent the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Egyptian]] systems, and is currently understood to have likely been derived from some combination of the two.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''</ref> Scholars commonly infer the absolute sizes based on the better-known Babylonian units' relations to their contemporary counterparts.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n== Length and distance ==\nThe original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body \u2014 the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace \u2014 but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the '''[[digit (unit)|digit]]''' or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e6\u05d1\u05e2, ''etzba''; plural ''etzba'ot''),<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /> the '''[[Palm (measurement)|palm]]''' or handbreadth (Hebrew: \u05d8\u05e4\u05d7, ''tefah''/''tefach''; plural ''tefahim''/''tefachim''), which is equal to four fingerbreadths,<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1963\">''Mishnah with Maimonides' Commentary'', (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1963, ''Kila'im'' 6:6 [p. 127] (Hebrew)</ref> the '''[[span (measurement)|span]]''' (Hebrew: \u05d6\u05e8\u05ea, ''zeret''),<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /> the '''[[ell]]''' or [[cubit#Biblical cubit|cubit]] (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05de\u05d4, ''Amah'', plural ''Amot''),<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1967\">''Mishnah with Maimonides' Commentary'', (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 3, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1967, ''Middot'' 3:1 [p. 291] (Hebrew)</ref> the '''[[Biblical mile|mile]]''' (Hebrew: \u05de\u05d9\u05dc, ''mil''; plural ''milin''), and the '''parsa''' (Hebrew: \u05e4\u05e8\u05e1\u05d4, ''parasa''). The latter two are [[loan word]]s into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the [[Roman mile|Latin ''mille'']], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''[[parasang]]'', respectively; both were units of [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the ''parasang'', also on the speed of travel.\n\nThe Israelite measurements were related as follows:\n* 1 palm [handbreadth] (''tefach'') = 4 digit (''etzba'ot'')<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\">[[Tosefta]] (''Kelim Baba-Metsia'' 6:12\u201313)</ref><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1963\" />\n* 1 span (''zeret'') = 3 palms (''tefahim'')<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" />\n* 1 ell [cubit] (''amah'') = 2 spans (''zeret''), or 6 palms [handbreadths]<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1967\" />\n* 1 [[Biblical mile|mil]] (''mil'') = 2000 ells [cubits] (''amot'')<ref>''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed. [[Yosef Qafih]]), vol. 1, [[Mossad Harav Kook]]: Jerusalem 1963, s.v.

Ezekiel's ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the [[Book of Chronicles]]; the Chronicler writes that Solomon's Temple was built according to \"cubits following the first measure\",<ref>{{bibleref|2|Chronicles|3:3|}}</ref> suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which \u2014 the ''royal'' ell \u2014 was a sixth larger than the common ell;<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> this ''royal'' measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the [[Pyramid]]s of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.<ref name=\"Peakes\">''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref>\n\nThe smaller of the Egyptian ells measured {{convert|17.72|in|cm|sp=us|abbr=on|0}}, but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the [[statues of Gudea|statues of King Gudea]], was 49.5&nbsp;cm (19.49&nbsp;in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8&nbsp;cm (20.67 and 20.79&nbsp;in).<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> The [[Books of Samuel]] portray the Temple as having a [[Phoenicia]]n architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5&nbsp;cm (19.49 or 20.67&nbsp;in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit \u2014 the finger-breadth (''Etzba'') \u2014 can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2&nbsp;cm (0.83 or 0.87&nbsp;in); Rav [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]] approximates at 2&nbsp;cm (0.79&nbsp;in); Talmudic scholar [[Chazon Ish]] at 2.38&nbsp;cm (0.94&nbsp;in). The ''mile'' (''Mil'') is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760&nbsp;ft) \u2014 approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land [[mile]] of 5280&nbsp;ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km).\n\nThe precise width of the ''etzba'' (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities.

The ''stadium'' appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the ''double palm'' seems to have been derived from the Greek ''[[dichas]]''.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\nThe relationship between four of these ''additional'' units and the earlier system is as follows:\n* 1 double palm (''hasit'') = 2 palms (''tefah'')\n* 1 pace (''pesiah'') = 1 ell (''amah'')\n* 1 stadium (''ris'') = 1600 palms ({{frac|2|15}} mile) (''tefah'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/74950445/Index|title=Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>  Others say that 1 stadium was equivalent to 470\u2013500 [[cubits]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (15.11.3; XV.415\u2013416), who described the dimensions of the [[Temple Mount]] in the following terms (apparently not including the extension made to the Temple Mount): \u201cThis hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs; [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong (Gr. ''stadion'').\u201d Compare [[Mishnah]] [http://www.sefaria.org/Mishnah_Middot.2.1?lang=bi ''Middot'' 2:1] which states that the Temple Mount measured five-hundred cubits (Heb. ''amah'') by five-hundred cubits. If it can be ascertained that Josephus' ''stadion'' is equivalent to the 500 cubits mentioned in the Mishnah, and being that the Southern Wall measured 281 meters, this would place each cubit (Heb. ''amah'') at 56.205 cm. Rabbi [[Saadia Gaon]], on the other hand, holds that a ''stadion'' was equivalent to only 470 cubits (v. Uziel Fuchs, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24174679?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents ''\"Millot HaMishnah\" by R.

Moreover, Josephus, in his ''[[The Life of Flavius Josephus|Vita]]'' (\u00a7 12), says that ''Bethmaus'' (Heb.

May, chief editor of two classic Bible-related reference books, the bath may be archaeologically determined to have been about 22 liters (5.75 US gal) from a study of jar remains marked 'bath' and 'royal bath' from [[Tell Beit Mirsim]].<ref>The Interpreter's Bible, Buttrick ed., Abingden Press, Nashville, 1956, volume VI, p. 317 (p155 in the Internet Archive copy of the text)</ref>\n\n===Talmudic additions===\nIn Talmudic times many more measures of capacity were used, mostly of foreign origin, especially from Persia and Greece, which had both held dominance over [[Judea]] by the time the Talmud came to be created. The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the ''Kab'' include, in increasing order of size, ''ukla'' (\u05e2\u05d5\u05db\u05dc\u05d0), ''tuman'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05df), and ''kapiza'' (\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the ''[[modius (unit)|modius]]'' (\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d0),<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Gittin'' 57a; traditionally associated with the ''seah''.</ref> ''geriwa'' (geriwa), ''garab'' (\u05d2\u05e8\u05d1). Of unidentified size were the ''ardaba'' (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d1), the ''kuna'' (\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0), and the ''qometz'' (\u05e7\u05de\u05e5); the latter two of these were said to equate to a ''handful''.\n\n==Weight and coins==\nThe Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the ''talent'', ''mina'', ''[[shekel]]'' (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e7\u05dc), and ''[[Gerah|giru]]'', related to one another as follows:\n* 1 ''shekel'' = 24  ''giru''\n* 1 ''mina'' = 60 ''shekels'' (later 100 zuz)\n* 1 ''talent'' = 60 ''mina''\n\nIn the Israelite system, the ratio of the ''giru'' to the ''shekel'' was altered, and the ''talent'', ''mina'', and ''giru'', later went by the names ''kikkar'' (\u05db\u05db\u05e8), ''litra'', and ''gerah'' (\u05d2\u05e8\u05d4), respectively; ''litra'' is a loan word from Latin - ''libra'', meaning ''pound''.<ref name=\"Peakes\"/>\nThe Israelite system was thus as follows:\n\n* 1 ''shekel'' = 20 ''[[gerah]]''\n* 1 ''litra'' = 60 ''shekels''\n* 1 ''kikkar'' = 60 ''litra''\n\nThere were, however, different versions of the ''talent''/''kikkar'' in use; a ''royal'' and a ''common'' version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light ''royal'' talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy ''royal'' talent often took the form of a lion. The ''mina'' for the heavy ''royal'' talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23&nbsp;lbs), while that for the heavy ''common'' talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17&nbsp;lbs); accordingly, the heavy ''common'' shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56&nbsp;oz).<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> According to [[Josephus]], it was the heavy ''common'' talent, and its ''mina'' and ''shekel'', that was the normal measure of weight in [[Syria]] and [[Judea]];<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', volume 14, 106</ref> Josephus also mentions an additional unit \u2013 the ''bekah'' \u2013 which was exactly half a shekel.\n\nGradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a ''mina'' was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard ''mina'' was reduced. [[Moses]] mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of [[silver]]; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3\u2153 [[denarii]], but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n*\"Pruta\" (pl.

There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as ''Ziv'' (meaning ''light'') and ''Ethanim'' (meaning ''strong'', perhaps in the sense of ''strong rain'' - i.e. ''[[monsoon]]''), with [[Canaan]]ite origins, but after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the names were changed to [[Babylonian calendar|the ones used by the Babylonians]]. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as ''[[Adar I]]'', the following month being ''Adar''/''[[Adar II]]'' (in the Babylonian calendar, it was ''Adar II'' that was considered to be the intercalary month).\n\n=== Week ===\nThe Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the [[Genesis creation]] (and biblical references to [[Shabbat]]) describe a seven-day week.  The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:3-2:3|HE}}.\n\nThe modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day [[Hebrew calendar#Weeks|weekly cycle]], which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the [[Sabbath]], as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon, as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).<ref>{{Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Sabbath|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12962-sabbath#anchor10|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example \"Day 1, or Yom Rishon\".\n\n=== Day ===\nIn addition to \"tomorrow\" (''machar'') and \"yesterday\" (''etmol''), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for ''two days ago'' (''shilshom''). ''Ma\u1e25aratayim'' (\"the day after tomorrow\"), is a dual form of ''machar'', literally \"two tomorrows\". In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as ''midnight'', and ''half-night''.<ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|12:29|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Judges|16:3|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|119:62|}})</ref> Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at [[dusk]].\n\nBy Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into '''hours''' (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e2\u05d4, ''sha'ah''), '''parts''' (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7, ''[[helek|heleq]]'', plural ''halaqim''), and '''moments''' (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d2\u05e2, ''rega'', plural ''rega'im''), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:\n\n* 1 part  (''heleq'') = 76 moments  (''rega'im'') (each moment, ''rega'', is 0.04386 of a second; 22.8 ''rega'im'' is 1 second)\n* 1 hour (''sha'ah'') = 1080 parts (''halaqim'') (each ''heleq'' is 3\u2153 seconds)\n* 1 day = 24 hours (''sha'ah'')\n\nTo complicate matters, [[Halakha]], speaking of the [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|relative hour]], states that there are always 12 hours between the break of [[dawn]] and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bible code]], a purported set of secret messages encoded within the Torah.\n* [[Chol HaMoed]], the intermediate days during Passover and Sukkot.\n* [[Chronology of the Bible]]\n* [[Counting of the Omer]]\n* [[Gematria]], Jewish system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase.\n* [[Hebrew calendar]]\n* [[Hebrew numerals]]\n* [[Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000\u20132050]]\n* [[Lag BaOmer]], 33rd day of counting the ''Omer''.\n* [[Notarikon]], a method of deriving a word by using each of its initial letters.\n* [[Sephirot]], the 10 attributes/emanations found in Kabbalah.\n* [[Significance of numbers in Judaism]]\n* [[Weekly Torah portion]], division of the Torah into 54 portions.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=a}}\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Eastons}}\n*{{citation |last=Hirsch |first=Emil G. |author2=Immanuel Benzinger |author3=Joseph Jacobs |author4=Jacob Zallel Lauterbach |date=1906 |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Hirsch & al.|1906}} |contribution=Weights and Measures |contribution-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14821-weights-and-measures |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/ |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia |volume=Vol. XII |pp=483 ff |publisher= |location= |editor=Cyrus Adler |editor2=Gotthard Deutsch |editor3=Louis Ginzberg |editor4=Richard Gottheil |editor5=Joseph Jacobs |editor6=Marcus Jastrow |editor7=Morris Jastrow, Jr. |editor8=Kaufmann Kohler |editor9=Frederick de Sola Mendes |editor10=Crawford H.

These units of measurement continue to be used in functions regulating  Jewish contemporary life. The specificity of some of the units used and which are encompassed under these systems of measurement (whether in linear distance, weight or volume of capacity) have given rise, in some instances, to disputes, owing to the discontinuation of their Hebrew names and their replacement by other names in modern usage.\n\nNote: The listed measurements of this system range from the lowest to highest acceptable [[halakha|halachic value]], in terms of conversion to and from contemporary systems of measurement.\n\n== Contemporary unit conversion ==\n\nWhile documentation on each unit's relation to another's is plentiful, there is much debate, both within Judaism and in [[Jewish studies|academia]], about the exact relationship between measurements in the system and those in other [[system of measurement|measurement systems]]. Classical definitions, such as that an ''etzba'' was seven [[barley]]corns laid side by side, or that a ''log'' was equal to six medium-sized eggs, are so indefinite and vague as to be nearly useless.\nNevertheless, the entire system of measurement bears profound resemblance to the [[Ancient Mesopotamian units of measurement|Babylonian]] and to a lesser extent the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian units of measurement|Egyptian]] systems, and is currently understood to have likely been derived from some combination of the two.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\">''[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]''</ref> Scholars commonly infer the absolute sizes based on the better-known Babylonian units' relations to their contemporary counterparts.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n== Length and distance ==\nThe original measures of length were clearly derived from the human body \u2014 the finger, hand, arm, span, foot, and pace \u2014 but since these measures differ between individuals, they are reduced to a certain standard for general use. The Israelite system thus used divisions of the '''[[digit (unit)|digit]]''' or fingerbreadth (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05e6\u05d1\u05e2, ''etzba''; plural ''etzba'ot''),<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /> the '''[[Palm (measurement)|palm]]''' or handbreadth (Hebrew: \u05d8\u05e4\u05d7, ''tefah''/''tefach''; plural ''tefahim''/''tefachim''), which is equal to four fingerbreadths,<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1963\">''Mishnah with Maimonides' Commentary'', (ed.

The latter two are [[loan word]]s into the Hebrew language, and borrowed measurements - the [[Roman mile|Latin ''mille'']], and [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] ''[[parasang]]'', respectively; both were units of [[wikt:itinerant|itinerant]] distance, and thus varied according to terrain and stride length, and, in the case of the ''parasang'', also on the speed of travel.\n\nThe Israelite measurements were related as follows:\n* 1 palm [handbreadth] (''tefach'') = 4 digit (''etzba'ot'')<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\">[[Tosefta]] (''Kelim Baba-Metsia'' 6:12\u201313)</ref><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1963\" />\n* 1 span (''zeret'') = 3 palms (''tefahim'')<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" />\n* 1 ell [cubit] (''amah'') = 2 spans (''zeret''), or 6 palms [handbreadths]<ref name=\"ToseftaKelim\" /><ref name=\"MishnahMaimonides1967\" />\n* 1 [[Biblical mile|mil]] (''mil'') = 2000 ells [cubits] (''amot'')<ref>''Mishnah - with a Commentary of Rabbi Moses ben Maimon'' (ed.

''Kippurim'' 6:4</ref>\n* 1 parasang (''parasa'') = 4 mils (''milin'')\n\n=== Discrepancies of ell ===\n{{details|ell}}\n\nThe biblical ''ell'' is closely related to the [[cubit]], but two different factors are given in the Bible; Ezekiel's measurements imply that the ell was equal to 1 cubit plus 1 palm (''Tefah''),<ref>{{bibleref|Ezekiel|40:5}}</ref><ref>{{bibleref|Ezekiel|43:13}}</ref> while elsewhere in the Bible, the ell is equated with 1 cubit exactly. Ezekiel's ell, by which he gave measurements in his guided vision through a future Jerusalem Temple, is thus one sixth larger than the standard ell, for which an explanation seems to be suggested by the [[Book of Chronicles]]; the Chronicler writes that Solomon's Temple was built according to \"cubits following the first measure\",<ref>{{bibleref|2|Chronicles|3:3|}}</ref> suggesting that over the course of time the original ell was supplanted by a smaller one.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> The Egyptians also used two different ells, one of which \u2014 the ''royal'' ell \u2014 was a sixth larger than the common ell;<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> this ''royal'' measurement was the earlier of the two in Egyptian use, and the one which the [[Pyramid]]s of the 3rd and 4th Dynasties seem to be measured in integer multiples of.<ref name=\"Peakes\">''[[Peake's commentary on the Bible]]''</ref>\n\nThe smaller of the Egyptian ells measured {{convert|17.72|in|cm|sp=us|abbr=on|0}}, but the standard Babylonian ell, cast in stone on one of the [[statues of Gudea|statues of King Gudea]], was 49.5&nbsp;cm (19.49&nbsp;in), and the larger Egyptian ell was between 52.5 and 52.8&nbsp;cm (20.67 and 20.79&nbsp;in).<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> The [[Books of Samuel]] portray the Temple as having a [[Phoenicia]]n architect, and in Phoenicia it was the Babylonian ell which was used to measure the size of parts of ships.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> Thus scholars are uncertain whether the standard Biblical ell would have been 49.5 or 52.5&nbsp;cm (19.49 or 20.67&nbsp;in), but are fairly certain that it was one of these two figures.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> From these figures for the size of a Biblical ell, that of the basic unit \u2014 the finger-breadth (''Etzba'') \u2014 can be calculated to be either 2.1 or 2.2&nbsp;cm (0.83 or 0.87&nbsp;in); Rav [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]] approximates at 2&nbsp;cm (0.79&nbsp;in); Talmudic scholar [[Chazon Ish]] at 2.38&nbsp;cm (0.94&nbsp;in). The ''mile'' (''Mil'') is thus about 963 or 1146 meters (3160 or 3760&nbsp;ft) \u2014 approximately six or seven tenths of a mile, and significantly shorter than the modern statute or land [[mile]] of 5280&nbsp;ft or 1760 yd (approximately 1.6&nbsp;km).\n\nThe precise width of the ''etzba'' (finger) has been a subject of controversy among halakhic authorities.

The ''stadium'' appears to have been adopted from Persia, while the ''double palm'' seems to have been derived from the Greek ''[[dichas]]''.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\nThe relationship between four of these ''additional'' units and the earlier system is as follows:\n* 1 double palm (''hasit'') = 2 palms (''tefah'')\n* 1 pace (''pesiah'') = 1 ell (''amah'')\n* 1 stadium (''ris'') = 1600 palms ({{frac|2|15}} mile) (''tefah'').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/74950445/Index|title=Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|access-date=9 January 2019}}</ref>  Others say that 1 stadium was equivalent to 470\u2013500 [[cubits]].<ref>[[Josephus]], ''[[Antiquities of the Jews|Antiquities]]'' (15.11.3; XV.415\u2013416), who described the dimensions of the [[Temple Mount]] in the following terms (apparently not including the extension made to the Temple Mount): \u201cThis hill was walled all round, and in compass four furlongs; [the distance of] each angle containing in length a furlong (Gr.

If it can be ascertained that Josephus' ''stadion'' is equivalent to the 500 cubits mentioned in the Mishnah, and being that the Southern Wall measured 281 meters, this would place each cubit (Heb.

The definitions for many of these are disputed. Those that were certain (disputed) fractions of the ''Kab'' include, in increasing order of size, ''ukla'' (\u05e2\u05d5\u05db\u05dc\u05d0), ''tuman'' (\u05ea\u05d5\u05de\u05df), and ''kapiza'' (\u05e7\u05e4\u05d9\u05d6\u05d0). Those that were larger, in increasing order of size, included the ''[[modius (unit)|modius]]'' (\u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05d0),<ref>[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Gittin'' 57a; traditionally associated with the ''seah''.</ref> ''geriwa'' (geriwa), ''garab'' (\u05d2\u05e8\u05d1). Of unidentified size were the ''ardaba'' (\u05d0\u05d3\u05e8\u05d1), the ''kuna'' (\u05db\u05d5\u05e0\u05d0), and the ''qometz'' (\u05e7\u05de\u05e5); the latter two of these were said to equate to a ''handful''.\n\n==Weight and coins==\nThe Babylonian system, which the Israelites followed, measured weight with units of the ''talent'', ''mina'', ''[[shekel]]'' (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e7\u05dc), and ''[[Gerah|giru]]'', related to one another as follows:\n* 1 ''shekel'' = 24  ''giru''\n* 1 ''mina'' = 60 ''shekels'' (later 100 zuz)\n* 1 ''talent'' = 60 ''mina''\n\nIn the Israelite system, the ratio of the ''giru'' to the ''shekel'' was altered, and the ''talent'', ''mina'', and ''giru'', later went by the names ''kikkar'' (\u05db\u05db\u05e8), ''litra'', and ''gerah'' (\u05d2\u05e8\u05d4), respectively; ''litra'' is a loan word from Latin - ''libra'', meaning ''pound''.<ref name=\"Peakes\"/>\nThe Israelite system was thus as follows:\n\n* 1 ''shekel'' = 20 ''[[gerah]]''\n* 1 ''litra'' = 60 ''shekels''\n* 1 ''kikkar'' = 60 ''litra''\n\nThere were, however, different versions of the ''talent''/''kikkar'' in use; a ''royal'' and a ''common'' version. In addition, each of these forms had a heavy and a light version, with the heavy version being exactly twice the weight of the lighter form; the light ''royal'' talent was often represented in the form of a duck, while the heavy ''royal'' talent often took the form of a lion. The ''mina'' for the heavy ''royal'' talent weighed 1.01 kilograms (2.23&nbsp;lbs), while that for the heavy ''common'' talent weighed only 984 grams (2.17&nbsp;lbs); accordingly, the heavy ''common'' shekel would be about 15.87 grams (0.56&nbsp;oz).<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/> According to [[Josephus]], it was the heavy ''common'' talent, and its ''mina'' and ''shekel'', that was the normal measure of weight in [[Syria]] and [[Judea]];<ref>Josephus, ''Antiquities of the Jews'', volume 14, 106</ref> Josephus also mentions an additional unit \u2013 the ''bekah'' \u2013 which was exactly half a shekel.\n\nGradually, the system was reformed, perhaps under the influence of Egypt, so that a ''mina'' was worth only 50 shekels rather than 60; to achieve this, the shekel remained the same weight, while the weight of the standard ''mina'' was reduced. [[Moses]] mandated that the standard coinage would be in single shekels of [[silver]]; thus each shekel coin would constitute about 15.86 grams (0.51 troy ounces) of pure silver. In Judea, the Biblical shekel was initially worth about 3\u2153 [[denarii]], but over time the measurement had enlarged so that it would be worth exactly four denarii.<ref name=\"Jewish Encyclopedia\"/>\n\n*\"Pruta\" (pl.

There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as ''Ziv'' (meaning ''light'') and ''Ethanim'' (meaning ''strong'', perhaps in the sense of ''strong rain'' - i.e. ''[[monsoon]]''), with [[Canaan]]ite origins, but after the [[Babylonian captivity]], the names were changed to [[Babylonian calendar|the ones used by the Babylonians]]. With the Babylonian naming, the intercalary month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as ''[[Adar I]]'', the following month being ''Adar''/''[[Adar II]]'' (in the Babylonian calendar, it was ''Adar II'' that was considered to be the intercalary month).\n\n=== Week ===\nThe Israelite month was clearly broken up into weeks, since the [[Genesis creation]] (and biblical references to [[Shabbat]]) describe a seven-day week.  The seven-day cycle is not seen as a cycle in nature and is rather a custom biblically originating from {{bibleverse||Genesis|1:3-2:3|HE}}.\n\nThe modern Hebrew calendar follows a seven-day [[Hebrew calendar#Weeks|weekly cycle]], which runs concurrently but independently of the monthly and annual cycles. The origin of Hebrew seven day week and the [[Sabbath]], as well as the true meaning of the name, is uncertain. The earliest Biblical passages which mention it (Exodus 20:10 and 24:21; Deut. 5:14; Amos 8:5) presuppose its previous existence, and analysis of all the references to it in the canon makes it plain that its observance was neither general nor altogether spontaneous in either pre-exilic or post-exilic Israel. It was probably originally connected in some manner with the cult of the moon, as indeed is suggested by the frequent mention of Sabbath and New-Moon festivals in the same sentence (Isa. 1:13; Amos 8:5; H Kings 6:23).<ref>{{Jewish Encyclopedia|title=Sabbath|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12962-sabbath#anchor10|inline=1}}</ref>\n\nThe names for the days of the week are simply the day number within the week. In Hebrew, these names may be abbreviated using the numerical value of the Hebrew letters, for example \"Day 1, or Yom Rishon\".\n\n=== Day ===\nIn addition to \"tomorrow\" (''machar'') and \"yesterday\" (''etmol''), the Israelite vocabulary also contained a distinct word for ''two days ago'' (''shilshom''). ''Ma\u1e25aratayim'' (\"the day after tomorrow\"), is a dual form of ''machar'', literally \"two tomorrows\". In the Bible, the day is divided up vaguely, with descriptions such as ''midnight'', and ''half-night''.<ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Exodus|12:29|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Judges|16:3|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse-lb||Psalms|119:62|}})</ref> Nevertheless, it is clear that the day was considered to start at [[dusk]].\n\nBy Talmudic times, the Babylonian system of dividing up the day (from sunset to sunrise, and sunrise to sunset), into '''hours''' (Hebrew: \u05e9\u05e2\u05d4, ''sha'ah''), '''parts''' (Hebrew: \u05d7\u05dc\u05e7, ''[[helek|heleq]]'', plural ''halaqim''), and '''moments''' (Hebrew: \u05e8\u05d2\u05e2, ''rega'', plural ''rega'im''), had been adopted; the relationship of these units was:\n\n* 1 part  (''heleq'') = 76 moments  (''rega'im'') (each moment, ''rega'', is 0.04386 of a second; 22.8 ''rega'im'' is 1 second)\n* 1 hour (''sha'ah'') = 1080 parts (''halaqim'') (each ''heleq'' is 3\u2153 seconds)\n* 1 day = 24 hours (''sha'ah'')\n\nTo complicate matters, [[Halakha]], speaking of the [[Relative hour (Jewish law)|relative hour]], states that there are always 12 hours between the break of [[dawn]] and sunset, so these measurements are averages. For example, in the summer, a day time hour is much longer than a night time hour.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bible code]], a purported set of secret messages encoded within the Torah.\n* [[Chol HaMoed]], the intermediate days during Passover and Sukkot.\n* [[Chronology of the Bible]]\n* [[Counting of the Omer]]\n* [[Gematria]], Jewish system of assigning numerical value to a word or phrase.\n* [[Hebrew calendar]]\n* [[Hebrew numerals]]\n* [[Jewish and Israeli holidays 2000\u20132050]]\n* [[Lag BaOmer]], 33rd day of counting the ''Omer''.\n* [[Notarikon]], a method of deriving a word by using each of its initial letters.\n* [[Sephirot]], the 10 attributes/emanations found in Kabbalah.\n* [[Significance of numbers in Judaism]]\n* [[Weekly Torah portion]], division of the Torah into 54 portions.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=a}}\n\n== References ==\n===Citations===\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n*{{Eastons}}\n*{{citation |last=Hirsch |first=Emil G. |author2=Immanuel Benzinger |author3=Joseph Jacobs |author4=Jacob Zallel Lauterbach |date=1906 |display-authors=1 |ref={{harvid|Hirsch & al.|1906}} |contribution=Weights and Measures |contribution-url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14821-weights-and-measures |url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/ |title=The Jewish Encyclopedia |volume=Vol. XII |pp=483 ff |publisher= |location= |editor=Cyrus Adler |editor2=Gotthard Deutsch |editor3=Louis Ginzberg |editor4=Richard Gottheil |editor5=Joseph Jacobs |editor6=Marcus Jastrow |editor7=Morris Jastrow, Jr. |editor8=Kaufmann Kohler |editor9=Frederick de Sola Mendes |editor10=Crawford H.

He had previously given away his family ring, which is traditionally worn by the heir's fianc\u00e9e, two years earlier to a prostitute named Brenda, and resolves to find the woman and hope that she will enter into a sham marriage with him.  Satsuki, a Japanese exchange student studying drama, is struggling to make ends meet and works in a pub visited by Brenda, who has become gravely ill.  Before she dies, he gives Satsuki a ring, asking him to return it to its rightful owner.  Edward and Satsuki meet at the pub where Satsuki works, and Edward asks Satsuki to give Brenda a message.  Satsuki goes to tell Brenda but finds that she had died several days earlier.  As Brenda is dead, Satsuki later visits Edward at his apartment to deliver the news and return the ring.  When he does this, a drunk Edward offers Satsuki \u20a4300 per day to pretend to be his fianc\u00e9e.  Satsuki at first refuses but later takes him up on his offer as he needs money to stay in school.\n\nWhile pretending to be Edward's fianc\u00e9e, Satsuki comes up against Edward's cousin Angelica, who wants to marry Edward and take control of the family fortune.  Angelica does various things to try to ruin their engagement, such as forcing Edward to escort her instead of Satsuki to a party and then throwing wine on Satsuki's dress at the party to prevent her from dancing with Edward in public.  Satsuki becomes a wallflower and ends up talking to and dancing with a foreign prince.  When Edward sees this, he becomes violently jealous and leaves the party.  When they return to the apartment, Edward gets drunk, and in a fit of jealous rage, rapes Satsuki.  Here, it is found that Edward has fallen in love with Satsuki.  However, after this, Satsuki becomes cold towards Edward, but continues their agreement to teach Edward the lesson that money cannot buy everything.\n\nLater on, Satsuki's friend Yohei from Japan visits and confesses his feelings to Satsuki, but Satsuki can only think of Edward.  Satsuki realizes that he is in love with Edward.  However, after Angelica again tries to ruin the engagement by making Edward believe that Satsuki is cheating on him with Yohei, Edward quits speaking to Satsuki.  Due to Angelica's interferences, they decide to move the fake wedding up a month and so Satsuki and Edward marry.  Afterward, Satsuki confesses to Edward that he helped Edward, not for the money but because he loves Edward.  Edward returns his feelings and the two consummate their marriage.  The morning after, they leave for the airport together, and Edward resolves to live without his fortune to be with Satsuki.\n\n==Reception==\nRachel Bentham, writing for Active Anime, found the story reminded her of historical romance fiction.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bentham |first=Rachel |url=http://activeanime.com/html/2008/05/20/a-promise-of-romance-advance-review/ |title=A Promise of Romance (Advance Review) |work=activeAnime |date=20 May 2008 }}<!-- http://www.activeanime.com/html/content/view/3231/36/ --></ref>  Briana Lawrence, writing for Mania Entertainment, felt that the pace of the final chapter was disappointing, but enjoyed the rest of the novel, especially when Satsuki was traumatised by his rape.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Lawrence |first=Briana |url=http://www.mania.com/promise-romance-vol01_article_82773.html |title=A Promise of Romance Vol. #01 |work=Mania |publisher=[[Demand Media]] |date=July 22, 2008 |accessdate=October 29, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622103636/http://www.mania.com/promise-romance-vol01_article_82773.html |archivedate=June 22, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n* {{Ann|manga|10362}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Promise of Romance}}\n[[Category:Yaoi]]\n[[Category:Light novels]]\n[[Category:Digital Manga Publishing titles]]\n[[Category:2008 manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = \n| image           = \n| caption         =\n| ja_kanji        = \n| ja_romaji       = \n| genre           = [[Yaoi]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Print\n| type            = light novel\n| title           = \n| author          = [[Kyoko Akitsu]]\n| illustrator     = [[Tooko Miyagi]] \n| publisher       = [[Taiyoh Tosho]]\n| publisher_en    = {{English manga publisher|US=[[Digital Manga Publishing]]}}\n| demographic     = Female\n| imprint           = \n| magazine        = \n| published       = May 2008 (English)\n| first           = \n| last            = \n| volumes         = 1\n| volume_list     = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''A Promise of Romance'''''|\u5951\u7d04 \u30d6\u30e9\u30f3\u30c9\u30ed\u30de\u30f3\u30b9|Keiyaku - Brand Romance}} is a [[light novel]] with [[yaoi|homoerotic]] themes.

It received [[List of accolades received by First Man|numerous accolades]], including two nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]), ten nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning Best Editing and Best Score), seven nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], and four nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] (winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1961, [[NASA]] test pilot [[Neil Armstrong]] is flying the [[X-15]] rocket-powered spaceplane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the [[Mojave Desert]], his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction, and he is grounded.\n\nHis 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for [[Project Gemini]] and is accepted to [[NASA Astronaut Group 2]]. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends [[Elliot See]], another civilian test pilot, and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]. As Armstrong begins training, [[Deke Slayton]] impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the [[Soviet Union]] had reached every milestone in the [[Space Race]] ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark.\n\nBy 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of [[Gemini 8]], with [[David Scott (astronaut)|David Scott]] as the pilot. Prior to the mission, See and [[Charles Bassett]] are killed in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash]], deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on [[Gemini 8]] and dock with the [[Agena target vehicle]], but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins to roll at a rapid rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. Later, White reveals that he has been selected for the [[Apollo 1]] mission, along with [[Gus Grissom]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]].\n\nDuring a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a [[Apollo_1#Fire|fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew]] , and Armstrong hears the news while representing NASA at the [[White House]]. The next year, after ejecting from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] in an accident that could have killed him, Armstrong is selected to command [[Apollo 11]], and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he might not survive the flight and insists that he should explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family.\n\nApollo 11 reaches the Moon four days later. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and attempt the landing. They realize that they are coming in too fast and are going to overshoot their designated landing site. The new landing site turns out to have much rougher terrain, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft. He lands the lunar module successfully with less than 30 seconds of fuel remaining. After setting foot on the Moon, Armstrong utters his famous line, \"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Later he drops Karen's bracelet into [[Little West (lunar crater)|Little West crater]]. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in [[quarantine]], where the film of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1962 speech \"[[We choose to go to the Moon]]\" is shown, and Armstrong and Janet share a moment of tenderness.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as [[Neil Armstrong]], the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon during [[Apollo 11]].\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife.\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], Neil's friend and neighbor, the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]], who died during a pre-launch test for [[Apollo 1]], which was to be the first crewed Apollo mission.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as [[Deke Slayton]], one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, who became NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]].\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as [[Buzz Aldrin]], the second man to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11.\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as [[Elliot See]], partnered with Armstrong as backup crew for [[Gemini 5]].

Instead, [[LED display]]s of up to 10 meters were used. These projected images that would simulate the exterior of the spacecraft, both the earth and space. Next to the screens, several simulators were built, each corresponding to a spacecraft. These were programmed to move synchronized with the images of the spherical LED screens that could be seen through the windows. Chazelle chose this technique because it allowed the actors to get more into the role; instead of seeing a green screen, they saw the outside environment recreated with [[visual effects]]. [[Scale model|Miniatures]] were used for several exterior shots of the spacecraft.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTo recreate Armstrong's home, the production crew built a replica of it in an empty lot.

It received [[List of accolades received by First Man|numerous accolades]], including two nominations at the [[76th Golden Globe Awards]] (winning [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]]), ten nominations at the [[24th Critics' Choice Awards]] (winning Best Editing and Best Score), seven nominations at the [[72nd British Academy Film Awards]], and four nominations at the [[91st Academy Awards]] (winning [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]]).\n\n== Plot ==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 1961, [[NASA]] test pilot [[Neil Armstrong]] is flying the [[X-15]] rocket-powered spaceplane when it inadvertently bounces off the atmosphere. Although he manages to land the plane in the [[Mojave Desert]], his colleagues express concern that his recent record of mishaps is due to distraction, and he is grounded.\n\nHis 2 1/2-year-old daughter, Karen, is undergoing treatment for a brain tumor. Desperate to save her, Armstrong keeps a detailed log of her symptoms and feverishly tries to find possible treatments, but she dies soon afterwards. Grief-stricken, Armstrong applies for [[Project Gemini]] and is accepted to [[NASA Astronaut Group 2]]. Armstrong, his wife Janet, and their son Rick move to Houston alongside other astronaut families. Armstrong befriends [[Elliot See]], another civilian test pilot, and [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]]. As Armstrong begins training, [[Deke Slayton]] impresses upon the new astronauts the importance of the Gemini program, as the [[Soviet Union]] had reached every milestone in the [[Space Race]] ahead of the United States. Armstrong and Janet have a second son, Mark.\n\nBy 1965, the family has settled in Houston, and Armstrong awaits selection for a crew. After the Soviets complete the first [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), Armstrong is informed that he will be the commander of [[Gemini 8]], with [[David Scott (astronaut)|David Scott]] as the pilot. Prior to the mission, See and [[Charles Bassett]] are killed in a [[1966 NASA T-38 crash|T-38 crash]], deepening Armstrong's grief at the string of recent losses. Armstrong and Scott successfully launch on [[Gemini 8]] and dock with the [[Agena target vehicle]], but soon afterward, the spacecraft begins to roll at a rapid rate. After nearly blacking out, Armstrong activates the [[Reaction control system|RCS]] thrusters and safely aborts the mission. Armstrong initially faces criticism, but NASA determines the crew is not at fault. Later, White reveals that he has been selected for the [[Apollo 1]] mission, along with [[Gus Grissom]] and [[Roger B. Chaffee|Roger Chaffee]].\n\nDuring a launch rehearsal test on January 27, 1967, a [[Apollo_1#Fire|fire kills White and the Apollo 1 crew]] , and Armstrong hears the news while representing NASA at the [[White House]]. The next year, after ejecting from the [[Lunar Landing Research Vehicle]] in an accident that could have killed him, Armstrong is selected to command [[Apollo 11]], and Slayton informs him that it will likely be the first lunar landing. As the mission nears, Neil becomes increasingly preoccupied and emotionally distant from his family. Just prior to the launch, Janet confronts Armstrong about the possibility that he might not survive the flight and insists that he should explain the risks of the mission to their young sons. After telling them about the risks he faces, Armstrong says goodbye to his family.\n\nApollo 11 reaches the Moon four days later. Armstrong and Aldrin undock in the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] and attempt the landing. They realize that they are coming in too fast and are going to overshoot their designated landing site. The new landing site turns out to have much rougher terrain, forcing Armstrong to take manual control of the spacecraft. He lands the lunar module successfully with less than 30 seconds of fuel remaining. After setting foot on the Moon, Armstrong utters his famous line, \"That's one small step for (a) man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Later he drops Karen's bracelet into [[Little West (lunar crater)|Little West crater]]. With their mission complete, the astronauts return home and are placed in [[quarantine]], where the film of [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1962 speech \"[[We choose to go to the Moon]]\" is shown, and Armstrong and Janet share a moment of tenderness.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- Cast and order per tombstone closing credits, roles per closing credits scroll --->\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as [[Neil Armstrong]], the astronaut who became the first man to walk on the Moon during [[Apollo 11]].\n* [[Claire Foy]] as Janet Armstrong, Neil's first wife.\n* [[Jason Clarke]] as [[Ed White (astronaut)|Ed White]], Neil's friend and neighbor, the first American to [[Extra-vehicular activity|walk in space]], who died during a pre-launch test for [[Apollo 1]], which was to be the first crewed Apollo mission.\n* [[Kyle Chandler]] as [[Deke Slayton]], one of the original [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts, who became NASA's first [[Chief of the Astronaut Office]].\n* [[Corey Stoll]] as [[Buzz Aldrin]], the second man to walk on the Moon during Apollo 11.\n* [[Patrick Fugit]] as [[Elliot See]], partnered with Armstrong as backup crew for [[Gemini 5]].

Instead, [[LED display]]s of up to 10 meters were used. These projected images that would simulate the exterior of the spacecraft, both the earth and space. Next to the screens, several simulators were built, each corresponding to a spacecraft. These were programmed to move synchronized with the images of the spherical LED screens that could be seen through the windows. Chazelle chose this technique because it allowed the actors to get more into the role; instead of seeing a green screen, they saw the outside environment recreated with [[visual effects]]. [[Scale model|Miniatures]] were used for several exterior shots of the spacecraft.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nTo recreate Armstrong's home, the production crew built a replica of it in an empty lot.

This is close to the estimates of energy analysts, which put Iran's sales at the end of 2012 in a range of 1 mbd to 1.5 mbd. Reducing Iran's sales further might depend on whether U.S. officials are able to persuade China, in particular, to further cut buys from Iran\u2014and to sustain those cuts.\n* Iran has been storing some unsold oil on tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]], and it is building new storage tanks on shore. Iran has stored excess oil (21 million barrels, according to [[Citigroup]] Global Markets) to try to keep production levels up\u2014shutting down wells risks harming them and it is costly and time consuming to resume production at a well that has been shut. However, since July 2012, Iran reportedly has been forced to shut down some wells, and overall oil production has fallen to about 2.6 million barrels per day from the level of nearly 4.0 mbd at the end of 2011.\n* The oil sales losses Iran is experiencing are likely to produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran's hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as of the end of 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]], believe Iran's hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis\u2014or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran's ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.\n* On 15 October 2012, Iran said that to try to stretch its hard currency reserve, it would not supply hard currency for purchases of luxury goods such as cars or cellphones (the last 2 of the government's 10 categories of imports, ranked by their importance). The government is still supplying hard currency for essential and other key imports. Importers for essential goods can obtain dollars at the official rate of 12,260 to the dollar, and importers of other key categories of goods can obtain dollars at a new rate of 28,500 to the dollar. The government has also threatened to arrest the unofficial currency traders who sell dollars at less than the rate of about 28,500 to the dollar. The few unofficial traders that remain active are said to be trading at approximately that rate so as not to risk arrest.\n* Some Iranians and outside economists worry that [[hyperinflation]] might result. The [[Central Bank of Iran|Iranian Central Bank]] estimated on 9 January 2013 that the inflation rate is about 27%\u2014the highest rate ever acknowledged by the Bank\u2014but many economists believe the actual rate is between 50% and 70%.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This has caused Iranian merchants to withhold goods or shut down entirely because they are unable to set accurate prices. Almost all Iranian factories depend on imports and the currency collapse has made it difficult for Iranian manufacturing to operate.\n* Beyond the issue of the cost of imported goods, the Treasury Department's designations of affiliates and ships belong to [[Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines]] (IRISL) reportedly are harming Iran's ability to ship goods at all, and have further raised the prices of goods to Iranian import-export dealers. Some ships have been impounded by various countries for nonpayment of debts due on them.\n* Suggesting Iran's operating budget is already struggling; some reports say the government has fallen behind in its payments to military personnel and other government workers. Others say the government has begun \"means testing\" in order to reduce social spending payments to some of the less needy families. In late 2012, it also postponed phase two of [[Iranian targeted subsidy plan|an effort to wean the population off subsidies]], in exchange for cash payments of about $40 per month to 60 million Iranians. Phase one of that program began in December 2010 after several years of debate and delay, and was praised for rationalizing gasoline prices.{{clarify|date=February 2013}} Gasoline prices now run on a tiered system in which a small increment is available at the subsidized price of about $1.60 per gallon, but amounts above that threshold are available only at a price of about $2.60 per gallon, close to the world price. Before the subsidy phase out, gasoline was sold for about 40 cents per gallon.\n* Press reports indicate that sanctions have caused Iran's production of automobiles to fall by about 40% from 2011 levels. Iran produces cars for the domestic market, such as the [[Iran Khodro|Khodro]], based on licenses from European auto makers such as Renault and Peugeot. The currency collapse has largely overtaken the findings of an IMF forecast, released in October 2012, which Iran would return to economic growth in 2013, after a small decline in 2012. An [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] assessment published in late 2012 indicates Iran's [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) likely contracted about 3% in 2012 and will contract an additional 1.2% in 2013. (\"Oil Sanctions on Iran: Cracking Under Pressure.\")\n* Mitigating some of the effects are that some private funds are going into the [[Tehran Stock Exchange]] and hard assets, such as property.

He indicated sales had fallen 40% from the average of 2.5 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2011 (see chart above on Iran oil buyers). This is close to the estimates of energy analysts, which put Iran's sales at the end of 2012 in a range of 1 mbd to 1.5 mbd. Reducing Iran's sales further might depend on whether U.S. officials are able to persuade China, in particular, to further cut buys from Iran\u2014and to sustain those cuts.\n* Iran has been storing some unsold oil on tankers in the [[Persian Gulf]], and it is building new storage tanks on shore. Iran has stored excess oil (21 million barrels, according to [[Citigroup]] Global Markets) to try to keep production levels up\u2014shutting down wells risks harming them and it is costly and time consuming to resume production at a well that has been shut. However, since July 2012, Iran reportedly has been forced to shut down some wells, and overall oil production has fallen to about 2.6 million barrels per day from the level of nearly 4.0 mbd at the end of 2011.\n* The oil sales losses Iran is experiencing are likely to produce over $50 billion in hard currency revenue losses in a one-year period at current oil prices. The IMF estimated Iran's hard currency reserves to be $106 billion as of the end of 2011, and some economists say that figure may have fallen to about $80 billion as of November 2012. Analysts at one outside group, the [[Foundation for the Defense of Democracies]], believe Iran's hard currency reserves might be exhausted entirely by July 2014 at current rates of depletion. Compounding the loss of oil sales by volume is that many of its oil transactions reportedly are now conducted on a barter basis\u2014or in exchange for gold, which is hard currency but harder to use than cash is. In addition, the 6 February 2013, imposition of sanctions on Iran's ability to repatriate hard currency could cause the depletion rate to increase.\n* On 15 October 2012, Iran said that to try to stretch its hard currency reserve, it would not supply hard currency for purchases of luxury goods such as cars or cellphones (the last 2 of the government's 10 categories of imports, ranked by their importance). The government is still supplying hard currency for essential and other key imports. Importers for essential goods can obtain dollars at the official rate of 12,260 to the dollar, and importers of other key categories of goods can obtain dollars at a new rate of 28,500 to the dollar. The government has also threatened to arrest the unofficial currency traders who sell dollars at less than the rate of about 28,500 to the dollar. The few unofficial traders that remain active are said to be trading at approximately that rate so as not to risk arrest.\n* Some Iranians and outside economists worry that [[hyperinflation]] might result. The [[Central Bank of Iran|Iranian Central Bank]] estimated on 9 January 2013 that the inflation rate is about 27%\u2014the highest rate ever acknowledged by the Bank\u2014but many economists believe the actual rate is between 50% and 70%.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} This has caused Iranian merchants to withhold goods or shut down entirely because they are unable to set accurate prices. Almost all Iranian factories depend on imports and the currency collapse has made it difficult for Iranian manufacturing to operate.\n* Beyond the issue of the cost of imported goods, the Treasury Department's designations of affiliates and ships belong to [[Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines]] (IRISL) reportedly are harming Iran's ability to ship goods at all, and have further raised the prices of goods to Iranian import-export dealers. Some ships have been impounded by various countries for nonpayment of debts due on them.\n* Suggesting Iran's operating budget is already struggling; some reports say the government has fallen behind in its payments to military personnel and other government workers. Others say the government has begun \"means testing\" in order to reduce social spending payments to some of the less needy families. In late 2012, it also postponed phase two of [[Iranian targeted subsidy plan|an effort to wean the population off subsidies]], in exchange for cash payments of about $40 per month to 60 million Iranians. Phase one of that program began in December 2010 after several years of debate and delay, and was praised for rationalizing gasoline prices.{{clarify|date=February 2013}} Gasoline prices now run on a tiered system in which a small increment is available at the subsidized price of about $1.60 per gallon, but amounts above that threshold are available only at a price of about $2.60 per gallon, close to the world price. Before the subsidy phase out, gasoline was sold for about 40 cents per gallon.\n* Press reports indicate that sanctions have caused Iran's production of automobiles to fall by about 40% from 2011 levels. Iran produces cars for the domestic market, such as the [[Iran Khodro|Khodro]], based on licenses from European auto makers such as Renault and Peugeot. The currency collapse has largely overtaken the findings of an IMF forecast, released in October 2012, which Iran would return to economic growth in 2013, after a small decline in 2012. An [[Economist Intelligence Unit]] assessment published in late 2012 indicates Iran's [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) likely contracted about 3% in 2012 and will contract an additional 1.2% in 2013. (\"Oil Sanctions on Iran: Cracking Under Pressure.\")\n* Mitigating some of the effects are that some private funds are going into the [[Tehran Stock Exchange]] and hard assets, such as property.

The player controls Fay or Bent depending on the situation. The player can't switch interactively between them.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts in the far future. Due to [[ecology|ecological]] disasters life is only possible in caves deep under the ground. Many [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|lifeforms]] and [[organism]]s have become extinct and even the human race is about to disappear. Some inventors were able to develop a [[time travel|time machine]] which uses some kind of [[radiocarbon dating]]. They now send some researchers back in time by using some sample which was made in the year 2050. Fay and her coworker arrive in a ruined [[San Francisco]]. Fay contacts the other time travelers, but they all end up in some natural disaster and most of them die. Salvador concludes their team must travel back in time to a year where ecological problems already exist, but still can be solved. In their search they find an article about Bent Svensson who invented a [[biofuel]] based upon [[blue algae]]. They also find an article how earth got partially destroyed after a nuclear reactor exploded in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest]]. This event destroyed the rain forest causing to start a chain reaction in which the earth went into a [[nuclear winter]]. The team travels back in time. However, it turns out Bent had to go on retirement due to health issues. The project is now led by his son Duve. Fay must convince Bent she really is from the future, the biofuel is the only solution to save the planet and the product must go in production right away.

The player controls Fay or Bent depending on the situation. The player can\u2019t switch interactively between them.\n\n== Plot ==\nThe game starts in the far future. Due to [[ecology|ecological]] disasters life is only possible in caves deep under the ground. Many [[Raunki\u00e6r plant life-form|lifeforms]] and [[organism]]s have become extinct and even the human race is about to disappear. Some inventors were able to develop a [[time travel|time machine]] which uses some kind of [[radiocarbon dating]]. They now send some researchers back in time by using some sample which was made in the year 2050. Fay and her coworker arrive in a ruined [[San Francisco]]. Fay contacts the other time travelers, but they all end up in some natural disaster and most of them die. Salvador concludes their team must travel back in time to a year where ecological problems already exist, but still can be solved. In their search they find an article about Bent Svensson who invented a [[biofuel]] based upon [[blue algae]]. They also find an article how earth got partially destroyed after a nuclear reactor exploded in the [[Brazil]]ian [[Amazon rainforest]]. This event destroyed the rain forest causing to start a chain reaction in which the earth went into a [[nuclear winter]]. The team travels back in time. However, it turns out Bent had to go on retirement due to health issues. The project is now led by his son Duve. Fay must convince Bent she really is from the future, the biofuel is the only solution to save the planet and the product must go in production right away. However, everyone has some reason to manipulate things for own purposes. This might fail the rescue of [[earth]]\u2014or not.\n\n==Development==\nAccording to Daedalic's Carsten Fichtelmann, [[Valve Corporation|Valve]] rejected ''A New Beginning'' and ''[[Edna & Harvey: The Breakout]]'' three times from its [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform \"on the grounds that their target audience did not care about the game\".
