He hails from the kingdom of Ferelden, a realm in the world of Thedas, where the ''[[Dragon Age]]'' series is set. Loghain first appeared in 2009's novel ''[[Dragon Age: The Stolen Throne|The Stolen Throne]]'' as one of its main characters alongside his friend, King Maric Theirin. The novel's story is set during their youth, where Loghain served as Maric's right hand during Ferelden's war against the Orlesian Empire. He would next appear in ''[[Dragon Age: The Calling|The Calling]]'', eleven years after King Maric and his companions ventured into the Deep Roads as described in ''The Stolen Throne'', and eight years after the rebellion led by Prince Maric managed to liberate Ferelden from the Orlesians.\n\nHe made his video game debut in ''[[Dragon Age: Origins]]'', which was released shortly after the release of ''The Calling'', as one of the video game's main antagonists. In ''Origins'', he is initially encountered as a general who provides strategies for King Cailan Theirin, Maric's son and successor to the throne, in the defense of Ferelden from the invading Darkspawn, a race of humanoid tainted creatures that mostly dwell in the underground of Thedas. He is voiced by [[Simon Templeman]].\n\nDepending on the player's choices in ''Origins'', Loghain may appear in a [[cameo appearance|cameo role]] in the expansion for ''Origins'', ''Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening'', as well as a supporting role in ''Dragon Age: Inquisition''.\n\nHis critical reception has been positive, with attention drawn to his effectiveness as a compelling and morally complex [[villain]] who many players could empathize with.\n\n==Creation and development== \n{{Quote box\n| width = 25em\n| align = right\n| quote = \"A good dynamic foil.

In a later interview with ''PC Gamer'' after his departure from Bioware, Gaider describes Loghain's characterization as part of the general shift toward a more morally ambiguous form of [[role playing game|RPG]]. He explained that \u201ca lot of ''Dragon Age'' was us at BioWare reacting to things we did or didn\u2019t like about ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'' as a game system or a setting, so I\u2019d say the effort to move to something more morally grey was intentional. Good people are capable of terribly evil things, and terrible people are capable of great good\u201d<ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/>. For Gaider, the main rationale behind Loghain's decisions remain the same, in that villains who perceive themselves as the good guy are the villains that intrigue him the most, \"the ones where you can put yourself in their shoes and imagine you\u2019d make exactly the same decisions even if you opposed them.\u201d He said it is an intentional design choice to make Loghain's motives relate-able, allowing for the possibility that a player might not hate him, and might perceive him as simply being misguided.

Or it could be as [[Solas (Dragon Age)|Solas]] said in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', that when he dreamed near Ostagar, he saw \u201can army overwhelmed and a veteran commander refusing to let more soldiers die in a lost cause.\u201d Most likely, it\u2019s a combination of both.\"\n| source = \u2014Keri Honea, ''A Little Look at Lore: Understanding Loghain''.<ref name=\"PSLS\"/> \n}}\nLoghain is depicted as a [[war hero]] and a [[Patriotism|patriot]], revered by many common folk in Ferelden. He inspires intense loyalty among those who serve under him<ref name=\"Cauthrien\"/>. \n\nIn an article written for Rock Paper Shotgun in 2017, Richard Cobbett observed that Loghain certainly comes across like a villain \"who spends most of the game up to his gauntlets in dodgy dealings\", but if the player interacts with Loghain as a party member, a much more rounded figure emerges; he would articulate his reasons for doubting the veracity of the Blight and reveal his suspicion of the Grey Warden's presence as being merely part of a scheme from Ferelden's former colonizers, the Orlesian Empire. He possesses a \"strong sense of honour\", albeit with a \"ruthless\" streak. \n\nJeff Cork, writing for Game Informer, agreed. He observed that Loghain \"is more than just the one-dimensional traitorous scum players had been led to believe. Late in the game we learn more about his motivations for betraying the Grey Wardens (and the player), and they actually make sense. Rather than the power-mad general we\u2019d been set up to expect, he\u2019s actually a fiercely loyal leader desperate to keep his nation safe\".<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===In Video Games===\nLoghain is first encountered at the fortress of Ostagar in ''Origins''. As the Teyrn commanding the army, Loghain is responsible for devising the tactics that will be used in the Battle of Ostagar. Loghain's plan utilizes the anvil and hammer strategy; the Grey Wardens are to act as the anvil, drawing the main Darkspawn horde out, and Loghain's troops will flank the Darkspawn once the beacon is lit.\n\nAlthough Loghain advises him not to fight on the front lines, Cailan refuses to listen and insists on accompanying the Wardens. Cailan also insists on having the two newest Grey Wardens, the player character and [[Alistair (Dragon Age)|Alistair]], light the beacon; however, after the signal is given for Loghain to launch an attack on the Darkspawn's flank, he commits an act of [[desertion]] and orders a retreat from the field along with his army, leaving both the King and the Grey Wardens to their deaths. IGN's Christian Holt notes that the death of Duncan, the protagonist's mentor, \"is particularly painful because no matter what origin story you went with, he played a role as a steady but firm hand that not only saved your life, but initiated you into the Grey Wardens\". \n\nFor the majority of the game from then on, Loghain takes up residence in Denerim and appoints himself regent to Queen Anora, becoming the de facto ruler of Ferelden. He uses the Grey Wardens as a [[scapegoat]], blaming his traitorous actions at Ostagar on the Wardens; he simultaneously outlawing the Grey Wardens in Ferelden, putting a price on the head of any survivors and closing the border to Warden reinforcements from Orlais. He also demands that Ferelden's nobility submit to his rule. The nobility, either disbelieving Loghain's explanation of the disaster at Ostagar or feeling that, given his [[commoner|common birth]] and the alacrity with which he had taken the regency in the aftermath of Cailan's death, Loghain was opportunistically grabbing a throne he had no claim to, refused to acknowledge Loghain's authority and demanded that he resign the regency; Loghain's refusal to do so and his heavy-handed tactics to force the people to fall into line instigated a [[civil war]] between his forces and those of Ferelden's nobility.\n\nLoghain may join the player's party as a secret companion character late in the game.<ref name=\"Secret\"/> After the player and Loghain duel each other during the Landsmeet event, the player may choose to either have Loghain executed for his crimes or recruited into the Grey Wardens. Allowing Loghain to live will result in Alistair leaving the party in disgust, and will allow Loghain to take his place in the party. Choosing to have Loghain killed will result in Alistair staying, but Anora will refuse to marry whomever killed her father. It is possible if the player has hardened Alistair through his personal quest to have Alistair still marry Anora and rule as king while keeping Loghain alive, in this path Loghain still replaces him as a party member. Loghain is aware the Joining was meant to be a death sentence, and is willing to sacrifice himself to kill the Archdemon, seeing it as a way of making amends for his mistakes. At the conclusion of this story path, the player may sacrifice either their protagonist or Loghain to slay the Archdemon, or in the alternative the Grey Warden characters may survive the death of the Archdemon if one of them participates in [[Morrigan (Dragon Age)|Morrigan]]'s ritual. \n\nLoghain makes a small cameo appearance in ''Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening'' should he survive the events of ''Origins'',  he informs the player character he is being sent by the Grey Wardens to serve in Orlais by order of the senior Grey Warden leadership; if the player married Anora, he will make a number of related comments, including suggesting plans for an heir and admonishing the player to treat his daughter well.\n\nIn ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', Loghain's actions at the Battle of Ostagar were mentioned briefly by the story's narrator, [[Varric Tethras]]. \n\nLoghain may make a further appearance as a supporting character in ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'', should he survive the events of ''Origins'' and joins the Grey Wardens. He is presented as an ally of the ''Inquisition'' alongside Hawke, the protagonist of ''Dragon Age II'', while they attempt to investigate corruption within the ranks of the Grey Warden Order. If Loghain participates in the ritual with Morrigan in ''Origins'', she will conceive a child with him; Loghain may encounter his young son in ''Inquisition''.\n\n===In Other Media===\nLoghain's [[origin story]] is told in ''The Stolen Throne'', which takes place more than thirty years before the events of the ''Origins''. During the Orlesian occupation, Loghain's father refused to pay the tax collectors a tribute tax levied on all of Ferelden [[landholder]]s by the Orlesian emperor, and was accused of tax evasion. One day the Orlesian soldiers seized the farmhold, and Loghain and his father were forced to watch as Orlesian troops raped and killed his mother. After murdering the Orlesian commander responsible, Loghain's father took him and fled into the Fereldan wilds, banding together with other desperate Ferelden's to eke out a living however they could.\n\nWhile living with a band of outlaws, Loghain met Maric, though he was not initially aware of Maric's lineage. When the Orlesian forces caught up with them, his father sacrificed himself to save Maric after charging Loghain with his safety. They pass through the Korcari Wilds, and meets the mysterious Witch of the Wilds, who enables them to pass through the Wilds safely. She provides this help on the condition that Maric makes her a promise; the specifics of this promise are unknown. She also prophesied to Maric that a Blight will one day come to Ferelden and gives him a cryptic warning about Loghain: \"Keep him close and he will betray you, each time worse than the last\". The duo successfully escape the wilds and joins Maric's rebel army. \n\nOver the course of the rebellion, Loghain became one of Maric's closest friends, as well as a key military advisor of the rebel cause. His strategies and tactics were responsible for many of the rebels' greatest victories.  Loghain fell in love with Rowan Guerrin, the sister of Eamon and Teagan Guerrin who was betrothed to Maric and thus the future queen. Afterwards Loghain led the Ferelden forces at the critical Battle of River Dane and was rewarded for his leadership by being made [[Lord|Teyrn]] of Gwaren. The Ferelden resistance eventually drove the Orlesian Empire out of their homeland completely. Loghain was then raised to the position of [[Lord|Teyrn]] of Gwaren for his service to King Maric. \n\nIn the sequel to ''The Stolen Throne'', ''The Calling'', Loghain continued to support King Maric in the years after the passing of Queen Rowan. It is revealed that Loghain had long been suspicious of the Grey Wardens; the Order was previously exiled from the realm centuries before due to a power struggle for the Ferelden throne, and he perceives the organization to be in league with Orlais. After Maric vanished following a meeting with the Wardens and the First Enchanter of the Orlesian Circle of Magi, Loghain deployed the Ferelden army to search for Maric while he spied on the Orlesians, certain that they would be betrayed. Two days after a tower named Kinhold Hold was taken over by Orlesian mages and templars who allied with a Darkspawn leader, Loghain led an assault on Kinloch Hold through Lake Calenhad. The attack was successful and Loghain was surprised when he found Maric in the tower as well. Loghain believed the plot was the doing of the Grey Wardens and felt Maric made a mistake in continuing to trust them. He disapproved when Maric indicated that he has allowed the Wardens to return to Ferelden, as they were previously exiled from Ferelden for hundreds of years by a previous King of Ferelden, and re-establish their order there on a permanent basis. Loghain did not speak to Maric the entire trip back to Denerim until they parted ways. At that point, Loghain only said, \u201cThere will be no Blight, Maric\u201d.  \n\nAfter King Maric became lost at sea and is presumed dead, Loghain became responsible for defending Ferelden and guiding Maric's naive son, King Cailan Theirin. His daughter, Anora would eventually be married to Cailan.\n\nIn 2010 Loghain was included in DC Unlimited's ''Dragon Age'' themed range of video game figures, along with Duncan, Morrigan, and a Genlock.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> \n\n==Reception==\nLoghain was acclaimed for his appearance in ''Origins''. In their December 2010 issue, ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked Loghain as #9 in their \"Top 30 Characters Who Defined A Decade\" list.<ref name=\"Decade\"/> A special edition podcast was later uploaded which provides insider's look into how the list came to be, where the editors discussed the selections, and some of the internal debates they had in selecting the list.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/> In a later editorial published in 2014, the managing editor of ''Game Informer'', Matt Bertz, singled out Loghain as the best character in ''Origins'' but criticized the other party members as being the largest cast of insufferable companions he has experienced in a modern role-playing game. Bertz said he \"loved the shades of gray BioWare used to paint this protector of the realm who always thought he was doing to right thing even when that took him down some dark roads\".<ref name=\"Versus\"/> IGN ranks Loghain's betrayal as #83 on their top 100 list of unforgettable video game moments.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> IGN's Christian Holt considers Loghain's betrayal at Ostagar to be a great plot starter; the player character becomes one of the last Grey Wardens who is capable of defeating the Darkspawn, and spends much of the remaining game gathering allies to fight both the Darkspawn and Loghain's forces. He notes that, like a true Bioware game, the player later gets to decide Loghain's fate, concluding \"Was he a sniveling coward or intelligent for not entering a hopeless battle? Were the Grey Wardens too powerful? Should he be executed or allowed to redeem himself? It\u2019s all set up by Loghain\u2019s actions at Ostagar in the game\u2019s first hours\".\n\nRick Lane of ''PC Gamer'' named Loghain as one of the superb examples of human villains in gaming. He explains that many of Loghain's actions are undoubtedly evil, but motivating them are visibly human emotions of fear, conviction, and love for his daughter. He praised ''Dragon Age'' for going further than most video games, by allowing the player to make a final judgement on Loghain.<ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> Cobbett, in an article written for ''Eurogamer'' in 2016, praised the complexity of Loghain's character as an example of a high level of writing care and attention.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> In a later article written in 2017 for ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'', Cobbett named Loghain as the most successful example of a [[Villain#Sympathetic_villain|sympathetic villain]] in a role playing game that he could think of. He notes that once Loghain discovers that only a blood sacrifice to slay the Archdemon, the [[dragon|draconic leader]] of the Darkspawn horde, would save Ferelden from the Blight, \"he's also the first to volunteer immediately, having realized his mistakes and is looking for a way to atone\".<ref name=\"RPS\"/> Sam Roberts of ''Gamesradar'' share the same sentiments: Loghain being the only notable antagonist in ''Origins'', has his reasons for being the way he is and the player have the opportunity to unravel them. He noted that characters like Loghain are better than the actual story due to the well written dialogue, whereas he found the overarching narrative to be difficult for him to get invested in.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> Keri Honea of PlayStation Lifestyle drew reference to the tie-in novels for ''Origins'', ''The Stolen Throne'' and ''The Calling'', when discussing Loghain's actions and motivations in ''Origins''. She considers the novels essential reading in order to fully understand his character, and claims that she no longer feels a visceral hatred for the character after reading the novels.<ref name=\"PSLS\"/>\n\nJosh Straub of ''Game Informer'', in a retrospective article about ''Origins'', commented that Loghain's choices as the primary antagonist means that the player will have to choose between avenging the death of Duncan and forgiving Loghain in favor of strengthening the forces of Ferelden. He observed that not only was Loghain's actions at the Battle of Ostagar important to the beginning of ''Origins'', it is integral to shaping the identity of the entire ''Dragon Age'' franchise, further noting that the events of ''[[Dragon Age II]]'' was set into motion as a result of the outcome of the Battle of Ostagar.<ref

Or it could be as [[Solas (Dragon Age)|Solas]] said in ''[[Dragon Age: Inquisition]]'', that when he dreamed near Ostagar, he saw \u201can army overwhelmed and a veteran commander refusing to let more soldiers die in a lost cause.\u201d Most likely, it\u2019s a combination of both.\"\n| source = \u2014Keri Honea, ''A Little Look at Lore: Understanding Loghain''.<ref name=\"PSLS\"/> \n}}\nLoghain is depicted as a [[war hero]] and a [[Patriotism|patriot]], revered by many common folk in Ferelden. He inspires intense loyalty among those who serve under him<ref name=\"Cauthrien\"/>. \n\nIn an article written for Rock Paper Shotgun in 2017, Richard Cobbett observed that Loghain certainly comes across like a villain \"who spends most of the game up to his gauntlets in dodgy dealings\", but if the player interacts with Loghain as a party member, a much more rounded figure emerges; he would articulate his reasons for doubting the veracity of the Blight and reveal his suspicion of the Grey Warden's presence as being merely part of a scheme from Ferelden's former colonizers, the Orlesian Empire. He possesses a \"strong sense of honour\", albeit with a \"ruthless\" streak. \n\nJeff Cork, writing for Game Informer, agreed. He observed that Loghain \"is more than just the one-dimensional traitorous scum players had been led to believe. Late in the game we learn more about his motivations for betraying the Grey Wardens (and the player), and they actually make sense. Rather than the power-mad general we\u2019d been set up to expect, he\u2019s actually a fiercely loyal leader desperate to keep his nation safe\".<ref name=\"Beyond\"/>\n\n==Appearances==\n===In Video Games===\nLoghain is first encountered at the fortress of Ostagar in ''Origins''. As the Teyrn commanding the army, Loghain is responsible for devising the tactics that will be used in the Battle of Ostagar. Loghain's plan utilizes the anvil and hammer strategy; the Grey Wardens are to act as the anvil, drawing the main Darkspawn horde out, and Loghain's troops will flank the Darkspawn once the beacon is lit.\n\nAlthough Loghain advises him not to fight on the front lines, Cailan refuses to listen and insists on accompanying the Wardens. Cailan also insists on having the two newest Grey Wardens, the player character and [[Alistair (Dragon Age)|Alistair]], light the beacon; however, after the signal is given for Loghain to launch an attack on the Darkspawn's flank, he commits an act of [[desertion]] and orders a retreat from the field along with his army, leaving both the King and the Grey Wardens to their deaths. IGN's Christian Holt notes that the death of Duncan, the protagonist's mentor, \"is particularly painful because no matter what origin story you went with, he played a role as a steady but firm hand that not only saved your life, but initiated you into the Grey Wardens\". \n\nFor the majority of the game from then on, Loghain takes up residence in Denerim and appoints himself regent to Queen Anora, becoming the de facto ruler of Ferelden. He uses the Grey Wardens as a [[scapegoat]], blaming his traitorous actions at Ostagar on the Wardens; he simultaneously outlawing the Grey Wardens in Ferelden, putting a price on the head of any survivors and closing the border to Warden reinforcements from Orlais. He also demands that Ferelden's nobility submit to his rule. The nobility, either disbelieving Loghain's explanation of the disaster at Ostagar or feeling that, given his [[commoner|common birth]] and the alacrity with which he had taken the regency in the aftermath of Cailan's death, Loghain was opportunistically grabbing a throne he had no claim to, refused to acknowledge Loghain's authority and demanded that he resign the regency; Loghain's refusal to do so and his heavy-handed tactics to force the people to fall into line instigated a [[civil war]] between his forces and those of Ferelden's nobility.\n\nLoghain may join the player's party as a secret companion character late in the game.<ref name=\"Secret\"/> After the player and Loghain duel each other during the Landsmeet event, the player may choose to either have Loghain executed for his crimes or recruited into the Grey Wardens. Allowing Loghain to live will result in Alistair leaving the party in disgust, and will allow Loghain to take his place in the party. Choosing to have Loghain killed will result in Alistair staying, but Anora will refuse to marry whomever killed her father. It is possible if the player has hardened Alistair through his personal quest to have Alistair still marry Anora and rule as king while keeping Loghain alive, in this path Loghain still replaces him as a party member. Loghain is aware the Joining was meant to be a death sentence, and is willing to sacrifice himself to kill the Archdemon, seeing it as a way of making amends for his mistakes. At the conclusion of this story path, the player may sacrifice either their protagonist or Loghain to slay the Archdemon, or in the alternative the Grey Warden characters may survive the death of the Archdemon if one of them participates in [[Morrigan (Dragon Age)|Morrigan]]'s ritual. \n\nLoghain makes a small cameo appearance in ''Dragon Age: Origins \u2013 Awakening'' should he survive the events of ''Origins'',  he informs the player character he is being sent by the Grey Wardens to serve in Orlais by order of the senior Grey Warden leadership; if the player married Anora, he will make a number of related comments, including suggesting plans for an heir and admonishing the player to treat his daughter well.\n\nIn ''[[Dragon Age II]]'', Loghain's actions at the Battle of Ostagar were mentioned briefly by the story's narrator, [[Varric Tethras]]. \n\nLoghain may make a further appearance as a supporting character in ''Dragon Age: Inquisition'', should he survive the events of ''Origins'' and joins the Grey Wardens. He is presented as an ally of the ''Inquisition'' alongside Hawke, the protagonist of ''Dragon Age II'', while they attempt to investigate corruption within the ranks of the Grey Warden Order. If Loghain participates in the ritual with Morrigan in ''Origins'', she will conceive a child with him; Loghain may encounter his young son in ''Inquisition''.\n\n===In Other Media===\nLoghain's [[origin story]] is told in ''The Stolen Throne'', which takes place more than thirty years before the events of the ''Origins''. During the Orlesian occupation, Loghain's father refused to pay the tax collectors a tribute tax levied on all of Ferelden [[landholder]]s by the Orlesian emperor, and was accused of tax evasion. One day the Orlesian soldiers seized the farmhold, and Loghain and his father were forced to watch as Orlesian troops raped and killed his mother. After murdering the Orlesian commander responsible, Loghain's father took him and fled into the Fereldan wilds, banding together with other desperate Ferelden's to eke out a living however they could.\n\nWhile living with a band of outlaws, Loghain met Maric, though he was not initially aware of Maric's lineage. When the Orlesian forces caught up with them, his father sacrificed himself to save Maric after charging Loghain with his safety. They pass through the Korcari Wilds, and meets the mysterious Witch of the Wilds, who enables them to pass through the Wilds safely. She provides this help on the condition that Maric makes her a promise; the specifics of this promise are unknown. She also prophesied to Maric that a Blight will one day come to Ferelden and gives him a cryptic warning about Loghain: \"Keep him close and he will betray you, each time worse than the last\". The duo successfully escape the wilds and joins Maric's rebel army. \n\nOver the course of the rebellion, Loghain became one of Maric's closest friends, as well as a key military advisor of the rebel cause. His strategies and tactics were responsible for many of the rebels' greatest victories.  Loghain fell in love with Rowan Guerrin, the sister of Eamon and Teagan Guerrin who was betrothed to Maric and thus the future queen. Afterwards Loghain led the Ferelden forces at the critical Battle of River Dane and was rewarded for his leadership by being made [[Lord|Teyrn]] of Gwaren. The Ferelden resistance eventually drove the Orlesian Empire out of their homeland completely. Loghain was then raised to the position of [[Lord|Teyrn]] of Gwaren for his service to King Maric. \n\nIn the sequel to ''The Stolen Throne'', ''The Calling'', Loghain continued to support King Maric in the years after the passing of Queen Rowan. It is revealed that Loghain had long been suspicious of the Grey Wardens; the Order was previously exiled from the realm centuries before due to a power struggle for the Ferelden throne, and he perceives the organization to be in league with Orlais. After Maric vanished following a meeting with the Wardens and the First Enchanter of the Orlesian Circle of Magi, Loghain deployed the Ferelden army to search for Maric while he spied on the Orlesians, certain that they would be betrayed. Two days after a tower named Kinhold Hold was taken over by Orlesian mages and templars who allied with a Darkspawn leader, Loghain led an assault on Kinloch Hold through Lake Calenhad. The attack was successful and Loghain was surprised when he found Maric in the tower as well. Loghain believed the plot was the doing of the Grey Wardens and felt Maric made a mistake in continuing to trust them. He disapproved when Maric indicated that he has allowed the Wardens to return to Ferelden, as they were previously exiled from Ferelden for hundreds of years by a previous King of Ferelden, and re-establish their order there on a permanent basis. Loghain did not speak to Maric the entire trip back to Denerim until they parted ways. At that point, Loghain only said, \u201cThere will be no Blight, Maric\u201d.  \n\nAfter King Maric became lost at sea and is presumed dead, Loghain became responsible for defending Ferelden and guiding Maric's naive son, King Cailan Theirin. His daughter, Anora would eventually be married to Cailan.\n\nIn 2010 Loghain was included in DC Unlimited's ''Dragon Age'' themed range of video game figures, along with Duncan, Morrigan, and a Genlock.<ref name=\"Kotaku\"/> \n\n==Reception==\nLoghain was acclaimed for his appearance in ''Origins''. In their December 2010 issue, ''[[Game Informer]]'' ranked Loghain as #9 in their \"Top 30 Characters Who Defined A Decade\" list.<ref name=\"Decade\"/> A special edition podcast was later uploaded which provides insider's look into how the list came to be, where the editors discussed the selections, and some of the internal debates they had in selecting the list.<ref name=\"Podcast\"/> In a later editorial published in 2014, the managing editor of ''Game Informer'', Matt Bertz, singled out Loghain as the best character in ''Origins'' but criticized the other party members as being the largest cast of insufferable companions he has experienced in a modern role-playing game. Bertz said he \"loved the shades of gray BioWare used to paint this protector of the realm who always thought he was doing to right thing even when that took him down some dark roads\".<ref name=\"Versus\"/> IGN ranks Loghain's betrayal as #83 on their top 100 list of unforgettable video game moments.<ref name=\"IGN\"/> IGN's Christian Holt considers Loghain's betrayal at Ostagar to be a great plot starter; the player character becomes one of the last Grey Wardens who is capable of defeating the Darkspawn, and spends much of the remaining game gathering allies to fight both the Darkspawn and Loghain's forces. He notes that, like a true Bioware game, the player later gets to decide Loghain's fate, concluding \"Was he a sniveling coward or intelligent for not entering a hopeless battle? Were the Grey Wardens too powerful? Should he be executed or allowed to redeem himself? It\u2019s all set up by Loghain\u2019s actions at Ostagar in the game\u2019s first hours\".\n\nRick Lane of ''PC Gamer'' named Loghain as one of the superb examples of human villains in gaming. He explains that many of Loghain's actions are undoubtedly evil, but motivating them are visibly human emotions of fear, conviction, and love for his daughter. He praised ''Dragon Age'' for going further than most video games, by allowing the player to make a final judgement on Loghain.<ref name=\"PC Gamer\"/> Cobbett, in an article written for ''Eurogamer'' in 2016, praised the complexity of Loghain's character as an example of a high level of writing care and attention.<ref name=\"Eurogamer\"/> In a later article written in 2017 for ''[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]]'', Cobbett named Loghain as the most successful example of a [[Villain#Sympathetic_villain|sympathetic villain]] in a role playing game that he could think of. He notes that once Loghain discovers that only a blood sacrifice to slay the Archdemon, the [[dragon|draconic leader]] of the Darkspawn horde, would save Ferelden from the Blight, \"he's also the first to volunteer immediately, having realized his mistakes and is looking for a way to atone\".<ref name=\"RPS\"/> Sam Roberts of ''Gamesradar'' share the same sentiments: Loghain being the only notable antagonist in ''Origins'', has his reasons for being the way he is and the player have the opportunity to unravel them. He noted that characters like Loghain are better than the actual story due to the well written dialogue, whereas he found the overarching narrative to be difficult for him to get invested in.<ref name=\"Gamesradar\"/> Keri Honea of PlayStation Lifestyle drew reference to the tie-in novels for ''Origins'', ''The Stolen Throne'' and ''The Calling'', when discussing Loghain's actions and motivations in ''Origins''. She considers the novels essential reading in order to fully understand his character, and claims that she no longer feels a visceral hatred for the character after reading the novels.<ref name=\"PSLS\"/>\n\nJosh Straub of ''Game Informer'', in a retrospective article about ''Origins'', commented that Loghain's choices as the primary antagonist means that the player will have to choose between avenging the death of Duncan and forgiving Loghain in favor of strengthening the forces of Ferelden. He observed that not only was Loghain's actions at the Battle of Ostagar important to the beginning of ''Origins'', it is integral to shaping the identity of the entire ''Dragon Age'' franchise, further noting that the events of ''[[Dragon Age II]]'' was set into motion as a result of the outcome of the Battle of Ostagar.<ref name=\"Moments\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<!--Games-->\n<ref name=\"Cauthrien\">{{cite video game |title=Dragon Age: Origins |developer=BioWare |level=Denerim: Royal Palace |quote='''Ser Cauthrien''':  You have torn this nation apart to oppose my lord, and never once tried to understand why he is a hero to Ferelden. }}</ref>\n\n<!--Printed media-->\n<ref name=\"Secret\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s);

caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref

92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in

NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on [[CNBC]], [[USA Network]], and [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network]].\n\nAs in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market,  and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them. These broadcasters include [[regional sports network]] chains such as [[Fox Sports Networks]], [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], [[NBC Sports Regional Networks]], and [[AT&T SportsNet]]. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN, such as non-Wednesday regular season games and first round playoff games, are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.\n\nOnly a handful of regular season games, including the [[NHL outdoor games|outdoor games]], may be broadcast nationally in both countries. A Saturday night [[Bruins\u2013Canadiens rivalry|Bruins\u2013Canadiens]] game, for example, would typically air on ''Hockey Night in Canada'' across that country but only regionally south of the border in the Boston area. Likewise, a Tuesday night Bruins\u2013Canadiens game may air across the U.S. on NBCSN but only regionally north of the border in the Montreal area.\n\n[[XM Satellite Radio]] is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL, as of July 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[XM Satellite Radio]] |date=June 28, 2007 |title=XM to Become Exclusive Satellite Radio Carrier of NHL |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=1466 |accessdate=June 28, 2007}}</ref> Between September 2005 and June 2007, the NHL's broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout. XM used to broadcast more than 80% of NHL games, including all the playoffs and finals. Starting with the 2007\u201308 season, XM broadcasts every game.\n\nThe league used to operate an [[NHL Radio]] network, through [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], that carried high-profile contests such as the Stanley Cup Finals to stations across the United States. From 2009 to 2015, the league did not have national radio broadcasts, relying only on local broadcast teams.<ref>http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/06/05/nba-finals-ratings-soar-here-another-local-angle-to-celebrity-family-feud/</ref> NHL Radio resumed during the 2016 playoffs through [[NBC Sports Radio]].\n\n==NHL Network==\n{{main|NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network (Canadian TV network)}}\n[[File:NHL Network at the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.jpg|thumb|The [[NHL Network (American TV channel)|NHL Network]]'s television panel at the [[2019 NHL Entry Draft]] at [[Rogers Arena]] in Vancouver]]\nThe league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is ''[[NHL Tonight]]'' (formerly ''NHL on the Fly''), which covers NHL news, highlights, interviews, and analysis. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters.\n\nThere were originally two versions: [[NHL Network (Canadian TV network)|one for Canadian viewers]] and a separate one for [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|those in the United States]]. The Canadian version shut down on September 1, 2015, due to Rogers Communications' acquisition of sole national media rights to the NHL in Canada. The U.S. version will continue to simulcast selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.\n\n==Out-of-market sports packages==\nThe NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games; [[NHL Centre Ice]] in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=27197 |title=NHL Centre Ice (Canada) official website |publisher=Nhl.com |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> and [[NHL Center Ice]] in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26371 |title=NHL Center Ice United States official website |work=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider.\n\nThe league also offers ''NHL.tv'' (branded as ''Rogers NHL Live'' in Canada), which allows the [[video streaming]] of out-of-market games over the internet, either through the NHL website, [[mobile app|smartphones and tablets]], [[digital media player]]s, [[smart TV]]s, and [[video game console]]s. In the United States, the service does not carry national games (which are offered through the NBC Sports Live Extra service to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated pay television subscribers]]) or in-market games (online availability varies by broadcaster).\n\nPer its exclusive national television and digital rights contract, [[Rogers Communications]] took over Canadian distribution and marketing of both the out-of-market TV and the internet services in Canada as of the 2014\u201315 season. A number of changes were made to the internet service, which was initially re-branded as ''Rogers NHL GameCentre Live''. Canadian users access the service using a \"MyRogers\" login account instead of one directly on NHL.com. As part of the transition, Rogers also issued a free trial of the service, lasting through the start of 2015, to all Rogers cable and mobile internet subscribers.<ref name=np-everygame>{{cite news|title=Rogers will allow you to watch even more NHL games online this season ... just not all of them|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/09/03/how-rogers-will-allow-you-to-watch-even-more-nhl-games-online-this-season-just-not-all-of-them/|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=National Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140918202857/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/09/03/how-rogers-will-allow-you-to-watch-even-more-nhl-games-online-this-season-just-not-all-of-them/|archive-date=18 September 2014|df=}}</ref> The services offers access to national games, along with in-market streaming of regional games.

Hockey broadcasting on a national scale was spotty prior to 1981; NBC and CBS held rights at various times during that period, with each network carrying weekend-afternoon games during the second half of the regular season and the playoffs, along with some (but not all) of the Stanley Cup Finals. From 1971 to 1995, there was no exclusive coverage of games.\n[[File:Mike \"Doc\" Emrick (2014).jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Mike Emrick|Mike \"Doc\" Emrick]], [[NBC Sports]]' lead hockey play-by-play announcer, 2014]]\nNational U.S. television rights are currently held by [[NBC Sports]]; its current 10-year, US$2 billion contract, which began in the [[2011\u201312 NHL season|2011\u201312 season]], extended and unified rights deals that were first established in the [[2005\u201306 NHL season|2005\u201306]] season, when [[Comcast]] (through OLN, later [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]]) acquired cable rights to replace ESPN, and [[NBC]] acquired broadcast television rights under a revenue-sharing agreement to replace [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]].<ref name=\"nysun\">{{cite news|first=Evan |last=Weiner |work=New York Sun |url=http://www.nysun.com/article/34542 |title= Don't Believe the Gripe: The NHL Is Back |date=June 16, 2006 |accessdate=June 19, 2006}}</ref> Following the acquisition of parent company [[NBCUniversal]] by Comcast, Versus was re-branded as NBC Sports Network, and the company negotiated a new, 10-year, unified rights deal worth nearly US$2 billion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |title=NBC/Versus To Air NHL Games For The Next Ten Years |author=Fang, Ken |date=April 19, 2011 |work= |publisher=Fangsbites.com |accessdate=April 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018033414/http://fangsbites.com/2011/04/nbcversus-to-air-nhl-games-for-the-next-ten-year/ |archive-date=October 18, 2011 }}</ref> Under this contract, [[NBCSN]] usually airs at least two regular season games per week, while NBC airs afternoon games on selected weekends. NBCUniversal holds exclusive rights to Wednesday night games, all games televised by the NBC network, and every game in the Stanley Cup playoffs beginning in the second round. Coverage of the playoffs and the Finals is split between the two networks, with other games shown on [[CNBC]], [[USA Network]], and [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network]].\n\nAs in Canada, games not broadcast nationally are aired regionally within a team's home market,  and are subject to [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] outside of them. These broadcasters include [[regional sports network]] chains such as [[Fox Sports Networks]], [[MSG (TV network)|MSG Network]], [[NBC Sports Regional Networks]], and [[AT&T SportsNet]]. Certain national telecasts on NBCSN, such as non-Wednesday regular season games and first round playoff games, are non-exclusive, and may also air in tandem with telecasts of the game by local broadcasters. However, national telecasts of these games are blacked out in the participating teams' markets to protect the local broadcaster.\n\nOnly a handful of regular season games, including the [[NHL outdoor games|outdoor games]], may be broadcast nationally in both countries. A Saturday night [[Bruins\u2013Canadiens rivalry|Bruins\u2013Canadiens]] game, for example, would typically air on ''Hockey Night in Canada'' across that country but only regionally south of the border in the Boston area. Likewise, a Tuesday night Bruins\u2013Canadiens game may air across the U.S. on NBCSN but only regionally north of the border in the Montreal area.\n\n[[XM Satellite Radio]] is the official satellite radio broadcaster of the NHL, as of July 1, 2007.<ref>{{cite press release |publisher=[[XM Satellite Radio]] |date=June 28, 2007 |title=XM to Become Exclusive Satellite Radio Carrier of NHL |url=http://xmradio.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=press_releases&item=1466 |accessdate=June 28, 2007}}</ref> Between September 2005 and June 2007, the NHL's broadcasting rights were shared with both XM and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] and were broadcast on just Sirius before the NHL lockout. XM used to broadcast more than 80% of NHL games, including all the playoffs and finals. Starting with the 2007\u201308 season, XM broadcasts every game.\n\nThe league used to operate an [[NHL Radio]] network, through [[Westwood One (1976\u20132011)|Westwood One]], that carried high-profile contests such as the Stanley Cup Finals to stations across the United States. From 2009 to 2015, the league did not have national radio broadcasts, relying only on local broadcast teams.<ref>http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2015/06/05/nba-finals-ratings-soar-here-another-local-angle-to-celebrity-family-feud/</ref> NHL Radio resumed during the 2016 playoffs through [[NBC Sports Radio]].\n\n==NHL Network==\n{{main|NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|NHL Network (Canadian TV network)}}\n[[File:NHL Network at the 2019 NHL Entry Draft.jpg|thumb|The [[NHL Network (American TV channel)|NHL Network]]'s television panel at the [[2019 NHL Entry Draft]] at [[Rogers Arena]] in Vancouver]]\nThe league co-owns the NHL Network, a television specialty channel devoted to the NHL. Its signature show is ''[[NHL Tonight]]'' (formerly ''NHL on the Fly''), which covers NHL news, highlights, interviews, and analysis. The NHL Network also airs live games, but primarily simulcasts of one of the team's regional broadcasters.\n\nThere were originally two versions: [[NHL Network (Canadian TV network)|one for Canadian viewers]] and a separate one for [[NHL Network (U.S. TV network)|those in the United States]]. The Canadian version shut down on September 1, 2015, due to Rogers Communications' acquisition of sole national media rights to the NHL in Canada. The U.S. version will continue to simulcast selected regular season games nationally that are not aired by NBC Sports, as well as be used as an overflow channel during the playoffs.\n\n==Out-of-market sports packages==\nThe NHL operates two subscription-based services allowing access to live, out-of-market games; [[NHL Centre Ice]] in Canada<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=27197 |title=NHL Centre Ice (Canada) official website |publisher=Nhl.com |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> and [[NHL Center Ice]] in the United States<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/page.htm?id=26371 |title=NHL Center Ice United States official website |work=NHL.com |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2014}}</ref> offer access to out-of-market feeds of games through a cable or satellite television provider.\n\nThe league also offers ''NHL.tv'' (branded as ''Rogers NHL Live'' in Canada), which allows the [[video streaming]] of out-of-market games over the internet, either through the NHL website, [[mobile app|smartphones and tablets]], [[digital media player]]s, [[smart TV]]s, and [[video game console]]s. In the United States, the service does not carry national games (which are offered through the NBC Sports Live Extra service to [[TV Everywhere|authenticated pay television subscribers]]) or in-market games (online availability varies by broadcaster).\n\nPer its exclusive national television and digital rights contract, [[Rogers Communications]] took over Canadian distribution and marketing of both the out-of-market TV and the internet services in Canada as of the 2014\u201315 season. A number of changes were made to the internet service, which was initially re-branded as ''Rogers NHL GameCentre Live''. Canadian users access the service using a \"MyRogers\" login account instead of one directly on NHL.com. As part of the transition, Rogers also issued a free trial of the service, lasting through the start of 2015, to all Rogers cable and mobile internet subscribers.<ref name=np-everygame>{{cite news|title=Rogers will allow you to watch even more NHL games online this season ... just not all of them|url=http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/09/03/how-rogers-will-allow-you-to-watch-even-more-nhl-games-online-this-season-just-not-all-of-them/|accessdate=18 September 2014|work=National Post|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20140918202857/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2014/09/03/how-rogers-will-allow-you-to-watch-even-more-nhl-games-online-this-season-just-not-all-of-them/|archive-date=18 September 2014|df=}}</ref> The services offers access to national games, along with in-market streaming of regional games.

Rogers GameCentre Live also offers \"GamePlus\", a component featuring alternate camera angles, such as net cams, point-of-view cams, and sky cams.

The differences are most prominent during each league's respective championship series or game. The U.S. broadcaster's feed of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Super Bowl]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]] and the [[NBA Finals|National Basketball Association Finals]] is usually simulcast by a Canadian broadcaster (with [[simultaneous substitution]] of the commercials). With the prominence of ''Hockey Night in Canada'' since the 1950s, and with Canadian teams like the [[Edmonton Oilers]] and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] making multiple championship runs during the 1970s and 1980s, the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] has regularly been produced and aired on [[Terrestrial television|broadcast television]] in Canada. On the other hand, with the historically inconsistent U.S. coverage, and the current contract that calls for the Cup Finals to be split between NBC and NBCSN, the entire series has never been exclusively televised on a U.S. broadcast network.\n\n==Summary of branded-nationally televised games==\n[[File:Hockey Night in Canada - Ron MacLean.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Ron Maclean]], host of ''[[Hockey Night in Canada]]'', 2006]]\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!
