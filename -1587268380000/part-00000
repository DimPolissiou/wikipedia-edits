Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref>\n\nChauhans have 24 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara.

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya influenced by Jain philosophy===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara.

After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983). Bachhawat Gotriya Mehta Vansh: Utpati, Ateet and Vartmaan (Hindi). Mahendra Prakashan, Udaipur.</ref> This was one of the trade routes to sea ports of Gujarat.\n\nLater, [[Chittorgarh fort|Chittorgarh Fort]] was recovered from Muslim occupation by Maharana Hamir Singh I. Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all his brothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\" />''</blockquote>After the death of Bothra Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty|Gurjar]] \u2013 [[Patan, Gujarat|Patan]] ([[Anhilpur]]) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to [[Chittorgarh]] to settle down. Later his descendant, Bothra Bachhraj became [[Dewan]] of [[Jodhpur State|Jodhpur]] and founding Dewan of [[Bikaner State|Bikaner.]] Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, in 15th century, the Kingdom of [[Mewar dynasty|Mewar]] was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with [[Bari Sadri|Badi Sadri]] and [[Gogunda]]. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of [[Dhrangadhra State|Dhrangadhara]] ([[Dhrangadhra State|Halvad]]), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. \n\nAjja fought alongside [[Rana Sanga|Maharana Sangram Singh]] I (1509\u20131527) against [[Babur]] in 1527 at the [[Battle of Khanwa]]. When Maharana Sangram Singh ([[Rana Sanga]]) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\" /> \n\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet to be researched and established.<br>\n{{chart top| '''<br>(1143* - 1350 AD)<br>Genealogical Tree \u2013 Jalore-Sirohi-Delwara<br>Songara / Deora Chauhan Dynasty<br>Rao Alhana to Raja Sagar'''}}\n<center>\n{{Tree chart/start}}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| | |WHITE='''Rao Alhana <br> Nadol 1143*'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #FB845B;|Tit=Rulers of Mewar - State Capitals|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Kirtipal <br> Jalore 1181'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kshem Singh / Rawal Samant Singh (1168- 1182*) - Ahar / Dungarpur <br> Rao Kirtipal invades Ahar and takes over Mewar <br> Settles Deora  Chauhans around Ahar / Girva |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Samar Singh <br> Jalore 1182'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Samant Singh - Dungarpur <br> (Kshem Singh was forced to move his capital to Dungarpur due to Muslim Invasions) |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Uday Singh <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kumar Singh / Manthan Singh / Padma Singh - Dungarpur |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart| | | | ,|- |^|- |.| | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit|ONE| |TWO| ONE='''Rao  Chargideo <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_ONE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|TWO='''Rao Man Singh <br> Jalore / Sirohi <br> 1213-28'''|boxstyle_TWO = background-color: #CFFB5B;|Tit=Rawal Jaitra Singh (1213-53) - Nagda|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n</center>\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god. It boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son, Kunwar Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.&nbsp; Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== City of learning and education ===\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== Grandeur of Jain temples ===\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at [[Chandravati]] (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the [[Vaghela dynasty|Vaghela]] ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930). These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]). \n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi).

Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh.

[[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.

Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul Deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cChauhans have 24 sects and Deoras are one of them.

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar [[Viramadeva|Viramdeo]] were killed in a battle against [[Alauddin Khalji's conquest of Jalore|Alauddin Khalji]] in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925|title=Chapter 5|website=www.ibiblio.org|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> \n\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of [[Jalore]], she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939). Oswal Jati ka Itihas. Oswal History Publishing House, Bhanpura, Indore.</ref>\n\nAround middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara. He was the progenitor of [[Karam Chand Bachhawat|Bachhawat]] clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980). Karamchandra Vanshavali Prabandh (Sanskrit / Hindi). Singhi Granthmala, Bhartiya Vidhya Bhawan, Mumbai.</ref>\n\n=== Battle of Bhutalghati ===\nOne of the fiercest battle Raja Sagar fought alongside Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) was against [[Iltutmish|Sultan Shams-ud-din Iltutmish]] (1211-36) at Bhutalghati, near [[Nagda, Rajasthan|Nagda]]. While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Sultan Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh (Hindi) \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015). Lokchetna Prakashan.</ref>\n<blockquote>''\u201cThis fierce battle was fought in the valley near Nagda towards Gogunda. Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offering water tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya influenced by Jain philosophy===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref>\n\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \n\n=== Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar ===\nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan. Rawat Publications.</ref>\n\n=== Rana Shree Karan Sacrifices his Life for Mewar ===\nAfter Raja Bohitya, his eldest son Raja Shree Karan ascended to the throne of Delwara. Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of Rana Shree Karan looted the treasury of [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] (1325-51) while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983). Bachhawat Gotriya Mehta Vansh: Utpati, Ateet and Vartmaan (Hindi). Mahendra Prakashan, Udaipur.</ref> This was one of the trade routes to sea ports of Gujarat.\n\nLater, [[Chittorgarh fort|Chittorgarh Fort]] was recovered from Muslim occupation by Maharana Hamir Singh I. Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq|Muhammad Bin Tughluk]] of Delhi brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near [[Mandalgarh]]. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting Maharana Hamir Singh I. Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi. Mewar established their supremacy within 50 years of the sack of Chittorgarh and Maharana Hamir Singh I recaptured the Fort in 1353.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\">Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar? It is yet tobe researched and established.<br>\n\n\n{{chart top| '''<br>(1143* - 1350 AD)<br>Genealogical Tree \u2013 Jalore-Sirohi-Delwara<br>Songara / Deora Chauhan Dynasty<br>Rao Alhana to Raja Sagar'''}}\n<center>\n{{Tree chart/start}}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| | |WHITE='''Rao Alhana <br> Nadol 1143*'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #FB845B;|Tit=Rulers of Mewar - State Capitals|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Kirtipal <br> Jalore 1181'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kshem Singh / Rawal Samant Singh (1168- 1182*) - Ahar / Dungarpur <br> Rao Kirtipal invades Ahar and takes over Mewar <br> Settles Deora  Chauhans around Ahar / Girva |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Samar Singh <br> Jalore 1182'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Samant Singh - Dungarpur <br> (Kshem Singh was forced to move his capital to Dungarpur due to Muslim Invasions) |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }} \n{{Tree chart| | | | | |!| | | | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit  |WHITE| WHITE='''Rao  Uday Singh <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_WHITE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|Tit=Rawal Kumar Singh / Manthan Singh / Padma Singh - Dungarpur |boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart| | | | ,|- |^|- |.| | | }}\n{{Tree chart|Tit|ONE| |TWO| ONE='''Rao  Chargideo <br> Jalore'''|boxstyle_ONE = background-color: #5BFBE8;|TWO='''Rao Man Singh <br> Jalore / Sirohi <br> 1213-28'''|boxstyle_TWO = background-color: #CFFB5B;|Tit=Rawal Jaitra Singh (1213-53) - Nagda|boxstyle_Tit = background-color: #F0F0EF; }}\n{{Tree chart/end}}\n</center>\n{{chart bottom}}\n\n== Delightful places <ref>https://wikitravel.org/en/Delwara</ref> ==\n'''Devi Garh Palace''' - This 18th century palace in the village of Delwara has undergone years of restoration and rebuilding.

Formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], the unit was raised for service during [[World War II]]. Originally formed as part of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Australian Division]] the brigade was subsequently transferred to the newly created [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian Division]] in December. The brigade served during the [[Western Desert Campaign]], forming part of the Allied garrison during the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Later, the brigade was withdrawn to Syria for occupation duties, but then later took part in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]]. In early 1943, the brigade was returned to Australia to fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. In 1943\u20131944, the brigade fought in New Guinea, taking part in the [[landing at Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]]. Its final campaign came late in the war, when it took part in the [[Battle of Labuan|Labuan landings]] and the [[Battle of North Borneo]] in mid-1945. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in early 1946.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe brigade was formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the all volunteer [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF). Consisting of three infantry battalions \u2013 the [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th]], [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th]] and [[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd]] \u2013 the brigade was recruited from Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. It opened its headquarters at [[Keperra, Queensland|Grovely]], but moved to [[Enoggera, Queensland|Enoggera]] a month later; its constituent units completed their training in their home locations, though. Upon establishment, the brigade was assigned to the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]]. The brigade's Queensland based battalion, the 2/25th, was detached in October 1940 and sent to garrison [[Darwin, Northern Territory]];{{sfn|Draydon|2001|p=23}} the same month, the 24th Brigade was transferred to the newly formed [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. This was part of a reorganisation of the 2nd AIF, which saw the less experienced units moved to the 9th Division, while those that were ready for combat were moved to the 7th Division.{{sfn|Johnston|2002|pp=2\u20133}} The 2/25th Battalion was later transferred to the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], while it was replaced by the [[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]], which had been formed in the United Kingdom and would marry up with the brigade in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407134738/https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp |title=2/32nd Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 July 2012|archivedate=7 April 2012}}</ref> In December 1940, the 24th Brigade embarked for the Middle East, arriving in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in February 1941, where the brigade concentrated, bringing together all three of its battalions for the first time.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2101}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier [[Eric Plant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/plant-eric-clive-pegus-11434/text20377 |title=Plant, Eric Clive Pegus (1890\u20131950) |author=Sutton, R. |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |year=2002 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Bren carriers from the Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn on manouevres Syria (AWM photo 024402).jpg|thumb|left|Bren carriers from the 24th Brigade on manoeuvre in Syria, June 1942|alt=A tracked military vehicle moves across the desert]]\n\nThe initial fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] had been undertaken by the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], which had launched a series of attacks in January 1941, with the [[Battle of Bardia]]. As the most experienced and prepared formation, it was subsequently sent to [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] to help defend against a German invasion there. To free the 6th Division up, the 9th Division was sent to relieve them around [[Benghazi]]. The 24th Brigade had not completed its training, so it was held back around [[Tobruk]] during this time, and placed in reserve.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|pp=2101\u20132102}} The 2/32nd joined the brigade at this time.<ref name=AWM/> In February 1941, Brigadier  [[Arthur Harry Langham Godfrey|Arthur Godfrey]], who had previously commanded the [[2/6th Battalion (Australia)|2/6th Battalion]], took over command of the 24th Brigade.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=198}} After [[Operation Sonnenblume|German forces landed]] around [[Tripoli]] to reinforce the Italians in North Africa, a large scale withdrawal began as the British and Australian forces were pushed back towards Tobruk, which was subsequently surrounded and placed under siege.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=65\u201383}} The 9th Division was subsequently assigned to the eastern sector of the Allied perimeter and over the brigade undertook defensive duties for the next several months, rotating around the position. In July and August, they held the Salient, taking over from the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]]; in this sector they carried out patrols and launched a minor attack.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=198\u2013203}} Elsewhere, they carried out raids against Italian positions in May and then again in September.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=220 & 235}} Finally, in September 1941, the British [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigade]] relieved the 24th, which was withdrawn by sea back to Palestine, less the 2/43rd Battalion, which was withdrawn the following month.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=284}}{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\nA period of rest and reorganisation followed before the 9th Division was sent to Syria in January 1942, relieving the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], which was to return to Australia due to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In Syria, the 9th Division formed part of the Allied garrison that had been established there following the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]]. Relieving the [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]], the 24th occupied positions in the interior, with its units spread out between Sir ed Danie, Haret Jedide, El Ayoun and Arle, although the 2/32nd moved from El Ayoun to [[Ramlieh]] in March. During May and June, the brigade rotated with the 26th Brigade to allow each formation to carry out collective training ahead of future operations, whilst still maintaining a defensive posture. By the end of June, the 9th Division received orders to return to Egypt, as the Germans began an offensive in North Africa that threatened the Allied base around [[Alexandria]]. The 24th Brigade established defensive positions around [[Lake Mariout|Lake Maryut]] in July, before being ordered to move forward to join the fighting in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. During this defensive battle, the brigade was temporarily detached to the British [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] and carried out raids from Ruweisat Ridge towards Alam Baoshaza. After returning to the 9th Division, the 24th Brigade carried out a series of attacks around the Qattara Track, Tel el Makh Khad and Ruin Ridge. During the assault on Ruin Ridge, the 2/28th Battalion suffered heavy losses when it became cut off, with the majority of the battalion eventually being taken prisoner. To make up for this loss, the [[2/3rd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd Pioneer Battalion]] was temporarily assigned to the brigade, whilst the 2/28th was rebuilt in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403113604/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |title=2/28th Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=3 July 2012 |archivedate=3 April 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the rest of the brigade fought to hold the German offensive and in September launched a series of raids in preparation for a coming offensive.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn mortar in 1942 (AWM image 024718).jpg|thumb|A mortar crew from the 24th Brigade during the fighting around El Alamein, 30 July 1942|alt=Soldiers loading a mortar tube in a desert position]]\n\nIn late October,  the Allies went on the offensive, launching the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. The 9th Division was assigned a role in the initial break-in effort, attacking around Tel el Eisa.

Here they began reorganising for jungle warfare, in preparation for deployment to [[New Guinea campaign|New Guinea]]. After amphibious warfare training  around [[Cairns, Queensland|Cairns]], the brigade took part in the [[Landing at Lae|capture of Lae]],{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2103}} which envisaged a two-pronged assault with the 7th Division advancing from [[Nadzab]].{{sfn|Keogh|1965|p=299}} Assigned as a follow on force, in early September 1943 the brigade staged out of [[Buna, Papua New Guinea|Buna]], and arrived at the landing beach {{convert|16|mi}} east of Lae, several days after the initial landing by the 20th and 26th Brigades. The 26th Brigade had led the advance towards Lae, but was replaced by the 24th, which took over the advance along the coast at the Burep River, while the 26th Brigade pushed inland. Heavy rain flooded the Busu River, and held up the advance, however, with the support of US engineers from [[2nd Engineer Special Brigade]] the 24th Brigade was able to force their way across and continue the advance towards Malahang airfield, where they defeated strong Japanese resistance on 15 September before linking up with the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], which had advanced from Nadzab.{{sfn|Keogh|1965|pp=310\u2013311}} In the aftermath, the 2/32nd provided a detachment to secure the [[Tami Islands]], where a radar station was built, while the rest of the brigade concentrated around the Burep River to prepare for future operations.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2103}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn embarking from Cairns August 1943 (AWM image 055354).jpg|thumb|left|Troops from the 24th Brigade embark at Cairns, 8 August 1943, bound for New Guinea|alt=Soldiers at a wharf prepare to embark for overseas]]\n\nAfter the capture of Lae, the Allies decided to follow up their success with another amphibious operation to secure [[Finschaffen]], as part of plans to secure control of the [[Huon Peninsula campaign|Huon Peninsula]] and [[Vitiaz Strait]].{{sfn|Dexter|1961|pp=444\u2013445}} The initial [[Landing at Scarlet Beach]] was carried out by the 20th Brigade, although the 2/43rd Battalion was detached from the 24th Brigade in late September to help defend the beachhead.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2013}} The 2/43rd subsequently took up a blocking posting around Jivevaneng, relieving the [[2/17th Battalion (Australia)|2/17th Battalion]], while the main elements of the 20th Brigade advanced south to [[Battle of Finschhafen|capture of Finschhafen]]. Throughout early October, the 2/43rd came under consistent attack, and it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing to launch a counter-attack. As a result the 24th Brigade's other two battalions, as well as the 9th Division's headquarters were landed by 11 October. The counter-attack came on 16 October, around Jivevaneng and around the coast, and the 24th Brigade was heavily involved in the fighting, eventually repelling the Japanese attack.

Within this campaign, the 24th Brigade was tasked with [[Battle of Labuan|landing on Labuan]], as part of the wider [[Battle of North Borneo]], in order to secure an anchorage in [[Brunei Bay]] for the [[British Pacific Fleet]].{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2013}}\n\n[[File:Australian troops coming ashore at Jesselton wharf (AWM 120777).JPG |thumb|Troops from the 24th Brigade land at Jesselton, September 1945|alt=Soldiers disembark a landing craft at a makeshift wooden jetty]]\n\nStaging out of [[Morotai Island]], where they arrived in April 1945, the 24th Brigade carried out the landing on Labuan on 10 June.

Following the landing, the 2/43rd fought to secure the airfields at Labuan and Timalai, while the 2/28th undertook some hard fighting on the left of the Australian lodgement, in an area dubbed \"the Pocket\". This resistance was overcome by 21 June with tank support.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=474\u2013475}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2/32nd Battalion subsequently landed on Labuan on 12 June, but was transferred to the mainland several days later, where it captured the town of [[Weston, Sabah|Weston]] before moving on towards [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=472 & 475}} It was assessed that Beaufort was occupied by up to 1,000 Japanese defenders, and as a result, following the fighting on Labuan, the remainder of the 24th Brigade was landed on the mainland. The 2/43rd landed around Mempakul to secure the Klias Peninsula with the [[2/11th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/11th Commando Squadron]], before moving by barge along the Klias River.

During this time, the brigade's battalions were spread out between [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]], [[Jesselton]], [[Membakut]], and [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].  In October 1945, the brigade commander, Porter, marched out of the unit, and the 2/32nd Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Scott, assumed administrative command, holding the position until early December 1945 when he was discharged but not replaced. The  [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation]] process began in October and continued for several months. The first unit to be declared redundant was the 2/28th Battalion which was moved back to Labuan in late October, in preparation for their return to Australia.<ref name=AWM822440/> Based on a priority system, each battalion began returning troops to Australia in drafts, as shipping became available.{{sfn|Combe|Ligertwood|Gilchrist|1992|pp=239\u2013242}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=15\u201316}} Other troops were transferred to the [[66th Battalion (Australia)|66th Infantry Battalion]] for further service as occupation troops.<ref name=AWM822440/> Meanwhile, a vocational education and training program was implemented to prepare the soldiers for their return to civilian life and to keep them occupied while they waited for demobilisation.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=500\u2013501}} In mid-December, the brigade's headquarters moved from Papar to Labuan and a large draft of personnel were returned to Australia. The final draft from the 24th Brigade embarked on the transport ''Lake Charles Victory'' on 10/11 January 1946.

Formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the [[Second Australian Imperial Force]], the unit was raised for service during [[World War II]]. Originally formed as part of the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Australian Division]] the brigade was subsequently transferred to the newly created [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Australian Division]] in December. The brigade served during the [[Western Desert Campaign]], forming part of the Allied garrison during the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Later, the brigade was withdrawn to Syria for occupation duties, but then later took part in the [[First Battle of El Alamein|First]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|Second Battles of El Alamein]]. In early 1943, the brigade was returned to Australia to fight against the Japanese in the Pacific. In 1943\u20131944, the brigade fought in New Guinea, taking part in the [[landing at Lae]] and the [[Huon Peninsula campaign]]. Its final campaign came late in the war, when it took part in the [[Battle of Labuan|Labuan landings]] and the [[Battle of North Borneo]] in mid-1945. After the war, the brigade was disbanded in early 1946.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe brigade was formed on 1 July 1940 as part of the all volunteer [[Second Australian Imperial Force]] (2nd AIF). Consisting of three infantry battalions \u2013 the [[2/25th Battalion (Australia)|2/25th]], [[2/28th Battalion (Australia)|2/28th]] and [[2/43rd Battalion (Australia)|2/43rd]] \u2013 the brigade was recruited from Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. It opened its headquarters at [[Keperra, Queensland|Grovely]], but moved to [[Enoggera, Queensland|Enoggera]] a month later; its constituent units completed their training in their home locations, though. Upon establishment, the brigade was assigned to the [[8th Division (Australia)|8th Division]]. The brigade's Queensland based battalion, the 2/25th, was detached in October 1940 and sent to garrison [[Darwin, Northern Territory]];{{sfn|Draydon|2001|p=23}} the same month, the 24th Brigade was transferred to the newly formed [[9th Division (Australia)|9th Division]]. This was part of a reorganisation of the 2nd AIF, which saw the less experienced units moved to the 9th Division, while those that were ready for combat were moved to the 7th Division.{{sfn|Johnston|2002|pp=2\u20133}} The 2/25th Battalion was later transferred to the [[25th Brigade (Australia)|25th Brigade]], while it was replaced by the [[2/32nd Battalion (Australia)|2/32nd Battalion]], which had been formed in the United Kingdom and would marry up with the brigade in the [[Middle East]].<ref name=AWM>{{cite web|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407134738/https://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11283.asp |title=2/32nd Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=17 July 2012|archivedate=7 April 2012}}</ref> In December 1940, the 24th Brigade embarked for the Middle East, arriving in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in February 1941, where the brigade concentrated, bringing together all three of its battalions for the first time.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2101}} The brigade's first commander was Brigadier [[Eric Plant]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/plant-eric-clive-pegus-11434/text20377 |title=Plant, Eric Clive Pegus (1890\u20131950) |author=Sutton, R. |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography, Volume 16 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |year=2002 |accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Middle East===\n[[File:Bren carriers from the Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn on manouevres Syria (AWM photo 024402).jpg|thumb|left|Bren carriers from the 24th Brigade on manoeuvre in Syria, June 1942|alt=A tracked military vehicle moves across the desert]]\n\nThe initial fighting in the [[Western Desert Campaign]] had been undertaken by the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], which had launched a series of attacks in January 1941, with the [[Battle of Bardia]]. As the most experienced and prepared formation, it was subsequently sent to [[Battle of Greece|Greece]] to help defend against a German invasion there. To free the 6th Division up, the 9th Division was sent to relieve them around [[Benghazi]].

In July and August, they held the Salient, taking over from the [[20th Brigade (Australia)|20th Brigade]]; in this sector they carried out patrols and launched a minor attack.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=198\u2013203}} Elsewhere, they carried out raids against Italian positions in May and then again in September.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|pp=220 & 235}} Finally, in September 1941, the British [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigade]] relieved the 24th, which was withdrawn by sea back to Palestine, less the 2/43rd Battalion, which was withdrawn the following month.{{sfn|Wilmot|1993|p=284}}{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\nA period of rest and reorganisation followed before the 9th Division was sent to Syria in January 1942, relieving the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th Division]], which was to return to Australia due to the threat posed by Japan's entry into the war. In Syria, the 9th Division formed part of the Allied garrison that had been established there following the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]]. Relieving the [[21st Brigade (Australia)|21st Brigade]], the 24th occupied positions in the interior, with its units spread out between Sir ed Danie, Haret Jedide, El Ayoun and Arle, although the 2/32nd moved from El Ayoun to [[Ramlieh]] in March. During May and June, the brigade rotated with the 26th Brigade to allow each formation to carry out collective training ahead of future operations, whilst still maintaining a defensive posture. By the end of June, the 9th Division received orders to return to Egypt, as the Germans began an offensive in North Africa that threatened the Allied base around [[Alexandria]]. The 24th Brigade established defensive positions around [[Lake Mariout|Lake Maryut]] in July, before being ordered to move forward to join the fighting in the [[First Battle of El Alamein]]. During this defensive battle, the brigade was temporarily detached to the British [[1st Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|1st Armoured Division]] and carried out raids from Ruweisat Ridge towards Alam Baoshaza. After returning to the 9th Division, the 24th Brigade carried out a series of attacks around the Qattara Track, Tel el Makh Khad and Ruin Ridge. During the assault on Ruin Ridge, the 2/28th Battalion suffered heavy losses when it became cut off, with the majority of the battalion eventually being taken prisoner. To make up for this loss, the [[2/3rd Pioneer Battalion (Australia)|2/3rd Pioneer Battalion]] was temporarily assigned to the brigade, whilst the 2/28th was rebuilt in Palestine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403113604/http://www.awm.gov.au/units/unit_11279second_world_war.asp |title=2/28th Battalion |work=Second World War, 1939\u20131945 units |publisher=Australian War Memorial |accessdate=3 July 2012 |archivedate=3 April 2012}}</ref> Meanwhile, the rest of the brigade fought to hold the German offensive and in September launched a series of raids in preparation for a coming offensive.{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2102}}\n\n[[File:Australian 2-43rd Inf Bn mortar in 1942 (AWM image 024718).jpg|thumb|A mortar crew from the 24th Brigade during the fighting around El Alamein, 30 July 1942|alt=Soldiers loading a mortar tube in a desert position]]\n\nIn late October,  the Allies went on the offensive, launching the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]].

Throughout early October, the 2/43rd came under consistent attack, and it became clear to the Australians that the Japanese were preparing to launch a counter-attack. As a result the 24th Brigade's other two battalions, as well as the 9th Division's headquarters were landed by 11 October. The counter-attack came on 16 October, around Jivevaneng and around the coast, and the 24th Brigade was heavily involved in the fighting, eventually repelling the Japanese attack.

This resistance was overcome by 21 June with tank support.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=474\u2013475}}\n\nElsewhere, the 2/32nd Battalion subsequently landed on Labuan on 12 June, but was transferred to the mainland several days later, where it captured the town of [[Weston, Sabah|Weston]] before moving on towards [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=472 & 475}} It was assessed that Beaufort was occupied by up to 1,000 Japanese defenders, and as a result, following the fighting on Labuan, the remainder of the 24th Brigade was landed on the mainland. The 2/43rd landed around Mempakul to secure the Klias Peninsula with the [[2/11th Commando Squadron (Australia)|2/11th Commando Squadron]], before moving by barge along the Klias River. They then marched overland to the Padas River, linking up with the 2/32nd at Kandu to join the [[Battle of Beaufort (1945)|attack on Beaufort]] on 27/28 June,{{sfn|Long|1963|p=479}} during which over 100 Japanese were killed.{{sfn|Coulthard-Clark|1998|p=253}} Meanwhile, the 2/28th went ashore around Weston and carried the advance towards [[Papar]],{{sfn|Long|1963|loc=Map p. 476}} which was reached in July. The war came to an end in mid-August, by which time the brigade was tasked with securing Japanese prisoners in northern Borneo and helping to re-establish British civil administration through the [[British Military Administration (Borneo)|British Borneo Civil Affairs Unit]].{{sfn|McKenzie-Smith|2018|p=2014}}{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=495\u2013496}}\n\n===Disbandment===\nFollowing the conclusion of hostilities, the brigade was used to oversee the surrender of Japanese troops in the local area, and maintaining law and order until civilian authorities could be re-established. During this time, the brigade's battalions were spread out between [[Papar, Malaysia|Papar]], [[Jesselton]], [[Membakut]], and [[Beaufort, Malaysia|Beaufort]].  In October 1945, the brigade commander, Porter, marched out of the unit, and the 2/32nd Battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Scott, assumed administrative command, holding the position until early December 1945 when he was discharged but not replaced. The  [[Demobilisation of the Australian military after World War II|demobilisation]] process began in October and continued for several months. The first unit to be declared redundant was the 2/28th Battalion which was moved back to Labuan in late October, in preparation for their return to Australia.<ref name=AWM822440/> Based on a priority system, each battalion began returning troops to Australia in drafts, as shipping became available.{{sfn|Combe|Ligertwood|Gilchrist|1992|pp=239\u2013242}}{{sfn|James|2009|pp=15\u201316}} Other troops were transferred to the [[66th Battalion (Australia)|66th Infantry Battalion]] for further service as occupation troops.<ref name=AWM822440/> Meanwhile, a vocational education and training program was implemented to prepare the soldiers for their return to civilian life and to keep them occupied while they waited for demobilisation.{{sfn|Long|1963|pp=500\u2013501}} In mid-December, the brigade's headquarters moved from Papar to Labuan and a large draft of personnel were returned to Australia. The final draft from the 24th Brigade embarked on the transport ''Lake Charles Victory'' on 10/11 January 1946.

This system is the most commonly used time notation in the world today,<ref name=\"cldr\">See the [[Common Locale Data Repository]] for detailed data about the preferred date and time notations used across the world, as well the [[Locale (computer software)|locale]] settings of major computer [[operating system]]s, and the article [[Date and time representation by country]].</ref> and is used by international standard [[ISO 8601]].<ref name=\"iso8601\">International Standard [[ISO 8601]]: Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times. [[International Organization for Standardization]], 3rd ed., 2004.</ref>\n\nA number of countries, particularly English-speaking, use the [[12-hour clock]], or a mixture of the 24- and 12-hour time systems. In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\".

In countries where the 12-hour clock is dominant, some professions prefer to use the 24-hour clock. For example, in the practice of [[medicine]], the 24-hour clock is generally used in documentation of care as it prevents any ambiguity as to when events occurred in a patient's [[medical history]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Dosage calculations |last=Pickar |first=Gloria D. |last2=Graham |first2=Hope |last3=Swart |first3=Beth |last4=Swedish |first4=Margaret |date=2011 |publisher=Nelson Education |isbn=9780176502591 |edition=2nd Canadian |location=Toronto |page=60}}</ref> In the [[United States]] and some other countries, it is popularly referred to as '''military time'''.<ref name=cldr /><ref>U.S. Government Printing Office, Style Manual.{{Cite web|url=http://www.gpoaccess.gov/stylemanual/2000/chapter_txt-12.html |title=12.

In the case of a [[leap second]], the value of ss may extend to 60. A leading zero is added for numbers under 10, but it is optional for the hours. The leading zero is very commonly used in computer applications, and always used when a specification requires it (for example, [[ISO 8601]]).\n\nWhere subsecond resolution is required, the seconds can be a [[Decimal#Decimal fractions|decimal fraction]]; that is, the fractional part follows a decimal dot or comma, as in 01:23:45.678. The most commonly used separator symbol between hours, minutes and seconds is the [[colon (punctuation)|colon]], which is also the symbol used in ISO 8601. In the past, some European countries used the [[Full stop|dot on the line]] as a separator, but most national standards on time notation have since then been changed to the international standard colon. In some contexts (including the U.S. military and some computer protocols), no separator is used and times are written as, for example, \"2359\".\n\n=== Midnight 00:00 and 24:00 ===\nIn the 24-hour time notation, the day begins at midnight, 00:00, and the last minute of the day begins at 23:59. Where convenient, the notation 24:00 may also be used to refer to midnight at the end of a given date<ref>[[ISO 8601]]:2004 ''Data elements and interchange formats \u2013 Information interchange \u2013 Representation of dates and times'', clause 4.2.3 Midnight</ref>&nbsp;\u2014 that is, 24:00 of one day is the same time as 00:00 of the following day.\n\nThe notation 24:00 mainly serves to refer to the exact end of a day in a time interval. A typical usage is giving opening hours ending at midnight (e.g. \"00:00\u201324:00\", \"07:00\u201324:00\"). Similarly, some bus and train timetables show 00:00 as departure time and 24:00 as arrival time. Legal contracts often run from the start date at 00:00 until the end date at 24:00.\n\nWhile the 24-hour notation unambiguously distinguishes between midnight at the start (00:00) and end (24:00) of any given date, there is no commonly accepted distinction among users of the 12-hour notation. [[Style guide]]s and military communication regulations in some English-speaking countries discourage the use of 24:00 even in the 24-hour notation, and recommend reporting times near midnight as 23:59 or 00:01 instead.<ref name=acp121>\"[http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf Communication instructions \u2013 General] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807210103/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf |date=2011-08-07}}\", Allied Communications Publication ACP 121(I), page 3\u20136, Combined Communications-Electronics Board, October 2010<!-- IF THIS LINK GOES DEAD, see http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ for the latest version of ACP 121 --></ref> Sometimes the use of 00:00 is also avoided.<ref name=acp121 /> In variance with this, the correspondence manual for the [[United States Navy]] and [[United States Marine Corps]] formerly specified 0001 to 2400.<ref name=\"http://www.marforres.marines.mil/Portals/116/Docs/G-1/AAU/AAUDocuments/CORRESPONDENCE%20MANUAL.pdf\">SECNAV M-5216.5 Department of the Navy Correspondence Manual dated March 2010, Chapter 2, Section 5 Paragraph 15.

However, they have been used occasionally in some special contexts in the United Kingdom, France, Spain, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong and China where business hours extend beyond midnight, such as broadcast television production and scheduling.\n\n=== Computer support ===\nIn most countries, computers by default show the time in 24-hour notation. For example, [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]] activate the 12-hour notation by default only if a computer is in a handful of [[12-hour clock#Computer support|specific language and region settings]]. The 24-hour system is commonly used in text-based interfaces. [[POSIX]] programs such as [[ls]] default to displaying timestamps in 24-hour format.\n\n=== Military time ===\nIn [[American English]], the term ''military time'' is a synonym for the 24-hour clock.<ref>{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|military time}}</ref> In these dialects, the time of day is customarily given almost exclusively using the 12-hour clock notation, which counts the hours of the day as 12, 1, ..., 11 with suffixes ''a.m.'' and ''p.m.'' distinguishing the two [[Day|diurnal]] repetitions of this sequence. The 24-hour clock is commonly used there only in some specialist areas (military, aviation, navigation, tourism, meteorology, astronomy, computing, logistics, emergency services, hospitals), where the [[12-hour clock#Confusion at noon and midnight|ambiguities of the 12-hour notation]] are deemed too inconvenient, cumbersome, or dangerous.\n\nMilitary usage, as agreed between the United States and allied English-speaking military forces,<ref>{{Cite web\n| title=Communication Instructions General ACP 121(I)\n| url=http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160508202743/http://jcs.dtic.mil/j6/cceb/acps/acp121/ACP121I.pdf\n| archivedate=2016-05-08\n}}</ref> differs in some respects from other twenty-four-hour time systems:\n*No hours/minutes separator is used when writing the time, and a letter designating the time zone is appended (for example \"0340Z\").\n*[[Leading zero]]s are always written out and are required to be spoken, so 5:43&nbsp;a.m. is spoken \"zero five forty-three\" (casually) or \"zero five four three\" (military radio), as opposed to \"five forty-three\" or \"five four three\".\n*[[List of military time zones|Military time zones]] are lettered and given word designations from the [[NATO phonetic alphabet]]. For example, in [[Eastern Time Zone|US Eastern Standard Time]] (UTC\u22125), which is designated time zone R, 6:00&nbsp;a.m. is written \"0600R\" and spoken \"zero six hundred Romeo\".\n*Local time is designated as zone J or \"[[NATO phonetic alphabet|Juliett]]\". \"1200J\" (\"twelve hundred Juliett\") is noon local time.\n*[[Greenwich Mean Time]] (GMT) or [[Coordinated Universal Time]] (UTC) is designated time zone Z, and thus called \"Zulu time\".

After Scrooge locks the boys in a room for making fun of him, the triplets come across Webby Vanderquack, who befriends them and shows off a collection of relics and artifacts that Scrooge and Donald collected during their previous adventures, only to accidentally release various ancient evils housed in them. After the kids help him contain them, Scrooge finds his thirst for adventure rekindled and decides to take them all, along with his driver/pilot Launchpad McQuack, to find the Lost Jewel of [[Atlantis]]. However, the group are unaware that Scrooge's rival, [[Flintheart Glomgold]] ([[Keith Ferguson (voice actor)|Keith Ferguson]]), seeks the jewel as well and has hired Donald as his sailor; leading to a race against time to claim the relic. During their quest, Dewey argues with Scrooge about locking him and his brothers up and not wanting them around, though they later reconcile. In the end, Scrooge gets the Jewel, and Donald and the boys move into McDuck Manor after an accident costs them their houseboat.

However, it fails and Lunaris reveals his plan to make the Earth revolve around the Moon using a planetary engine. Elsewhere, Della flies the kids to safety, disguising it as a recruitment drive, but they're attacked and crash on an island, where they find Donald. Della tries to sway the others from leaving, until Louie helps her see that it's okay to have bad experiences because there will be good ones. Gladstone and Fethry soon find them and take them back to Duckburg on Mitzi. Meanwhile, Scrooge reluctantly teams up with Glomgold and defeats Lunaris with a dumb, but successful plan. Lunaris flees in his ship and attempts to blow up the Earth, leading to a space battle against the Ducks. In the end, Penumbra arrives and damages Lunaris' ship, leaving him stranded in space. Afterwards, the Moonlanders stop the invasion and the family celebrates, unaware of F.O.W.L watching them.\n |LineColor       = F89E32\n}}\n}}\n\n===Season 3 (2020) ===\n{{Episode table|background=#960018|overall=|season=|title=|director=|writer=|aux2=|aux2T=Storyboard by|airdate=|prodcode=|prodcodeR=<ref name=WDTV>{{cite web|url=https://www.wdtvpress.com/disneyxd/shows/ducktales/episodes/|title=Disney XD - DuckTales: Episode Info|website=Walt Disney Television Press|accessdate=April 5, 2020}}</ref>|viewers=|country=U.S.|episodes=\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 48\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n |Title           = Challenge of the Senior Junior Woodchucks!\n |RTitle          = \n |DirectedBy      = Matthew Humphreys\n |WrittenBy       = {{StoryTeleplay|s=Francisco Angones, Madison Bateman, Colleen Evanson, Christian Magalhaes & Bob Snow|t=Angones & Bateman}}\n |Aux2            = Stephanie Gonzaga, Krystal Ureta & Brandon Warren\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|4|4}}\n |ProdCode        =  304\n |Viewers         = 0.19<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-saturday-cable-originals-network-finals-4-4-20.html|title=Top 150 Saturday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 4.4.2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|author=Mitch Metcalf|date=April 7, 2020|access-date=April 7, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = As part of their Junior Woodchuck graduation, Huey and Violet must compete in a challenge to earn the title of Senior Woodchuck. Panicked by the possibility of losing, Huey hallucinates a talking Junior Woodchuck guidebook ([[Stephen Root]]) to aid him and ignores Violet when she is endangered. After Violet saves his life, he admits she's a better Woodchuck and forfeits the competition. Meanwhile, Scrooge finds a map to the treasure of famed adventurer Isabella Finch, but his attempts to find it are thwarted when the rest of the family decide to follow a strange bird instead. While he insists they are missing out, the others remind him that it is more meaningful to have your own adventure than to follow someone else's. The bird ultimately leads them to Finch's treasure: her lost adventure journal which contains a list of legendary treasures she was unable to find.

While focusing on taking the perfect family photo, Huey suspects something is wrong after hearing Donald's normal voice and slowly manages to convince the others. Donald tries his best to hide his secret by maintaining the plot and reluctantly hiring his wacky neighbor, [[Goofy]] ([[Bill Farmer]]), to be the photographer. The family eventually finds Gene and demand he send them back home, but he tells them only Donald can reverse the wish since he made it. Donald refuses and storms off with Goofy. When the others try to escape, the wish fights back to maintain itself.
