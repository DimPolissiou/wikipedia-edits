There are several [[tapeworms]] that are found to infect the [[Artemia]] spp.; however, ''F. liguloides'' is the most prevalent species of infectious tapeworm among the [[Artemia]] spp. ''F. liguloides'' infects brine shrimp (Artemia) as the intermediate host and [[flamingos]] as the definitive host. Effects of the tapeworm in [[flamingos]] is unclear, though researchers hypothesize that a high parasitemia could potentially be deadly to the host. The parasite appears to affect the [[Artemia]] spp. as it alters the behavior and color of its host.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yong|first1=Ed|title=Parasites Make Their Hosts Sociable So They Get Eaten|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/01/29/parasites-make-their-hosts-sociable-so-they-get-eaten/|website=Phenomena|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Life cycle==\n[[Artemia]] spp. can reproduce both sexually and asexually. The life cycle of ''F. liguloides'' begins by [[Artemia]] ingesting the cestode larva, called oncosphere. It then penetrates the intestinal wall into the hemocoel where it becomes a cysticercoid, or larva with a scolex. The larva reaches maturity in the digestive tract of the flamingo (definitive host). Adult parasites produce eggs, which are released in the feces and into the environment.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amarouayache|first1=Mounia|title=The parasitism of ''Flamingolepis liguloides'' (Gervais, 1847) (Cestoda, Hymenolepididae) in ''Artemia salina'' (Crustacea, Branchiopoda) in two saline lakes in Algeria|journal=Acta Parasitologica|date=1 October 2009|volume=54|issue=4|pages=330\u2013334|doi=10.2478/s11686-009-0049-8|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226622013|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nA survey conducted at four sites in southern Spain found the total prevalence of cestode ranging from 45-89% in ''Artemia'' with 45-77% being infected with ''Flamingolepis liguloides.'' High prevalence of ''F. liguloides'' can be observed throughout the year in southern Spain. However, this is not the case for all areas. In French saltpans the prevalence of ''F. liguloides'' in ''Artemia'' spp. populations is much lower in the months of April to October, having a prevalence of around 4.25%. ''Artemia'' in saltpans outside the range of flamingos such as the Bulgarian Black Sea coast has a prevalence of almost zero.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = S\u00e1nchez | first1 = Marta | year = 2013 | title = High prevalence of cestodes in Artemia spp. throughout the annual cycle: relationship with abundance of avian final hosts | url = | journal = Parasitology Research | volume = 112 | issue = 5| pages = 1913\u20131923 }}</ref>\n\nTypically host density is indicative of parasitic presence.

Seasonal patterns of infection of F. liguloides showed to have the highest prevalence in June and the lowest in December. Although the waterbird biomass was correlated to strong seasonal patterns, the actual transmission from birds or the removal of infected shrimp showed no significant effect. There was also no clear relationship between cestode and final host abundances. The gender of A. salina did not significantly hinder infection rates of F. liguloides.

A feature often used to distinguish F. ligulepis is the presence of 8 skrjabinnoid hooks.  Each of these hooks are characteristically 180-190 \u03bcm in length. When visualizing the body plan of the parasite,  the hooks and blades are localized on the posterior end. The rostellar suckers of the F. liguloides are oval shaped, with small hooks surrounding the perimeter.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 10 November 2003 and last appearance on 15 January 2007.\n\nDuring his time on the programme, Charlie gradually became the show's third [[antagonist]] after being transpired to have a narcissistic, manipulative and despicable streak. This became evident during most of the character's story arc, which saw Charlie spark a relationship local landlady [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]) - whom he ends up mistreating, up to the point where he clashes with her interfering mother [[Bev Unwin|Bev]] ([[Susie Blake]]), before she eventually jilts him at their wedding. He then went on to proceed in forming a close friendship with his colleague [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]); instigate a feud with Shelly's ex-husband [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) after assaulting him; embark on an affair with Jason's girlfriend [[Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Smith]]); attempt to drown local teenager [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) in retribution for the latter trying to blackmail him; and repeatedly clashes with Maria's best-friend [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) over his antagonistic nature.\n\nIn his exit storyline, Charlie recoups his once-broken romance with Peter's stepsister [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) - who, unbeknownst to him, is plotting to exact revenge on the character after discovering the extent of his affairs and deceit. This ultimately results in Tracy attacking Charlie with an ornament, which consequently results in Charlie being hospitalized and later dying of his injuries.\n\n==Storylines==\nCharlie Stubbs first arrived in Weatherfield along with one of his fellow builders. Upon arrival, they become outraged when local factory owner [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) refuses to move his car so they could park their vehicle. In retaliation, they used a bulldozer to move Mike\u2019s car and it was narrowly saved from being smashed up. Charlie later began dating [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]), which further escalated into a relationship. However, Charlie was unfaithful. When arsonist [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]) set fire to the Corner Shop on Coronation Street, Charlie and [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) broke in and rescued [[Dev Alahan|Dev]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) and [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]).\n\nCharlie eventually began harassing Shelley at every opportunity. At one point, he tried to make her choose between him and her mother, [[Bev Unwin|Bev]] ([[Susie Blake]]). On one occasion he ripped out Shelley\u2019s earrings in a fit of rage. When he asked his colleague [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) for a sealent gun, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Williams]] ([[Betty Driver]]) overheard their conversation on the phone and thought Charlie wanted a genuine firearm. She phoned the police and he was arrested. When he was released, however, he became less violent. He accidentally opened a door which hit Shelley in the face. This caused him to lock her in her bedroom to stop people seeing her face as he knew people would think he was abusing her. Charlie later began to abuse Shelley mentally rather than physically, which caused her to develop agoraphobia. However, she received treatment and Charlie proposed to her, but she jilted him on their wedding day. Despite begging for forgiveness, Shelley refused reconciliation.\n\nIn 2005, Charlie began a relationship with [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]). He convinced her to move in with him and later in February 2006, manipulated her into having her daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Amber Chadwick) move in with her parents. In turn, Tracy began to manipulate Charlie. She pretended to be pregnant and used the money he gave her for an abortion to buy expensive shoes and used her \"grief\" to have him allow Amy to move back in. When Shelley visited before her mother\u2019s marriage to [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]), she and Charlie had a one-night stand. She told Tracy about their night of passion, who accused her of lying. Shelley later revealed that she was pregnant with Charlie\u2019s baby but didn\u2019t allow Charlie to have anything to do with the baby, and left. He and Tracy briefly split but reconciled. Charlie later began an affair with [[Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Smith]]), who was renting his flat. When [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) discovered the affair he tried to blackmail Charlie, threatening to reveal the affair to Tracy. Charlie retaliated by trying to drown David in the bath. When Tracy eventually found out about the affair, they split once more. Tracy began to plot revenge against Charlie and pretended to make amends with Charlie. She pretended he was abusing her to the point of burning herself with an iron to make it look like Charlie was responsible for her injuries. Charlie eventually realized his partner was seeking revenge and when he was about to tell her their relationship was over, she insisted on performing a lap dance for him.

He made his first appearance during the episode broadcast on 10 November 2003 and last appearance on 15 January 2007.\n\nDuring his time on the programme, Charlie gradually became the show's third [[antagonist]] after being transpired to have a narcissistic, manipulative and despicable streak. This became evident during most of the character's story arc, which saw Charlie spark a relationship local landlady [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]) - whom he ends up mistreating, up to the point where he clashes with her interfering mother [[Bev Unwin|Bev]] ([[Susie Blake]]), before she eventually jilts him at their wedding. He then went on to proceed in forming a close friendship with his colleague [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]); instigate a feud with Shelly's ex-husband [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) after assaulting him; embark on an affair with Jason's girlfriend [[Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Smith]]); attempt to drown local teenager [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) in retribution for the latter trying to blackmail him; and repeatedly clashes with Maria's best-friend [[Claire Peacock]] ([[Julia Haworth]]) over his antagonistic nature.\n\nIn his exit storyline, Charlie recoups his once-broken romance with Peter's stepsister [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]) - who, unbeknownst to him, is plotting to exact revenge on the character after discovering the extent of his affairs and deceit. This ultimately results in Tracy attacking Charlie with an ornament, which consequently results in Charlie being hospitalized and later dying of his injuries.\n\n==Storylines==\nCharlie Stubbs first arrived in Weatherfield along with one of his fellow builders. Upon arrival, they become outraged when local factory owner [[Mike Baldwin (Coronation Street)|Mike Baldwin]] ([[Johnny Briggs (actor)|Johnny Briggs]]) refuses to move his car so they could park their vehicle. In retaliation, they used a bulldozer to move Mike\u2019s car and it was narrowly saved from being smashed up. Charlie later began dating [[Shelley Unwin]] ([[Sally Lindsay]]), which further escalated into a relationship. However, Charlie was unfaithful. When arsonist [[Maya Sharma]] ([[Sasha Behar]]) set fire to the Corner Shop on Coronation Street, Charlie and [[Ciaran McCarthy]] ([[Keith Duffy]]) broke in and rescued [[Dev Alahan|Dev]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) and [[Sunita Alahan]] ([[Shobna Gulati]]).\n\nCharlie eventually began harassing Shelley at every opportunity. At one point, he tried to make her choose between him and her mother, [[Bev Unwin|Bev]] ([[Susie Blake]]). On one occasion he ripped out Shelley\u2019s earrings in a fit of rage. When he asked his colleague [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]) for a sealent gun, [[Betty Williams (Coronation Street)|Betty Williams]] ([[Betty Driver]]) overheard their conversation on the phone and thought Charlie wanted a genuine firearm. She phoned the police and he was arrested. When he was released, however, he became less violent. He accidentally opened a door which hit Shelley in the face. This caused him to lock her in her bedroom to stop people seeing her face as he knew people would think he was abusing her. Charlie later began to abuse Shelley mentally rather than physically, which caused her to develop agoraphobia. However, she received treatment and Charlie proposed to her, but she jilted him on their wedding day. Despite begging for forgiveness, Shelley refused reconciliation.\n\nIn 2005, Charlie began a relationship with [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]). He convinced her to move in with him and later in February 2006, manipulated her into having her daughter [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Amber Chadwick) move in with her parents. In turn, Tracy began to manipulate Charlie. She pretended to be pregnant and used the money he gave her for an abortion to buy expensive shoes and used her \"grief\" to have him allow Amy to move back in. When Shelley visited before her mother\u2019s marriage to [[Fred Elliott]] ([[John Savident]]), she and Charlie had a one-night stand. She told Tracy about their night of passion, who accused her of lying. Shelley later revealed that she was pregnant with Charlie\u2019s baby but didn\u2019t allow Charlie to have anything to do with the baby, and left. He and Tracy briefly split but reconciled. Charlie later began an affair with [[Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Smith]]), who was renting his flat. When [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]) discovered the affair he tried to blackmail Charlie, threatening to reveal the affair to Tracy. Charlie retaliated by trying to drown David in the bath. When Tracy eventually found out about the affair, they split once more. Tracy began to plot revenge against Charlie and pretended to make amends with Charlie. She pretended he was abusing her to the point of burning herself with an iron to make it look like Charlie was responsible for her injuries. Charlie eventually realized his partner was seeking revenge and when he was about to tell her their relationship was over, she insisted on performing a lap dance for him. She hit him round the head with a heavy ornament, and he later died in hospital. She claimed she\u2019d killed him in self-defence but the court found her guilty and she was given a life sentence.\n\nIn December 2010, Tracy returned to the cobbles after being released on legal technicalities.\n\n==Creation and development==\nActor [[Bill Ward (actor)|Bill Ward]] was cast in the role of Charlie.

The embedding is not unique, but for high dimension of the Euclidean space it is unique up to [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], thus the (class of the) bundle is unique, and called the ''stable normal bundle''.\n\nThis construction works for any [[Poincar\u00e9 space]] ''X'': a finite [[CW-complex]] admits a stably unique (up to homotopy) embedding in [[Euclidean space]], via [[general position]], and this embedding yields a spherical fibration over ''X''. For more restricted spaces (notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds), one gets stronger data.\n\n===Details===\n\nTwo embeddings <math>i,i'\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m</math> are ''isotopic'' if they are [[homotopic]]\nthrough embeddings. Given a manifold or other suitable space ''X,'' with two embeddings into Euclidean space <math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m,</math> <math>j\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^n,</math> these will not in general be isotopic, or even maps into the same space (<math>m</math> need not equal <math>n</math>). However, one can embed these into a larger space <math>\\mathbf{R}^N</math> by letting the last <math>N-m</math> coordinates be 0:\n:<math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m \\cong \\R^m \\times \\left\\{(0,\\dots,0)\\right\\} \\subset \\R^m \\times \\R^{N-m} \\cong \\R^N</math>.\nThis process of adjoining trivial copies of Euclidean space is called ''stabilization.''\nOne can thus arrange for any two embeddings into Euclidean space to map into the same Euclidean space (taking <math>N = \\max(m,n)</math>), and, further, if <math>N</math> is sufficiently large, these embeddings are isotopic, which is a theorem.\n\nThus there is a unique stable isotopy class of embedding: it is not a particular embedding (as there are many embeddings), nor an isotopy class (as the target space is not fixed: it is just \"a sufficiently large Euclidean space\"), but rather a stable isotopy class of maps. The normal bundle associated with this (stable class of) embeddings is then the stable normal bundle.\n\nOne can replace this stable isotopy class with an actual isotopy class by fixing the target space, either by using [[Hilbert space]] as the target space, or (for a fixed dimension of manifold <math>n</math>) using a fixed <math>N</math> sufficiently large, as ''N'' depends only on ''n'', not the manifold in question.\n\nMore abstractly, rather than stabilizing the embedding, one can take any embedding, and then take a vector bundle direct sum with a sufficient number of trivial line bundles; this corresponds exactly to the normal bundle of the stabilized embedding.\n\n==Construction via [[classifying space]]s==\nAn ''n''-manifold ''M'' has a tangent bundle, which has a classifying map (up to homotopy)\n:<math>\\tau_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n).</math>\n\nComposing with the inclusion <math>B\\textrm{O}(n) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> yields (the homotopy class of a classifying map of) the stable tangent bundle. The normal bundle of an embedding <math>M \\subset \\R^{n+k}</math> (<math>k</math> large) is an inverse <math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k)</math> for <math>\\tau_M</math>, such that the [[Whitney sum]] <math>\\tau_M\\oplus \\nu_M\n\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n+k)</math> is trivial. The homotopy class of the composite\n<math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> is independent of the choice of inverse, classifying the stable normal bundle <math>\\nu_M</math>.\n\n==Motivation==\nThere is no intrinsic notion of a normal vector to a manifold, unlike tangent or cotangent vectors \u2013 for instance, the normal space depends on which dimension one is embedding into \u2013 so the stable normal bundle instead provides a notion of a stable normal space: a normal space (and normal vectors) up to trivial summands.\n\nWhy stable normal, instead of stable tangent?

There is also an analogue in [[homotopy theory]] for [[Poincar\u00e9 space]]s, the '''Spivak spherical fibration''', named after [[Michael Spivak]].<ref>{{citation\n|last=Spivak\n|first=Michael\n|author-link=Michael Spivak\n|title=Spaces satisfying Poincar\u00e9 duality\n|journal=[[Topology (journal)|Topology]]\n|issue=6\n|year=1967\n|pages=77\u2013101\n|mr=0214071\n}}</ref>\n\n==Construction via embeddings==\nGiven an embedding of a manifold in [[Euclidean space]] (provided by the theorem of [[Hassler Whitney]]), it has a [[normal bundle]]. The embedding is not unique, but for high dimension of the Euclidean space it is unique up to [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], thus the (class of the) bundle is unique, and called the ''stable normal bundle''.\n\nThis construction works for any [[Poincar\u00e9 space]] ''X'': a finite [[CW-complex]] admits a stably unique (up to homotopy) embedding in [[Euclidean space]], via [[general position]], and this embedding yields a spherical fibration over ''X''. For more restricted spaces (notably PL-manifolds and topological manifolds), one gets stronger data.\n\n===Details===\n\nTwo embeddings <math>i,i'\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m</math> are ''isotopic'' if they are [[homotopic]]\nthrough embeddings. Given a manifold or other suitable space ''X,'' with two embeddings into Euclidean space <math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m,</math> <math>j\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^n,</math> these will not in general be isotopic, or even maps into the same space (<math>m</math> need not equal <math>n</math>). However, one can embed these into a larger space <math>\\mathbf{R}^N</math> by letting the last <math>N-m</math> coordinates be 0:\n:<math>i\\colon X \\hookrightarrow \\R^m \\cong \\R^m \\times \\left\\{(0,\\dots,0)\\right\\} \\subset \\R^m \\times \\R^{N-m} \\cong \\R^N</math>.\nThis process of adjoining trivial copies of Euclidean space is called ''stabilization.''\nOne can thus arrange for any two embeddings into Euclidean space to map into the same Euclidean space (taking <math>N = \\max(m,n)</math>), and, further, if <math>N</math> is sufficiently large, these embeddings are isotopic, which is a theorem.\n\nThus there is a unique stable isotopy class of embedding: it is not a particular embedding (as there are many embeddings), nor an isotopy class (as the target space is not fixed: it is just \"a sufficiently large Euclidean space\"), but rather a stable isotopy class of maps. The normal bundle associated with this (stable class of) embeddings is then the stable normal bundle.\n\nOne can replace this stable isotopy class with an actual isotopy class by fixing the target space, either by using [[Hilbert space]] as the target space, or (for a fixed dimension of manifold <math>n</math>) using a fixed <math>N</math> sufficiently large, as ''N'' depends only on ''n'', not the manifold in question.\n\nMore abstractly, rather than stabilizing the embedding, one can take any embedding, and then take a vector bundle direct sum with a sufficient number of trivial line bundles; this corresponds exactly to the normal bundle of the stabilized embedding.\n\n==Construction via [[classifying space]]s==\nAn ''n''-manifold ''M'' has a tangent bundle, which has a classifying map (up to homotopy)\n:<math>\\tau_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n).</math>\n\nComposing with the inclusion <math>B\\textrm{O}(n) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> yields (the homotopy class of a classifying map of) the stable tangent bundle. The normal bundle of an embedding <math>M \\subset \\R^{n+k}</math> (<math>k</math> large) is an inverse <math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k)</math> for <math>\\tau_M</math>, such that the [[Whitney sum]] <math>\\tau_M\\oplus \\nu_M\n\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(n+k)</math> is trivial. The homotopy class of the composite\n<math>\\nu_M\\colon M \\to B\\textrm{O}(k) \\to B\\textrm{O}</math> is independent of the choice of inverse, classifying the stable normal bundle <math>\\nu_M</math>.\n\n==Motivation==\nThere is no intrinsic notion of a normal vector to a manifold, unlike tangent or cotangent vectors \u2013 for instance, the normal space depends on which dimension one is embedding into \u2013 so the stable normal bundle instead provides a notion of a stable normal space: a normal space (and normal vectors) up to trivial summands.\n\nWhy stable normal, instead of stable tangent? Stable normal data is used instead of unstable tangential data because generalizations of manifolds have natural stable normal-type structures, coming from [[tubular neighborhood]]s and generalizations, but not unstable tangential ones, as the local structure is not smooth.\n\nSpherical fibrations over a space ''X'' are classified by the homotopy classes of maps <math>X \\to BG</math> to a\n[[classifying space]] <math>BG</math>, with [[homotopy groups]] the [[stable homotopy groups of spheres]]\n\n:<math>\\pi_*(BG)=\\pi_{*-1}^S</math>.\n\nThe forgetful map <math>B\\textrm{O} \\to BG</math> extends to a [[fibration]] sequence\n\n:<math>B\\textrm{O} \\to BG \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math>.\n\nA [[Poincar\u00e9 space]] ''X'' does not have a tangent bundle, but it does have a well-defined stable spherical [[fibration]], which for a differentiable manifold is the spherical fibration associated to the stable normal bundle; thus a primary obstruction to ''X'' having the homotopy type of a differentiable manifold is that the spherical fibration lifts to a vector bundle, i.e., the Spivak spherical fibration <math>X \\to BG</math> must lift to <math>X \\to B\\textrm{O}</math>, which is equivalent to the map <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math> being [[null homotopic]]\nThus the bundle obstruction to the existence of a (smooth) manifold structure is the class <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math>.\nThe secondary obstruction is the Wall [[surgery obstruction]].\n\n==Applications==\nThe stable normal bundle is fundamental in [[surgery theory]] as a primary obstruction:\n*For a [[Poincar\u00e9 space]] ''X'' to have the homotopy type of a smooth manifold, the map <math>X \\to B(G/\\textrm{O})</math> must be [[null homotopic]]\n*For a homotopy equivalence <math>f\\colon M \\to N</math> between two manifolds to be homotopic to a diffeomorphism, it must pull back the stable normal bundle on ''N'' to the stable normal bundle on ''M''.\n\nMore generally, its generalizations serve as replacements for the (unstable) tangent bundle.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Differential geometry]]\n[[Category:Surgery theory]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Journal cites:, added 1 DOI", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_normal_bundle"}

The town on the [[N69 road (Ireland)|N69]], the road between Limerick and Tralee, is built on the banks of the [[River Deel]] some 3&nbsp;km upstream from the estuary of the [[River Shannon]].\n\nAmong the historic structures in the town are a castle dating from 1199 and a Franciscan friary dating from 1389. The castle was abandoned to the English in 1580 \u2013 its walls blown up by the fleeing defenders \u2013 after the fall of [[Siege of Carrigafoyle Castle|Carrigafoyle Castle]] during the [[Desmond Rebellions]]. Askeaton was a [[Askeaton (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|constituency]] in the [[Irish House of Commons]] represented by two members until the dissolution of the parliament in 1801\n\n== Desmond Castle ==\n\nThe focal point of the town is the Desmond Castle, which stands in the center of the town on a rocky island on the river Deel.  This noble building has protected Askeaton since 1199, when the castle and its rights were given to Hamo de Valoignes, the Justiciary of Ireland between 1197 and 1199. In the Annals of Inisfallen, William de Burgo is recorded as having been granted the castle and estates by the king of Thomand, D\u00f3nal M\u00f3r.\n\nin 1348 [[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]] paid 40 shillings for the barony of Lystifti. The building that stands today dates from that time. The [[Earls of Desmond]] were to become a powerful presence in Munster, of whom it was proudly said that they had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' \u2013 they lived in the Gaelic manner, following the Brehon Laws, dressed in the Irish manner, spoke Irish, played Irish music and games, rode and hunted, and respected poets. The family had generations of enmity with the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthys]] to the south in Cork and Kerry, as well as with their bitter Anglo-Norman rivals, the Butlers, [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earls of Ormond]].\n\nThe earliest written reference to the castle is in ''Leabhar nanCeart'', which in translation in English means ''The Book of Rights'', compiled in the 15th century, in which the fort of ''Gephtine'' is mentioned as being reserved to the King of Cashel.\n\nThe Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds, held possession of the castle for over 200 years; it was the centre of their power, and they ruled Munster from it. The tragic [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond]], had a powerful stronghold at Askeaton in 1559 and so England saw him as a threat. The English tried to impose a policy of surrender on the Irish lords who rebelled and fought a war of defence across Munster. Gerald, known as The Rebel Earl, was popular among his followers, but as the atrocities of the English incursion grew unbearable they gradually abandoned him. Fleeing with a few retainers, on 11 November 1583 he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at B\u00f3thar an Iarlaigh.<ref>[[Arthur Blennerhassett Rowan|Rowan, A.

London: Watson & Hazell. pp. 117\u2013130. Originally published Kerry Magazine. May 1854.</ref>\n\nSir Nicholas Malby unsuccessfully attacked the castle in 1579. Askeaton Castle was then occupied by Lieutenant Patrick Purcell of the confederate Catholics. The English saw Askeaton as a threat while it was under Catholic rule. It was destroyed by the Cromwellian captain [[Daniel Axtell]] in 1652; he hanged Patrick Purcell. (Executions seem to have been a theme in the life of Axtell; captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] at Westminster Hall in 1649, shortly after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660 he himself was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide.)\n\nThe murderous Lord Justice Sir [[William Pelham (lord justice)|William Pelham]] then took possession. It was the end of the FitzGerald reign over Askeaton and Munster.\n\nThe castle was transferred to the ownership of the English crown under Captain Edward Berkley.<ref>(Taken from a lecture by Anita Guinane, (Askeaton Civic Trust)</ref>\n\n=== Banqueting Hall ===\n\nThe ''Halla Mor'' (the Great Hall) is one of the finest examples of its kind in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In the grounds of the castle, it was used as a place of feasting, where the earls courted their allies and welcomed visitors. Hospitality was a huge part of the Irish way of life. How you treated your guests was a direct reflection on your honour. The hall, 72 feet long by 30 feet wide, was built by [[James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond]], around 1440-1459. On the south wall are three blind archades and carved windows of exceptional architectural design.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} They are considered to have been built by the same craftsmen who built the Franciscan friary, as they are of the same design. Underneath the hall are its wine cellars and kitchens, dating from the 13th century.\n\n== Franciscan Friary ==\n[[File:Askeaton Abbey Front Side 2014.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Franciscan friary]]\n\n[[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond]], the legendary poet earl who is said still to sleep in a cave waiting to ride back on his silver-shod steed in Ireland's time of ultimate need, founded [[Askeaton Abbey]] in about 1389. It has cloisters with 12 arches on each side, an east window, mediaeval carvings, and a chapter room that is the final resting place of the martyrs [[Patrick O'Hely|Bishop Patrick O'Healy]] and Fr Conn O'Rourke.\n\nOn 9 October 1579, after failing to take Askeaton Castle, the English commander [[Nicholas Malby|Sir Nicholas Malby]] attacked the town and burned the friary, killing most of the friars, some in a gruesome fashion, and wrecked the ancestral tombs of the Desmonds, in a mean-spirited attack to take revenge on the earl in his impenetrable fortress. Monks returned to the friary only in 1627 but the community did not reach its former numbers until 1642. The community again abandoned the site in 1648 when Cromwell's forces neared Askeaton, and did not return until the 1650s. The friary permanently closed in 1740.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandingstone.ie/2010/05/askeaton-friary-co-limerick.html|title=Askeaton Friary, Co. Limerick.|website=www.thestandingstone.ie}}</ref>\n\n== St Mary's Church ==\n\nThe present [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]] church was built in 1851, after the previous building near the Franciscan friary was totally destroyed by fire in 1847. The fire, which originated in a nearby mill, killed an employee and severely burned several others. Parish priest Fr Edward Cussen put his life at risk to rescue several men from the blaze. This happened during the heights of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Famine]], and there were no funds for a new building. Fr James Enright was sent to America and there raised the funds for a new church.\n\nIt is built of local limestone and has stained glass windows. The window to the right of the transept shows the resurrection of Christ, and that on the left his ascension into heaven. In the centre of the nave are windows showing St Patrick receiving the two daughters of King Laoire, the King of Ireland, into the church, and Jesus with children, and over the main door of the church a window shows the Virgin Mary. Over the door is a statue of the Pieta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickdioceseheritage.org/Askeaton/chAskeaton.htm|title=Askeaton Church|website=www.limerickdioceseheritage.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Church of Ireland also have a church in the town names St Mary's with a clergyman resident in [[Rathkeale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rathkeale & Kilnaughtin  Group of Parishes|url=http://www.rathkeale.limerick.anglican.org/index.php}}</ref>\n\n== The Hellfire Club ==\n\nEast of the castle are the remains of the Hellfire Club, an almost intact redbrick building built in 1740 (the same year the monks abandoned the nearby friary). It is one of two in Ireland (the other is outside Dublin). The Hellfire Clubs, throughout Ireland and Britain, were 18th-century clubs where rich men gathered to drink, gamble, have orgies, curse Catholics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_irish/history_irish_hellfire.htm|title=Turtle Bunbury - Award-winning travel writer, historian and author based in Ireland|website=www.turtlebunbury.com|access-date=2015-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321200732/http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_irish/history_irish_hellfire.htm|archive-date=2017-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> and use prostitutes. Lurid rumours around Hellfire Clubs included visits by the devil and human sacrifice. These clubs popularised the combination of whiskey, butter and cream mulled by a red-hot poker known as \u2018scaltheen\u2019. The club closed down by 1800. The fa\u00e7ade of the building collapsed in the 1990s.\n\n== Community hall ==\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, the community organisation [[Muintir na Tire]] built a community hall for the parish. Built in a time of economic depression, it was constructed with voluntary labour of local people. It became a vital focal point in the social life of the town, used for dances and concerts and bingo. Replacing the library (which was too small) as a dance hall, it became in essence the \u201cBallroom of Romance\u201d It was used as a national school while the new building was being built in 1962/63, and also as a church when masses were held there during the refurbishments of St Mary's, the Catholic church, in 1977.\n\n== Transport ==\nThe railway line that passes through the now closed [[Askeaton railway station]] was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857.<ref name=\"AS\">{{cite web | title=Askeaton station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926042407/http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The line between [[Limerick]] and [[Foynes]] had stations at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton.

This noble building has protected Askeaton since 1199, when the castle and its rights were given to Hamo de Valoignes, the Justiciary of Ireland between 1197 and 1199. In the Annals of Inisfallen, William de Burgo is recorded as having been granted the castle and estates by the king of Thomand, D\u00f3nal M\u00f3r.\n\nin 1348 [[Maurice FitzGerald, 1st Earl of Desmond]] paid 40 shillings for the barony of Lystifti. The building that stands today dates from that time. The [[Earls of Desmond]] were to become a powerful presence in Munster, of whom it was proudly said that they had become 'more Irish than the Irish themselves' \u2013 they lived in the Gaelic manner, following the Brehon Laws, dressed in the Irish manner, spoke Irish, played Irish music and games, rode and hunted, and respected poets. The family had generations of enmity with the [[MacCarthy dynasty|MacCarthys]] to the south in Cork and Kerry, as well as with their bitter Anglo-Norman rivals, the Butlers, [[Earl of Ormond (Ireland)|Earls of Ormond]].\n\nThe earliest written reference to the castle is in ''Leabhar nanCeart'', which in translation in English means ''The Book of Rights'', compiled in the 15th century, in which the fort of ''Gephtine'' is mentioned as being reserved to the King of Cashel.\n\nThe Earls of Desmond, the FitzGeralds, held possession of the castle for over 200 years; it was the centre of their power, and they ruled Munster from it. The tragic [[Gerald FitzGerald, 15th Earl of Desmond]], had a powerful stronghold at Askeaton in 1559 and so England saw him as a threat. The English tried to impose a policy of surrender on the Irish lords who rebelled and fought a war of defence across Munster. Gerald, known as The Rebel Earl, was popular among his followers, but as the atrocities of the English incursion grew unbearable they gradually abandoned him. Fleeing with a few retainers, on 11 November 1583 he was murdered by Moriarty of Castledrum, at Glenagenty, five miles east of Tralee at B\u00f3thar an Iarlaigh.<ref>[[Arthur Blennerhassett Rowan|Rowan, A.

London: Watson & Hazell. pp. 117\u2013130. Originally published Kerry Magazine. May 1854.</ref>\n\nSir Nicholas Malby unsuccessfully attacked the castle in 1579. Askeaton Castle was then occupied by Lieutenant Patrick Purcell of the confederate Catholics. The English saw Askeaton as a threat while it was under Catholic rule. It was destroyed by the Cromwellian captain [[Daniel Axtell]] in 1652; he hanged Patrick Purcell. (Executions seem to have been a theme in the life of Axtell; captain of the Parliamentary Guard at the trial of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] at Westminster Hall in 1649, shortly after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] in 1660 he himself was hanged, drawn and quartered as a regicide.)\n\nThe murderous Lord Justice Sir [[William Pelham (lord justice)|William Pelham]] then took possession. It was the end of the FitzGerald reign over Askeaton and Munster.\n\nThe castle was transferred to the ownership of the English crown under Captain Edward Berkley.<ref>(Taken from a lecture by Anita Guinane, (Askeaton Civic Trust)</ref>\n\n=== Banqueting Hall ===\n\nThe ''Halla Mor'' (the Great Hall) is one of the finest examples of its kind in Ireland.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} In the grounds of the castle, it was used as a place of feasting, where the earls courted their allies and welcomed visitors. Hospitality was a huge part of the Irish way of life. How you treated your guests was a direct reflection on your honour. The hall, 72 feet long by 30 feet wide, was built by [[James FitzGerald, 6th Earl of Desmond]], around 1440-1459. On the south wall are three blind archades and carved windows of exceptional architectural design.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}} They are considered to have been built by the same craftsmen who built the Franciscan friary, as they are of the same design. Underneath the hall are its wine cellars and kitchens, dating from the 13th century.\n\n== Franciscan Friary ==\n[[File:Askeaton Abbey Front Side 2014.jpg|300px|thumb|left|Franciscan friary]]\n\n[[Gerald FitzGerald, 3rd Earl of Desmond]], the legendary poet earl who is said still to sleep in a cave waiting to ride back on his silver-shod steed in Ireland's time of ultimate need, founded [[Askeaton Abbey]] in about 1389. It has cloisters with 12 arches on each side, an east window, mediaeval carvings, and a chapter room that is the final resting place of the martyrs [[Patrick O'Hely|Bishop Patrick O'Healy]] and Fr Conn O'Rourke.\n\nOn 9 October 1579, after failing to take Askeaton Castle, the English commander [[Nicholas Malby|Sir Nicholas Malby]] attacked the town and burned the friary, killing most of the friars, some in a gruesome fashion, and wrecked the ancestral tombs of the Desmonds, in a mean-spirited attack to take revenge on the earl in his impenetrable fortress. Monks returned to the friary only in 1627 but the community did not reach its former numbers until 1642. The community again abandoned the site in 1648 when Cromwell's forces neared Askeaton, and did not return until the 1650s. The friary permanently closed in 1740.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thestandingstone.ie/2010/05/askeaton-friary-co-limerick.html|title=Askeaton Friary, Co. Limerick.|website=www.thestandingstone.ie}}</ref>\n\n== St Mary's Church ==\n\nThe present [[Roman Catholicism in Ireland|Catholic]] church was built in 1851, after the previous building near the Franciscan friary was totally destroyed by fire in 1847. The fire, which originated in a nearby mill, killed an employee and severely burned several others. Parish priest Fr Edward Cussen put his life at risk to rescue several men from the blaze. This happened during the heights of the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Famine]], and there were no funds for a new building. Fr James Enright was sent to America and there raised the funds for a new church.\n\nIt is built of local limestone and has stained glass windows. The window to the right of the transept shows the resurrection of Christ, and that on the left his ascension into heaven. In the centre of the nave are windows showing St Patrick receiving the two daughters of King Laoire, the King of Ireland, into the church, and Jesus with children, and over the main door of the church a window shows the Virgin Mary. Over the door is a statue of the Pieta.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.limerickdioceseheritage.org/Askeaton/chAskeaton.htm|title=Askeaton Church|website=www.limerickdioceseheritage.org}}</ref>\n\nThe Church of Ireland also have a church in the town names St Mary's with a clergyman resident in [[Rathkeale]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rathkeale & Kilnaughtin  Group of Parishes|url=http://www.rathkeale.limerick.anglican.org/index.php}}</ref>\n\n== The Hellfire Club ==\n\nEast of the castle are the remains of the Hellfire Club, an almost intact redbrick building built in 1740 (the same year the monks abandoned the nearby friary). It is one of two in Ireland (the other is outside Dublin). The Hellfire Clubs, throughout Ireland and Britain, were 18th-century clubs where rich men gathered to drink, gamble, have orgies, curse Catholics<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_irish/history_irish_hellfire.htm|title=Turtle Bunbury - Award-winning travel writer, historian and author based in Ireland|website=www.turtlebunbury.com|access-date=2015-03-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321200732/http://www.turtlebunbury.com/history/history_irish/history_irish_hellfire.htm|archive-date=2017-03-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> and use prostitutes. Lurid rumours around Hellfire Clubs included visits by the devil and human sacrifice. These clubs popularised the combination of whiskey, butter and cream mulled by a red-hot poker known as \u2018scaltheen\u2019. The club closed down by 1800. The fa\u00e7ade of the building collapsed in the 1990s.\n\n== Community hall ==\n\nIn the late 1940s and early 1950s, the community organisation [[Muintir na Tire]] built a community hall for the parish. Built in a time of economic depression, it was constructed with voluntary labour of local people. It became a vital focal point in the social life of the town, used for dances and concerts and bingo. Replacing the library (which was too small) as a dance hall, it became in essence the \u201cBallroom of Romance\u201d It was used as a national school while the new building was being built in 1962/63, and also as a church when masses were held there during the refurbishments of St Mary's, the Catholic church, in 1977.\n\n== Transport ==\nThe railway line that passes through the now closed [[Askeaton railway station]] was built by the former Limerick and Foynes Railway Company from 1856 to 1858, with the station opening on 12 May 1857.<ref name=\"AS\">{{cite web | title=Askeaton station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf | accessdate=2007-09-08| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926042407/http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf| archivedate= 26 September 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> The line between [[Limerick]] and [[Foynes]] had stations at Patrickswell, Kilgobbin, Adare, Ballingrane Junction (Rathkeale) and Askeaton.

The line is still officially open to freight traffic, but has not seen a train since the annual weedspray train visited the line in May 2002, but in 2018 its expected to reopen.\n\nIn an interview on [[Limerick's Live 95fm]] on 18 April 2011, Kay McGuinness, chair of Shannon Foynes Port Company, said that they were confident that the rail link could be reopened for \u20ac7 million, considerably less than [[Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann]]'s quoted price of \u20ac30 million. A recent campaign by the residents of Station Road prevented Iarnr\u00f3d \u00c9ireann from removing the railway gates at the station.

However, despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members.

Minnelli told reporters: \"I am stable as a table.\"\n\nGest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song \"[[Over The Rainbow]]\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation. Amongst performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included \"I Believe You\" by [[The Carpenters]]; a rap version of \"Liza with a Z\"; \"Yes\"; and [[Mary J.

Despite having vocal surgery shortly prior, she sang her signature song, \"New York, New York,\" and received an enthusiastic ovation. She also returned to the stage in 2001 when asked by long-time friend [[Michael Jackson]] to perform at Madison Square Garden in New York City where she sang \"Never Never Land\" and the televised \"You Are Not Alone\" at the [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special]] concert produced by future husband [[David Gest]]. Minnelli told reporters: \"I am stable as a table.\"\n\nGest was so impressed with Minnelli's stamina and ability to stun audiences that he produced her in ''[[Liza's Back]]'' in Spring 2002, performing to rave reviews in London and New York City. The tour featured a tribute to her mother: after years of declining fans' pleas for her to sing Garland's signature song \"[[Over The Rainbow]]\", she concluded Act 1 with the final refrain of her mother's anthem to an instant ovation. Amongst performing her classic hits, other numbers unreleased in the album version included \"I Believe You\" by [[The Carpenters]]; a rap version of \"Liza with a Z\"; \"Yes\"; and [[Mary J. Blige]]'s [[Family Affair (Mary J. Blige song)|\"Family Affair\"]].\n\n[[VH1]] signed Minnelli and Gest in 2002 to appear in a reality show titled ''[[Liza and David]]''. The pilot episode was filmed following the couple around as they prepared for a party at their home, with a guest list including [[Ray Charles]], [[Luther Vandross]], [[Isaac Mizrahi]], [[Anastacia]], and others. The show was cancelled shortly after the pilot episode was filmed due to a dispute between VH1, Gest and Minnelli, and never aired. Recordings of the pilot episode still exist.\n\nFrom 2003 through 2005, she appeared as a recurring character on the Emmy Award-winning TV sitcom ''[[Arrested Development]]'' as [[Lucille Austero]] (also known as \"Lucille 2\"), the lover of both the sexually and socially awkward [[Buster Bluth]] and Buster's brother [[Gob Bluth|Gob]]. Minnelli appeared in the role for the show's fourth season in 2013.\n\nIn September 2006, Minnelli made a guest appearance on the long-running drama ''[[Law & Order: Criminal Intent]]'' in \"Masquerade\", a Halloween-themed episode, broadcast on October 31, 2006.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2006-09-29-minelli_x.htm Minnelli to guest star on 'Law & Order'] October 1, 2006</ref>\n\nMinnelli also completed guest vocals on [[My Chemical Romance]]'s 2006 concept album ''[[The Black Parade]],'' portraying \"Mother War,\" a dark conception of the main character's mother in the song \"[[Mama (My Chemical Romance song)|Mama]]\".<ref>Brittany Spanos, \"Flashback: My Chemical Romance Recruit Liza Minnelli for ''Mama''\",\n''Rolling Stone'' (19 Dec. 2019); online at https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/flashback-my-chemical-romance-recruits-liza-minnelli-for-black-parade-mama-928847/</ref>\n\n[[File:Liza Minnelli.jpg|thumb|Minnelli at ''The Heart Truth Fashion Show'' 2008]]\nMinnelli returned to Broadway in a new solo concert at the [[Palace Theatre, New York|Palace Theatre]] titled ''[[Liza's at The Palace...!]]'', which ran from December 3, 2008, through January 4, 2009.<ref>[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/124222.html Liza's at The Palace ...!

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref><!-- TIM, is this the right source for this? Why ever not? --> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them. They were performed in various combinations of three.{{refn|The plays chosen for each performance were announced in advance, although a myth evolved that the groupings were random.<ref>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''[[The Times]]'', 20 January 1936, p. 10; 11 February 1936, p. 12; 2 March 1936, p. 12; 6 April 1936, p. 10; 2 May 1936, p. 12; 10 June 1936, p. 14.</ref>|group=n}}  ''Shadow Play'' was first presented on 18 October 1935 at the [[Manchester Opera House|Opera House, Manchester]], the final play in a programme that also contained ''[[Hands Across the Sea (play)|Hands Across the Sea]]'' and ''[[Fumed Oak]]''.<ref>Mander and Mitchenson, p. 282</ref>\n\nThe first London performance was on 18 January 1936 at the [[Phoenix Theatre (London)|Phoenix Theatre]].<ref name=times>\"Phoenix Theatre\", ''The Times'', 19 January 1936, p. 15.</ref> The production ran for a limited season, playing to full houses; as was typical for him, Coward closed the cycle after three months.<ref>Morley (1974), p. 192</ref>{{refn|Coward, who disliked long runs, and also needed to set aside time to write and compose,<ref>Morley (1974), pp. 94\u201395</ref> usually insisted on playing a part for no longer than three months.<ref>Hoare, p. 155</ref>|group=n}} The Broadway premiere was at the [[Nederlander Theatre|National Theatre]] on 27 November 1936, with mostly the same cast as in London.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? --> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena<!-- WHO IS LENA, a maid? --> is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.

Short plays were unfashionable in the 1920s and 30s, but Coward was fond of the genre and conceived the idea of a group of brief pieces to be played across several evenings. The actress most closely associated with him was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], and he wrote the ten plays as vehicles for them both.\n\n''Shadow Play'' depicts a husband and wife in a marriage on the brink of collapse. Under the influence of an unwisely large dose of sleeping pills, the wife has a dream that retells their story in hallucinatory form. Musical intervals weave in and out of the dream. The husband is so concerned for his wife's condition that his love is rekindled, and when she comes round they are reconciled.\n\nThe play was first produced in 1935 in [[Manchester]] and then toured for nine weeks before opening in London (1936) and New York (1936\u20131937), where it played (together with other plays in the cycle) to full houses. It has enjoyed several major revivals and has been adapted for television.\n\n==Background and first productions==\nShort plays had been popular in the previous century, often as [[curtain-raiser]]s and afterpieces to longer plays. By the 1920s they had gone out of fashion, but Coward was fond of the genre. He wrote, \"A short play, having a great advantage over a long one in that it can sustain a mood without technical creaking or over padding, deserves a better fate, and if, by careful writing, acting and producing I can do a little towards reinstating it in its rightful pride, I shall have achieved one of my more sentimental ambitions.\"<ref>''Quoted'' in Morley (2005), p. 66</ref> Among Coward's earlier one-act plays are ''[[The Better Half (play)|The Better Half]]'' (1921) and ''[[Post Mortem (Coward play)|Post Mortem]]'' (1930). In 1935 he conceived the idea of a set of nine short plays, to run in varying permutations on three consecutive nights at the theatre. His biographer [[Philip Hoare]] describes it as \"a bold idea, risky and innovative\".<ref>Hoare, p. 268</ref>\n\nThe actress most closely associated with Coward was [[Gertrude Lawrence]], his oldest friend, with whom he had first acted as a child in a revival of ''[[The Assumption of Hannele]]'' in 1913.<ref>Hoare, pp. 27, 30 and 51</ref><!-- TIM, is this the right source for this? Why ever not? --> They starred together in his revue ''[[London Calling!]]'' (1923) and his comedy ''[[Private Lives]]'' (1930\u201331),<ref>Morley, (1999), p. viii; and Mander and Mitchenson, pp. 209 and 217</ref> and he wrote the ''Tonight at 8.30'' plays \"as acting, singing and dancing vehicles for Gertrude Lawrence and myself\".<ref>''Quoted'' in Mander and Mitchenson, p. 283</ref> Coward directed the plays as well as acting in them.

They have been to the theatre together, but Vicky refuses to accompany Martha to a party because Simon Gayforth, her husband, is sure to be there with Sybil Heston, to whom he is somewhat attached.<!-- ATTRACTED? --> Vicky intends to go to bed, and takes three strong sleeping tablets. Her admirer Michael Doyle rings up, and she tells him brusquely to call back tomorrow as she is too tired to talk now.\n\nSimon comes to tell Martha that George, her husband, is waiting impatiently for her. Simon too has decided not to go to the party, and he asks the Cunninghams to make his excuses for him. When they have gone he begins a serious conversation with his wife: he asks her to divorce him. She agrees, noting sadly that they have been married for just five years. The sleeping tablets begin to take effect making her head swim. The action becomes confused and dreamlike, and is evidently seen through Vicky's drugged eyes. Music is heard; it stops and then starts again. Simon dances a few steps. The music becomes more insistent. Simon and Vicky sing a duet, \"Then\", about transitory joy. This is followed by a second song, \"Play, Orchestra, Play\" (\"We Must Have Music\"). The lights fade to nothing. Sybil Heston appears in a pool of light, telling Simon that they must let Vicky know the truth; they are joined by Michael Doyle, who asks them to give her his love. The lights fade on a reprise of \"Play, Orchestra, Play\".\n\nThe scene changes to a moonlit garden. We see the first meeting of Vicky and Simon, at a country ball. Their dialogue is a mixture of what they said at the time and their current comments on it:\n:Vicky: What do you do?\n:Simon: I'm in a bank.\n:Vicky: High up in a bank? Or just sitting in a cage totting up things?\n:Simon: Oh, quite high up, really. It's a very good bank.\n:Vicky: I'm so glad.\n:Simon: How lovely you are.\n:Vicky: No, no, that came later \u2013 you've skipped some.\n:Simon: Sorry.\n:Vicky: You're nice and thin \u2013 your eyes are funny \u2013 you move easily \u2013 I'm afraid you're terribly attractive.\n:Simon: You never said that.\n:Vicky: No, but I thought it.\n:Simon: Stick to the script.\nThey sing a duet, \"You Were There\", finishing in each other's arms in a spotlight. The dreamlike mood continues. Lena<!-- WHO IS LENA, a maid? --> is seen spotlit, carrying sleeping tablets and a glass of water, and singing \"Then\". In another pool of light, Martha and George are seen in a car discussing the Gayforths' matrimonial troubles: Vicky runs on and accuses them of \"spoiling it all\". There follow hallucinatory images of the Gayforths' honeymoon journey to Venice and a noisy nightclub where Sybil Heston and Michael Doyle dance together in a brilliant spotlight. Another spotlight picks up Vicky and Simon, and the two couples dance on, constantly switching partners, faster and faster, as voices from the darkness rhythmically chant the names of night-clubs: \"The Florida, The Cocoanut Grove, The Four Hundred, The Blue Train\". The noise crescendos and then stops suddenly, with a blackout.\n\nLena, spotlit, is seen telephoning Martha asking her to come back to the house because Vicky is suffering from an overdose of sleeping tablets and Simon is alarmed about her. In the final scene the lighting returns to normal. Simon, Lena and Martha are at Vicky's bedside, giving her black coffee. Simon tells her, when she asks for explanations, that, under the influence of the drug, \"you just went mad, that's all \u2013 raving \u2026 you began dancing about the room\". Deciding that Vicky is now safe, the others leave her alone with Simon. When she asks him about the divorce, he declares that he wants nothing of the sort; everything is all right again between them. He lifts her on to the bed, covers her over with the counterpane, and lies down on the sofa at her feet.\n\n==Revivals and adaptations==\n===Theatre===\n\nIn 1937 a company led by [[Estelle Winwood]] and [[Robert Henderson (actor)| Robert Henderson]] toured the ''Tonight at 8.30'' cycle in the US and Canada.
