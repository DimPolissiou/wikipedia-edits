His closest contest came in his second attempt when he was defeated by then-New York City Comptroller [[Abe Beame]] in a runoff [[primary election|primary]]. In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, dropping out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. Badillo unsuccessfully sought a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] mayoral nomination in 2001, losing in a landslide vote for billionaire businessman and political neophyte [[Michael Bloomberg]] who would later prevail in that general election.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Deputy Mayor of New York City==\n\nBadillo resigned from Congress on December 31, 1977, to become [[deputy mayor]] of New York City under Mayor [[Ed Koch]], a position he held until September 1979. Badillo was one of seven deputy mayors appointed by Koch for the first portion of his administration. As a deputy mayor Badillo handled labor relations and community outreach for Koch. In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over the lack of support for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Post-City Hall career and State Comptroller campaign==\nAfter leaving City Hall, Badillo worked as an attorney in New York City. He supported [[Mario Cuomo]] for governor over Koch during the 1982 Democratic primary. In late 1983 Cuomo appointed Badillo Chairman of the [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]]. In 1985 Badillo considered a bid for mayor against Koch in the Democratic primary. In 1986 Badillo was the Democratic nominee for [[New York State Comptroller]], losing to Republican incumbent [[Edward Regan]]. During these years Badillo was also active in Presidential politics, supporting [[Alan Cranston]] for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and [[Michael Dukakis]] in 1988.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==City Comptroller campaign==\n\nIn 1993, Badillo \u2013 though still a Democrat \u2013 campaigned for Comptroller of New York City on a [[Electoral fusion|\"fusion\"]] basis with Republican [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s mayoral campaign. He also sought the Democratic nomination, but finished third, behind [[Alan Hevesi]] and the incumbent Comptroller, [[Elizabeth Holtzman]].

As CUNY Chairman Badillo organized a successful effort to end open enrollment and revamp the curriculum. These actions gained him some support among conservatives but alienated him from the mainstream of the Puerto Rican political leadership, which had been his traditional base.\n\nIn 1999, Badillo's remarks about Latino immigrants ignited calls for his dismissal. His reference to recent Dominican Republic and Mexico immigrants as \"pure Indians -- Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five feet tall with straight hair,\" and never having a \"tradition of education\" were widely criticized, and he apologized two days later.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/02/nyregion/officials-back-badillo-amid-furor-on-hispanic-remarks.html | work=The New York Times | first=Karen W. | last=Arenson | title=Officials Back Badillo Amid Furor on Hispanic Remarks | date=October 2, 1999}}</ref>\n\n==Republican Party switch and 2001 mayoral campaign==\nIn the late 1990s Badillo formally joined the Republican Party. He resigned as education special counsel and CUNY Chairman when announcing his candidacy for mayor in 2001.

His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% of the population of the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\nThere is a school in [[Buffalo, New York]] called [[Herman Badillo Bilingual Academy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Puerto Rico}}\n*[[List of Puerto Ricans]]\n*[[List of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007031359/http://triallaw1.com/attorneys/members_ofcounsel_profile.jsp;jsessionid=DA262790816C48134259A3911E9054B8?type=1&attorneyid=75 \"Of Counsel Profile\"] \u2013 biography on law firm website\n*[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/congress/badillo.html Hispanic Americans in Congress--Badillo]\n*[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2001/vol5n33/ProfBadillo-en.html Puerto Rico Herald: Puerto Rico Profile: Herman Badillo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060504085841/http://www.nyccfb.info/debates_vg/voter_guides/primary_2001/cd_statements/m_hbadillo.htm The 2001 Voter Guides] ([[New York City Campaign Finance Board]])\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013173223/http://www.nypress.com/14/36/nyc/nyc.cfm Badillo for Mayor] Endorsement by the New York Press.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185837/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/badillo.htm Manhattan Institute Scholar Herman Badillo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116134721/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/news/regionalnews/badillo_lashes_latinos_regionalnews_carl_campanile.htm Badillo Lashes Latinos]\n*[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00912F835580C768EDDAF0894D0494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fR%2fRepublican%20Party Badillo Is Said to Be Switching to the Republicans]\n*[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GeorgeWill/2001/08/30/the_best_candidate_wont_win_this_time The best candidate won't win this time] by [[George Will]]\n*[http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110009450 Stalled in America] (Why one Hispanic immigrant is being trashed for his blueprint for success)\n{{CongBio|B000025}}\n*{{C-SPAN|Hermanbadillo}}\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-off}}\n{{Succession box |\ntitle= [[Borough President]] of [[the Bronx]] |\nbefore= [[Joseph F.

During his tenure in Congress, he became an important national spokesperson for Federal investment in urban centers.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Mayoral campaigns==\n\nBadillo sought the Democratic nomination for mayor of New York in [[New York City mayoral election, 1969|1969]], [[New York City mayoral election, 1973|1973]], [[New York City mayoral election, 1977|1977]], [[New York City mayoral election, 1981|1981]] and [[New York City mayoral election, 1985|1985]]. His closest contest came in his second attempt when he was defeated by then-New York City Comptroller [[Abe Beame]] in a runoff [[primary election|primary]]. In 1981 and 1985 he did not appear on the ballot, dropping out after early moves to stage a campaign failed to generate broad enough support. Badillo unsuccessfully sought a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] mayoral nomination in 2001, losing in a landslide vote for billionaire businessman and political neophyte [[Michael Bloomberg]] who would later prevail in that general election.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Deputy Mayor of New York City==\n\nBadillo resigned from Congress on December 31, 1977, to become [[deputy mayor]] of New York City under Mayor [[Ed Koch]], a position he held until September 1979. Badillo was one of seven deputy mayors appointed by Koch for the first portion of his administration. As a deputy mayor Badillo handled labor relations and community outreach for Koch. In a major public disagreement with Mayor Koch over the lack of support for his program to revitalize the South Bronx, Badillo resigned his post. Some argue that Badillo made a major career mistake in giving up his Congressional post for this appointed position under Mayor Koch.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Post-City Hall career and State Comptroller campaign==\nAfter leaving City Hall, Badillo worked as an attorney in New York City. He supported [[Mario Cuomo]] for governor over Koch during the 1982 Democratic primary. In late 1983 Cuomo appointed Badillo Chairman of the [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]]. In 1985 Badillo considered a bid for mayor against Koch in the Democratic primary. In 1986 Badillo was the Democratic nominee for [[New York State Comptroller]], losing to Republican incumbent [[Edward Regan]]. During these years Badillo was also active in Presidential politics, supporting [[Alan Cranston]] for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1984 and [[Michael Dukakis]] in 1988.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==City Comptroller campaign==\n\nIn 1993, Badillo \u2013 though still a Democrat \u2013 campaigned for Comptroller of New York City on a [[Electoral fusion|\"fusion\"]] basis with Republican [[Rudy Giuliani]]'s mayoral campaign. He also sought the Democratic nomination, but finished third, behind [[Alan Hevesi]] and the incumbent Comptroller, [[Elizabeth Holtzman]]. Although Giuliani won the general election, Badillo, running on the Republican and Liberal party lines, was defeated by Hevesi.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Giuliani Administration and CUNY Chairmanship==\n\nBadillo held a series of positions with the Giuliani administration, serving as the mayor's Special Counsel on education policy and as chairman of the board of trustees of the [[City University of New York]].<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\nIn his capacity as Giuliani's education advisor, Badillo advocated increased mayoral control of the public schools and a revamped curriculum; he was also Giuliani's liaison to the city's board of education. As CUNY Chairman Badillo organized a successful effort to end open enrollment and revamp the curriculum. These actions gained him some support among conservatives but alienated him from the mainstream of the Puerto Rican political leadership, which had been his traditional base.\n\nIn 1999, Badillo's remarks about Latino immigrants ignited calls for his dismissal. His reference to recent Dominican Republic and Mexico immigrants as \"pure Indians -- Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five feet tall with straight hair,\" and never having a \"tradition of education\" were widely criticized, and he apologized two days later.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/02/nyregion/officials-back-badillo-amid-furor-on-hispanic-remarks.html | work=The New York Times | first=Karen W. | last=Arenson | title=Officials Back Badillo Amid Furor on Hispanic Remarks | date=October 2, 1999}}</ref>\n\n==Republican Party switch and 2001 mayoral campaign==\nIn the late 1990s Badillo formally joined the Republican Party. He resigned as education special counsel and CUNY Chairman when announcing his candidacy for mayor in 2001. Despite his strong support of Mayor Giuliani, Badillo's bid for mayor never received serious support from Giuliani or the Republican Party, and lost badly in the Republican primary to billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who had just switched parties as Badillo had done earlier.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\n==Later career==\nIn 2005, Badillo became \"[[of counsel]]\" to the New York City law firm of [[Sullivan Papain Block McGrath & Cannavo]] P.C.

In the book Badillo criticizes what he perceives as a lax work ethic among Hispanics, who he contends do not value education as much as other immigrants just as historically impoverished but more successful, such as Asian-Americans.\n*:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In contrast to the support he gave to bilingual education during his early career, his book attacks what he describes as obstacles to assimilation, such as bilingual education, and urges Hispanics to eschew government solutions and adopt instead the cultural values that have made previous generations of American immigrants prosperous and successful. His view is that Hispanics will soon make up 25% of the population of the United States and that their failure to excel would be tragic for them and the nation.<ref name=\"AA\"/><ref name=\"AB\"/><ref name=\"AD\"/><ref name=\"AF\"/><ref name=\"AE\"/><ref name=\"AG\"/><ref name=\"AH\"/><ref name=\"AI\"/><ref name=\"AJ\"/>\n\nThere is a school in [[Buffalo, New York]] called [[Herman Badillo Bilingual Academy]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Biography|Puerto Rico}}\n*[[List of Puerto Ricans]]\n*[[List of Hispanic and Latino Americans in the United States Congress]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071007031359/http://triallaw1.com/attorneys/members_ofcounsel_profile.jsp;jsessionid=DA262790816C48134259A3911E9054B8?type=1&attorneyid=75 \"Of Counsel Profile\"] \u2013 biography on law firm website\n*[https://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/congress/badillo.html Hispanic Americans in Congress--Badillo]\n*[http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/2001/vol5n33/ProfBadillo-en.html Puerto Rico Herald: Puerto Rico Profile: Herman Badillo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060504085841/http://www.nyccfb.info/debates_vg/voter_guides/primary_2001/cd_statements/m_hbadillo.htm The 2001 Voter Guides] ([[New York City Campaign Finance Board]])\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013173223/http://www.nypress.com/14/36/nyc/nyc.cfm Badillo for Mayor] Endorsement by the New York Press.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185837/http://www.manhattan-institute.org/html/badillo.htm Manhattan Institute Scholar Herman Badillo]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070116134721/http://www.nypost.com/seven/12192006/news/regionalnews/badillo_lashes_latinos_regionalnews_carl_campanile.htm Badillo Lashes Latinos]\n*[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00912F835580C768EDDAF0894D0494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fOrganizations%2fR%2fRepublican%20Party Badillo Is Said to Be Switching to the Republicans]\n*[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/GeorgeWill/2001/08/30/the_best_candidate_wont_win_this_time The best candidate won't win this time] by [[George Will]]\n*[http://www.opinionjournal.com/taste/?id=110009450 Stalled in America] (Why one Hispanic immigrant is being trashed for his blueprint for success)\n{{CongBio|B000025}}\n*{{C-SPAN|Hermanbadillo}}\n{{S-start}}\n{{S-off}}\n{{Succession box |\ntitle= [[Borough President]] of [[the Bronx]] |\nbefore= [[Joseph F.

French School.png|thumb|270px|Jesus disputes with the [[Pharisees]] and is rejected, from the [[Bowyer Bible]], 19th century.]]\n\nThis article relates to a number of episodes in the [[New Testament]] in which '''Jesus was rejected''' in accordance with the Jewish tradition which was followed during his lifetime.\n\n==New Testament==\n===Hometown rejection===\n{{See also|Mark 6|Pauline Christianity|Paul the Apostle and Judaism}}\nIn the sixth chapter of the [[Gospel of Mark]] there is an account of a visit by Jesus to his hometown together with his followers. On the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], he enters a [[synagogue]] and begins to teach. The account says that many who heard him were 'astounded', and offended, and they asked him \"is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary?\" It adds that he could do no 'deeds of power there' except to heal a few sick people. Amazed at the community's lack of belief in him, Jesus observes that \"Prophets are not without honour, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%206:1-6 Mark 6:1-6])\n\nThe account which is given in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] differs from this account by having those in the synagogue describe Jesus as the \"son of the carpenter\" and stating that he could not do many deeds of power (rather than none).<ref name=\"Harrington2010\">{{cite book|author=Daniel J. Harrington|title=Meeting St. Matthew Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=baGiJHsZ8E0C&pg=PT46|date=1 October 2010|publisher=Loyola Press|isbn=978-0-8294-3104-9|page=46}}</ref>\n([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A54-58&version=NRSV Matthew 13:54-58])\n\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] moves this story to the beginning of Jesus' preaching in Galilee; according to [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] commentator [[Mark Allan Powell]], this was done in order to introduce what follows it.<ref>Mark Allan Powell, ''What are They Saying about Luke?'' (Paulist Press, 1989), page 19.</ref> In this version, Jesus is described as performing a [[Lection|public reading of scripture]]; he claims to be the fulfillment of a [[prophecy]] at {{bibleverse||Isaiah|61:1-2}}. ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A16-30&version=NRSV Luke 4:16-30])\n\nIn Matthew and Mark the crowd is also described as referring to [[Brothers of Jesus|Jesus as being the brother]] of [[James the Just|James]], Simon, Joseph, and [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Judas]] (in Mark they also mention, but do not name, Jesus's sisters) in a manner suggesting that the crowd regards them as just ordinary people, and criticising Jesus' quite different behaviour.\n\nLuke adds that Jesus recounted stories about how, during the time of [[Elijah]], only a [[Sidon]]ian woman was saved, and how, during the time of [[Elisha]], though there were many lepers in Israel, only a [[Ancient Syria|Syrian]] was cleansed. This, according to Luke, caused the people to attack Jesus and chase him to the top of a hill in order to try to throw Jesus off, though Jesus slips away. Some scholars conclude that the [[Historical reliability of the Gospels#Luke|historical accuracy of Luke's version is questionable]], in this particular case citing that there is no cliff face in Nazareth.<ref>''The Complete Gospels'', Robert J. Miller editor, 1992, page 126, translation note to Luke 4:29: \"Nazareth is not built on or near a cliff face. Luke generally seems poorly informed about Palestinian geography. Aspects of his geography may therefore be fictive.\"</ref> There are, however, several sharp precipices in the vicinity.<ref>https://jesustrail.com/hike-the-jesus-trail/points-of-interest/mount-precipice</ref>\n\nThe negative view of Jesus' family may be related to the conflict between [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Jewish Christians]]. [[A. N. Wilson]] suggests that the negative relationship between Jesus and his family was placed in the Gospels (especially in the Gospel of Mark) to dissuade early Christians from following the Jesus cult that was administered by Jesus\u2019 family: \"\u2026it would not be surprising if other parts of the church, particularly the Gentiles, liked telling stories about Jesus as a man who had no sympathy or support from his family.\"<ref>Wilson, A.N., ''Jesus: A life''. 1992. New York: Norton & Co., page 86.</ref> [[Jeffrey B\u00fctz]]<ref>Butz, Jeffrey. The brother of Jesus and the lost teachings of Christianity. 2005. Rochester, Vermont: Inner Traditions.</ref> is more succinct: \"\u2026by the time Mark was writing in the late 60s, the Gentile churches outside of Israel were beginning to resent the authority wielded by Jerusalem where James and the apostles were leaders, thus providing the motive for Mark\u2019s antifamily stance\u2026 (p. 44).\" Other prominent scholars agree (e.g., Crosson, 1973;<ref>Crosson, John Dominic. \u201cMark and the relatives of Jesus\u201d.

This references similar wording in {{bibleref2|Psalm|118:22}}: ''The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone''.\n\n===Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, and Decapolis===\n{{Main|Woes to the unrepentant cities}}\nAccording to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, the Galilean cities of [[Chorazin]], [[Bethsaida]], [[Capernaum]], and the [[Decapolis]] did not [[repent]] in response to Jesus's teaching, so Jesus declared that the wicked cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] would have repented; it will be more bearable for the latter cities on the Judgement Day, and Capernaum, in particular, will sink down to [[Hades]] ({{bibleref2|Matthew|11:23}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|10:13-15}}).\n\n===Not welcomed in a Samaritan village===\nAccording to {{bibleref2|Luke|9:51-56}}, when Jesus entered a [[Samaritan]] village, he was not welcomed, because he was going on to Jerusalem. (There was enmity between the Jews and their [[Second Temple|temple in Jerusalem]] and Samaritans and their temple on [[Mount Gerizim]].) His disciples wanted to call down fire from [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] on the village but Jesus reprimanded them and they continued on to another village.<ref>''The Complete Gospels'', Robert J. Miller, editor, 1992, Polebridge Press, {{ISBN|0-944344-30-5}}, page 140, translation note to Luke 9:53: \"Samaritans would not offer hospitality to those travelling to the temple in Jerusalem, which the Samaritans regarded as an illegitimate rival to their own temple on Mount Gerizim (see John 4:20).\"</ref>\n\n===Many disciples leave===\n{{bibleref2|John|6:60-6:66}} records \"many [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]\" leaving Jesus after he said that those who eat [[Body of Christ|his body]] and drink [[Blood of Christ|his blood]] will remain in him and have [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] ({{bibleref2|John|6:48-59}}). In {{bibleref2|John|6:67-71}} Jesus asks the [[Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] if they also want to leave, but [[St. Peter|Peter]] responds that they have become believers.\n\n==Rejection as the Jewish messiah==\n{{Further|Jewish messianism|Judaism's view of Jesus}}\nJesus is rejected in [[Judaism]] as a failed [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Jewish Messiah claimant]] and a [[False prophet#Judaism|false prophet]] by most Jewish denominations.

On the [[Biblical Sabbath|Sabbath]], he enters a [[synagogue]] and begins to teach. The account says that many who heard him were 'astounded', and offended, and they asked him \"is this not the carpenter, the son of Mary?\" It adds that he could do no 'deeds of power there' except to heal a few sick people. Amazed at the community's lack of belief in him, Jesus observes that \"Prophets are not without honour, except in their hometown, and among their own kin, and in their own house.\" ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark%206:1-6 Mark 6:1-6])\n\nThe account which is given in the [[Gospel of Matthew]] differs from this account by having those in the synagogue describe Jesus as the \"son of the carpenter\" and stating that he could not do many deeds of power (rather than none).<ref name=\"Harrington2010\">{{cite book|author=Daniel J. Harrington|title=Meeting St. Matthew Today|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=baGiJHsZ8E0C&pg=PT46|date=1 October 2010|publisher=Loyola Press|isbn=978-0-8294-3104-9|page=46}}</ref>\n([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+13%3A54-58&version=NRSV Matthew 13:54-58])\n\nThe [[Gospel of Luke]] moves this story to the beginning of Jesus' preaching in Galilee; according to [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] commentator [[Mark Allan Powell]], this was done in order to introduce what follows it.<ref>Mark Allan Powell, ''What are They Saying about Luke?'' (Paulist Press, 1989), page 19.</ref> In this version, Jesus is described as performing a [[Lection|public reading of scripture]]; he claims to be the fulfillment of a [[prophecy]] at {{bibleverse||Isaiah|61:1-2}}. ([https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+4%3A16-30&version=NRSV Luke 4:16-30])\n\nIn Matthew and Mark the crowd is also described as referring to [[Brothers of Jesus|Jesus as being the brother]] of [[James the Just|James]], Simon, Joseph, and [[Jude, brother of Jesus|Judas]] (in Mark they also mention, but do not name, Jesus's sisters) in a manner suggesting that the crowd regards them as just ordinary people, and criticising Jesus' quite different behaviour.\n\nLuke adds that Jesus recounted stories about how, during the time of [[Elijah]], only a [[Sidon]]ian woman was saved, and how, during the time of [[Elisha]], though there were many lepers in Israel, only a [[Ancient Syria|Syrian]] was cleansed. This, according to Luke, caused the people to attack Jesus and chase him to the top of a hill in order to try to throw Jesus off, though Jesus slips away. Some scholars conclude that the [[Historical reliability of the Gospels#Luke|historical accuracy of Luke's version is questionable]], in this particular case citing that there is no cliff face in Nazareth.<ref>''The Complete Gospels'', Robert J. Miller editor, 1992, page 126, translation note to Luke 4:29: \"Nazareth is not built on or near a cliff face. Luke generally seems poorly informed about Palestinian geography. Aspects of his geography may therefore be fictive.\"</ref> There are, however, several sharp precipices in the vicinity.<ref>https://jesustrail.com/hike-the-jesus-trail/points-of-interest/mount-precipice</ref>\n\nThe negative view of Jesus' family may be related to the conflict between [[Paul the Apostle]] and [[Jewish Christians]]. [[A. N. Wilson]] suggests that the negative relationship between Jesus and his family was placed in the Gospels (especially in the Gospel of Mark) to dissuade early Christians from following the Jesus cult that was administered by Jesus\u2019 family: \"\u2026it would not be surprising if other parts of the church, particularly the Gentiles, liked telling stories about Jesus as a man who had no sympathy or support from his family.\"<ref>Wilson, A.N., ''Jesus: A life''. 1992.

This references similar wording in {{bibleref2|Psalm|118:22}}: ''The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone''.\n\n===Chorazin, Bethsaida, Capernaum, and Decapolis===\n{{Main|Woes to the unrepentant cities}}\nAccording to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, the Galilean cities of [[Chorazin]], [[Bethsaida]], [[Capernaum]], and the [[Decapolis]] did not [[repent]] in response to Jesus's teaching, so Jesus declared that the wicked cities of [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]], [[Sodom and Gomorrah]] would have repented; it will be more bearable for the latter cities on the Judgement Day, and Capernaum, in particular, will sink down to [[Hades]] ({{bibleref2|Matthew|11:23}}, {{bibleref2|Luke|10:13-15}}).\n\n===Not welcomed in a Samaritan village===\nAccording to {{bibleref2|Luke|9:51-56}}, when Jesus entered a [[Samaritan]] village, he was not welcomed, because he was going on to Jerusalem. (There was enmity between the Jews and their [[Second Temple|temple in Jerusalem]] and Samaritans and their temple on [[Mount Gerizim]].) His disciples wanted to call down fire from [[Heaven (Christianity)|heaven]] on the village but Jesus reprimanded them and they continued on to another village.<ref>''The Complete Gospels'', Robert J. Miller, editor, 1992, Polebridge Press, {{ISBN|0-944344-30-5}}, page 140, translation note to Luke 9:53: \"Samaritans would not offer hospitality to those travelling to the temple in Jerusalem, which the Samaritans regarded as an illegitimate rival to their own temple on Mount Gerizim (see John 4:20).\"</ref>\n\n===Many disciples leave===\n{{bibleref2|John|6:60-6:66}} records \"many [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]]\" leaving Jesus after he said that those who eat [[Body of Christ|his body]] and drink [[Blood of Christ|his blood]] will remain in him and have [[Eternal life (Christianity)|eternal life]] ({{bibleref2|John|6:48-59}}). In {{bibleref2|John|6:67-71}} Jesus asks the [[Apostles|Twelve Apostles]] if they also want to leave, but [[St. Peter|Peter]] responds that they have become believers.\n\n==Rejection as the Jewish messiah==\n{{Further|Jewish messianism|Judaism's view of Jesus}}\nJesus is rejected in [[Judaism]] as a failed [[Jewish Messiah claimants|Jewish Messiah claimant]] and a [[False prophet#Judaism|false prophet]] by most Jewish denominations.
