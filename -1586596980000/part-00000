He wrote several grammars and worked on comparative [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Rask traveled extensively to study languages, first to [[Iceland]], where he wrote the first grammar of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and later to [[Russia]], [[Persia]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka). Shortly before his death, he was hired as professor of Eastern languages at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Rask is especially known for his contributions to [[comparative linguistics]], including an early formulation of what would later be known as [[Grimm's Law]].<ref name=\"Nielsen\" /><ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\n==Early life==\nRask was born to Niels Hansen Rasch and Birthe Rasmusdatter in the village of Br\u00e6ndekilde near [[Odense]] on the Danish island of [[Funen]]. His father, a smallholder and tailor, was well-read and had a decently-sized book collection. As a child, Rask's scholastic abilities became apparent, and, in 1801, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to the [[Latin school]] in Odense, now known as the Odense Katedralskole. One of his friends from Latin school, Niels Matthias Petersen (1791\u20131862), who went on to be the first professor of [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] at the University of Copenhagen, later remarked that \"His short stature, his lively eyes, the ease with which he moved and jumped over tables and benches, his unusual knowledge, and even his quaint peasant dress, attracted the attention of his fellow students\".<ref name=\"Nielsen\">{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Hans Frede|date=2008|title=Rasmus Kristian Rask (1787-1832): Liv og levned|trans-title=Rasmus Kristian Rask (1787-1832): His life|language=Danish|url=http://www.sdu.dk/~/media/Files/Om_SDU/Institutter/ISK/Forskningspublikationer/Rask/Rask%2028/Hans%20Frede%20Nielsen%20er%20frdigbehandlet2542.pdf|journal=Rask|publisher=Syddansk Universitet|volume=28|pages=25\u201342|format=PDF|access-date=2 July 2016}}</ref> At the Latin school, Rask's interest in [[Old Norse]] and [[Icelandic language]] and [[Icelandic literature|literature]] was awakened. His teacher, Jochum E. Suhr, loaned him a copy of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' in Icelandic, and the rector, Ludvig Heiberg, gave him a new translation of the same work as a prize for his diligence. By comparing the original work and the translation, he was able to make an Icelandic vocabulary, cross-referencing the Icelandic words with cognates in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]]. In addition to Danish and [[Latin]], Rask studied [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[French language|French]] and German at Odense. An interest in [[orthography]] also led Rask to develop his own spelling system for Danish that more closely resembled its pronunciation, and it was at this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from \"Rasch\" to \"Rask\".\n\n==University years==\nIn 1808, Rask traveled to [[Copenhagen]] to continue his studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]], where he stayed in the [[Regensen]] dormitory. Although he was not particularly religious and even had expressed serious doubts, he signed up as a student of [[theology]], although in practice he simply studied the grammar of various languages of his own choosing.<ref name=\"Leksikon\">{{cite web|author=<!--staff-->|title=Rasmus Rask|language=Danish|website=Leksikon|publisher=Gyldendal|access-date=3 July 2016|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Sprog/Sprogforskeres_biografier/Rasmus_Kristian_Rask}}</ref> By 1812, he had systematically studied [[Sami languages|Sami]], Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]], English, Dutch, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and had started studies of German, French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], Greek, Latin, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language|Czech]], although Icelandic continued to be his main interest.\n\nIn 1809, he finished his first book, ''Introduction to the Icelandic or Old Norse Language'', which he published in Danish in 1811. It was a didactic grammar based on printed and manuscript materials accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. According to Hans Frede Nielsen, it exceeded anything previously published on the topic.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\n==Prize essay==\nIn 1811, the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] put out a call for a prize essay on the topic of language history that would \"use historical critique and fitting examples to illuminate the source whence the old Scandinavian tongue can be most probably derived, to explain the character of the language and the relations that it has had through the middle ages to the Nordic as well as Germanic dialects, and to accurately ascertain the basic tenets upon which all derivation and comparison of these tongues should be constructed.\"<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\nIn order to conduct research for the prize essay, Rask traveled to [[Sweden]] in 1812 with his friend Rasmus Nyerup. There, he studied Sami and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in order to determine whether they were related to the Scandinavian languages. When he returned to Denmark, he was recommended to the [[Arnamagn\u00e6an Institute]], which hired him to edit Bj\u00f6rn Halld\u00f3rsson's ''Icelandic Lexicon'' (1814), which had long remained in manuscript. From 1813 to 1815, Rask visited [[Iceland]], where he became fluent in Icelandic and familiarized himself with Icelandic literature and customs.\n\nIn 1814, while still living in Iceland, he finished his prize essay, \"Investigation of the Origin of the Old Norse or Icelandic Language\" (1818), in which he argued that Old Norse was related to the [[Germanic languages]], including Gothic, to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], and even to Classical Latin and Greek, which he grouped together under the label Thracian. He also argued that the Germanic languages were not related to [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], Finnish or the [[Celtic languages]] (on this last instance he was wrong, and he later acknowledged this). The academy accepted the essay but suggested that he could have spent more time comparing Icelandic with [[Persian language|Persian]] and other Asian languages. Because of this, Rask envisioned a trip to India to study Asian languages such as [[Sanskrit]], which was already being taught by philologists such as [[Franz Bopp]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in Germany. In 1814, after returning from Iceland, Rask worked as a sub-librarian at the University of Copenhagen library.<ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\n==Travel to India and Ceylon==\nIn October 1816, Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition funded by the monarchy to investigate Asian languages and collect manuscripts for the University of Copenhagen library. He traveled first to Sweden, where he stayed for two years. During his time in Sweden, he took a short trip to [[Finland]] to study Finnish and published his ''Anglo-Saxon Grammar'' (1817) in Swedish.\n\nThat same year, he published the first complete editions of Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and [[S\u00e6mundr fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'s ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. The editions were bilingual, with the original Icelandic accompanied by his Swedish translations. In 1819, he left [[Stockholm]] for [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], where he wrote the paper \"The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland,\" which published in German in the sixth volume of the ''Vienna Jahrb\u00fccher''. Leaving Russia, he traveled through [[Central Asia]] to [[Persian Empire|Persia]], where he stayed in [[Tabriz]], [[Tehran]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]. In about six weeks, he was said to have mastered enough Persian to be able to converse freely.\n\nIn 1820, he traveled from [[Bushehr]], Persia to [[Mumbai]], India (then called Bombay), and during his residence there, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the [[Zend language|Zend Language]]\" (1821). From Bombay, he traveled through India to [[Sri Lanka]] (then called Ceylon), arriving in 1822. Soon afterwards, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters\".\n\n==Return to Denmark==\n[[File:Kbh_Rasmus_Rask_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Rasmus Rask's grave at [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], Copenhagen. Inscriptions in Arabic<!--The Arabic inscription reads: \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642 \u0623\u0628\u0644\u062c \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0627\u0637\u0644 \u0644\u062c\u0644\u062c-->, Old Norse, Sanskrit and Danish. Translated to English, it reads: \"If you wish to become perfect in knowledge, you must learn all the languages, and yet, do not neglect your native tongue or speech.\"]]\n\nRask returned to Copenhagen in May 1823, bringing a considerable number of manuscripts in Persian, Zend, [[Pali]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] for Copenhagen libraries. In 1825, he was hired as a professor of literary history, and in 1829, he was hired as a librarian at the University of Copenhagen. In 1831, just a year before his death, he was hired as professor of Eastern languages at the University of Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" /><ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\nAfter his return to Denmark, Rask published ''Spanish Grammar'' (1824), ''Frisian Grammar'' (1825), ''Essay on Danish Orthography'' (1826), ''Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' (1827), ''Italian Grammar'' (1827), and ''Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses'' (1828). He also published ''A Grammar of the Danish Language for the use of Englishmen'' (1830) and oversaw [[Benjamin Thorpe]]'s English translation of his ''A Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Tongue'' (1830).\n\n==Death==\nHe died of tuberculosis in Copenhagen in 1832, at Badstuestr\u00e6de 17, where a plaque commemorating him is found. He is buried in [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\n==Accomplishments==\nRask was the first to show the relationship between the ancient Northern and the Western and Eastern [[Germanic languages]], as well as to show their relationship with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]], Greek and Latin languages. He formulated the first working version of what would later be known as \"[[Grimm's Law]]\" for the transmutation of [[consonant]]s in the transition from the old [[Indo-European languages]] to Germanic, although he only compared Germanic and Greek, as [[Sanskrit]] was unknown to him at the time.\n\nBy 1822, he knew twenty-five languages and dialects, and he is believed to have studied twice as many. His numerous philological manuscripts were transferred to the Royal Danish Library at Copenhagen.

He wrote several grammars and worked on comparative [[phonology]] and [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Rask traveled extensively to study languages, first to [[Iceland]], where he wrote the first grammar of [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and later to [[Russia]], [[Persia]], [[India]], and [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]] (now Sri Lanka). Shortly before his death, he was hired as professor of Eastern languages at the [[University of Copenhagen]]. Rask is especially known for his contributions to [[comparative linguistics]], including an early formulation of what would later be known as [[Grimm's Law]].<ref name=\"Nielsen\" /><ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\n==Early life==\nRask was born to Niels Hansen Rasch and Birthe Rasmusdatter in the village of Br\u00e6ndekilde near [[Odense]] on the Danish island of [[Funen]]. His father, a smallholder and tailor, was well-read and had a decently-sized book collection. As a child, Rask's scholastic abilities became apparent, and, in 1801, at the age of thirteen, he was sent to the [[Latin school]] in Odense, now known as the Odense Katedralskole. One of his friends from Latin school, Niels Matthias Petersen (1791\u20131862), who went on to be the first professor of [[North Germanic languages|Nordic languages]] at the University of Copenhagen, later remarked that \"His short stature, his lively eyes, the ease with which he moved and jumped over tables and benches, his unusual knowledge, and even his quaint peasant dress, attracted the attention of his fellow students\".<ref name=\"Nielsen\">{{cite journal|last=Nielsen|first=Hans Frede|date=2008|title=Rasmus Kristian Rask (1787-1832): Liv og levned|trans-title=Rasmus Kristian Rask (1787-1832): His life|language=Danish|url=http://www.sdu.dk/~/media/Files/Om_SDU/Institutter/ISK/Forskningspublikationer/Rask/Rask%2028/Hans%20Frede%20Nielsen%20er%20frdigbehandlet2542.pdf|journal=Rask|publisher=Syddansk Universitet|volume=28|pages=25\u201342|format=PDF|access-date=2 July 2016}}</ref> At the Latin school, Rask's interest in [[Old Norse]] and [[Icelandic language]] and [[Icelandic literature|literature]] was awakened. His teacher, Jochum E. Suhr, loaned him a copy of [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s ''[[Heimskringla]]'' in Icelandic, and the rector, Ludvig Heiberg, gave him a new translation of the same work as a prize for his diligence. By comparing the original work and the translation, he was able to make an Icelandic vocabulary, cross-referencing the Icelandic words with cognates in [[Danish language|Danish]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[English language|English]]. In addition to Danish and [[Latin]], Rask studied [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[French language|French]] and German at Odense. An interest in [[orthography]] also led Rask to develop his own spelling system for Danish that more closely resembled its pronunciation, and it was at this time that he changed the spelling of his last name from \"Rasch\" to \"Rask\".\n\n==University years==\nIn 1808, Rask traveled to [[Copenhagen]] to continue his studies at the [[University of Copenhagen]], where he stayed in the [[Regensen]] dormitory. Although he was not particularly religious and even had expressed serious doubts, he signed up as a student of [[theology]], although in practice he simply studied the grammar of various languages of his own choosing.<ref name=\"Leksikon\">{{cite web|author=<!--staff-->|title=Rasmus Rask|language=Danish|website=Leksikon|publisher=Gyldendal|access-date=3 July 2016|url=http://denstoredanske.dk/Sprog,_religion_og_filosofi/Sprog/Sprogforskeres_biografier/Rasmus_Kristian_Rask}}</ref> By 1812, he had systematically studied [[Sami languages|Sami]], Swedish, [[Faroese language|Faroese]], English, Dutch, [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and had started studies of German, French, [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], Greek, Latin, [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Czech language|Czech]], although Icelandic continued to be his main interest.\n\nIn 1809, he finished his first book, ''Introduction to the Icelandic or Old Norse Language'', which he published in Danish in 1811. It was a didactic grammar based on printed and manuscript materials accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research. According to Hans Frede Nielsen, it exceeded anything previously published on the topic.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\n==Prize essay==\nIn 1811, the [[Royal Danish Academy of Sciences and Letters]] put out a call for a prize essay on the topic of language history that would \"use historical critique and fitting examples to illuminate the source whence the old Scandinavian tongue can be most probably derived, to explain the character of the language and the relations that it has had through the middle ages to the Nordic as well as Germanic dialects, and to accurately ascertain the basic tenets upon which all derivation and comparison of these tongues should be constructed.\"<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\nIn order to conduct research for the prize essay, Rask traveled to [[Sweden]] in 1812 with his friend Rasmus Nyerup. There, he studied Sami and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] in order to determine whether they were related to the Scandinavian languages. When he returned to Denmark, he was recommended to the [[Arnamagn\u00e6an Institute]], which hired him to edit Bj\u00f6rn Halld\u00f3rsson's ''Icelandic Lexicon'' (1814), which had long remained in manuscript. From 1813 to 1815, Rask visited [[Iceland]], where he became fluent in Icelandic and familiarized himself with Icelandic literature and customs.\n\nIn 1814, while still living in Iceland, he finished his prize essay, \"Investigation of the Origin of the Old Norse or Icelandic Language\" (1818), in which he argued that Old Norse was related to the [[Germanic languages]], including Gothic, to the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] and [[Slavic languages]], and even to Classical Latin and Greek, which he grouped together under the label Thracian. He also argued that the Germanic languages were not related to [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]], Finnish or the [[Celtic languages]] (on this last instance he was wrong, and he later acknowledged this). The academy accepted the essay but suggested that he could have spent more time comparing Icelandic with [[Persian language|Persian]] and other Asian languages. Because of this, Rask envisioned a trip to India to study Asian languages such as [[Sanskrit]], which was already being taught by philologists such as [[Franz Bopp]] and [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel|Friedrich Schlegel]] in Germany. In 1814, after returning from Iceland, Rask worked as a sub-librarian at the University of Copenhagen library.<ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\n==Travel to India and Ceylon==\nIn October 1816, Rask left Denmark on a literary expedition funded by the monarchy to investigate Asian languages and collect manuscripts for the University of Copenhagen library. He traveled first to Sweden, where he stayed for two years. During his time in Sweden, he took a short trip to [[Finland]] to study Finnish and published his ''Anglo-Saxon Grammar'' (1817) in Swedish.\n\nThat same year, he published the first complete editions of Snorri Sturluson's ''[[Prose Edda]]'' and [[S\u00e6mundr fr\u00f3\u00f0i]]'s ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. The editions were bilingual, with the original Icelandic accompanied by his Swedish translations. In 1819, he left [[Stockholm]] for [[St. Petersburg]], [[Russia]], where he wrote the paper \"The Languages and Literature of Norway, Iceland, Sweden and Finland,\" which published in German in the sixth volume of the ''Vienna Jahrb\u00fccher''. Leaving Russia, he traveled through [[Central Asia]] to [[Persian Empire|Persia]], where he stayed in [[Tabriz]], [[Tehran]], [[Persepolis]], and [[Shiraz, Iran|Shiraz]]. In about six weeks, he was said to have mastered enough Persian to be able to converse freely.\n\nIn 1820, he traveled from [[Bushehr]], Persia to [[Mumbai]], India (then called Bombay), and during his residence there, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation on the Authenticity of the [[Zend language|Zend Language]]\" (1821). From Bombay, he traveled through India to [[Sri Lanka]] (then called Ceylon), arriving in 1822. Soon afterwards, he wrote (in English) \"A Dissertation respecting the best Method of expressing the Sounds of the Indian Languages in European Characters\".\n\n==Return to Denmark==\n[[File:Kbh_Rasmus_Rask_1.jpg|thumb|200px|Rasmus Rask's grave at [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]], Copenhagen.

Translated to English, it reads: \"If you wish to become perfect in knowledge, you must learn all the languages, and yet, do not neglect your native tongue or speech.\"]]\n\nRask returned to Copenhagen in May 1823, bringing a considerable number of manuscripts in Persian, Zend, [[Pali]] and [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] for Copenhagen libraries. In 1825, he was hired as a professor of literary history, and in 1829, he was hired as a librarian at the University of Copenhagen. In 1831, just a year before his death, he was hired as professor of Eastern languages at the University of Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" /><ref name=\"Leksikon\" />\n\nAfter his return to Denmark, Rask published ''Spanish Grammar'' (1824), ''Frisian Grammar'' (1825), ''Essay on Danish Orthography'' (1826), ''Treatise respecting the Ancient Egyptian Chronology'' (1827), ''Italian Grammar'' (1827), and ''Ancient Jewish Chronology previous to Moses'' (1828). He also published ''A Grammar of the Danish Language for the use of Englishmen'' (1830) and oversaw [[Benjamin Thorpe]]'s English translation of his ''A Grammar of the Anglo-Saxon Tongue'' (1830).\n\n==Death==\nHe died of tuberculosis in Copenhagen in 1832, at Badstuestr\u00e6de 17, where a plaque commemorating him is found. He is buried in [[Assistens Cemetery (Copenhagen)|Assistens Cemetery]] in Copenhagen.<ref name=\"Nielsen\" />\n\n==Accomplishments==\nRask was the first to show the relationship between the ancient Northern and the Western and Eastern [[Germanic languages]], as well as to show their relationship with the [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], [[Slavonic language|Slavonic]], Greek and Latin languages. He formulated the first working version of what would later be known as \"[[Grimm's Law]]\" for the transmutation of [[consonant]]s in the transition from the old [[Indo-European languages]] to Germanic, although he only compared Germanic and Greek, as [[Sanskrit]] was unknown to him at the time.\n\nBy 1822, he knew twenty-five languages and dialects, and he is believed to have studied twice as many. His numerous philological manuscripts were transferred to the Royal Danish Library at Copenhagen. Rask's [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]], Danish and Icelandic grammars were published in English editions by Benjamin Thorpe, [[\u00deorleifur Repp]] and [[George Webbe Dasent]], respectively. Rask influenced many later linguists, and in particular [[Karl Verner]] carried on his inquiries into comparative and historical linguistics.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=287936|pages=91\u201393|last1=Dodge|first1=D.

The town is famous for its annual Viking Games as well as for the [[Jens Ferdinand Willumsen|J.F. Willumsen]] museum. Since 1935, it has been connected to [[Hornsherred]] via the Kronprins Frederik Bridge.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Frederikssund Frederikssund. From Den store Danske]. In Danish. Retrieved 22 January 2010.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Frederikssunds v\u00e5ben.png|thumb|left|Historical coat of arms]]\nThere is evidence of communities dating right back to the stone age with a number of burial sites in the area. It seems probable that there was a small settlement at the present location of Frederikssund in the Middle Ages but the development of the town probably began in the 12th century with the construction of a church at what was then known as Ude Sundby<ref>[http://www.frederikssundkirke.dk/ History of Frederikssund Church from Frederikssund Kirke]. Retrieved 8 January 2007.</ref> or Sundby F\u00e6rge (Sundby Ferry). Located at a narrow point on Roskilde Fjord, Sundby F\u00e6rge became the harbour for the nearby market town of [[Slangerup]].\n\nIn 1809-10, the status of market town was transferred from Slangerup to Frederikssund, named after King [[Frederik III]].<ref>[http://www.byhistorie.dk/raadhuse/?raadhus=12 History of Frederikssund's town hall from Dansk Center for Byhistorie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211139/http://www.byhistorie.dk/raadhuse/?raadhus=12 |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 8 January 2007.</ref> In 1868, a pontoon bridge linking Frederikssund to Hornsherred was opened.<ref>[http://www.egnsmuseet-faergegaarden.dk/ Historical descriptions for the F\u00e6rgeg\u00e5rden local history museum]. Retrieved 11 January 2007.</ref> This was replaced by today's Kronprins Frederik Bridge in 1935.\n\nFrederikssund's rapid expansion from a small town at the end of the 19th century is due in large part to the railway connection with [[Ballerup]] in 1879 which was upgraded to a frequent suburban service to [[Copenhagen]] in 1989.\n\n==Geography==\nFrederikssund is located on the east coast of [[Roskilde Fjord]], about 45&nbsp;km north-west of [[Copenhagen]], 20&nbsp;km south of [[Hiller\u00f8d]] and 30&nbsp;km north of [[Roskilde]]. It is less than an hour from Copenhagen by either road or rail. S-trains (suburban commuter trains) leave about once every 10 minutes. Copenhagen Airport can be reached by road or rail in about an hour.\n\nThe low hills on which Frederikssund lies are formed of [[moraines]] from the last [[Ice Age]]. The shallow [[Roskilde Fjord]] which separates Frederikssund from [[Hornsherred]] originated in the same period.\n\nThe fertile land surrounding Frederikssund is used for mixed farming - with an emphasis on cereals, root crops and pigs.\n\n==Frederikssund today==\nThe recent development of the town center and the old commercial harbour have given Frederikssund a new look which reflects its growing popularity as a residential area with connections to Copenhagen and surroundings. It has all the facilities associated with a modern Danish town: museums, a public library, supermarkets, a hospital and sports and recreation centers. With a location facing west over the Roskilde Fjord, it has many footpaths along the shores and up into the higher ground to the east.\nThe local rail and bus services are well developed.\n\n===Culture===\nCultural attractions include the [[J.F.

Denmark|Region Hovedstaden]] with a population of 16,268 (1 January 2019).<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1st January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> It received the status of [[market town]] in 1810. The town is famous for its annual Viking Games as well as for the [[Jens Ferdinand Willumsen|J.F. Willumsen]] museum. Since 1935, it has been connected to [[Hornsherred]] via the Kronprins Frederik Bridge.<ref>[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_geografi/Sj%C3%A6lland/Frederikssund Frederikssund. From Den store Danske]. In Danish. Retrieved 22 January 2010.</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Frederikssunds v\u00e5ben.png|thumb|left|Historical coat of arms]]\nThere is evidence of communities dating right back to the stone age with a number of burial sites in the area. It seems probable that there was a small settlement at the present location of Frederikssund in the Middle Ages but the development of the town probably began in the 12th century with the construction of a church at what was then known as Ude Sundby<ref>[http://www.frederikssundkirke.dk/ History of Frederikssund Church from Frederikssund Kirke]. Retrieved 8 January 2007.</ref> or Sundby F\u00e6rge (Sundby Ferry). Located at a narrow point on Roskilde Fjord, Sundby F\u00e6rge became the harbour for the nearby market town of [[Slangerup]].\n\nIn 1809-10, the status of market town was transferred from Slangerup to Frederikssund, named after King [[Frederik III]].<ref>[http://www.byhistorie.dk/raadhuse/?raadhus=12 History of Frederikssund's town hall from Dansk Center for Byhistorie] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211139/http://www.byhistorie.dk/raadhuse/?raadhus=12 |date=27 September 2007 }}. Retrieved 8 January 2007.</ref> In 1868, a pontoon bridge linking Frederikssund to Hornsherred was opened.<ref>[http://www.egnsmuseet-faergegaarden.dk/ Historical descriptions for the F\u00e6rgeg\u00e5rden local history museum]. Retrieved 11 January 2007.</ref> This was replaced by today's Kronprins Frederik Bridge in 1935.\n\nFrederikssund's rapid expansion from a small town at the end of the 19th century is due in large part to the railway connection with [[Ballerup]] in 1879 which was upgraded to a frequent suburban service to [[Copenhagen]] in 1989.\n\n==Geography==\nFrederikssund is located on the east coast of [[Roskilde Fjord]], about 45&nbsp;km north-west of [[Copenhagen]], 20&nbsp;km south of [[Hiller\u00f8d]] and 30&nbsp;km north of [[Roskilde]]. It is less than an hour from Copenhagen by either road or rail. S-trains (suburban commuter trains) leave about once every 10 minutes. Copenhagen Airport can be reached by road or rail in about an hour.\n\nThe low hills on which Frederikssund lies are formed of [[moraines]] from the last [[Ice Age]]. The shallow [[Roskilde Fjord]] which separates Frederikssund from [[Hornsherred]] originated in the same period.\n\nThe fertile land surrounding Frederikssund is used for mixed farming - with an emphasis on cereals, root crops and pigs.\n\n==Frederikssund today==\nThe recent development of the town center and the old commercial harbour have given Frederikssund a new look which reflects its growing popularity as a residential area with connections to Copenhagen and surroundings. It has all the facilities associated with a modern Danish town: museums, a public library, supermarkets, a hospital and sports and recreation centers. With a location facing west over the Roskilde Fjord, it has many footpaths along the shores and up into the higher ground to the east.\nThe local rail and bus services are well developed.\n\n===Culture===\nCultural attractions include the [[J.F.

Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuri. International matches have been played since 1844 and [[Test cricket]] began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after [[association football]] (soccer). Governance is by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.\n\n==Early cricket==\n{{main|History of cricket to 1725}}{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}\n\n===Origin===\nCricket was probably created during [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] or [[Normans|Norman]] times by children living in the [[Weald]], an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].<ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite book |last=Wynne-Thomas |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Wynne-Thomas |title=From the Weald to the World |year=1997 |publisher=Stationery Office Books}}</ref> The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\"]] Julian date, the year equating to 1598 in the modern calendar).\n\nThere have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 and concerns the future [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] playing at \"creag and other games\" in both [[Westminster]] and [[Newenden]]. It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an [[Early Modern English|Olde English]] word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of \"[[craic]]\", meaning \"fun and games in general\".<ref name=\"HSA\">{{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.S. |authorlink=H. S. Altham |title=A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914) |year=1962 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin}}</ref>\n\nIt is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from [[bowls]], assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a [[wicket gate]]) as the wicket.<ref name=\"DB\">{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum}}</ref>\n\n===First definite reference===\n[[Image:RGS old building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|John Derrick was a pupil at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]], then the Free School, in Guildford when he and his friends played ''creckett'' circa 1550]]  \n \nA 1597 (Old Style \u2013 1598 New Style) court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] mentions the game of ''creckett''. A 59-year-old coroner, [[John Derrick]], testified that he and his school friends had played ''creckett'' on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Free School]]. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey ''circa'' 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham, p. 21.</ref><ref>Underdown, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.<ref name=\"TJM\">McCann, p. xxxi.</ref> In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Derivation of the name of \"cricket\"===\nA number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference,it was spelled ''creckett''. The name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff, or the [[French language|French]] word ''criquet'' meaning a wooden post.<ref name=\"DB\"/> The Middle Dutch word ''krickstoel'' means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen, p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the [[University of Bonn]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |last=Terry |first=David |publisher=SportsLibrary |date=2008 |accessdate=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621011709/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the [[County of Flanders]], especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], many Middle Dutch<ref>Middle Dutch was the language in use in Flanders at the time.</ref> words found their way into southern English dialects.<ref name=RB>[[Rowland Bowen]], ''Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development'', Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970</ref>\n\n===Early 17th century===\nA number of references occur up to the [[English Civil War]] and these indicate that cricket had become an adult game contested by parish teams, but there is no evidence of county strength teams at this time. Equally, there is little evidence of the rampant gambling that characterised the game throughout the 18th century. It is generally believed, therefore, that [[village cricket]] had developed by the middle of the 17th century but that county cricket had not and that investment in the game had not begun.<ref name=LL>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html ''From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300\u20131787'']</ref>\n\n===The Commonwealth===\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down on \"unlawful assemblies\", in particular the more raucous sports such as football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]]. There is no actual evidence that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the [[interregnum]] that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any \"breach of the Sabbath\".<ref name=LL/> It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Gambling and press coverage===\nCricket certainly thrived after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the \"Cavalier\" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to \u00a3100, although that was still a fortune at the time,<ref name=LL/> equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|100|1664|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms {{inflation-fn|UK}}. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] a side.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nWith [[freedom of the press]] having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.<ref name=LL/>\n\n==18th century cricket==\n{{See also|History of cricket to 1725|History of cricket (1726\u201340)}}\n\n===Patronage and players===\nGambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first \"county teams\" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing \"local experts\" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n\nThe most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|the 2nd Duke of Richmond]], [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]], [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]] and [[Edwin Stead]]. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like [[Thomas Waymark]].\n\n===Cricket expands beyond England===\nCricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century,<ref name=RB/> probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the [[West Indies]] by colonists<ref name=RB/> and to India by [[British East India Company]] mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\nCricket never caught on in [[Cricket in Canada|Canada]], despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the [[British Empire]]. [[History of Canadian cricket|Canada]], unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860\u20131960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with [[baseball]]. During the [[First World War]], Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': a Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' (1999) 26#1 pp. 51\u201381</ref><ref>Andrew Horrall, \"'Keep-a-fighting!

Baseball and the Canadian Forces During the First World War,\" ''[[Canadian Military History]]'' (2001) 10#2 pp. 27\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development of the Laws===\n{{See also|Laws of Cricket}}\n\nThe basic rules of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how out, etc. have existed since time immemorial. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] to determine the code of practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance of gambling.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nIn 1744, the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes\". The codes were drawn up by the so-called \"Star and Garter Club\" whose members ultimately founded [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at [[Lord's]] in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.<ref name=MCC>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |title=The official laws of cricket |access-date=30 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203450/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Continued growth in England===\nThe game continued to spread throughout England and, in 1751, [[Yorkshire]] is first mentioned as a venue.<ref name=ASW>[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], \"At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742\u20131751\", ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900</ref> The original form of [[bowling]] (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace.<ref name=LL/> Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772 and since then an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.<ref name=S&B>[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores & Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744\u20131826), Lillywhite, 1862</ref>\n\n[[Image:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artwork depicting the history of the cricket bat]]\n\nThe first famous clubs were [[London Cricket Club|London]] and [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the [[Artillery Ground]], which still exists. Others followed, particularly [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]]. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, [[Bromley Cricket Club|Bromley]], [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]], [[Hadlow Cricket Club|Hadlow]] and [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]].\n\nBut far and away the most famous of the early clubs was [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the first great fast bowler [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]]. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler [[Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens]], who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.\n\nIt was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old \"hockey stick\" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.\n\n===Cricket and crisis===\n[[File:A Game of Cricket (The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|A Game of Cricket at The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park, depiction by unknown artist, c. 1790\u20131799]]\nCricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the \"Hambledon Era\" proper began in the mid-1760s.\n\nCricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |page=4}}</ref> But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.\n\nOn 17 June 1815, on the eve of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] British soldiers played a cricket match in the ''[[Bois de la Cambre]]'' park in Brussels. Ever since the park area where that match took place has been called ''La Pelouse des Anglais'' (the Englishmen's lawn).\n\nMCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] and [[George Osbaldeston]]. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] being banned from playing at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] for life. Gambling scandals in cricket had been going on since the 17th century.\n\nIn the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow [[roundarm bowling]] gathered pace.\n\n==19th century cricket==\n{{main|Overview of English cricket from 1816 to 1863}}\n[[Image:Plainpalais-1817.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Geneva]]'s Plaine de Plainpalais with cricketers, 1817]]\nThe game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to \"player action\" as [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] created the travelling [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.\n\n[[Image:Darnall cricket ground.jpg|thumb|right|A cricket match at Darnall, Sheffield in the 1820s.]]\nThe growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 26 (1999): 51\u201381.</ref>\n\nIn 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of [[overarm bowling|overarm]] and in the same year [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] was first published. [[W. G. Grace]] began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.\n\n===International cricket begins===\nThe [[United States v Canada (1844)|first ever international cricket game]] was between the [[United States national cricket team|US]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the [[St George's Cricket Club]] in New York.<ref name=\"USAvCAN\">{{cite web\n|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/120/120631.html\n|title=United States of America v Canada\n|website=CricketArchive\n|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:England in North America 1859.jpg|thumb|left|The English team 1859 on their way to the US]]\n\nIn 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between May and October 1868, a team of [[Australian Aborigine]]s toured England in what was the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team]] to travel overseas.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/collection_interactives/cricketing_journeys/cricket_html/the_australian_eleven/the_australian_eleven_the_first_australian_team The Australian Eleven: The first Australian team], [[National Museum of Australia]]. Retrieved 30 December 2014.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1878AusTeamNiagraFalls.jpg|thumb|The first Australian touring team (1878) pictured at Niagara Falls]]\n\nIn 1877, an [[English cricket team|England]] touring team in [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at [[The Oval]] in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to [[The Ashes]].\n\n[[South African cricket team|South Africa]] became the third Test nation in 1889.\n\n===National championships===\nA significant development in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official [[County Championship]] was constituted in England. This organisational initiative has been repeated in other countries. Australia established the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1892\u201393. Other national competitions to be established were the [[Currie Cup (cricket)|Currie Cup]] in South Africa, the [[Plunket Shield]] in New Zealand and the [[Ranji Trophy]] in India.\n\nThe period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to \"the spirit of the game\", but more realistically because it was a peacetime period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called The [[Golden Age of cricket]] and it featured numerous great names such as Grace, [[Wilfred Rhodes]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[Victor Trumper]].\n\n===Balls per over===\nCricket started with four balls per over. In 1889 the four balls per over was replaced by a five balls per over and then this was changed to the current six balls per over in 1900. Subsequently, some countries experimented with eight balls per over. In 1922, the number of balls per over was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 the eight balls per over was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. In England, the eight balls per over was adopted experimentally for the 1939 season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English cricket reverted to the six ball over. The 1947 ''Laws of Cricket'' allowed six or eight balls depending on the conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, the six balls per over has been used worldwide and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six ball overs.\n\n==20th century cricket==\n===Growth of Test cricket===\n[[Image:Sid Barnes traps Armanath, MCG, February 1948.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sid Barnes]] traps [[Lala Amarnath]] lbw in the first official Test between Australia and India at the MCG in 1948]]\nWhen the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (as it was originally called) was founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] (1928), [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] (1930) and [[India national cricket team|India]] (1932) became Test nations before [[World War II]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] (1952) soon afterwards. The international game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members being appointed and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, three of those became full members: [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (1982), [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] (1992) and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] (2000). They were followed in the early 21st century by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] (both 2018).\n\nTest cricket remained the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it had its problems, notably in the infamous \"[[Bodyline]] Series\" of 1932\u201333 when [[Douglas Jardine]]'s England used so-called \"leg theory\" to try and neutralise the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's [[Don Bradman]].\n\n===Suspension of South Africa (1970\u201391)===\n{{See also|International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981}}\n\nThe greatest crisis to hit international cricket was brought about by [[apartheid]], the South African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise after 1961 when South Africa left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and so, under the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC). Cricket's opposition to apartheid intensified in 1968 with the cancellation of England's tour to South Africa by the South African authorities, due to the inclusion of \"coloured\" cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] in the England team. In 1970, the ICC members voted to suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition.\n\nStarved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African Cricket Board began funding so-called \"rebel tours\", offering large sums of money for international players to form teams and [[South African rebel tours|tour South Africa]]. The ICC's response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect.\n\nThe rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, now a \"Rainbow Nation\" under [[Nelson Mandela]], was welcomed back into international sport in 1991.\n\n===World Series Cricket===\n{{See also|World Series Cricket}}\n\nThe money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate [[Kerry Packer]] fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the \"rebel\" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.\n\n===Limited-overs cricket===\nIn the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship.\n\nAlthough many \"traditional\" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.\n\nThe first limited-overs international match took place at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. [[One Day International|limited-overs internationals]] (LOIs or ODIs\u2014one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first [[Cricket World Cup]] in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.\n\n===Analytic and graphic technology===\nLimited-overs cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire's decision.\n\nIn 1992, the use of a [[third umpire]] to adjudicate run-out appeals with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South Africa and India. The third umpire's duties have subsequently expanded to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate [[Umpire Decision Review System|review of umpires' decisions]], including LBW, with the aid of virtual-reality tracking technologies (e.g., [[Hawk-Eye]] and [[Hot Spot (cricket)|Hot Spot]]), though such measures still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.<ref>Gibson, Owen [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/08/cricket-embraced-technology-hawkeye-founder Cricket may have embraced technology too quickly, says Hawk-Eye founder] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 August 2013</ref>\n\n==21st century cricket==\nIn June 2001, the ICC introduced a \"Test Championship Table\" and, in October 2002, a \"One-day International Championship Table\". As indicated by ICC rankings,<ref name=iccrank>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/current/page/211271.html ICC rankings for Tests, ODIs and Twenty20] at espncricinfo.com (Accessed 30 August 2013)</ref> the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]].\n\nThe ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the [[United States cricket team|United States]]. In 2004, the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is [[Twenty20]], essentially an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup]] tournament was held in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146856.html|title=Remember these?

There is no official term for cricket of this high standard before 1895 and many loose terms were used for convenience including \"first-class\" itself and other adjectives like \"major\", \"great\" and \"important\", the latter being coined by the ACS for its ''A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863'' (1981).<ref name=\"FMG\">ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref> It is generally agreed by the main historical sources that the earliest known example of what was contemporarily called a \"great match\" was the one played for fifty guineas in June 1697 between two eleven-a-side teams at an unspecified location in Sussex.<ref name=\"TJM\"/> It is entirely feasible, and is indeed believed by some historians, that major matches were played for many years before 1697.<ref name=\"W10\">Webber, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"A23\">Altham, p. 23.</ref> In 1695, the English Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696.<ref name=\"L95\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1695 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> The main reason for matches before 1697 being unknown is that, while the Licensing Act was in force, it effectively imposed censorship upon the press and sport was not deemed to be a suitable subject for newspaper coverage. After the restrictions were removed, sport was gradually introduced into the newspapers but it would be decades before coverage became anything substantial, let alone comprehensive.<ref name=\"L95\"/>\n\nFrom 1895, there is no question about first-class status because of the official definition.<ref name=\"FMG\"/> The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, although there has been hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947.<ref name=WCA48>''Wisden 1948'', p. 813.</ref> Status of [[limited overs cricket|limited overs matches]], which began in 1963, is governed by the official [[List A]] categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major [[Twenty20]] matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage of the total number of matches recorded. Apart from [[Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI cricket team in India and Ceylon in 1930\u201331|one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930\u201331]], all the \"disputed\" matches took place in England before 1895: see [[Variations in published cricket statistics]] for further information.\n\nThe list below is by no means exhaustive, but the works included are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport from the end of the 17th century to the commencement of officially defined first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, all of the sources listed in [[Bibliography of cricket]], though again this is not an exhaustive list, are reliable but autobiographies and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly not if used in isolation, to determine match status.\n\n===Books and other printed works===\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.

Having originated in south-east England, it became the country's national sport in the 18th century and has developed globally in the 19th and 20th centuries. International matches have been played since 1844 and [[Test cricket]] began, retrospectively recognised, in 1877. Cricket is the world's second most popular spectator sport after [[association football]] (soccer). Governance is by the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) which has over one hundred countries and territories in membership although only twelve currently play Test cricket.\n\n==Early cricket==\n{{main|History of cricket to 1725}}{{Cricket sidebar |expanded=all}}\n\n===Origin===\nCricket was probably created during [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] or [[Normans|Norman]] times by children living in the [[Weald]], an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south-east England that lies across [[Kent]] and [[Sussex]].<ref name=\"PWT\">{{cite book |last=Wynne-Thomas |first=Peter |authorlink=Peter Wynne-Thomas |title=From the Weald to the World |year=1997 |publisher=Stationery Office Books}}</ref> The first definite reference is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|\"Old Style\"]] Julian date, the year equating to 1598 in the modern calendar).\n\nThere have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 and concerns the future [[Edward II of England|King Edward II]] playing at \"creag and other games\" in both [[Westminster]] and [[Newenden]]. It has been suggested that \"creag\" was an [[Early Modern English|Olde English]] word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of \"[[craic]]\", meaning \"fun and games in general\".<ref name=\"HSA\">{{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.S. |authorlink=H. S. Altham |title=A History of Cricket, Volume 1 (to 1914) |year=1962 |publisher=George Allen & Unwin}}</ref>\n\nIt is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from [[bowls]], assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep-grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheep's wool (or even a stone or a small lump of wood) as the ball; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate (e.g., a [[wicket gate]]) as the wicket.<ref name=\"DB\">{{cite book |last=Birley |first=Derek |authorlink=Derek Birley |title=A Social History of English Cricket |year=1999 |publisher=Aurum}}</ref>\n\n===First definite reference===\n[[Image:RGS old building.jpg|250px|right|thumb|John Derrick was a pupil at the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Royal Grammar School]], then the Free School, in Guildford when he and his friends played ''creckett'' circa 1550]]  \n \nA 1597 (Old Style \u2013 1598 New Style) court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in [[Guildford]], [[Surrey]] mentions the game of ''creckett''. A 59-year-old coroner, [[John Derrick]], testified that he and his school friends had played ''creckett'' on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the [[Royal Grammar School, Guildford|Free School]]. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey ''circa'' 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.<ref name=\"HSA21\">Altham, p. 21.</ref><ref>Underdown, p. 3.</ref>\n\nThe first reference to cricket being played as an adult sport was in 1611, when two men in Sussex were prosecuted for playing cricket on Sunday instead of going to church.<ref name=\"TJM\">McCann, p. xxxi.</ref> In the same year, a dictionary defined cricket as a boys' game and this suggests that adult participation was a recent development.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Derivation of the name of \"cricket\"===\nA number of words are thought to be possible sources for the term \"cricket\". In the earliest definite reference,it was spelled ''creckett''. The name may have been derived from the [[Middle Dutch]] ''krick''(''-e''), meaning a stick; or the [[Old English language|Old English]] ''cricc'' or ''cryce'' meaning a crutch or staff, or the [[French language|French]] word ''criquet'' meaning a wooden post.<ref name=\"DB\"/> The Middle Dutch word ''krickstoel'' means a long low stool used for kneeling in church; this resembled the long low [[wicket]] with two [[stump (cricket)|stumps]] used in early cricket.<ref>Bowen, p. 33.</ref> According to Heiner Gillmeister, a European language expert of the [[University of Bonn]], \"cricket\" derives from the Middle Dutch phrase for [[hockey]], ''met de (krik ket)sen'' (i.e., \"with the stick chase\").<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite web|url=http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |title=The Seventeenth Century Game of Cricket: A Reconstruction of the Game |last=Terry |first=David |publisher=SportsLibrary |date=2008 |accessdate=25 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621011709/http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/SportsHistorian/2000/sh201e.pdf |archivedate=21 June 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt is more likely that the terminology of cricket was based on words in use in south-east England at the time and, given trade connections with the [[County of Flanders]], especially in the 15th century when it belonged to the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], many Middle Dutch<ref>Middle Dutch was the language in use in Flanders at the time.</ref> words found their way into southern English dialects.<ref name=RB>[[Rowland Bowen]], ''Cricket: A History of its Growth and Development'', Eyre & Spottiswoode, 1970</ref>\n\n===Early 17th century===\nA number of references occur up to the [[English Civil War]] and these indicate that cricket had become an adult game contested by parish teams, but there is no evidence of county strength teams at this time. Equally, there is little evidence of the rampant gambling that characterised the game throughout the 18th century. It is generally believed, therefore, that [[village cricket]] had developed by the middle of the 17th century but that county cricket had not and that investment in the game had not begun.<ref name=LL>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html ''From Lads to Lord's; The History of Cricket: 1300\u20131787'']</ref>\n\n===The Commonwealth===\nAfter the Civil War ended in 1648, the new Puritan government clamped down on \"unlawful assemblies\", in particular the more raucous sports such as football. Their laws also demanded a stricter observance of the Sabbath than there had been previously. As the Sabbath was the only free time available to the lower classes, cricket's popularity may have waned during the [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]]. However, it did flourish in public fee-paying schools such as [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[St Paul's School (London)|St Paul's]]. There is no actual evidence that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s regime banned cricket specifically and there are references to it during the [[interregnum]] that suggest it was acceptable to the authorities provided that it did not cause any \"breach of the Sabbath\".<ref name=LL/> It is believed that the nobility in general adopted cricket at this time through involvement in village games.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\n===Gambling and press coverage===\nCricket certainly thrived after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660 and is believed to have first attracted gamblers making large bets at this time. In 1664, the \"Cavalier\" Parliament passed the Gaming Act 1664 which limited stakes to \u00a3100, although that was still a fortune at the time,<ref name=LL/> equivalent to about \u00a3{{formatprice|{{inflation|UK|100|1664|r=-3}}}} in present-day terms {{inflation-fn|UK}}. Cricket had certainly become a significant gambling sport by the end of the 17th century. There is a newspaper report of a \"great match\" played in Sussex in 1697 which was 11-a-side and played for high stakes of 50 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] a side.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nWith [[freedom of the press]] having been granted in 1696, cricket for the first time could be reported in the newspapers. But it was a long time before the newspaper industry adapted sufficiently to provide frequent, let alone comprehensive, coverage of the game. During the first half of the 18th century, press reports tended to focus on the betting rather than on the play.<ref name=LL/>\n\n==18th century cricket==\n{{See also|History of cricket to 1725|History of cricket (1726\u201340)}}\n\n===Patronage and players===\nGambling introduced the first patrons because some of the gamblers decided to strengthen their bets by forming their own teams and it is believed the first \"county teams\" were formed in the aftermath of the Restoration in 1660, especially as members of the nobility were employing \"local experts\" from village cricket as the earliest professionals.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/> The first known game in which the teams use county names is in 1709 but there can be little doubt that these sort of fixtures were being arranged long before that. The match in 1697 was probably Sussex versus another county.\n\nThe most notable of the early patrons were a group of aristocrats and businessmen who were active from about 1725, which is the time that press coverage became more regular, perhaps as a result of the patrons' influence. These men included [[Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond|the 2nd Duke of Richmond]], [[Sir William Gage, 7th Baronet|Sir William Gage]], [[Alan Brodrick, 2nd Viscount Midleton|Alan Brodrick]] and [[Edwin Stead]]. For the first time, the press mentions individual players like [[Thomas Waymark]].\n\n===Cricket expands beyond England===\nCricket was introduced to North America via the English colonies in the 17th century,<ref name=RB/> probably before it had even reached the north of England. In the 18th century it arrived in other parts of the globe. It was introduced to the [[West Indies]] by colonists<ref name=RB/> and to India by [[British East India Company]] mariners in the first half of the century. It arrived in Australia almost as soon as colonisation began in 1788. New Zealand and South Africa followed in the early years of the 19th century.<ref name=\"HSA21\"/>\n\nCricket never caught on in [[Cricket in Canada|Canada]], despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the [[British Empire]]. [[History of Canadian cricket|Canada]], unlike Australia and the West Indies, witnessed a continual decline in the popularity of the game during 1860\u20131960. Linked to upper class British-Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. In the summer season it had to compete with [[baseball]]. During the [[First World War]], Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': a Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' (1999) 26#1 pp. 51\u201381</ref><ref>Andrew Horrall, \"'Keep-a-fighting! Play the Game!' Baseball and the Canadian Forces During the First World War,\" ''[[Canadian Military History]]'' (2001) 10#2 pp. 27\u201340</ref>\n\n===Development of the Laws===\n{{See also|Laws of Cricket}}\n\nThe basic rules of cricket such as bat and ball, the wicket, pitch dimensions, overs, how out, etc. have existed since time immemorial. In 1728, the Duke of Richmond and Alan Brodick drew up [[Articles of Agreement (cricket)|Articles of Agreement]] to determine the code of practice in a particular game and this became a common feature, especially around payment of stake money and distributing the winnings given the importance of gambling.<ref name=\"TJM\"/>\n\nIn 1744, the ''[[Laws of Cricket]]'' were codified for the first time and then amended in 1774, when innovations such as lbw, middle stump and maximum bat width were added. These laws stated that \"the principals shall choose from amongst the gentlemen present two umpires who shall absolutely decide all disputes\". The codes were drawn up by the so-called \"Star and Garter Club\" whose members ultimately founded [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] at [[Lord's]] in 1787. MCC immediately became the custodian of the Laws and has made periodic revisions and recodifications subsequently.<ref name=MCC>{{Cite web |url=https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |title=The official laws of cricket |access-date=30 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170829203450/https://www.lords.org/mcc/laws-of-cricket/ |archive-date=29 August 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Continued growth in England===\nThe game continued to spread throughout England and, in 1751, [[Yorkshire]] is first mentioned as a venue.<ref name=ASW>[[F S Ashley-Cooper]], \"At the Sign of the Wicket: Cricket 1742\u20131751\", ''Cricket'' Magazine, 1900</ref> The original form of [[bowling]] (i.e., rolling the ball along the ground as in bowls) was superseded sometime after 1760 when bowlers began to pitch the ball and study variations in line, length and pace.<ref name=LL/> Scorecards began to be kept on a regular basis from 1772 and since then an increasingly clear picture has emerged of the sport's development.<ref name=S&B>[[Arthur Haygarth]], ''Scores & Biographies'', Volume 1 (1744\u20131826), Lillywhite, 1862</ref>\n\n[[Image:Historical cricket bat art.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An artwork depicting the history of the cricket bat]]\n\nThe first famous clubs were [[London Cricket Club|London]] and [[Dartford Cricket Club|Dartford]] in the early 18th century. London played its matches on the [[Artillery Ground]], which still exists. Others followed, particularly [[Slindon Cricket Club|Slindon]] in Sussex which was backed by the Duke of Richmond and featured the star player [[Richard Newland (cricketer)|Richard Newland]]. There were other prominent clubs at Maidenhead, Hornchurch, Maidstone, Sevenoaks, [[Bromley Cricket Club|Bromley]], [[Addington Cricket Club|Addington]], [[Hadlow Cricket Club|Hadlow]] and [[Chertsey Cricket Club|Chertsey]].\n\nBut far and away the most famous of the early clubs was [[Hambledon Club|Hambledon]] in Hampshire. It started as a parish organisation that first achieved prominence in 1756. The club itself was founded in the 1760s and was well patronised to the extent that it was the focal point of the game for about thirty years until the formation of [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]] and the opening of [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] in 1787. Hambledon produced several outstanding players including the master batsman [[John Small (cricketer)|John Small]] and the first great fast bowler [[Thomas Brett (cricketer)|Thomas Brett]]. Their most notable opponent was the Chertsey and Surrey bowler [[Edward \"Lumpy\" Stevens]], who is believed to have been the main proponent of the flighted delivery.\n\nIt was in answer to the flighted, or pitched, delivery that the straight bat was introduced. The old \"hockey stick\" style of bat was only really effective against the ball being trundled or skimmed along the ground.\n\n===Cricket and crisis===\n[[File:A Game of Cricket (The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|A Game of Cricket at The Royal Academy Club in Marylebone Fields, now Regent's Park, depiction by unknown artist, c. 1790\u20131799]]\nCricket faced its first real crisis during the 18th century when major matches virtually ceased during the [[Seven Years' War]]. This was largely due to shortage of players and lack of investment. But the game survived and the \"Hambledon Era\" proper began in the mid-1760s.\n\nCricket faced another major crisis at the beginning of the 19th century when a cessation of major matches occurred during the culminating period of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Again, the causes were shortage of players and lack of investment.<ref>{{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |page=4}}</ref> But, as in the 1760s, the game survived and a slow recovery began in 1815.\n\nOn 17 June 1815, on the eve of the [[Battle of Waterloo]] British soldiers played a cricket match in the ''[[Bois de la Cambre]]'' park in Brussels. Ever since the park area where that match took place has been called ''La Pelouse des Anglais'' (the Englishmen's lawn).\n\nMCC was itself the centre of controversy in the Regency period, largely on account of the enmity between [[Lord Frederick Beauclerk]] and [[George Osbaldeston]]. In 1817, their intrigues and jealousies exploded into a match-fixing scandal with the top player [[William Lambert (cricketer, born 1779)|William Lambert]] being banned from playing at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]] for life. Gambling scandals in cricket had been going on since the 17th century.\n\nIn the 1820s, cricket faced a major crisis of its own making as the campaign to allow [[roundarm bowling]] gathered pace.\n\n==19th century cricket==\n{{main|Overview of English cricket from 1816 to 1863}}\n[[Image:Plainpalais-1817.jpg|thumb|right|View of [[Geneva]]'s Plaine de Plainpalais with cricketers, 1817]]\nThe game also underwent a fundamental change of organisation with the formation for the first time of county clubs. All the modern county clubs, starting with [[Sussex County Cricket Club|Sussex]] in 1839, were founded during the 19th century. No sooner had the first county clubs established themselves than they faced what amounted to \"player action\" as [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] created the travelling [[William Clarke's All-England Eleven|All-England Eleven]] in 1846. Though a commercial venture, this team did much to popularise the game in districts which had never previously been visited by high-class cricketers. Other similar teams were created and this vogue lasted for about thirty years. But the counties and MCC prevailed.\n\n[[Image:Darnall cricket ground.jpg|thumb|right|A cricket match at Darnall, Sheffield in the 1820s.]]\nThe growth of cricket in the mid and late 19th century was assisted by the development of the railway network. For the first time, teams from a long distance apart could play one other without a prohibitively time-consuming journey. Spectators could travel longer distances to matches, increasing the size of crowds. Army units around the Empire had time on their hands, and encouraged the locals so they could have some entertaining competition. Most of the Empire embraced cricket, with the exception of Canada.<ref>David Cooper, \"Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': A Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860\u20131960.\" ''Journal of Sport History'' 26 (1999): 51\u201381.</ref>\n\nIn 1864, another bowling revolution resulted in the legalisation of [[overarm bowling|overarm]] and in the same year [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] was first published. [[W. G. Grace]] began his long and influential career at this time, his feats doing much to increase cricket's popularity. He introduced technical innovations which revolutionised the game, particularly in batting.\n\n===International cricket begins===\nThe [[United States v Canada (1844)|first ever international cricket game]] was between the [[United States national cricket team|US]] and [[Canada national cricket team|Canada]] in 1844. The match was played at the grounds of the [[St George's Cricket Club]] in New York.<ref name=\"USAvCAN\">{{cite web\n|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/120/120631.html\n|title=United States of America v Canada\n|website=CricketArchive\n|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:England in North America 1859.jpg|thumb|left|The English team 1859 on their way to the US]]\n\nIn 1859, a team of leading English professionals set off to North America on the first-ever overseas tour and, in 1862, the first English team toured Australia. Between May and October 1868, a team of [[Australian Aborigine]]s toured England in what was the [[Australian Aboriginal cricket team in England in 1868|first Australian cricket team]] to travel overseas.<ref>[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections/collection_interactives/cricketing_journeys/cricket_html/the_australian_eleven/the_australian_eleven_the_first_australian_team The Australian Eleven: The first Australian team], [[National Museum of Australia]]. Retrieved 30 December 2014.</ref>\n\n[[Image:1878AusTeamNiagraFalls.jpg|thumb|The first Australian touring team (1878) pictured at Niagara Falls]]\n\nIn 1877, an [[English cricket team|England]] touring team in [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] played two matches against full Australian XIs that are now regarded as the inaugural [[Test cricket|Test matches]]. The following year, the Australians toured England for the first time and the success of this tour ensured a popular demand for similar ventures in future. No Tests were played in 1878 but more soon followed and, at [[The Oval]] in 1882, the Australian victory in a tense finish gave rise to [[The Ashes]].\n\n[[South African cricket team|South Africa]] became the third Test nation in 1889.\n\n===National championships===\nA significant development in domestic cricket occurred in 1890 when the official [[County Championship]] was constituted in England. This organisational initiative has been repeated in other countries. Australia established the [[Sheffield Shield]] in 1892\u201393. Other national competitions to be established were the [[Currie Cup (cricket)|Currie Cup]] in South Africa, the [[Plunket Shield]] in New Zealand and the [[Ranji Trophy]] in India.\n\nThe period from 1890 to the outbreak of the First World War has become one of nostalgia, ostensibly because the teams played cricket according to \"the spirit of the game\", but more realistically because it was a peacetime period that was shattered by the First World War. The era has been called The [[Golden Age of cricket]] and it featured numerous great names such as Grace, [[Wilfred Rhodes]], [[C. B. Fry]], [[Ranjitsinhji]] and [[Victor Trumper]].\n\n===Balls per over===\nCricket started with four balls per over. In 1889 the four balls per over was replaced by a five balls per over and then this was changed to the current six balls per over in 1900. Subsequently, some countries experimented with eight balls per over. In 1922, the number of balls per over was changed from six to eight in Australia only. In 1924 the eight balls per over was extended to New Zealand and in 1937 to South Africa. In England, the eight balls per over was adopted experimentally for the 1939 season; the intention was to continue the experiment in 1940, but first-class cricket was suspended for the Second World War and when it resumed, English cricket reverted to the six ball over. The 1947 ''Laws of Cricket'' allowed six or eight balls depending on the conditions of play. Since the 1979/80 Australian and New Zealand seasons, the six balls per over has been used worldwide and the most recent version of the Laws in 2000 only permits six ball overs.\n\n==20th century cricket==\n===Growth of Test cricket===\n[[Image:Sid Barnes traps Armanath, MCG, February 1948.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sid Barnes]] traps [[Lala Amarnath]] lbw in the first official Test between Australia and India at the MCG in 1948]]\nWhen the [[International Cricket Council|Imperial Cricket Conference]] (as it was originally called) was founded in 1909, only England, Australia and South Africa were members. [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] (1928), [[New Zealand national cricket team|New Zealand]] (1930) and [[India national cricket team|India]] (1932) became Test nations before [[World War II]] and [[Pakistan national cricket team|Pakistan]] (1952) soon afterwards. The international game grew with several ICC Affiliate Members being appointed and, in the last quarter of the 20th century, three of those became full members: [[Sri Lanka national cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (1982), [[Zimbabwe national cricket team|Zimbabwe]] (1992) and [[Bangladesh national cricket team|Bangladesh]] (2000). They were followed in the early 21st century by [[Ireland cricket team|Ireland]] and [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] (both 2018).\n\nTest cricket remained the sport's highest level of standard throughout the 20th century but it had its problems, notably in the infamous \"[[Bodyline]] Series\" of 1932\u201333 when [[Douglas Jardine]]'s England used so-called \"leg theory\" to try and neutralise the run-scoring brilliance of Australia's [[Don Bradman]].\n\n===Suspension of South Africa (1970\u201391)===\n{{See also|International cricket in South Africa from 1971 to 1981}}\n\nThe greatest crisis to hit international cricket was brought about by [[apartheid]], the South African policy of racial segregation. The situation began to crystallise after 1961 when South Africa left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] and so, under the rules of the day, its cricket board had to leave the [[International Cricket Council|International Cricket Conference]] (ICC). Cricket's opposition to apartheid intensified in 1968 with the cancellation of England's tour to South Africa by the South African authorities, due to the inclusion of \"coloured\" cricketer [[Basil D'Oliveira]] in the England team. In 1970, the ICC members voted to suspend South Africa indefinitely from international cricket competition.\n\nStarved of top-level competition for its best players, the South African Cricket Board began funding so-called \"rebel tours\", offering large sums of money for international players to form teams and [[South African rebel tours|tour South Africa]]. The ICC's response was to blacklist any rebel players who agreed to tour South Africa, banning them from officially sanctioned international cricket. As players were poorly remunerated during the 1970s, several accepted the offer to tour South Africa, particularly players getting towards the end of their careers for which a blacklisting would have little effect.\n\nThe rebel tours continued into the 1980s but then progress was made in South African politics and it became clear that apartheid was ending. South Africa, now a \"Rainbow Nation\" under [[Nelson Mandela]], was welcomed back into international sport in 1991.\n\n===World Series Cricket===\n{{See also|World Series Cricket}}\n\nThe money problems of top cricketers were also the root cause of another cricketing crisis that arose in 1977 when the Australian media magnate [[Kerry Packer]] fell out with the Australian Cricket Board over TV rights. Taking advantage of the low remuneration paid to players, Packer retaliated by signing several of the best players in the world to a privately run cricket league outside the structure of international cricket. World Series Cricket hired some of the banned South African players and allowed them to show off their skills in an international arena against other world-class players. The schism lasted only until 1979 and the \"rebel\" players were allowed back into established international cricket, though many found that their national teams had moved on without them. Long-term results of World Series Cricket have included the introduction of significantly higher player salaries and innovations such as coloured kit and night games.\n\n===Limited-overs cricket===\nIn the 1960s, English county teams began playing a version of cricket with games of only one innings each and a maximum number of overs per innings. Starting in 1963 as a knockout competition only, limited-overs cricket grew in popularity and, in 1969, a national league was created which consequently caused a reduction in the number of matches in the County Championship.\n\nAlthough many \"traditional\" cricket fans objected to the shorter form of the game, limited-overs cricket did have the advantage of delivering a result to spectators within a single day; it did improve cricket's appeal to younger or busier people; and it did prove commercially successful.\n\nThe first limited-overs international match took place at [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in 1971 as a time-filler after a Test match had been abandoned because of heavy rain on the opening days. It was tried simply as an experiment and to give the players some exercise, but turned out to be immensely popular. [[One Day International|limited-overs internationals]] (LOIs or ODIs\u2014one-day internationals) have since grown to become a massively popular form of the game, especially for busy people who want to be able to see a whole match. The International Cricket Council reacted to this development by organising the first [[Cricket World Cup]] in England in 1975, with all the Test-playing nations taking part.\n\n===Analytic and graphic technology===\nLimited-overs cricket increased television ratings for cricket coverage. Innovative techniques introduced in coverage of limited-over matches were soon adopted for Test coverage. The innovations included presentation of in-depth statistics and graphical analysis, placing miniature cameras in the stumps, multiple usage of cameras to provide shots from several locations around the ground, high-speed photography and computer graphics technology enabling television viewers to study the course of a delivery and help them understand an umpire's decision.\n\nIn 1992, the use of a [[third umpire]] to adjudicate run-out appeals with television replays was introduced in the Test series between South Africa and India. The third umpire's duties have subsequently expanded to include decisions on other aspects of play such as stumpings, catches and boundaries. From 2011, the third umpire was being called upon to moderate [[Umpire Decision Review System|review of umpires' decisions]], including LBW, with the aid of virtual-reality tracking technologies (e.g., [[Hawk-Eye]] and [[Hot Spot (cricket)|Hot Spot]]), though such measures still could not free some disputed decisions from heated controversy.<ref>Gibson, Owen [https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/08/cricket-embraced-technology-hawkeye-founder Cricket may have embraced technology too quickly, says Hawk-Eye founder] ''[[The Guardian]]'', 9 August 2013</ref>\n\n==21st century cricket==\nIn June 2001, the ICC introduced a \"Test Championship Table\" and, in October 2002, a \"One-day International Championship Table\". As indicated by ICC rankings,<ref name=iccrank>[http://www.espncricinfo.com/rankings/content/current/page/211271.html ICC rankings for Tests, ODIs and Twenty20] at espncricinfo.com (Accessed 30 August 2013)</ref> the various cricket formats have continued to be a major competitive sport in most former British Empire countries, notably the Indian subcontinent, and new participants including the Netherlands. In 2017, the number of countries with full ICC membership was increased to twelve by the addition of [[Afghanistan national cricket team|Afghanistan]] and [[Ireland national cricket team|Ireland]].\n\nThe ICC expanded its development programme, aiming to produce more national teams capable of competing at the various formats. Development efforts are focused on African and Asian nations, and on the [[United States cricket team|United States]]. In 2004, the [[ICC Intercontinental Cup]] brought first-class cricket to 12 nations, mostly for the first time. Cricket's newest innovation is [[Twenty20]], essentially an evening entertainment. It has so far enjoyed enormous popularity and has attracted large attendances at matches as well as good TV audience ratings. The [[2007 ICC World Twenty20|inaugural ICC Twenty20 World Cup]] tournament was held in 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/25/content/story/1146856.html|title=Remember these?

There is no official term for cricket of this high standard before 1895 and many loose terms were used for convenience including \"first-class\" itself and other adjectives like \"major\", \"great\" and \"important\", the latter being coined by the ACS for its ''A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709\u20131863'' (1981).<ref name=\"FMG\">ACS, ''First-class Match Guide'', p. 4.</ref> It is generally agreed by the main historical sources that the earliest known example of what was contemporarily called a \"great match\" was the one played for fifty guineas in June 1697 between two eleven-a-side teams at an unspecified location in Sussex.<ref name=\"TJM\"/> It is entirely feasible, and is indeed believed by some historians, that major matches were played for many years before 1697.<ref name=\"W10\">Webber, p. 10.</ref><ref name=\"A23\">Altham, p. 23.</ref> In 1695, the English Parliament decided against a renewal of the 1662 Licensing Act and so cleared the way for a free press on the Act's expiry in 1696.<ref name=\"L95\">{{cite web|url=http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |title=From Lads to Lord's: 1695 |date=2007 |first=John |last=Leach |publisher=Stumpsite |accessdate=10 January 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629140259/http://www.jl.sl.btinternet.co.uk/stampsite/cricket/ladstolords/1601.html#1693 |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}</ref> The main reason for matches before 1697 being unknown is that, while the Licensing Act was in force, it effectively imposed censorship upon the press and sport was not deemed to be a suitable subject for newspaper coverage. After the restrictions were removed, sport was gradually introduced into the newspapers but it would be decades before coverage became anything substantial, let alone comprehensive.<ref name=\"L95\"/>\n\nFrom 1895, there is no question about first-class status because of the official definition.<ref name=\"FMG\"/> The concept became global from 1947 when it was re-defined by the ICC, although there has been hardly any controversy about match status outside Great Britain before 1947.<ref name=WCA48>''Wisden 1948'', p. 813.</ref> Status of [[limited overs cricket|limited overs matches]], which began in 1963, is governed by the official [[List A]] categorisation and there are similarly no issues about major [[Twenty20]] matches. Although the experts are in general agreement about match status, there have been exceptions although these account for a tiny percentage of the total number of matches recorded. Apart from [[Maharaj Kumar of Vizianagram's XI cricket team in India and Ceylon in 1930\u201331|one tour of India and Ceylon by a privately organised team in the winter of 1930\u201331]], all the \"disputed\" matches took place in England before 1895: see [[Variations in published cricket statistics]] for further information.\n\nThe list below is by no means exhaustive, but the works included are widely held in cricketing circles to be significant and substantial sources of information about the development of the sport from the end of the 17th century to the commencement of officially defined first-class cricket in 1895. These are widely used to determine the status of individual matches, teams, venues and players. In a more general sense, all of the sources listed in [[Bibliography of cricket]], though again this is not an exhaustive list, are reliable but autobiographies and other works with a narrow scope are not necessarily suitable, certainly not if used in isolation, to determine match status.\n\n===Books and other printed works===\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to First-Class Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles |year=1982 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=ACS |authorlink=Association of Cricket Statisticians and Historians |title=A Guide to Important Cricket Matches Played in the British Isles 1709 \u2013 1863 |year=1981 |publisher=ACS |location=Nottingham |isbn=}}\n* {{cite book |last=Altham |first=H.
