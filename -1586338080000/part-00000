The second son and successor of hotelier [[Conrad Hilton]], he was the chairman, president and chief executive officer of [[Hilton Hotels Corporation]] and chairman emeritus of the [[Conrad N. Hilton Foundation]]. Hilton, a notable pilot and outdoorsman, was also a founder of the [[American Football League]] as the original owner of the [[Los Angeles Chargers]], and helped forge the merger with the [[National Football League]] that created the [[Super Bowl]]. Like his father before him, he pledged 97 percent of his wealth to the humanitarian work of the [[Conrad N. Hilton Foundation]].<ref>\"Barron Hilton to Donate 97% of Estate to Hilton Foundation\".

Hilton grew up with three siblings, [[Conrad Hilton, Jr.|Conrad Nicholson Hilton, Jr.]], Eric Michael Hilton, and Constance Francesca Hilton.

As a child, Hilton was fascinated by aviation, and learned to fly when he was 17. After his wartime discharge, he attended the [[University of Southern California]] Aeronautical School, where he earned his [[twin-engine]] rating at age 19.<ref>{{cite web |last=Robertson |first=Cliff |title=Smashing Stereotypes |publisher=Airport Journals |date=June 2006 |url=http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0606003 |accessdate=April 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717065651/http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0606003 |archive-date=July 17, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n== Early career, Los Angeles Chargers ==\nBefore joining his father in the hotel industry, Barron Hilton honed his business skills in a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. He acquired the Los Angeles-area distributorship of Vita-Pakt Citrus Products, co-founded MacDonald Oil Company, and founded Air Finance Corporation, one of the nation's first aircraft leasing businesses. In 1954, Barron was elected vice president of Hilton Hotels, running the company's franchise operations and creating the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] credit card as a service to the company's customers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrm.uh.edu/inductee/inductee.asp?InducteeId=52&id= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326065330/http://www.hrm.uh.edu/inductee/inductee.asp?InducteeId=52&id= |title=Hospitality Hall of Honor \u2013 Inductees \u2013 Barron Hilton |website=[[University of Houston]] |date=<!--undated--> |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archive-date=March 26, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]] offered Hilton the Los Angeles franchise in the new [[American Football League]] (AFL). Hilton named his team the [[Chargers]], but denied that he did it to create synergy with his new credit card business. A fan had nominated the name in a contest, and Hilton selected it because of the bugle call and \"Charge!\" cheer that was often sounded during [[USC Trojans football|USC football]] games at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. The Chargers began playing at the Coliseum in 1960, but in spite of winning the [[Western Division (NFL)|Western Division]], the club found it difficult to compete for fans with the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in their own stadium. Hilton moved the team to San Diego in time for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]] and played in tiny [[Balboa Stadium]], which the city had expanded to 30,000 seats.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/30/sports/la-sp-dwyre30-2009nov30 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Bill |last=Dwyre |title=Barron Hilton's Chargers turned short stay into long-term success |date=November 30, 2009 |access-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195724/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/30/sports/la-sp-dwyre30-2009nov30 |archive-date=January 7, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHilton began working with the local newspapers to engender support for construction of a state-of-the-art stadium. Encouraged by [[San Diego Union]] sports editor [[Jack Murphy (sportswriter)|Jack Murphy]], among others, a referendum was passed in 1965, and the Chargers began play in the new San Diego Stadium in 1967. With the availability of a new stadium, the city received a baseball expansion franchise from the National League, and the [[San Diego Padres]] began play in 1969. It was named Jack Murphy Stadium after Murphy's death in 1980, and is now known as [[SDCCU Stadium]].<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\" />\n\nHilton also served as AFL president in 1965, and helped forge the merger between the AFL and the NFL, announced in 1966, which created the Super Bowl. In all, the Chargers won five divisional titles, and one [[AFL Championship]], during Hilton's six years at the helm of the club. In 1966, directors of Hilton Hotels Corporation asked Hilton to succeed his father as president and chief executive officer of the company, provided that he drop his football responsibilities. He sold his majority interest in the team for $10&nbsp;million\u2014a record for any professional sports franchise at the time\u2014after an initial investment in a franchise fee of just $25,000.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\" />\n\nWith the death of the Bills' [[Ralph Wilson]] in 2014, Hilton became the last surviving member of the [[Foolish Club]]\u2014the nickname the original AFL owners gave each other, as they absorbed the start-up expenses and player salaries necessary to compete with the established NFL.<ref name = NYTObit/>\n\n==Hilton Hotels==\nOnce charged with the responsibility for Hilton Hotels Corporation, Barron Hilton soon showed his father's genius for cost controls and real estate deals. In 1970, he convinced the board to expand into [[Las Vegas]] by purchasing the International and the Flamingo from financier [[Kirk Kerkorian]]. Hilton Hotels thus became the first company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to venture into the gaming market. Renamed the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and the [[Flamingo Hilton]], the two resorts tapped a new source of income from gambling in a state where it had been legal since 1931. Barron could also see that Las Vegas would become a leading convention destination, capitalizing on the company's strength in that important market segment.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1970 Annual Report, pp. 12\u201316</ref>\n\nHilton personally introduced two innovations that have become standard features of casinos everywhere. Calling on his background in photography, he installed video cameras throughout the casinos to replace the \"eye in the sky\" system of observers peering through two-way mirrors in the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pregame.com/sample_weblogs/b/bob-majors/archive/2008/09/07/old-school-las-vegas-then-las-vegas-now-as-perceived-by-bob-majors.aspx |title=Old School \u2013 Las Vegas Then/Las Vegas Now as perceived by Bob Majors \u2013 Bob Majors \u2013 Sample Weblogs |publisher=Pregame.com |date=September 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |first=Bob |last=Majors |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528200436/http://pregame.com/sample_weblogs/b/bob-majors/archive/2008/09/07/old-school-las-vegas-then-las-vegas-now-as-perceived-by-bob-majors.aspx |archivedate=May 28, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nLas Vegas would also become the self-proclaimed \"Entertainment Capital of the World\". Of all the headliners to perform at the Hilton or the Flamingo, the most successful and spectacular was [[Elvis Presley]]. After a decade in the movies, he began performing in front of live audiences again in 1969 at the opening of the International (a few years later renamed the Las Vegas Hilton). He went on to star at the Las Vegas Hilton two months a year\u2014performing two shows a night, seven nights a week\u2014until shortly before his death in 1977. Presley set a world entertainment record at the Las Vegas Hilton for selling out 837 consecutive concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/dec/13/25-greatest-headliners-las-vegas-history/ |title=The 25 greatest headliners in Las Vegas history |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607190605/http://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/dec/13/25-greatest-headliners-las-vegas-history/ |archive-date=June 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe company's expansion into Nevada had an immediate impact on its net income. By 1972, the two resorts contributed 45 percent of the company's income (before interest income, interest expense, write down of investments and sales of properties), nearly matching the income from the other 160 Hilton hotels in the United States.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1973 Annual Report, p. 2</ref>\n\nOn the hotel front, in 1975, Hilton sold a 50 percent interest in six of the company's largest hotels to [[Prudential Insurance Company]] for $83&nbsp;million. He took a [[leaseback]] to manage the properties, collecting lucrative management fees and a percentage of their gross profits. Perhaps more importantly, the sale proved that these hotels were worth double their book value, demonstrating the underlying value of the company's real estate holdings.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 5</ref> The transaction also enhanced the value of the stock held by every HHC shareholder. Hilton used the proceeds to pay down high interest debt, and repurchase 20 percent of the company's stock\u2014all at [[market rate]]\u2014which was still trading well below the company's book value.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1975 Annual Report, p. 4</ref>\n\nHilton continued to expand the domestic hotel chain through franchising and the selective acquisition of management contracts and hotels in emerging markets. In 1977, he completed a hotel purchase that his father had initiated 28 years earlier. When Conrad Hilton bought the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in 1949, he actually bought the hotel's operating company and its 30-year lease to run the hotel. The building, and the land under it, were still owned by the realty arm of the [[Penn Central Railroad]]. Knowing that the lease would expire in 1979, Hilton deftly negotiated to buy the hotel and real estate from the railroad. The landmark property, whose current value is estimated around $1&nbsp;billion, was purchased by Hilton for just $35&nbsp;million.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 3</ref> \n\t\nAs competitors aggressively spread across the U.S. in the '80s, Barron held his own by rehabbing his own hotels and increasing revenues in Las Vegas. Through a series of massive additions to the Flamingo Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton, the company nearly tripled its rooms in Las Vegas by 1990, from 2,277 to 6,703. He also launched Conrad International in the '80s,<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1990 Annual Report, p. 7</ref> and [[Hilton Garden Inn]] in the '90s.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1996 Annual Report, p. 5</ref>\n\nIn contrast to his gamble on gaming, Hilton earned a well-deserved reputation as a financial conservative. After seeing his father struggle to overcome the effects of the [[American Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], he maintained the strongest [[balance sheet]] in the industry. Throughout his 30 years as CEO, he carried a low [[debt-to-capital ratio]] and a high [[credit rating]], enabling him to gobble up such properties as [[Bally's Reno]] (formerly the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino-Reno). The 2,000-room resort was opened in 1978 for $230&nbsp;million, and purchased by Hilton in 1992 for $88&nbsp;million. With strong [[cash flow]] and plenty of liquid investments on hand, he was able to weather the inevitable recessions and business interruptions that struck the industry from the mid-'60s to the mid-'90s.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation 1992 Annual Report, pp. 3\u20134</ref>\n \nHilton continued as chairman of the board through the next decade as his hand-picked successor, [[Steve Bollenbach]], dramatically expanded the company through a series of mergers and acquisitions. The advent of friendly capital markets in the late '90s enabled him to acquire such popular brands as [[Embassy Suites]], [[Doubletree]], [[Hampton Inn]], [[Homewood Suites]], Bally's and Caesars.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1999 Annual Report, p. 2</ref> Then, in 2005, he reacquired Hilton International, 38 years after it had been sold to TWA. With the company now strategically complete, Bollenbach spun off the gaming business, which merged with Harrah's in 2005 and was renamed [[Caesars Entertainment Corporation|Caesars Entertainment]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webpronews.com/caesars-and-harrahs-to-merge-2005-03 |title=Caesars and Harrah's To Merge |publisher=WebProNews.com |date=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224227/http://www.webpronews.com/caesars-and-harrahs-to-merge-2005-03 |archive-date=December 17, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the meantime, the hotel business continued to soar. With the best known and most respected name in the industry\u2014and popular domestic brands ripe for expansion overseas\u2014Hilton Hotels Corporation proved to be irresistible to [[The Blackstone Group]]. In 2007, the private equity firm purchased Hilton Hotels Corporation, consisting of 2,800 hotels with 480,000 rooms in 76 countries and territories. Blackstone paid $47.50 per share, a 32 percent premium over the July 2 closing price. The $26&nbsp;billion, all-cash transaction included $7.5&nbsp;billion of debt.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blackstone.com/news-views/press-releases/hilton-hotels-corporation-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone-investments-funds |title=Hilton Hotels Corporation to be Acquired by Blackstone Investments Funds |publisher=Blackstone.com |date= |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528221158/http://www.blackstone.com/news-views/press-releases/hilton-hotels-corporation-to-be-acquired-by-blackstone-investments-funds |archive-date=May 28, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[Host Hotels & Resorts]] veteran Chris Nassetta was hired to manage the company, which was renamed [[Hilton Worldwide]], Inc. and is now known as Hilton, Inc.

He left 13.5&nbsp;million shares of Hilton Hotels Corporation stock\u201497 percent of his estate\u2014to the [[Conrad N. Hilton Foundation]], a humanitarian charity which he had established in 1944.<ref name=\"Encyclopedia: Barron Hilton\">{{cite encyclopedia |title=Hilton, William \u2013 Overview, Personal Life, Career Details, Social and Economic Impact, Chronology: Hilton, William |publisher=Net Industries |url=http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6273/Hilton-William.html |format=Encyclopedia |accessdate=April 2, 2011 |date=<!--undated--> |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215163811/http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/articles/pages/6273/Hilton-William.html |archivedate=February 15, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn his will, Conrad also gave Barron the right to purchase those shares in order to maintain family control of the company, but the foundation challenged the option in [[probate court]]. It took an entire decade to resolve the issue. Hilton's right to exercise his option was upheld in an appeals court ruling in March 1988, giving him [[Voting interest|voting power]] over roughly 34 percent of the company's [[outstanding shares]]. Conrad's bequest of stock was worth $160&nbsp;million when he died in 1979. Thanks to his son's successful management of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, those shares were worth $654&nbsp;million when the settlement was reached late in 1988. In a press statement issued after the favorable ruling, Hilton said it gave him \"the opportunity to structure an arrangement whereby my father's two objectives, retaining control of the stock in family hands, and benefiting charity through the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation, can both be achieved. I am confident that my father would be pleased with this accord.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-26/business/fi-240_1_barron-hilton |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |first=Al |last=Delugach |title=Barron Hilton Wins Battle for Chain : Settlement of Lengthy Dispute Gives Hotelier Effective Control |date=November 26, 1988 |access-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218125601/http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-26/business/fi-240_1_barron-hilton |archive-date=December 18, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe settlement was finalized in 1989. Neither Hilton, nor the foundation, had to actually pay for the shares; they split them instead. Hilton received 4 million shares, the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation received 3.5&nbsp;million shares, and the remaining 6&nbsp;million shares were placed in the W. Barron Hilton [[Charitable remainder unitrust]], of which Barron was the executor.

He promised himself that he would one day learn to fly. He took private flying lessons at a field on the north shore of Oahu during his time in the Navy, and got his pilot's license at age 17.<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\">[http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0307003 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120627093532/http://www.airportjournals.com/Display.cfm?varID=0307003 |date=June 27, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to his single-engine and multi-engine ratings, Hilton eventually earned glider, lighter than air (balloons) and helicopter ratings as well. He maintained a small fleet of aircraft at his [[Flying-M Ranch|Flying M Ranch]] east of the sierras in northern Nevada that includes sailplanes, tow planes, aerobatic aircraft, hot air balloons and classic, restored biplanes.<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\"/> He flew them all until he retired from the cockpit in 2012 at age 84.<ref>{{cite book |last=Freeze |first=Di |title=In the Cockpit with Barron Hilton |year=2013 |page=xv |isbn=978-0985810368}}</ref>\n\nIn the '90s, he boldly backed the first attempts to capture one of the last great milestones in aviation\u2014flying non-stop around the world in a balloon\u2014with the Earthwinds Hilton and Global Hilton campaigns. While falling short of the ultimate goal, Hilton is credited with inspiring the efforts of those who achieved the feat. [[Bertrand Piccard]] and [[Brian Jones]] were the first to make a trans-global flight in 1999; [[Steve Fossett]] became the first to complete the flight solo in 2002.<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\"/>\n\nFrom 1980 to 2009, he also hosted the [[Barron Hilton Cup]], a unique, worldwide glider competition. Pilots who flew the longest triangular flights during each two-year period in six regions of the world earned participation in a weeklong soaring camp at his Flying M Ranch. Co-founder [[Helmut Reichmann]], Germany's three-time world soaring champion, devised a handicap system that enabled pilots flying older gliders to compete with elite pilots in high-performance aircraft of the latest design. Once at the Flying M, they flew recreationally alongside world champions and celebrities invited to attend by Hilton. Beginning in 1996 with its predecessors, the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Co., [[EADS]], had served as a partner in the event.<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\"/>\n\nOver the years, a number of notable pilots regularly joined Hilton for weekends at the Flying M. They include entertainers [[John Denver]] and [[Cliff Robertson]]; astronauts [[Neil Armstrong]], [[Gene Cernan]], [[Bill Anders]], and [[Ulf Merbold]]; and test pilots and record-holders Johnny Myers, [[Clay Lacy]], Bruno Gantenbrink, [[Bob Hoover]], [[Carroll Shelby]], Sully Sullenberger, and air, sea and land adventurer, [[Steve Fossett]].<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\"/>\n\nOn Labor Day, 2007, Fossett took off from the Flying M Ranch and never returned, perishing in a crash in the Sierras. In spite of an intensive search, the wreckage wasn't discovered until the following spring. The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause(s) of this accident to be \"the pilot's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane. Contributing to the accident were the downdrafts, high density altitude, and mountainous terrain.\"  Examination of the airframe and engine revealed no evidence of any malfunctions or failures that would have prevented normal operation.<ref>[http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20081007X17184&key=1 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203023400/http://www.ntsb.gov/aviationquery/brief.aspx?ev_id=20081007X17184&key=1 |date=December 3, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Smithsonian National Air & Space Museum]] honored Hilton in 2010 by christening the Barron Hilton Pioneers of Flight Gallery.

He acquired the Los Angeles-area distributorship of Vita-Pakt Citrus Products, co-founded MacDonald Oil Company, and founded Air Finance Corporation, one of the nation's first aircraft leasing businesses. In 1954, Barron was elected vice president of Hilton Hotels, running the company's franchise operations and creating the [[Carte Blanche (credit card)|Carte Blanche]] credit card as a service to the company's customers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrm.uh.edu/inductee/inductee.asp?InducteeId=52&id= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326065330/http://www.hrm.uh.edu/inductee/inductee.asp?InducteeId=52&id= |title=Hospitality Hall of Honor \u2013 Inductees \u2013 Barron Hilton |website=[[University of Houston]] |date=<!--undated--> |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archive-date=March 26, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 1959, [[Lamar Hunt]] offered Hilton the Los Angeles franchise in the new [[American Football League]] (AFL). Hilton named his team the [[Chargers]], but denied that he did it to create synergy with his new credit card business. A fan had nominated the name in a contest, and Hilton selected it because of the bugle call and \"Charge!\" cheer that was often sounded during [[USC Trojans football|USC football]] games at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. The Chargers began playing at the Coliseum in 1960, but in spite of winning the [[Western Division (NFL)|Western Division]], the club found it difficult to compete for fans with the [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) in their own stadium. Hilton moved the team to San Diego in time for the [[1961 NFL season|1961 season]] and played in tiny [[Balboa Stadium]], which the city had expanded to 30,000 seats.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\">{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/30/sports/la-sp-dwyre30-2009nov30 |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Bill |last=Dwyre |title=Barron Hilton's Chargers turned short stay into long-term success |date=November 30, 2009 |access-date=December 13, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107195724/http://articles.latimes.com/2009/nov/30/sports/la-sp-dwyre30-2009nov30 |archive-date=January 7, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHilton began working with the local newspapers to engender support for construction of a state-of-the-art stadium. Encouraged by [[San Diego Union]] sports editor [[Jack Murphy (sportswriter)|Jack Murphy]], among others, a referendum was passed in 1965, and the Chargers began play in the new San Diego Stadium in 1967. With the availability of a new stadium, the city received a baseball expansion franchise from the National League, and the [[San Diego Padres]] began play in 1969. It was named Jack Murphy Stadium after Murphy's death in 1980, and is now known as [[SDCCU Stadium]].<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\" />\n\nHilton also served as AFL president in 1965, and helped forge the merger between the AFL and the NFL, announced in 1966, which created the Super Bowl. In all, the Chargers won five divisional titles, and one [[AFL Championship]], during Hilton's six years at the helm of the club. In 1966, directors of Hilton Hotels Corporation asked Hilton to succeed his father as president and chief executive officer of the company, provided that he drop his football responsibilities. He sold his majority interest in the team for $10 million\u2014a record for any professional sports franchise at the time\u2014after an initial investment in a franchise fee of just $25,000.<ref name=\"articles.latimes.com\" />\n\nWith the death of the Bills' [[Ralph Wilson]] in 2014, Hilton became the last surviving member of the [[Foolish Club]]\u2014the nickname the original AFL owners gave each other, as they absorbed the start-up expenses and player salaries necessary to compete with the established NFL.<ref name = NYTObit/>\n\n==Hilton Hotels==\nOnce charged with the responsibility for Hilton Hotels Corporation, Barron Hilton soon showed his father's genius for cost controls and real estate deals. In 1970, he convinced the board to expand into [[Las Vegas]] by purchasing the International and the Flamingo from financier [[Kirk Kerkorian]]. Hilton Hotels thus became the first company listed on the [[New York Stock Exchange]] to venture into the gaming market. Renamed the [[Las Vegas Hilton]] and the [[Flamingo Hilton]], the two resorts tapped a new source of income from gambling in a state where it had been legal since 1931. Barron could also see that Las Vegas would become a leading convention destination, capitalizing on the company's strength in that important market segment.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1970 Annual Report, pp. 12\u201316</ref>\n\nHilton personally introduced two innovations that have become standard features of casinos everywhere. Calling on his background in photography, he installed video cameras throughout the casinos to replace the \"eye in the sky\" system of observers peering through two-way mirrors in the ceiling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pregame.com/sample_weblogs/b/bob-majors/archive/2008/09/07/old-school-las-vegas-then-las-vegas-now-as-perceived-by-bob-majors.aspx |title=Old School \u2013 Las Vegas Then/Las Vegas Now as perceived by Bob Majors \u2013 Bob Majors \u2013 Sample Weblogs |publisher=Pregame.com |date=September 7, 2008 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |first=Bob |last=Majors |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528200436/http://pregame.com/sample_weblogs/b/bob-majors/archive/2008/09/07/old-school-las-vegas-then-las-vegas-now-as-perceived-by-bob-majors.aspx |archivedate=May 28, 2015 }}</ref>\n\nLas Vegas would also become the self-proclaimed \"Entertainment Capital of the World\". Of all the headliners to perform at the Hilton or the Flamingo, the most successful and spectacular was [[Elvis Presley]]. After a decade in the movies, he began performing in front of live audiences again in 1969 at the opening of the International (a few years later renamed the Las Vegas Hilton). He went on to star at the Las Vegas Hilton two months a year\u2014performing two shows a night, seven nights a week\u2014until shortly before his death in 1977. Presley set a world entertainment record at the Las Vegas Hilton for selling out 837 consecutive concerts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/dec/13/25-greatest-headliners-las-vegas-history/ |title=The 25 greatest headliners in Las Vegas history |publisher=Las Vegas Weekly |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=May 28, 2015 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607190605/http://lasvegasweekly.com/news/2012/dec/13/25-greatest-headliners-las-vegas-history/ |archive-date=June 7, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThe company's expansion into Nevada had an immediate impact on its net income. By 1972, the two resorts contributed 45 percent of the company's income (before interest income, interest expense, write down of investments and sales of properties), nearly matching the income from the other 160 Hilton hotels in the United States.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1973 Annual Report, p. 2</ref>\n\nOn the hotel front, in 1975, Hilton sold a 50 percent interest in six of the company's largest hotels to [[Prudential Insurance Company]] for $83 million. He took a [[leaseback]] to manage the properties, collecting lucrative management fees and a percentage of their gross profits. Perhaps more importantly, the sale proved that these hotels were worth double their book value, demonstrating the underlying value of the company's real estate holdings.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 5</ref>  The transaction also enhanced the value of the stock held by every HHC shareholder. Hilton used the proceeds to pay down high interest debt, and repurchase 20 percent of the company's stock\u2014all at [[market rate]]\u2014which was still trading well below the company's book value.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1975 Annual Report, p. 4</ref>\n\nHilton continued to expand the domestic hotel chain through franchising and the selective acquisition of management contracts and hotels in emerging markets. In 1977, he completed a hotel purchase that his father had initiated 28 years earlier. When Conrad Hilton bought the [[Waldorf-Astoria]] in 1949, he actually bought the hotel's operating company and its 30-year lease to run the hotel. The building, and the land under it, were still owned by the realty arm of the [[Penn Central Railroad]]. Knowing that the lease would expire in 1979, Hilton deftly negotiated to buy the hotel and real estate from the railroad. The landmark property, whose current value is estimated around $1 billion, was purchased by Hilton for just $35 million.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1976 Annual Report, p. 3</ref> \n\t\nAs competitors aggressively spread across the U.S. in the '80s, Barron held his own by rehabbing his own hotels and increasing revenues in Las Vegas. Through a series of massive additions to the Flamingo Hilton and the Las Vegas Hilton, the company nearly tripled its rooms in Las Vegas by 1990, from 2,277 to 6,703. He also launched Conrad International in the '80s,<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1990 Annual Report, p. 7</ref> and [[Hilton Garden Inn]] in the '90s.<ref>Hilton Hotels Corporation, 1996 Annual Report, p. 5</ref>\n\nIn contrast to his gamble on gaming, Hilton earned a well-deserved reputation as a financial conservative. After seeing his father struggle to overcome the effects of the [[American Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], he maintained the strongest [[balance sheet]] in the industry. Throughout his 30 years as CEO, he carried a low [[debt-to-capital ratio]] and a high [[credit rating]], enabling him to gobble up such properties as [[Bally's Reno]] (formerly the MGM Grand Hotel and Casino-Reno). The 2,000-room resort was opened in 1978 for $230 million, and purchased by Hilton in 1992 for $88 million.

Conrad's bequest of stock was worth $160 million when he died in 1979. Thanks to his son's successful management of the Hilton Hotels Corporation, those shares were worth $654 million when the settlement was reached late in 1988. In a press statement issued after the favorable ruling, Hilton said it gave him \"the opportunity to structure an arrangement whereby my father's two objectives, retaining control of the stock in family hands, and benefiting charity through the Conrad N.

Charity is a supreme virtue, and the great channel through which the mercy of God is passed on to mankind. It is the virtue that unites men and inspires their noblest efforts. 'Love one another, for that is the whole law;' so our fellow men deserve to be loved and encouraged\u2014never abandoned to wander alone in poverty and darkness. The practice of charity will bind us\u2014will bind all men in one great brotherhood. As the funds you will expend have come from many places in the world, so let there be no territorial, religious, or color restrictions on your benefactions, but beware of organized, professional charities with high-salaried executives and a heavy ratio of expense. Be ever watchful for the opportunity to shelter little children with the umbrella of your charity; be generous to their schools, their hospitals and their places of worship. For, as they must bear the burdens of our mistakes, so are they in their innocence the repositories of our hopes for the upward progress of humanity. Give aid to their protectors and defenders, the Sisters, who devote their love and life's work for the good of mankind, for they appeal especially to me as being deserving of help from the Foundation.\"<ref>[http://hiltonfoundation.org/last-will ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527043302/http://hiltonfoundation.org/last-will |date=May 27, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Aviation career==\nHilton was born the year [[Charles Lindbergh]] flew the [[Spirit of St. Louis]] across the Atlantic.

He maintained a small fleet of aircraft at his [[Flying-M Ranch|Flying M Ranch]] east of the sierras in northern Nevada that includes sailplanes, tow planes, aerobatic aircraft, hot air balloons and classic, restored biplanes.<ref name=\"airportjournals.com\"/>  He flew them all until he retired from the cockpit in 2012 at age 84.<ref>{{cite book |last=Freeze |first=Di |title=In the Cockpit with Barron Hilton |year=2013 |page=xv |isbn=978-0985810368}}</ref>\n\nIn the '90s, he boldly backed the first attempts to capture one of the last great milestones in aviation\u2014flying non-stop around the world in a balloon\u2014with the Earthwinds Hilton and Global Hilton campaigns. While falling short of the ultimate goal, Hilton is credited with inspiring the efforts of those who achieved the feat.

Pilots who flew the longest triangular flights during each two-year period in six regions of the world earned participation in a weeklong soaring camp at his Flying M Ranch. Co-founder [[Helmut Reichmann]], Germany's three-time world soaring champion, devised a handicap system that enabled pilots flying older gliders to compete with elite pilots in high-performance aircraft of the latest design. Once at the Flying M, they flew recreationally alongside world champions and celebrities invited to attend by Hilton.

The National Transportation Safety Board determined the probable cause(s) of this accident to be \"the pilot's inadvertent encounter with downdrafts that exceeded the climb capability of the airplane.
