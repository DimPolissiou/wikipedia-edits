This occurred in a context of support for the [[Maine law|type of law]] passed by General [[Neal Dow]] in [[Maine]], [[United States]], in 1851, prohibiting the sale of intoxicants.\n[[File:Sir Wilfrid Lawson and Robert Watson UKA.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|Sir Wilfrid Lawson and Robert Watson UKA]]\n\n==Early history==\nThe idea was initiated by Nathaniel Card (1805\u20131856), an Irish [[cotton]] manufacturer and member of the [[Society of Friends]]. He had earlier been a member of the Manchester and Salford [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] Society, and had taken his inspiration from the success of what later became known as the [[Maine law]]. At a private meeting at Card's house on 20 July 1852, the National League for the Total and Legal Suppression of Intemperance was formed. Those present included [[Joseph Brotherton]] [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] for {{constlk|Salford}} and his cousin [[Alderman]] William Hervey, also of Salford. At a subsequent meeting of the League they formed a Provisional Committee based in Manchester. It was not, as some people thought, simply another temperance movement or [[Teetotalism|teetotal]] organisation; the organisers believed that temperance societies fail until legal temptations for drink and [[Alcohol intoxication|drunkenness]] was taken away.

[[Europe]] began to see great changes. [[France]], ravaged by a [[Hundred Years' War|hundred years of war]], at last found peace. The people under [[Louis XI]] felt free to hope again ~ to dream of progress. But superstition and prejudice often stood in the way, seeking to crush the adventurous spirit of man.\"\n\n===Summary===\nIn [[Paris, France|Paris]] during the [[late Middle Ages]], Louis XI, the [[King of France]], and his [[Chief Justice]] of Paris, Jehan Frollo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aycyas.com/liz_hnd.htm|title=And You Call Yourself a Scientist! - The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)|website=www.aycyas.com}}</ref> visit a [[printing shop]]. Frollo is determined to do everything in his power to protect Paris from anything he sees as evil, including the [[printing press]] and [[Romani people|gypsies]], who at the time are persecuted and prohibited from entering Paris without a permit. That day is Paris' annual celebration, the [[Feast of Fools]]. [[Pierre Gringoire]], a poor street poet, does a play in front of an audience until it is interrupted by [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]], the King of the Beggars. [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]], a young gypsy girl, is seen dancing in front of an audience of people. [[Quasimodo]], the hunchback and bell ringer of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], is crowned the King of Fools until Frollo catches up to him and takes him back to the church.\n\nWhile trying to find Louis to speak to him, Esmeralda is caught by a guard for entering Paris without a permit and is being chased after by a couple of soldiers until she seeks safety in Notre Dame, in which the [[Archbishop]] of Paris, Frollo's brother [[Claude Frollo|Claude]],<ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2910/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame/articles.html|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref name=\"tcm.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/29877%7C0/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame.html|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/hunchbackofnotredame.htm|title=hunchbackofnotredame|first=Dennis|last=Schwartz|website=homepages.sover.net}}</ref> protects her. She prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to help her fellow gypsies only to be confronted by Frollo, who accuses her of being a heathen. Afterwards, she asks Louis to help her people, to which he agrees. Frollo then takes her up to the [[bell tower]] where they encounter Quasimodo, of whom she is frightened. As she runs away from the hunchback, Frollo commands Quasimodo to chase after her and kidnap her. Quasimodo catches up to Esmeralda and physically carries her away. Gringoire witnesses all this, and calls out to [[Captain Phoebus]] and his guards, who capture Quasimodo just in time. Esmeralda is then saved and starts falling in love with Phoebus. Gringoire later accidentally trespasses [[Cour des miracles|the Court of Miracles]], and is about to be hanged by the beggars under Clopin's orders until Esmeralda saves him by marrying him. Afterwards, Frollo orders the guards to arrest and round up the gypsy girls to make an inspection in an attempt to find Esmeralda, but realizes that she is not present in the group and releases them.\n\nThe next day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the square and publicly humiliated afterwards. He then asks the Parisian townspeople for water. Frollo, seeing this, realizes that he can't stop the sentence in time because it already happened, and abandons Quasimodo instead of helping him. However, Esmeralda arrives and gives Quasimodo water, and this awakens the hunchback's love for her.\n\nLater that night, Esmeralda is invited by the nobles to their party. Frollo shows up to the party, where he confesses to Esmeralda his lust for her in a hiding place. Afterwards, she dances with a black goat named [[Aristotle]] in front of the nobles and moves away from the crowd with Phoebus to a garden where they share a moment between each other. Frollo then kills Phoebus out of jealousy, and Esmeralda is wrongly accused of his death. Gringoire visits her in the prison cell to console her and tells her that he will help her to get her free. Frollo arrives at Notre Dame where he confesses the crime to his brother, and, knowing that the Archbishop refuses to help him because he is the murderer, intends to sentence Esmeralda to death for it (which he does), saying that she has \"bewitched\" him.\n\nGringoire tries to get Esmeralda free by writing an appeal, but fails when the printing press gets destroyed by soldiers under Frollo's orders. He also tries to claim Esmeralda's innocence in the courtroom, but fails again when Frollo orders his soldiers to take him away. Quasimodo also shows up to the courtroom to save Esmeralda by saying that he committed the crime, but also fails by being mocked by the Parisians and dragged away by the soldiers. After Esmeralda is forced under torture to confess to the crime she did not commit, Louis shows up to the courtroom and attempts to help Esmeralda by offering her a [[trial by ordeal]], in which she is blindfolded and must reach out to choose one of two daggers placed on the table before her: her own dagger (which will indicate her guilt if chosen) or Louis's dagger (which will demonstrate her innocence). When Esmeralda chose her dagger, the judgement is against her and Frollo sentences her to be hanged in the gallows. As Esmeralda is being taken in front of Notre Dame to do public penance, the Archbishop claims her innocence and does not allow her to do penance; however, Frollo still orders Esmeralda to be hanged in the gallows. Just as she is about to be hanged, though, Quasimodo saves her by taking her to the cathedral.\n\nWhen Gringoire and Clopin realize that the nobles are planning to revoke Notre Dame's right of sanctuary, they both try different methods in order to save Esmeralda from hanging. Gringoire writes a [[pamphlet]] that will prevent this from happening, and Clopin leads the beggars to storm the cathedral. At the Palace of Justice, Frollo reads the pamphlet to Louis. After seeing a crowd protesting against the removal of Notre Dame's sanctuary law, Louis realizes that the pamphlet is creating public opinion, which can influence kings to make decisions. However, Frollo warns and advises him against public opinion, saying that it is dangerous. After the Archbishop arrives to inform Louis of Notre Dame's attack and that Esmeralda is innocent, Louis demands to know who the real murderer is, to which Frollo confesses his crime to Louis and walks away, leaving Louis shocked. Louis orders Olivier to arrest Frollo and then talks to Gringoire after reading his pamphlet.\n\nMeanwhile, Quasimodo and the guards of Paris fight off Clopin and the  beggars. Afterwards, he sees Frollo in the bell tower seeking to harm Esmeralda, and when he comes up, Frollo tries to stop him. Frollo then attempts to kill Quasimodo with a dagger, but Quasimodo, realizing Frollo's evil nature, stops him and in defense for himself and Esmeralda he throws Frollo off the cathedral top, sending him down to his death. Later that morning, Esmeralda is pardoned by the King and freed from hanging due to the success of Gringoire's pamphlet. Her Gypsy people are also finally freed. Then, she comes to truly love Gringoire and leaves with him and a huge cheering crowd out of the public square. Quasimodo sees all this from high on the cathedral and says sadly to a gargoyle, \"Why was I not made of stone, like thee?\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Maureen O'Hara as Esmerelda 2.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Esmeralda]]\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as [[Quasimodo]]\n* [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] as Jehan Frollo\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]]\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]]\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as [[Pierre Gringoire]]\n* [[Alan Marshal (actor)|Alan Marshal]] as [[Captain Phoebus]]\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Archbishop [[Claude Frollo]]\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as [[Louis XI of France|King Louis XI]]\n* [[Katharine Alexander]] as Madame de Lys\n* [[George Zucco]] as Procurator\n* [[Fritz Leiber (actor)|Fritz Leiber]] as Old nobleman\n* [[Etienne Girardot]] as Doctor\n* [[Helene Whitney]] as Fleur de Lys\n* [[Mina Gombell]] as Queen of beggars\n* [[Arthur Hohl]] as [[Olivier le Daim|Olivier]]\n* [[Curt Bois]] as Student\n* [[George Tobias]] as Beggar\n* [[Rod La Rocque]] as Phillippe\n* [[Spencer Charters]] as Court clerk\n* [[Kathryn Adams Doty|Kathryn Adams]] as Fleur's companion\n* Dianne Hunter as Fleur's companion\n* [[Sig Arno|Siegfried Arno]] as Tailor\n* [[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]] as Monk (uncredited)\n* [[Rondo Hatton]] as Ugly Man (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nIn 1932, it was reported by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' that Universal announced that it would remake the 1923 ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' film with [[John Huston]] writing a script and that [[Boris Karloff]] would play Quasimodo.<ref>{{cite book | first = Allen | last = Cohen | author2 = Harry Lawton | title = John Huston: A Guide to References and Resources | publisher = GK Hall | year= 1997| isbn= 9780816116195}}</ref>\n\n[[Irving Thalberg]], who was an uncredited producer in the 1923 film, considered remaking the film in 1934 and even discussed the idea with [[Charles Laughton]].

[[Ronald Colman]], [[Paul Muni]], [[Fredric March]], [[Lionel Barrymore]] and [[Peter Lorre]] were the choices in the poll and in the end, Universal decided to go with Lorre, even as far as negotiating with the actor to star in the film, but the project never materialized.\n\nA year later, [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] persuaded [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] to buy the property from Universal as a star-vehicle for Muni.

It was shot at the RKO Encino Ranch, with the interiors of the bell tower being shot at the Mudd Hall of Philosophy at the [[University of Southern California]].\n\nThe sets of Paris and the Notre Dame Cathedral were constructed by [[Van Nest Polglase]] at the cost of $250,000 (about $4,500,000 in 2019 dollars), while Darrell Silvera worked as set decorator. [[Walter Plunkett]] oversaw the costume design and [[Joseph H. August]] served as cinematographer, this film being the first of his three collaborations with Dieterle.\n\nFilming proved to be difficult for the cast and crew due to the hot temperatures, particularly for Laughton, who had to act with a lot of makeup. In her autobiography, O'Hara recalls one day arriving on the set and finding chimpanzees, baboons and gorillas. Dieterle wanted monks to be on the set but his assistant mistakenly thought he wanted monkeys because of his poor English and thick German accent.\n\nMakeup artist [[Perc Westmore]] was loaned by Warner Bros. to RKO for the production. Westmore and Laughton did not get along. Though Westmore wanted to use sponge rubber to make a light appliance for Laughton to wear, Laughton wanted a heavy one to help him stay in character. Laughton was offended when Westmore suggested he try acting like the hump was heavy and was rude and dismissive to Westmore throughout filming. Near the end of the shoot, Westmore called his younger brother to the studio, where he witnessed Westmore, while strapping on the hump, spray Laughton in the face with a [[seltzer bottle|seltzer]] bottle full of [[quinine]] water and then kick him in the ass. Westmore told Laughton, \"That's for all the grief you gave me\" and added that his brother was a witness and would deny anything Laughton said about the incident.<ref>{{cite book | first =Frank| last = Westmore  | title = The Westmores of Hollywood | publisher = J.B.

Laughton lightened the mood by reciting the [[Gettysburg Address]] (that he had recited in ''[[Ruggles of Red Gap]]''). Another incident of emotional filming was the filming of the scene where Quasimodo rings the bells in the tower of the cathedral for Esmeralda. Feeling in pain because his native Britain had declared war on Germany, Laughton rang the bells over and over again until he fell down from exhaustion, overwhelming the crew with emotion.<ref>{{cite book | first =Maureen| last = O'Hara  | title = Tis Herself: An Autobiography | publisher = Simon & Schuster | year= 2004| isbn=9780743269162 }}</ref>\n\n===Censorship===\nThe characters of [[Claude Frollo|Claude]] and [[Jehan Frollo]] are changed from the novel, as was done in the 1923 film.

[[Europe]] began to see great changes. [[France]], ravaged by a [[Hundred Years' War|hundred years of war]], at last found peace. The people under [[Louis XI]] felt free to hope again ~ to dream of progress. But superstition and prejudice often stood in the way, seeking to crush the adventurous spirit of man.\"\n\n===Summary===\nIn [[Paris, France|Paris]] during the [[late Middle Ages]], Louis XI, the [[King of France]], and his [[Chief Justice]] of Paris, Jehan Frollo,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aycyas.com/liz_hnd.htm|title=And You Call Yourself a Scientist! - The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)|website=www.aycyas.com}}</ref> visit a [[printing shop]]. Frollo is determined to do everything in his power to protect Paris from anything he sees as evil, including the [[printing press]] and [[Romani people|gypsies]], who at the time are persecuted and prohibited from entering Paris without a permit. That day is Paris' annual celebration, the [[Feast of Fools]]. [[Pierre Gringoire]], a poor street poet, does a play in front of an audience until it is interrupted by [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]], the King of the Beggars. [[Esm\u00e9ralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]], a young gypsy girl, is seen dancing in front of an audience of people. [[Quasimodo]], the hunchback and bell ringer of [[Notre Dame Cathedral]], is crowned the King of Fools until Frollo catches up to him and takes him back to the church.\n\nWhile trying to find Louis to speak to him, Esmeralda is caught by a guard for entering Paris without a permit and is being chased after by a couple of soldiers until she seeks safety in Notre Dame, in which the [[Archbishop]] of Paris, Frollo's brother [[Claude Frollo|Claude]],<ref name=\"tcm.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/2910/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame/articles.html|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939) - Articles - TCM.com|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref name=\"tcm.com1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/29877%7C0/The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame.html|title=The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1939)|website=Turner Classic Movies}}</ref><ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/hunchbackofnotredame.htm|title=hunchbackofnotredame|first=Dennis|last=Schwartz|website=homepages.sover.net}}</ref> protects her. She prays to the [[Virgin Mary]] to help her fellow gypsies only to be confronted by Frollo, who accuses her of being a heathen. Afterwards, she asks Louis to help her people, to which he agrees. Frollo then takes her up to the [[bell tower]] where they encounter Quasimodo, of whom she is frightened. As she runs away from the hunchback, Frollo commands Quasimodo to chase after her and kidnap her. Quasimodo catches up to Esmeralda and physically carries her away. Gringoire witnesses all this, and calls out to [[Captain Phoebus]] and his guards, who capture Quasimodo just in time. Esmeralda is then saved and starts falling in love with Phoebus. Gringoire later accidentally trespasses [[Cour des miracles|the Court of Miracles]], and is about to be hanged by the beggars under Clopin's orders until Esmeralda saves him by marrying him. Afterwards, Frollo orders the guards to arrest and round up the gypsy girls to make an inspection in an attempt to find Esmeralda, but realizes that she is not present in the group and releases them.\n\nThe next day, Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the square and publicly humiliated afterwards. He then asks the Parisian townspeople for water. Frollo, seeing this, realizes that he can't stop the sentence in time because it already happened, and abandons Quasimodo instead of helping him. However, Esmeralda arrives and gives Quasimodo water, and this awakens the hunchback's love for her.\n\nLater that night, Esmeralda is invited by the nobles to their party. Frollo shows up to the party, where he confesses to Esmeralda his lust for her in a hiding place. Afterwards, she dances with a black goat named [[Aristotle]] in front of the nobles and moves away from the crowd with Phoebus to a garden where they share a moment between each other. Frollo then kills Phoebus out of jealousy, and Esmeralda is wrongly accused of his death. Gringoire visits her in the prison cell to console her and tells her that he will help her to get her free. Frollo arrives at Notre Dame where he confesses the crime to his brother, and, knowing that the Archbishop refuses to help him because he is the murderer, intends to sentence Esmeralda to death for it (which he does), saying that she has \"bewitched\" him.\n\nGringoire tries to get Esmeralda free by writing an appeal, but fails when the printing press gets destroyed by soldiers under Frollo's orders. He also tries to claim Esmeralda's innocence in the courtroom, but fails again when Frollo orders his soldiers to take him away. Quasimodo also shows up to the courtroom to save Esmeralda by saying that he committed the crime, but also fails by being mocked by the Parisians and dragged away by the soldiers. After Esmeralda is forced under torture to confess to the crime she did not commit, Louis shows up to the courtroom and attempts to help Esmeralda by offering her a [[trial by ordeal]], in which she is blindfolded and must reach out to choose one of two daggers placed on the table before her: her own dagger (which will indicate her guilt if chosen) or Louis's dagger (which will demonstrate her innocence). When Esmeralda chose her dagger, the judgement is against her and Frollo sentences her to be hanged in the gallows. As Esmeralda is being taken in front of Notre Dame to do public penance, the Archbishop claims her innocence and does not allow her to do penance; however, Frollo still orders Esmeralda to be hanged in the gallows. Just as she is about to be hanged, though, Quasimodo saves her by taking her to the cathedral.\n\nWhen Gringoire and Clopin realize that the nobles are planning to revoke Notre Dame's right of sanctuary, they both try different methods in order to save Esmeralda from hanging. Gringoire writes a [[pamphlet]] that will prevent this from happening, and Clopin leads the beggars to storm the cathedral. At the Palace of Justice, Frollo reads the pamphlet to Louis. After seeing a crowd protesting against the removal of Notre Dame's sanctuary law, Louis realizes that the pamphlet is creating public opinion, which can influence kings to make decisions. However, Frollo warns and advises him against public opinion, saying that it is dangerous. After the Archbishop arrives to inform Louis of Notre Dame's attack and that Esmeralda is innocent, Louis demands to know who the real murderer is, to which Frollo confesses his crime to Louis and walks away, leaving Louis shocked. Louis orders Olivier to arrest Frollo and then talks to Gringoire after reading his pamphlet.\n\nMeanwhile, Quasimodo and the guards of Paris fight off Clopin and the  beggars. Afterwards, he sees Frollo in the bell tower seeking to harm Esmeralda, and when he comes up, Frollo tries to stop him. Frollo then attempts to kill Quasimodo with a dagger, but Quasimodo, realizing Frollo's evil nature, stops him and in defense for himself and Esmeralda he throws Frollo off the cathedral top, sending him down to his death. Later that morning, Esmeralda is pardoned by the King and freed from hanging due to the success of Gringoire's pamphlet. Her Gypsy people are also finally freed. Then, she comes to truly love Gringoire and leaves with him and a huge cheering crowd out of the public square. Quasimodo sees all this from high on the cathedral and says sadly to a gargoyle, \"Why was I not made of stone, like thee?\".\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Maureen O'Hara as Esmerelda 2.jpg|thumb|260px|right|[[Maureen O'Hara]] as Esmeralda]]\n* [[Charles Laughton]] as [[Quasimodo]]\n* [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] as Jehan Frollo\n* [[Thomas Mitchell (actor)|Thomas Mitchell]] as [[Clopin Trouillefou|Clopin]]\n* [[Maureen O'Hara]] as [[Esmeralda (The Hunchback of Notre Dame)|Esmeralda]]\n* [[Edmond O'Brien]] as [[Pierre Gringoire]]\n* [[Alan Marshal (actor)|Alan Marshal]] as [[Captain Phoebus]]\n* [[Walter Hampden]] as Archbishop [[Claude Frollo]]\n* [[Harry Davenport (actor)|Harry Davenport]] as [[Louis XI of France|King Louis XI]]\n* [[Katharine Alexander]] as Madame de Lys\n* [[George Zucco]] as Procurator\n* [[Fritz Leiber (actor)|Fritz Leiber]] as Old nobleman\n* [[Etienne Girardot]] as Doctor\n* [[Helene Whitney]] as Fleur de Lys\n* [[Mina Gombell]] as Queen of beggars\n* [[Arthur Hohl]] as [[Olivier le Daim|Olivier]]\n* [[Curt Bois]] as Student\n* [[George Tobias]] as Beggar\n* [[Rod La Rocque]] as Phillippe\n* [[Spencer Charters]] as Court clerk\n* [[Kathryn Adams Doty|Kathryn Adams]] as Fleur's companion\n* Dianne Hunter as Fleur's companion\n* [[Sig Arno|Siegfried Arno]] as Tailor\n* [[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]] as Monk (uncredited)\n* [[Rondo Hatton]] as Ugly Man (uncredited)\n\n==Production==\nIn 1932, it was reported by ''The Hollywood Reporter'' that Universal announced that it would remake the 1923 ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' film with [[John Huston]] writing a script and that [[Boris Karloff]] would play Quasimodo.<ref>{{cite book | first = Allen | last = Cohen | author2 = Harry Lawton | title = John Huston: A Guide to References and Resources | publisher = GK Hall | year= 1997| isbn= 9780816116195}}</ref>\n\n[[Irving Thalberg]], who was an uncredited producer in the 1923 film, considered remaking the film in 1934 and even discussed the idea with [[Charles Laughton]].
