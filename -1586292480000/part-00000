Carter noted that \"[[Verdana]] and Georgia... were all about binary [[bitmap]]s: every pixel was on or off, black or white... The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds, because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels. That is a bigger jump in weight than is conventional in print series.\"<ref name=\"Matthew Carter MyFonts interview\" /> Given these unusual design decisions, [[Matthew Butterick]], an expert on document design, recommended that organizations using Georgia for onscreen display license Miller to achieve a complementary, more balanced reading experience on paper.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Butterick |first1=Matthew |title=Miller |url=http://typographyforlawyers.com/miller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318145010/http://typographyforlawyers.com/miller.html |archive-date=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Miller |url=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller/ |publisher=Font Bureau |accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Georgia typeface is similar to [[Times New Roman]], another re-imagination of transitional serif designs, but as a design for screen display it has a larger x-height and fewer fine details.

It was intended as a serif typeface that would appear elegant but legible printed small or on low-resolution screens. The typeface is inspired by [[Scotch Roman]] designs of the 19th century and was based on designs for a print typeface in the same style Carter was working on when contacted by Microsoft; this would be released under the name [[Miller (typeface)|Miller]] the following year.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Connare |first1=Vincent |title=Comments on Typophile thread... |url=http://typophile.com/node/75410 |website=Typophile}}</ref>  The typeface's name referred to a [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headline \"Alien heads found in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]\".<ref>[http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/font-descriptions Typeface Descriptions & Histories]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424000832/http://web.nickshanks.com/typography/font-descriptions |date=April 24, 2015 }}.</ref>\n\n==Design==\nAs a transitional serif design, Georgia shows a number of traditional features of \"rational\" serif typefaces from around the early 19th century, such as alternating thick and thin strokes, [[ball terminal]]s and a vertical axis. Speaking in 2013 about the development of Georgia and Miller, Carter said: \"I was familiar with Scotch romans, puzzled by the fact that they were once so popular... and then they disappeared completely.\"<ref name=\"Matthew Carter MyFonts interview\">{{cite web |last1=Middendorp |first1=Jan |title=Matthew Carter interview |url=http://www.myfonts.com/newsletters/cc/201310.html |website=MyFonts |publisher=Monotype |accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref> Its figure (numeral) designs are lower-case, or [[text figures]], designed to blend into continuous text; this was at the time a rare feature in computer fonts.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniels |first1=Simon |title=Forum thread |url=http://typophile.com/node/63979 |website=Typophile |accessdate=12 December 2014}}</ref>\n\nCloser inspection, however, shows how Georgia was designed for clarity on a computer monitor even at small sizes.<ref name=\"Set on the Web-part 2\">{{cite web |last1=Yan |first1=Jack |authorlink1=Jack Yan |title=Set on the Web, part\u00a02 |url=http://jyanet.com/cap/0131fe2.htm |publisher=Jack Yan & Associates |accessdate=18 November 2017}}</ref> It features a large [[x-height]] (tall lower-case letters), and its thin strokes are thicker than would be common on a typeface designed for display use or the greater sharpness possible in print.<ref>[http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm \"Georgia & Verdana: Typefaces designed for the screen (finally)\"]. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130828210842/http://www.will-harris.com/verdana-georgia.htm |date=2013-08-28 }}, by Daniel Will-Harris, accessed 24 November 2005.</ref><ref>Friedl, Friedrich, Nicolaus Ott and Bernard Stein.

Carter noted that \"[[Verdana]] and Georgia... were all about binary [[bitmap]]s: every pixel was on or off, black or white... The bold versions of Verdana and Georgia are bolder than most bolds, because on the screen, at the time we were doing this in the mid-1990s, if the stem wanted to be thicker than one pixel, it could only go to two pixels. That is a bigger jump in weight than is conventional in print series.\"<ref name=\"Matthew Carter MyFonts interview\" /> Given these unusual design decisions, [[Matthew Butterick]], an expert on document design, recommended that organizations using Georgia for onscreen display license Miller to achieve a complementary, more balanced reading experience on paper.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Butterick |first1=Matthew |title=Miller |url=http://typographyforlawyers.com/miller.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318145010/http://typographyforlawyers.com/miller.html |archive-date=18 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Miller |url=http://www.fontbureau.com/fonts/Miller/ |publisher=Font Bureau |accessdate=11 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Georgia typeface is similar to [[Times New Roman]], another re-imagination of transitional serif designs, but as a design for screen display it has a larger x-height and fewer fine details. The ''[[The New York Times]]'' changed its standard font from Times New Roman to Georgia in 2007.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/ref/membercenter/help/OurRedesignfaq.html#h |title=What did you do to the font?

According to [[Thomas Curson Hansard]], these were cut by London-based [[punchcutting|punchcutter]] [[Richard Austin (punchcutter)|Richard Austin]].

This made it a popular choice for web designers, as pages specifying Georgia as a font choice would display identically on both types if users installed the core fonts package (or later Internet Explorer), simplifying development and testing.

He was [[Prime Minister (Denmark)|Prime Minister]] from 1962 to 1968 and again from 1971 to 1972. He was President of the [[Nordic Council]] in 1971.\n\n== Early life and political career ==\nKrag was born in [[Randers]], [[Denmark]]. He joined the [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Danish Social Democratic Party]] youth organization in 1930 and rose through the ranks of the party. In the 1930s he moved to [[Copenhagen]] and studied economics at the [[University of Copenhagen]] while remaining very active in the party.\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he was Danish supply director and advisor to the labor unions on economic matters. He was elected to Parliament ([[Folketinget]]) in 1947 and became [[Commerce Minister (Denmark)|Commerce Minister]]. He supported the strengthening of the Danish military and Danish membership of [[NATO]] in 1949.\n\nIn 1950 Krag resigned from Parliament partially due to a conflict with [[Vilhelm Buhl]] and [[H. C.

He was minister of the new department of foreign economic affairs from 1953 until 1958 and [[Foreign Minister (Denmark)|Foreign Minister]] from 1958 until 1962.\n\n== As Prime Minister ==\n\nIn September 1962 he succeeded [[Viggo Kampmann]] as [[Prime Minister (Denmark)|Prime Minister]] and leader of the Danish Social Democratic Party. He was Prime Minister until February 1968 when the [[Social Democrats]] lost power. He became Prime Minister again in 1971 when his party returned to power.\n\nLess than a year into his first term as prime minister, the opposition [[1963 Danish land laws referendum|held a referendum]] which rejected a set of [[land law]]s already passed by Krag's government.\n\nDuring his second term as Prime Minister, Krag campaigned particularly for European cooperation and unity.<ref name=Skou /> He sponsored a [[1972 Danish European Communities membership referendum|referendum for Denmark to join the European Economic Community]]. In 1972 the referendum passed, but the nation was divided over the issue, and Krag resigned, claiming that he had become tired of politics. His last role in public life was as the European Common Market representative to the United States from 1974 until 1975.\n\nIn social policy, a number of progressive reforms were implemented during Krag's time as Prime Minister. Under the New Care of Children and Juveniles Act of May 1964, local child and juvenile welfare committees were authorized to grant cash benefits to certain families with children, to avoid placing children in the care of the Municipal Social Welfare Offices. New criteria for day-care institutions stressing social, educational, and therapeutic aspects were also introduced, and municipalities were obliged to provide facilities for day-care and other related services. Under the Employment Service and Unemployment Insurance Act of February 1967, unemployment benefits were raised and indexed to the official wage index and waiting times were abolished. In addition, an accident insurance act of December 1964 indexed benefits. The Basic Education Act of April 1972 extended compulsory basic education from 7 to 9 years.<ref>Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II, Volume 4 edited by Peter Flora</ref> while A law passed in June 1972 introduced a new scheme for daily cash benefits in cases of sickness and maternity.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II|author=Flora, P.|date=1986|volume=3|publisher=W. de Gruyter|isbn=9783110111330|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=F16VaIYewIEC&pg=PA203|page=203|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> In 1964, a supplementary pension scheme was established,<ref name=\"google2\">{{cite book|title=Welfare State Futures|author1=Leibfried, S.|author2=Bonoli, G.|date=2001|issue=no. 3; no. 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521005128|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sDS1oA553pcC&pg=PA97|page=97|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref> together with universal child allowances in 1967.<ref name=\"google3\">{{cite book|title=Welfare States and Immigrant Rights: The Politics of Inclusion and Exclusion|author=Sainsbury, D.|date=2012|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199654789|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bTwFGEqfK-IC&pg=PA106|page=106|accessdate=8 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n== Private life and legacy ==\n\nKrag is widely recognised as one of the greatest politicians of all time in Denmark.<ref name=Skou /> He was in the front line of politics for 25 years, holding high ministerial offices for most of that time. He managed to raise Denmark's profile on the world stage, striking up strong relationships with fellow European leaders as well as American presidents Kennedy and Johnson. His list of political achievements is also one of the most impressive, overseeing one of the longest periods of economic expansion in Danish history. However, his largest achievement, and the one he himself was most proud of, was taking Denmark into the [[European Economic Community]] in 1973. With that task accomplished he felt he could retire at a high point.\n\nKrag was at one and the same time one of the most charismatic and withdrawn Danish politicians ever. He never enjoyed the attention to which he had to subject himself, and many people found him rather arrogant. According to his most thorough (and quite sympathetic) biographer ([[Bo Lidegaard]], ''Krag I-II'', 2001/2002) he never truly settled into the role as a politician, always considering himself on the way 'to somewhere else'.<ref name=Lidegaard>Lidegaard, Bo (2001). ''Jens Otto Krag - 1914\u20131961'' {{in lang|da}}. Gyldendal. {{ISBN|978-87-02-02203-2}}.</ref> He had always of dreamed of holding the position of governor of the [[Danmarks Nationalbank|National Bank of Denmark]]. Only when he had definitively quit politics in 1972 did he realise that he would not be able to achieve this goal.\n\nKrag had a difficult private life. He was married twice and had a son (Jens Christian born 1960) and a daughter, Astrid Helene \"S\u00f8sser\" (1962\u20132014), by his second wife, the famous actress [[Helle Virkner]], but also another child outside of wedlock. Both his marriages ended in divorce, largely due to his own infidelity. During his time in politics, he already struggled with alcoholism, an addiction that became more pronounced after his retirement. He died of heart failure in [[Skiveren]], [[Denmark]] at the age of 63.\n\nHe was an atheist.<ref>Politiken, \"Folkekirken har brug for frisind\", August 19, 2012. \"De socialdemokratiske statsministre Stauning, Hedtoft, H.C. Hansen og J. O. Krag var ateister og ikke medlemmer af folkekirken\". \"The Danish prime ministers Stauning, Hedtoft, H.C. Hansen and J.O.

With that task accomplished he felt he could retire at a high point.\n\nKrag was at one and the same time one of the most charismatic and withdrawn Danish politicians ever. He never enjoyed the attention to which he had to subject himself, and many people found him rather arrogant. According to his most thorough (and quite sympathetic) biographer ([[Bo Lidegaard]], ''Krag I-II'', 2001/2002) he never truly settled into the role as a politician, always considering himself on the way 'to somewhere else'.<ref name=Lidegaard>Lidegaard, Bo (2001). ''Jens Otto Krag - 1914\u20131961'' {{in lang|da}}. Gyldendal. {{ISBN|978-87-02-02203-2}}.</ref> He had always of dreamed of holding the position of governor of the [[Danmarks Nationalbank|National Bank of Denmark]]. Only when he had definitively quit politics in 1972 did he realise that he would not be able to achieve this goal.\n\nKrag had a difficult private life. He was married twice and had a son (Jens Christian born 1960) and a daughter, Astrid Helene \"S\u00f8sser\" (1962\u20132014), by his second wife, the famous actress [[Helle Virkner]], but also another child outside of wedlock. Both his marriages ended in divorce, largely due to his own infidelity. During his time in politics, he already struggled with alcoholism, an addiction that became more pronounced after his retirement. He died of heart failure in [[Skiveren]], [[Denmark]] at the age of 63.\n\nHe was an atheist.<ref>Politiken, \"Folkekirken har brug for frisind\", August 19, 2012. \"De socialdemokratiske statsministre Stauning, Hedtoft, H.C. Hansen og J. O. Krag var ateister og ikke medlemmer af folkekirken\". \"The Danish prime ministers Stauning, Hedtoft, H.C. Hansen and J.O. Krag were atheists and not members of the Church of Denmark\".</ref>\n\nIn the Danish TV series ''[[Kr\u00f8niken]]'' (2004\u20132006) he was portrayed by the actor [[Lars Mikkelsen]].<ref>[http://www.dr.dk/kroeniken/kroeniken/persongalleri/bipersoner.asp Kr\u00f8niken] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130416163159/http://www.dr.dk/kroeniken/kroeniken/persongalleri/bipersoner.asp |date=2013-04-16 }} - DR.dk. {{in lang|da}} Retrieved 13 February 2012.</ref><ref name=\"Hjort2011\">{{cite book|author=Mette Hjort|title=Lone Scherfig's Italian for Beginners|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ABATCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA14|date=1 September 2011|publisher=University of Washington Press|isbn=978-0-295-80196-4|pages=14}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Wilsford, David, ed.
