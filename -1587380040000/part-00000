During this time, it was generally applied to people of the southern regions thought to be descendants of the San Miao kingdom (dated to around the 3rd millennium BC.) The term does not appear again until the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), by which time it had taken on the connotation of \"barbarian.\" Being a variation of [[Nanman]], it was used to refer to one kind of indigenous people in the southern China who had not been assimilated into Han culture. During this time, references to Unfamiliar (''\u751f Sheng'') and Familiar (''\u719f Shu'') Miao appear, referring to level of assimilation and political cooperation of the two groups. Not until the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131911) do more finely grained distinctions appear in writing. Even then, discerning which ethnic groups are included in various classifications can be problematic.<ref name = \"Diamond\">Diamond, Norma \"Defining the Miao: Ming, Qing, and Contemporary Views\" in Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers, ed.

Furthermore, the bill called for the use of oral histories and first hand accounts from Hmong people who had participated in the war and who were caught up in the aftermath. Originally, the language of the bill mentioned only \"Hmong\" people, intending to include the entire community. A number of Mong Leng activists, led by Dr. [[Paoze Thao]] (Professor of Linguistics and Education at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]]), drew attention to the problems associated with omitting \"Mong\" from the language of the bill. They noted that despite nearly equal numbers of Hmong Der and Mong Leng in the United States, resources are disproportionately directed toward the Hmong Der community. This includes not only scholarly research, but also the translation of materials, potentially including curriculum proposed by the bill.<ref>Romney, Lee. \"[http://www.mongfederation.org/articles/latimes.htm Bill spurs bitter debate over Hmong identity]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}.\" L.A.

In the version that passed the assembly, \"Hmong\" was replaced by \"Southeast Asians\", a more broadly inclusive term.\n\nDr. Paoze Thao and some others feel strongly that \"Hmong\" can refer to only Hmong Der people and does not include \"Mong\" Leng people.

The term was later adopted by [[Tai languages|Tai]]-speaking groups in Southeast Asia where it took on especially insulting associations for Hmong people despite its official status.<ref>Tapp. Nicholas. \"Cultural Accommodations in Southwest China: the \"Han Miao\" and Problems in the Ethnography of the Hmong.\" Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 61, 2002: 97.</ref>\n\nIn modern China, the term \"Miao\" does not carry these negative associations and people of the various sub-groups that constitute this officially recognized nationality freely identify themselves as Miao or Chinese, typically reserving more specific [[Ethnonym|ethnonyms]] for intra-ethnic communication. During the struggle for political recognition after 1949, it was actually members of these ethnic minorities who campaigned for identification under the umbrella term \"Miao\"\u2014taking advantage of its familiarity and associations of historical political oppression.<ref>Cheung Siu-Woo \"Miao Identity in Western Guizhou: Indigenism and the politics of appropriation in the southwest china during the republican period\" in Hmong or Miao in Asia. 237\u2013240.</ref>\n\nContemporary transnational interactions between Hmong in the West and Miao groups in China, following the 1975 Hmong diaspora, have led to the development of a global Hmong identity that includes linguistically and culturally related minorities in China that previously had no ethnic affiliation.<ref>Schien, Louisa. \"Hmong/Miao Transnationality: Identity Beyond Culture.\" in Hmong or Miao in Asia. 274\u20135.</ref> Scholarly and commercial exchanges, increasingly communicated via the Internet, have also resulted in an exchange of terminology, including Hmu and A Hmao people identifying as Hmong and, to a lesser extent, Hmong people accepting the designation \"Miao,\" within the context of China.

After the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh|Viet Minh]] victory, numerous pro-French Hmong had to fall back to Laos and [[South Vietnam]].<ref>Michaud J. 2000 The Montagnards and the State in Northern Vietnam from 1802 to 1975: A Historical Overview.

The traditional trade in coffin wood with China and the cultivation of the [[Opium Poppy|opium poppy]] \u2013 both prohibited only in 1993 in Vietnam \u2013 long guaranteed a regular cash income. Today, converting to [[cash crop]]ping is the main economic activity. As in China and Laos, there is a certain degree of participation of Hmong in the local and regional administration.<ref>Bonnin, Christine 2011, Markets in the Mountains: Exploring Geographies of Market Exchange, Trade Practices and Trader Livelihoods in Upland Northern Vietnam.

Hmong settlement there is nearly as ancient as in Vietnam. After decades of distant relations with the Lao kingdoms, closer relations between the French military and some Hmong on the Xieng Khouang plateau were set up after [[World War II]]. There, a particular rivalry between members of the Lo and Ly clans developed into open enmity, also affecting those connected with them by kinship. Clan leaders took opposite sides and as a consequence, several thousand Hmong participated in the fighting against the [[Lao Communist Party|Pathet Lao Communists]], while perhaps as many were enrolled in the [[People's Liberation Army]]. As in Vietnam, numerous Hmong in Laos also genuinely tried to avoid getting involved in the conflict in spite of the extremely difficult material conditions under which they lived during wartime.<ref>Michaud, J. et al. 2016 The Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif. Rowman & Littlefield, pp.177-180.</ref>\n\nAfter the 1975 Communist victory, thousands of Hmong from Laos had to seek refuge abroad (see Laos below). Approximately 30 percent of the Hmong left, although the only concrete figure we have is that of 116,000 Hmong from Laos and Vietnam together seeking refuge in Thailand up to 1990.<ref>Culas and Michaud 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the Hmong in Thailand numbered 151,080. The presence of Hmong settlements there is documented from the end of the 19th century. Initially, the [[Siamese people|Siamese]] paid little attention to them. But in the early 1950s, the state suddenly took a number of initiatives aimed at establishing links. Decolonization and nationalism were gaining momentum in the Peninsula and wars of independence were raging. Armed opposition to the state in northern Thailand, triggered by outside influence, started in 1967 while here again, much Hmong refused to take sides in the conflict. Communist [[guerrilla warfare]] stopped by 1982 as a result of an international concurrence of events that rendered it pointless. Priority is since given by the Thai state to sedentarizing the mountain population, introducing commercially viable agricultural techniques and national education, with the aim of integrating these non-Tai animists within the national identity.<ref>Tapp, Nicholas, 1989 ''Sovereignty and Rebellion''.

By the same date, 10,000 Hmong had migrated to France, including 1,400 in [[French Guiana|French Guyana]]. [[Canada]] admitted 900 individuals, while another 360 went to [[Australia]], 260 to [[China]], and 250 to [[Argentina]].

Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum at that time under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act|Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975]]. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had immigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's secret army. It was not until the passage of the [[Refugee Act of 1980]] that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California and Minnesota. Today, 260,073 Hmong people reside in the United States<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">[https://www.census.gov ]</ref> the majority of whom live in California (91,224), Minnesota (66,181), and Wisconsin (49,240), an increase from 186,310 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Census Bureau Homepage |publisher=Census.gov |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref> Of them, 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity or race.

During this time, it was generally applied to people of the southern regions thought to be descendants of the San Miao kingdom (dated to around the 3rd millennium BC.) The term does not appear again until the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368\u20131644), by which time it had taken on the connotation of \"barbarian.\" Being a variation of [[Nanman]], it was used to refer to one kind of indigenous people in the southern China who had not been assimilated into Han culture. During this time, references to Unfamiliar (''\u751f Sheng'') and Familiar (''\u719f Shu'') Miao appear, referring to level of assimilation and political cooperation of the two groups. Not until the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644\u20131911) do more finely grained distinctions appear in writing. Even then, discerning which ethnic groups are included in various classifications can be problematic.<ref name = \"Diamond\">Diamond, Norma \"Defining the Miao: Ming, Qing, and Contemporary Views\" in Cultural Encounters on China's Ethnic Frontiers, ed.

Furthermore, the bill called for the use of oral histories and first hand accounts from Hmong people who had participated in the war and who were caught up in the aftermath. Originally, the language of the bill mentioned only \"Hmong\" people, intending to include the entire community. A number of Mong Leng activists, led by Dr. [[Paoze Thao]] (Professor of Linguistics and Education at [[California State University, Monterey Bay]]), drew attention to the problems associated with omitting \"Mong\" from the language of the bill. They noted that despite nearly equal numbers of Hmong Der and Mong Leng in the United States, resources are disproportionately directed toward the Hmong Der community. This includes not only scholarly research, but also the translation of materials, potentially including curriculum proposed by the bill.<ref>Romney, Lee. \"[http://www.mongfederation.org/articles/latimes.htm Bill spurs bitter debate over Hmong identity]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}.\" L.A.

In the version that passed the assembly, \"Hmong\" was replaced by \"Southeast Asians\", a more broadly inclusive term.\n\nDr. Paoze Thao and some others feel strongly that \"Hmong\" can refer to only Hmong Der people and does not include \"Mong\" Leng people.

The term was later adopted by [[Tai languages|Tai]]-speaking groups in Southeast Asia where it took on especially insulting associations for Hmong people despite its official status.<ref>Tapp. Nicholas. \"Cultural Accommodations in Southwest China: the \"Han Miao\" and Problems in the Ethnography of the Hmong.\" Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 61, 2002: 97.</ref>\n\nIn modern China, the term \"Miao\" does not carry these negative associations and people of the various sub-groups that constitute this officially recognized nationality freely identify themselves as Miao or Chinese, typically reserving more specific [[Ethnonym|ethnonyms]] for intra-ethnic communication. During the struggle for political recognition after 1949, it was actually members of these ethnic minorities who campaigned for identification under the umbrella term \"Miao\"\u2014taking advantage of its familiarity and associations of historical political oppression.<ref>Cheung Siu-Woo \"Miao Identity in Western Guizhou: Indigenism and the politics of appropriation in the southwest china during the republican period\" in Hmong or Miao in Asia. 237\u2013240.</ref>\n\nContemporary transnational interactions between Hmong in the West and Miao groups in China, following the 1975 Hmong diaspora, have led to the development of a global Hmong identity that includes linguistically and culturally related minorities in China that previously had no ethnic affiliation.<ref>Schien, Louisa. \"Hmong/Miao Transnationality: Identity Beyond Culture.\" in Hmong or Miao in Asia. 274\u20135.</ref> Scholarly and commercial exchanges, increasingly communicated via the Internet, have also resulted in an exchange of terminology, including Hmu and A Hmao people identifying as Hmong and, to a lesser extent, Hmong people accepting the designation \"Miao,\" within the context of China.

After the [[Vi\u1ec7t Minh|Viet Minh]] victory, numerous pro-French Hmong had to fall back to Laos and [[South Vietnam]].<ref>Michaud J. 2000 The Montagnards and the State in Northern Vietnam from 1802 to 1975: A Historical Overview.

The traditional trade in coffin wood with China and the cultivation of the [[Opium Poppy|opium poppy]] \u2013 both prohibited only in 1993 in Vietnam \u2013 long guaranteed a regular cash income. Today, converting to [[cash crop]]ping is the main economic activity. As in China and Laos, there is a certain degree of participation of Hmong in the local and regional administration.<ref>Bonnin, Christine 2011, Markets in the Mountains: Exploring Geographies of Market Exchange, Trade Practices and Trader Livelihoods in Upland Northern Vietnam.

Hmong settlement there is nearly as ancient as in Vietnam. After decades of distant relations with the Lao kingdoms, closer relations between the French military and some Hmong on the Xieng Khouang plateau were set up after [[World War II]]. There, a particular rivalry between members of the Lo and Ly clans developed into open enmity, also affecting those connected with them by kinship. Clan leaders took opposite sides and as a consequence, several thousand Hmong participated in the fighting against the [[Lao Communist Party|Pathet Lao Communists]], while perhaps as many were enrolled in the [[People's Liberation Army]]. As in Vietnam, numerous Hmong in Laos also genuinely tried to avoid getting involved in the conflict in spite of the extremely difficult material conditions under which they lived during wartime.<ref>Michaud, J. et al. 2016 The Historical Dictionary of the Peoples of the Southeast Asian Massif. Rowman & Littlefield, pp.177-180.</ref>\n\nAfter the 1975 Communist victory, thousands of Hmong from Laos had to seek refuge abroad (see Laos below). Approximately 30 percent of the Hmong left, although the only concrete figure we have is that of 116,000 Hmong from Laos and Vietnam together seeking refuge in Thailand up to 1990.<ref>Culas and Michaud 2004</ref>\n\nIn 2002 the Hmong in Thailand numbered 151,080. The presence of Hmong settlements there is documented from the end of the 19th century. Initially, the [[Siamese people|Siamese]] paid little attention to them. But in the early 1950s, the state suddenly took a number of initiatives aimed at establishing links. Decolonization and nationalism were gaining momentum in the Peninsula and wars of independence were raging. Armed opposition to the state in northern Thailand, triggered by outside influence, started in 1967 while here again, much Hmong refused to take sides in the conflict. Communist [[guerrilla warfare]] stopped by 1982 as a result of an international concurrence of events that rendered it pointless. Priority is since given by the Thai state to sedentarizing the mountain population, introducing commercially viable agricultural techniques and national education, with the aim of integrating these non-Tai animists within the national identity.<ref>Tapp, Nicholas, 1989 ''Sovereignty and Rebellion''.

By the same date, 10,000 Hmong had migrated to France, including 1,400 in [[French Guiana|French Guyana]]. [[Canada]] admitted 900 individuals, while another 360 went to [[Australia]], 260 to [[China]], and 250 to [[Argentina]].

While some ended up in refugee camps, others settled in mountainous areas among more ancient [[Hill tribe (Thailand)|Hill Tribes]].<ref name=\"Baird 2013 120\u2013151\">{{cite book|last=Baird|first=Ian G.|title=The monks and the Hmong: The special relationship between the Chao Fa and the Tham Krabok Buddhist Temple in Saraburi Province, Thailand.

Beginning in December 1975, the first Hmong refugees arrived in the U.S., mainly from refugee camps in Thailand; however, only 3,466 were granted asylum at that time under the [[Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act|Indochina Migration and Refugee Assistance Act of 1975]]. In May 1976, another 11,000 were allowed to enter the United States, and by 1978 some 30,000 Hmong people had immigrated. This first wave was made up predominantly of men directly associated with General Vang Pao's secret army. It was not until the passage of the [[Refugee Act of 1980]] that families were able to enter the U.S., becoming the second wave of Hmong immigrants. Hmong families scattered across all 50 states but most found their way to each other, building large communities in California and Minnesota. Today, 260,073 Hmong people reside in the United States<ref name=\"wwwcensusgov\">[https://www.census.gov ]</ref> the majority of whom live in California (91,224), Minnesota (66,181), and Wisconsin (49,240), an increase from 186,310 in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov |title=Census Bureau Homepage |publisher=Census.gov |date=2012-05-25 |accessdate=2012-06-08}}</ref> Of them, 247,595 or 95.2% are Hmong alone, and the remaining 12,478 are mixed Hmong with some other ethnicity or race.

Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see [[#Common types|Common types]] below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is changed by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A piece's texture may be changed by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used {{harv|Benward & Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2015}}}}. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody (PM), secondary melody (SM), parallel supporting melody (PSM), static support (SS), harmonic support (HS), rhythmic support (RS), and harmonic and rhythmic support (HRS) {{harv|Isaac & Russell|2003|p=136}}.\n\n==Common types==\nIn musical terms, particularly in the fields of music history and music analysis, some common terms for different types of texture are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Multiple voices of which one, the melody, stands out prominently and the others form a background of harmonic accompaniment. If all the parts have much the same rhythm, the homophonic texture can also be described as homorhythmic. Characteristic texture of the [[Classical music|Classical period]] and continued to predominate in [[Romantic music]] while in the 20th century, \"popular music is nearly all homophonic,\" and, \"much of jazz is also\" though, \"the simultaneous improvisations of some jazz musicians creates a true polyphony\" {{harv|Benward & Saker|2003|p=136}}.

There are three parts, the top two moving in parallel (interval of a tenth). The lowest part imitates the rhythm of the upper two at the distance of three beats.

Texture is often described in regard to the density, or thickness, and [[range (music)|range]], or width, between lowest and highest pitches, in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices, or parts, and the relationship between these voices (see [[#Common types|Common types]] below). For example, a thick texture contains many 'layers' of instruments. One of these layers could be a string section, or another brass. The thickness also is changed by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece. The thickness varies from light to thick. A piece's texture may be changed by the number and character of parts playing at once, the [[timbre]] of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony, [[tempo]], and rhythms used {{harv|Benward & Saker|2003|loc={{Page needed|date=August 2015}}}}. The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements: primary melody (PM), secondary melody (SM), parallel supporting melody (PSM), static support (SS), harmonic support (HS), rhythmic support (RS), and harmonic and rhythmic support (HRS) {{harv|Isaac & Russell|2003|p=136}}.\n\n==Common types==\nIn musical terms, particularly in the fields of music history and music analysis, some common terms for different types of texture are:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Characteristic texture of the [[Classical music|Classical period]] and continued to predominate in [[Romantic music]] while in the 20th century, \"popular music is nearly all homophonic,\" and, \"much of jazz is also\" though, \"the simultaneous improvisations of some jazz musicians creates a true polyphony\" {{harv|Benward & Saker|2003|p=136}}.

In English and Scots history, Anna Throndsen is best known for her marriage to [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]]<ref>Evans, Humphrey (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=CgEhAAAAMAAJ&pgis=1 The Queen's Man: James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell and Duke of Orkney, 1536-1578], University of Michigan</ref> (which later earned her the nickname ''Skottefruen'' (''\"The Scottish Lady\"''), a man who later married [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. Anna Throndsen is also known for her possible but much debated and disputed involvement in drafting some of the famous [[Casket Letters]]; these letters being the principal evidence against Mary.\n\n==Background==\n\nAnna was the eldest daughter of [[Kristoffer Throndsen]], a famous 16th-century Norwegian admiral, nobleman and wartime privateer (pirate).  During the final years of independent Norway, 1532\u20131536, Kristoffer served as admiral of the Norwegian fleet, in the service of his cousin, [[Olav Engelbrektsson]], the last archbishop of Norway.  Some years after Norway's political subsumption by Denmark, in 1539, Kristoffer was appointed to serve King [[Frederick II of Denmark and Norway|Frederick II]] as a Naval commander.  He served as an admiral in the Danish fleet, then as Danish Royal Consul in Copenhagen.  Kristoffer took his Norwegian family, including Anna, to Copenhagen at this time.  As a young woman, Anna assisted her father in consular affairs in the Danish capital.\n\n==Marriage to James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell==\n\nAnna was married to Bothwell,<ref>Schiern, Frederik E.A.(2009)Nyere Historiske Studier, Biblio Bazaar LLC</ref> by [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|handfasting]], while he was doing business in Denmark.  The marriage was considered legitimate under Dano-Norwegian law,<ref name=\"Gjerset\">Gjerset, Knut Ph.D (1915) [https://archive.org/stream/historyofnorwegi02gjeruoft/historyofnorwegi02gjeruoft_djvu.txt  History of the Norwegian People.] MacMillan & Co.</ref> but was, and is still, treated as dubious or invalid, by English and Scots historians. For this reason, most English books refer to her, incorrectly, as a \"mistress\", or jilted lover.  Anna's later Bergen lawsuit against Bothwell (ca. 1570), which held him to account for wrongful behaviour as a husband, as well as writings of the Scots Earl of Moray, lend credence to the fact that a marriage did transpire.\n\nA notorious scoundrel, Bothwell married another woman, [[Jean Gordon, Countess of Bothwell|Lady Jean Gordon]], in France, shortly after marrying her,<ref name=\"books.google.com\">MacRobert, A.

While in Scotland, Anna was frustrated and unhappy.  She was rumoured to have borne a child, this possibly being William, the only son of Bothwell.  In the mid-1560s, she left Scotland to return to her family; her mother and siblings had returned to Norway on her father's death.  Shortly thereafter, Bothwell proceeded to marry Mary Stuart, Queen of Scots, after having allegedly murdered her husband, [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley]].\n[[File:Rosenkrantz Tower in Bergen.jpg|thumb|[[Rosenkrantz Tower|The Rosenkrantz Tower]] in Bergen, where James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell, was imprisoned, during his court case with Anna, his former wife]]\nBothwell met his demise through a chance reunion with Anna in Bergen, Norway.<ref>T.

Elizabeth I was calling for Bothwell's extradition back to Scotland to stand trial for the murder of Darnley, Elizabeth's cousin. Rather than turn him over to England, the Danish King transferred Bothwell to [[Dragsholm Castle]] where he died after many years.\n\n==Possible involvement with the Casket Letters==\n\nAnna Throndsen has been connected with a set of correspondence called the [[Casket Letters]]. These letters which were found in the belongings of a servant of Bothwell, after his flight from Scotland.  These letters were used by her half-brother [[Regent Moray]] to demonstrate her involvement in the murder of her husband, Lord Darnley. The letters include sonnets and poetry. Some of this material is supposed to have been written by Anna, an idea first suggested by the novelist Robert Gore Browne in his 1937 study of Bothwell.<ref name=\"books.google.com\" />  Most British historians contest this, alleging that someone of Nordic nobility would not have had sufficient knowledge of French to draft such prose and there is no reason to connect Throndsen with the Scottish court of Mary or her enemies.

If the sum of the cards exceeds 10, its second digit is used as the score instead, and if the sum is exactly 10, the score is 1. If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced '''ya-ku-sa''' in Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making it the worst possible hand that can be drawn.<ref>[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%84%E3%81%8F%E3%81%96 \"Yakuza\" definition]. Kotobank (in Japanese)</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Japan Kyushu Region large.png|thumb|right|Throughout history, especially since the modern era, [[Kyushu]] island has been the largest source of ''yakuza'' members, including many renowned bosses in the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]].  Isokichi Yoshida (1867\u20131936) from the [[Kitakyushu]] area was considered{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} the first renowned modern ''yakuza''. Recently [[Shinobu Tsukasa]] and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of [[#Designated boryokudan|designated syndicates]] among all of the prefectures.]]\n\nDespite uncertainty about the single origin of ''yakuza'' organizations, most modern ''yakuza'' derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868): ''[[tekiya]]'', those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen, or shoddy goods; and ''[[bakuto]]'', those who were involved in or participated in gambling.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 18-21.</ref>\n\n''Tekiya'' (peddlers) ranked as one of the [[Four occupations|lowest social groups]] during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities.<ref>Joy, Alicia. \"A Brief History Of The Yakuza Organization\".

Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.\n\nThe ''tekiya'' were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the ''oyabun'' (boss) at the top and ''kobun'' (gang members) at the bottom.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\">Raz, Jacob. \"Insider Outsider: The Way of the Yakuza.\" Kyoto Journal. Last modified 17 April 2011. https://kyotojournal.org/society/insider-outsider/.</ref> This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family - the ''oyabun'' was often regarded{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as a surrogate father, and the ''kobun'' as surrogate children.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\"/> During the Edo period, the government formally recognized  the ''tekiya''. At this time, the ''oyabun'' were appointed{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as supervisors and granted near-[[samurai]] status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 22.</ref>\n\n''Bakuto'' (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan.  Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the ''bakuto'', with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the Yakuza originates from ''bakuto''; this includes the name ''Yakuza'' itself.\n\nBecause of the economic situation during the mid-period{{when?|date=March 2020}} and the predominance of the merchant class, developing Yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed Yakuza groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.{{Clarify|What \"mid-period\"? How gone from privileged merchants with swords to misfits? How did tekiya and bakuto come together?|date= March 2016}}\n\nThe roots of the Yakuza survive today in [[initiation ceremony| initiation ceremonies]], which incorporate tekiya or bakuto [[rituals]]. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as ''bakuto''.\n\n== Organization and activities ==\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Yakuza hierarchy.png|right|thumb|Yakuza hierarchy]]\nDuring the formation of the Yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where ''kobun'' (\u5b50\u5206; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the {{nihongo|''oyabun''|\u89aa\u5206||lit. foster parent}}.  In a much later period, the code of {{nihongo|''jingi''|\u4ec1\u7fa9||justice and duty}} was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life.\n\nThe oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of [[sake]] from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the Yakuza\u2014it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese [[Shinto]] weddings, and may have been a part of ''sworn brotherhood'' relationships.<ref name=\"trutv.com\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Yakuza - Oyabun-Kobun, Father-Child|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|publisher=[[truTV]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II]] period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.\n\nProspective Yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how Yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many Yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] gangs.  Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous Yakuza members come from [[Burakumin]] and ethnic Korean backgrounds.\n\nYakuza groups are headed by an ''oyabun'' or {{nihongo|''kumich\u014d''|\u7d44\u9577||family head}} who gives orders to his subordinates, the ''kobun''. In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese [[senpai]]-[[kohai|k\u014dhai]] (senior-junior) model. Members of Yakuza gangs cut their family ties and transfer their loyalty to the gang boss. They refer to each other as family members - fathers and elder and younger brothers. The Yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title {{nihongo|''ane-san''|\u59d0\u3055\u3093||older sister}}. When the 3rd [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] boss ([[Kazuo Taoka]]) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.\n\nYakuza have a complex organizational structure. There is an [[Capo di tutti capi|overall boss]] of the syndicate, the ''kumicho'', and directly beneath him are the ''saiko komon'' (senior advisor) and ''so-honbucho '' (headquarters chief). The second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] is the ''wakagashira'', who governs several gangs in a region with the help of a ''fuku-honbucho'' who is himself responsible for several gangs. The regional gangs themselves are governed by their local boss, the ''shateigashira''.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia - The Crime Library - Crime Library on truTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEach member's connection is ranked by the hierarchy of sakazuki (sake sharing). Kumicho are at the top, and control various {{nihongo|''saik\u014d-komon''|\u6700\u9ad8\u9867\u554f||senior advisors}}. The saik\u014d-komon control their own turfs in different areas or cities. They have their own underlings, including other [[underboss]]es, advisors, accountants and enforcers.\n\nThose who have received sake from oyabun are part of the immediate family and ranked in terms of elder or younger brothers. However, each kobun, in turn, can offer sakazuki as oyabun to his underling to form an affiliated organisation, which might in turn form lower ranked organizations. In the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls some 2,500 businesses and 500 Yakuza groups, there are fifth rank subsidiary organizations.<!--\n[[File:Hitokiri Ginji, Black Lagoon Vol.4.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fictional Yakuza character with typical upper-body [[irezumi|Yakuza tattoos]], from the ''[[Black Lagoon]]'' manga series.

Upon a first offense, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/ | work=CNN | title=The yakuza: Inside Japan's murky criminal underworld}}</ref>\n\nIts origin stems from the traditional way of holding a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese sword]]. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.\n\nThe idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection\u2014reducing individual action. In recent years, [[prosthetic]] fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nMany Yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their [[genitalia]]). These tattoos, known as [[irezumi]] in Japan, are still often \"hand-poked\", that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive, painful, and can take years to complete.<ref>''[[Japanorama]]'', [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], Series 2, Episode 3, first aired 21 September 2006</ref>\n\nWhen Yakuza members play [[Oicho-Kabu]] cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that Yakuza members display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Syndicates==\n{{Further|List of Yakuza syndicates}}{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Four largest syndicates===\nAlthough Yakuza membership has declined since the implementation of the Anti-[[Boryokudan]] Act in 1992, according to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)]] there are still approximately 39,100 active Yakuza members in Japan as of 2016.<ref>http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai/pdf/Police_of_Japan_2017_full_text.pdf \"Police of Japan 2017\"</ref> \nThe Yakuza does not consist of just one group, rather there are many different [[syndicate]] groups that together form one of the largest organized crime groups in the world.<ref>Johnston, Eric, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070214i1.html From rackets to real estate, yakuza multifaceted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 February 2007, p. 3.</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!

In essence, this is a specialized form of [[protection racket]]. Instead of harassing small businesses, the Yakuza harass a stockholders' meeting of a larger corporation.

Jiageya specialize in inducing holders of small real estate to sell their property so that estate companies can carry out much larger development plans. Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries.

This is in line with the idea that their activities are semi-open; theft by definition would be a covert activity. More importantly, such an act would be considered a trespass by the community. Also, Yakuza usually do not conduct the actual business operation by themselves. Core business activities such as merchandising, loan sharking or management of gambling houses are typically managed by non-Yakuza members who pay protection fees for their activities.\n\nThere is much evidence of Yakuza involvement in international crime. There are many tattooed Yakuza members imprisoned in various Asian prisons for such crimes as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1997, one verified Yakuza member was caught smuggling 4 kilograms (8.82 pounds) of [[heroin]] into Canada.\n\nBecause of their history as a legitimate feudal organization and their connection to the Japanese political system through the ''[[uyoku dantai]]'' (extreme right-wing political groups), Yakuza are somewhat a part of the Japanese establishment, with six [[fan magazine]]s reporting on their activities.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-yakuzas-ties-to-the-japanese-right-wing-000 | work=Vice Today | title=The Yakuza's Ties to the Japanese Right Wing}}</ref> Yakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/the-yakuza-lobby/ | work=Foreign Policy | title=The Yakuza Lobby}}</ref> One study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the Yakuza should be allowed to exist.{{r|adelstein20110318}} In the 1980s in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], a Yakuza war spiraled out of control and civilians were hurt. It was a large conflict between the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and [[Dojin-kai]], called the ''Yama-Michi War''. The police stepped in and forced the Yakuza bosses on both sides to declare a truce in public.\n\nAt various times, people in Japanese cities have launched anti-Yakuza campaigns with mixed and varied success. In March 1995, the Japanese government passed the ''Act for Prevention of Unlawful Activities by Criminal Gang Members'', which made traditional [[racketeering]] much more difficult. Beginning in 2009, led by agency chief [[Takaharu Ando]], Japanese police began to crack down on the gangs. [[Kodo-kai]] chief [[Kiyoshi Takayama]] was arrested in late 2010. In December 2010, police arrested Yamaguchi-gumi's alleged number three leader, [[Tadashi Irie]]. According to the media, encouraged by tougher anti-Yakuza laws and legislation, local governments and construction companies have begun to shun or ban Yakuza activities or involvement in their communities or construction projects.<ref>Zeller, Frank ([[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]-[[Jiji Press|Jiji]]), \"Yakuza served notice days of looking the other way are over,\" ''[[Japan Times]]'', 26 January 2011, p. 3.</ref> The police are handicapped, however, by Japan's lack of an equivalent to [[plea bargaining]], [[witness protection]], or the United States' [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].{{r|adelstein}} Laws were enacted in Osaka and Tokyo in 2010 and 2011 to try to combat Yakuza influence by making it illegal for any business to do business with the Yakuza.<ref>Botting, Geoff, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20111016bj.html Average Joe could be collateral damage in war against yakuza]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 October 2011, p. 9.</ref><ref>Schreiber, Mark, \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fd20120304bj.html Anti-yakuza laws are taking their toll]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 March 2012, p. 9.</ref>\n\n====Yakuza's aid in T\u014dhoku catastrophe====\nFollowing the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, the Yakuza sent hundreds of trucks filled with food, water, blankets, and sanitary accessories to aid the people in the affected areas of the natural disaster.

They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\nIn California, the Yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]]. They allied with Vietnamese gangs to use them as muscle, as they had potential to become extremely violent as needed. The Yakuza saw their potential following the constant Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\n[[Handgun]]s manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by [[China]] (16%) and the [[Philippines]] (10%).  In 1990, a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that cost $275 in the US could sell for up to $4,000 in Tokyo. By 1997 it would sell for only $500 due to the proliferation of guns in Japan during the 1990s.<ref name=yakuza03-america/>\n\nThe [[FBI]] suspects that the Yakuza use various operations to launder money in the U.S.<ref name=adelstein/>\n\nIn 2001, the FBI's representative in Tokyo arranged for [[Tadamasa Goto]], the head of the group [[Goto-gumi]], to receive a [[liver transplant]] at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] in the United States, in return for information of Yamaguchi-gumi operations in the US.

The burakumin are [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the [[feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal era]], mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or [[ritual impurity]], such as butchers, [[executioner]]s, [[undertaker]]s, or [[leather worker]]s. They traditionally lived in their own secluded [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].\n\nAccording to [[David E. Kaplan (author)|David E.

Methods include that which brought down [[Al Capone]]: checking the organization's finances. The [[Financial Services Agency]] ordered [[Mizuho Financial Group]], Inc. to improve compliance and that its top executives report by 28 October 2013 what they knew and when about a consumer-credit affiliate found making loans to crime groups. This adds pressure to the group from the U.S. as well where an executive order in 2011 required financial institutions to freeze Yakuza assets. As of 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] has frozen about US$55,000 of Yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/yazkuza-mobsters-whacked-by-regulators-freezing-amexs.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Yakuza Bosses Whacked by Regulators Freezing AmEx Cards}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== Yakuza in society ===\nThe Yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. They function as a police force in their areas of operation, to help reduce crime (that would be their competition). They also provide protection to businesses and relief in times of disaster. These actions have painted Yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. However, gang-wars, and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone | work=Daily Beast | title=Where Have Japan's Yakuza Gone?}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Yakuza have been  in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own [[Yakuza film|genre]] of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the Yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/yakuza-kind-hearted-criminals-or-monsters-in-suits | work=Japan Today | title=Yakuza: Kind-hearted criminals or monsters in suits? | date=10 October 2012 | accessdate=18 January 2019 }}</ref> Movies like ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity (film)|Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the \"business\" side of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Netflix film ''[[The Outsider (2018 film)|The Outsider]]'' centers around Nick Lowell, an American who falls in with a Yakuza clan in post-war Japan and focuses on his rise within the family.\n\n===Television===\nThe Yakuza make an appearance outside 742 Evergreen Terrace in the episode of the American TV Series [[The Simpsons]] called [[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]. Marge's Pretzel rivals ask the Yakuza to appear outside The Simpson House. They fight the mob gang that is lead by Fat Tony.\n\nThe Yakuza play a very important role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' remake. Lead character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Kono Kalakaua|Kono Kalakaua's]] husband [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Adam Noshimuri|Adam Noshimuri]] was the former head of the Yakuza who took over after his father Hiro Noshimuri died. Adam's brother [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Michael Nosimuri|Michael Noshimuri]] was also part of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Yakuza are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series [[Giri/Haji]].\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'', launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the Yakuza throughout the series. The series addresses some of the same themes as the Yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, etc. The series has been successful; spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live action [[Like a Dragon|movie]] and a web TV series.\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' features a Yakuza clan that assists the protagonist in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. The Yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are executed by Colombian gangsters.\n\n''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a Yakuza boss. A mission in a later game, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious Yakuza lawyer as one of two targets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[893239]] or Yakuza-Nijusan-Ku\n* [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku]]\n* [[Chimpira]], low ranking Yakuza\n* [[Crime in Japan]]\n* [[Criminal tattoo]]\n* [[Gopnik]]\n* [[Irezumi]]\n* [[Kkangpae]] (Korean mafia)\n* [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n* [[Organized crime]]\n* [[Punch perm]]\n* [[Russian mafia]]\n* [[Sicilian Mafia]]\n* [[American Mafia]]\n* [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]\n* [[Yakuza exclusion ordinances]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Bruno, A.

If the sum of the cards exceeds 10, its second digit is used as the score instead, and if the sum is exactly 10, the score is 1. If the three cards drawn are 8-9-3 (pronounced '''ya-ku-sa''' in Japanese), the sum is 20 and therefore the score is zero, making it the worst possible hand that can be drawn.<ref>[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E3%82%84%E3%81%8F%E3%81%96 \"Yakuza\" definition]. Kotobank (in Japanese)</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Japan Kyushu Region large.png|thumb|right|Throughout history, especially since the modern era, [[Kyushu]] island has been the largest source of ''yakuza'' members, including many renowned bosses in the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]].  Isokichi Yoshida (1867\u20131936) from the [[Kitakyushu]] area was considered{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} the first renowned modern ''yakuza''. Recently [[Shinobu Tsukasa]] and Kunio Inoue, the bosses of the two most powerful clans in the Yamaguchi-gumi, originate from Kyushu. [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], the northernmost part of the island, has the largest number of [[#Designated boryokudan|designated syndicates]] among all of the prefectures.]]\n\nDespite uncertainty about the single origin of ''yakuza'' organizations, most modern ''yakuza'' derive from two social classifications which emerged in the mid-[[Edo period]] (1603\u20131868): ''[[tekiya]]'', those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen, or shoddy goods; and ''[[bakuto]]'', those who were involved in or participated in gambling.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 18-21.</ref>\n\n''Tekiya'' (peddlers) ranked as one of the [[Four occupations|lowest social groups]] during the Edo period. As they began to form organizations of their own, they took over some administrative duties relating to commerce, such as stall allocation and protection of their commercial activities.<ref>Joy, Alicia. \"A Brief History Of The Yakuza Organization\". Culture Trip. Last modified 31 October 2016. https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/a-brief-history-of-the-yakuza-organization/.</ref> During [[Shinto]] [[Japanese festivals| festivals]], these peddlers opened stalls and some members were hired to act as security. Each peddler paid rent in exchange for a stall assignment and protection during the fair.\n\nThe ''tekiya'' were a highly structured and hierarchical group with the ''oyabun'' (boss) at the top and ''kobun'' (gang members) at the bottom.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\">Raz, Jacob. \"Insider Outsider: The Way of the Yakuza.\" Kyoto Journal. Last modified 17 April 2011. https://kyotojournal.org/society/insider-outsider/.</ref> This hierarchy resembles a structure similar to the family - the ''oyabun'' was often regarded{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as a surrogate father, and the ''kobun'' as surrogate children.<ref name=\"kyotojournal.org\"/> During the Edo period, the government formally recognized  the ''tekiya''. At this time, the ''oyabun'' were appointed{{by whom?|date=March 2020}} as supervisors and granted near-[[samurai]] status, meaning they were allowed the dignity of a surname and two swords.<ref>David E. Kaplan and Alec Dubro, Yakuza: The Explosive Account of Japan's Criminal Underworld (Reading, Mass: Addison-Wesley, 1986), 22.</ref>\n\n''Bakuto'' (gamblers) had a much lower social standing even than traders, as gambling was illegal. Many small gambling houses cropped up in abandoned temples or shrines at the edges of towns and villages all over Japan.  Most of these gambling houses ran loan-sharking businesses for clients, and they usually maintained their own security personnel. Society at large regarded the gambling houses themselves, as well as the ''bakuto'', with disdain. Much of the undesirable image of the Yakuza originates from ''bakuto''; this includes the name ''Yakuza'' itself.\n\nBecause of the economic situation during the mid-period{{when?|date=March 2020}} and the predominance of the merchant class, developing Yakuza groups were composed of misfits and delinquents who had joined or formed Yakuza groups to extort customers in local markets by selling fake or shoddy goods.{{Clarify|What \"mid-period\"? How gone from privileged merchants with swords to misfits? How did tekiya and bakuto come together?|date= March 2016}}\n\nThe roots of the Yakuza survive today in [[initiation ceremony| initiation ceremonies]], which incorporate tekiya or bakuto [[rituals]]. Although the modern Yakuza has diversified, some gangs still identify with one group or the other; for example, a gang whose primary source of income is illegal gambling may refer to themselves as ''bakuto''.\n\n== Organization and activities ==\n\n=== Structure ===\n[[File:Yakuza hierarchy.png|right|thumb|Yakuza hierarchy]]\nDuring the formation of the Yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where ''kobun'' (\u5b50\u5206; lit. foster child) owe their allegiance to the {{nihongo|''oyabun''|\u89aa\u5206||lit. foster parent}}.  In a much later period, the code of {{nihongo|''jingi''|\u4ec1\u7fa9||justice and duty}} was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life.\n\nThe oyabun-kobun relationship is formalized by ceremonial sharing of [[sake]] from a single cup. This ritual is not exclusive to the Yakuza\u2014it is also commonly performed in traditional Japanese [[Shinto]] weddings, and may have been a part of ''sworn brotherhood'' relationships.<ref name=\"trutv.com\">{{cite web|last=Bruno|first=Anthony|title=The Yakuza - Oyabun-Kobun, Father-Child|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html|publisher=[[truTV]]|accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring the [[World War II]] period in Japan, the more traditional tekiya/bakuto form of organization declined as the entire population was mobilised to participate in the war effort and society came under strict military government. However, after the war, the Yakuza adapted again.\n\nProspective Yakuza come from all walks of life. The most romantic tales tell how Yakuza accept sons who have been abandoned or exiled by their parents. Many Yakuza start out in junior high school or high school as common street thugs or members of [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] gangs.  Perhaps because of its lower socio-economic status, numerous Yakuza members come from [[Burakumin]] and ethnic Korean backgrounds.\n\nYakuza groups are headed by an ''oyabun'' or {{nihongo|''kumich\u014d''|\u7d44\u9577||family head}} who gives orders to his subordinates, the ''kobun''. In this respect, the organization is a variation of the traditional Japanese [[senpai]]-[[kohai|k\u014dhai]] (senior-junior) model. Members of Yakuza gangs cut their family ties and transfer their loyalty to the gang boss. They refer to each other as family members - fathers and elder and younger brothers. The Yakuza is populated almost entirely by men and the very few women who are acknowledged are the wives of bosses, who are referred to by the title {{nihongo|''ane-san''|\u59d0\u3055\u3093||older sister}}. When the 3rd [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] boss ([[Kazuo Taoka]]) died in the early 1980s, his wife (Fumiko) took over as boss of Yamaguchi-gumi, albeit for a short time.\n\nYakuza have a complex organizational structure. There is an [[Capo di tutti capi|overall boss]] of the syndicate, the ''kumicho'', and directly beneath him are the ''saiko komon'' (senior advisor) and ''so-honbucho '' (headquarters chief). The second in the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] is the ''wakagashira'', who governs several gangs in a region with the help of a ''fuku-honbucho'' who is himself responsible for several gangs. The regional gangs themselves are governed by their local boss, the ''shateigashira''.<ref>[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/gangsters_outlaws/gang/yakuza/2.html The Yakuza, the Japanese Mafia - The Crime Library - Crime Library on truTV.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nEach member's connection is ranked by the hierarchy of sakazuki (sake sharing). Kumicho are at the top, and control various {{nihongo|''saik\u014d-komon''|\u6700\u9ad8\u9867\u554f||senior advisors}}. The saik\u014d-komon control their own turfs in different areas or cities. They have their own underlings, including other [[underboss]]es, advisors, accountants and enforcers.\n\nThose who have received sake from oyabun are part of the immediate family and ranked in terms of elder or younger brothers. However, each kobun, in turn, can offer sakazuki as oyabun to his underling to form an affiliated organisation, which might in turn form lower ranked organizations. In the Yamaguchi-gumi, which controls some 2,500 businesses and 500 Yakuza groups, there are fifth rank subsidiary organizations.<!--\n[[File:Hitokiri Ginji, Black Lagoon Vol.4.jpg|thumb|right|180px|A fictional Yakuza character with typical upper-body [[irezumi|Yakuza tattoos]], from the ''[[Black Lagoon]]'' manga series.

Upon a first offense, the transgressor must cut off the tip of his left little finger and give the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an underboss may do this in penance to the oyabun if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. This practice has started to wane amongst the younger members, due to it being an easy identifier for police.<ref name=\"cnn.com\">{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/15/asia/yakuza-yamaguchi-gumi-explainer/ | work=CNN | title=The yakuza: Inside Japan's murky criminal underworld}}</ref>\n\nIts origin stems from the traditional way of holding a [[Kenjutsu|Japanese sword]]. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively weakens a person's sword grip.\n\nThe idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection\u2014reducing individual action. In recent years, [[prosthetic]] fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance.<ref name=\"trutv.com\"/>\n\nMany Yakuza have full-body tattoos (including their [[genitalia]]). These tattoos, known as [[irezumi]] in Japan, are still often \"hand-poked\", that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and handheld tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive, painful, and can take years to complete.<ref>''[[Japanorama]]'', [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]], Series 2, Episode 3, first aired 21 September 2006</ref>\n\nWhen Yakuza members play [[Oicho-Kabu]] cards with each other, they often remove their shirts or open them up and drape them around their waists. This enables them to display their full-body tattoos to each other. This is one of the few times that Yakuza members display their tattoos to others, as they normally keep them concealed in public with long-sleeved and high-necked shirts. When new members join, they are often required to remove their trousers as well and reveal any lower body tattoos.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}\n\n==Syndicates==\n{{Further|List of Yakuza syndicates}}{{Expand section|examples and additional citations|date=March 2018}}\n\n===Four largest syndicates===\nAlthough Yakuza membership has declined since the implementation of the Anti-[[Boryokudan]] Act in 1992, according to the [[National Police Agency (Japan)]] there are still approximately 39,100 active Yakuza members in Japan as of 2016.<ref>http://www.npa.go.jp/english/kokusai/pdf/Police_of_Japan_2017_full_text.pdf \"Police of Japan 2017\"</ref> \nThe Yakuza does not consist of just one group, rather there are many different [[syndicate]] groups that together form one of the largest organized crime groups in the world.<ref>Johnston, Eric, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20070214i1.html From rackets to real estate, yakuza multifaceted]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 14 February 2007, p. 3.</ref>\n\n{| class=wikitable\n!

Japan's bubble economy of the 1980s is often blamed on real estate speculation by banking subsidiaries.

This is in line with the idea that their activities are semi-open; theft by definition would be a covert activity. More importantly, such an act would be considered a trespass by the community. Also, Yakuza usually do not conduct the actual business operation by themselves. Core business activities such as merchandising, loan sharking or management of gambling houses are typically managed by non-Yakuza members who pay protection fees for their activities.\n\nThere is much evidence of Yakuza involvement in international crime. There are many tattooed Yakuza members imprisoned in various Asian prisons for such crimes as drug trafficking and arms smuggling. In 1997, one verified Yakuza member was caught smuggling 4 kilograms (8.82 pounds) of [[heroin]] into Canada.\n\nBecause of their history as a legitimate feudal organization and their connection to the Japanese political system through the ''[[uyoku dantai]]'' (extreme right-wing political groups), Yakuza are somewhat a part of the Japanese establishment, with six [[fan magazine]]s reporting on their activities.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/the-yakuzas-ties-to-the-japanese-right-wing-000 | work=Vice Today | title=The Yakuza's Ties to the Japanese Right Wing}}</ref> Yakuza involvement in politics functions similarly to that of a lobbying group, with them backing those who share in their opinions or beliefs.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2012/12/13/the-yakuza-lobby/ | work=Foreign Policy | title=The Yakuza Lobby}}</ref> One study found that 1 in 10 adults under the age of 40 believed that the Yakuza should be allowed to exist.{{r|adelstein20110318}} In the 1980s in [[Fukuoka Prefecture|Fukuoka]], a Yakuza war spiraled out of control and civilians were hurt. It was a large conflict between the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] and [[Dojin-kai]], called the ''Yama-Michi War''. The police stepped in and forced the Yakuza bosses on both sides to declare a truce in public.\n\nAt various times, people in Japanese cities have launched anti-Yakuza campaigns with mixed and varied success. In March 1995, the Japanese government passed the ''Act for Prevention of Unlawful Activities by Criminal Gang Members'', which made traditional [[racketeering]] much more difficult. Beginning in 2009, led by agency chief [[Takaharu Ando]], Japanese police began to crack down on the gangs. [[Kodo-kai]] chief [[Kiyoshi Takayama]] was arrested in late 2010. In December 2010, police arrested Yamaguchi-gumi's alleged number three leader, [[Tadashi Irie]]. According to the media, encouraged by tougher anti-Yakuza laws and legislation, local governments and construction companies have begun to shun or ban Yakuza activities or involvement in their communities or construction projects.<ref>Zeller, Frank ([[Agence France-Presse|AFP]]-[[Jiji Press|Jiji]]), \"Yakuza served notice days of looking the other way are over,\" ''[[Japan Times]]'', 26 January 2011, p. 3.</ref> The police are handicapped, however, by Japan's lack of an equivalent to [[plea bargaining]], [[witness protection]], or the United States' [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]].{{r|adelstein}} Laws were enacted in Osaka and Tokyo in 2010 and 2011 to try to combat Yakuza influence by making it illegal for any business to do business with the Yakuza.<ref>Botting, Geoff, \"[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fd20111016bj.html Average Joe could be collateral damage in war against yakuza]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 16 October 2011, p. 9.</ref><ref>Schreiber, Mark, \"[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/fd20120304bj.html Anti-yakuza laws are taking their toll]\", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 4 March 2012, p. 9.</ref>\n\n====Yakuza's aid in T\u014dhoku catastrophe====\nFollowing the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami|T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, the Yakuza sent hundreds of trucks filled with food, water, blankets, and sanitary accessories to aid the people in the affected areas of the natural disaster.

They easily fit into the local population, since many tourists from Japan and other Asian countries visit the islands on a regular basis, and there is a large population of residents who are of full or partial Japanese descent. They also work with local gangs, funneling Japanese tourists to gambling parlors and brothels.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\nIn California, the Yakuza have made alliances with local Korean gangs as well as [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese triads]]. They allied with Vietnamese gangs to use them as muscle, as they had potential to become extremely violent as needed. The Yakuza saw their potential following the constant Vietnamese cafe shoot-outs and home invasion burglaries throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. In New York City, they appear to collect finder's fees from Russian, Irish and Italian gang members and businessmen for guiding Japanese tourists to gambling establishments, both legal and illegal.<ref name=crimelibrary/>\n\n[[Handgun]]s manufactured in the US account for a large share (33%) of handguns seized in Japan, followed by [[China]] (16%) and the [[Philippines]] (10%).  In 1990, a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[.38 caliber]] [[revolver]] that cost $275 in the US could sell for up to $4,000 in Tokyo. By 1997 it would sell for only $500 due to the proliferation of guns in Japan during the 1990s.<ref name=yakuza03-america/>\n\nThe [[FBI]] suspects that the Yakuza use various operations to launder money in the U.S.<ref name=adelstein/>\n\nIn 2001, the FBI's representative in Tokyo arranged for [[Tadamasa Goto]], the head of the group [[Goto-gumi]], to receive a [[liver transplant]] at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] in the United States, in return for information of Yamaguchi-gumi operations in the US.  This was done without prior consultation of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|NPA]].

The burakumin are [[Lineal descendant|descendants]] of outcast communities of the pre-modern, especially the [[feudal Japan hierarchy|feudal era]], mainly those with occupations considered tainted with death or [[ritual impurity]], such as butchers, [[executioner]]s, [[undertaker]]s, or [[leather worker]]s. They traditionally lived in their own secluded [[hamlet (place)|hamlets]].\n\nAccording to [[David E. Kaplan (author)|David E.

Methods include that which brought down [[Al Capone]]: checking the organization's finances. The [[Financial Services Agency]] ordered [[Mizuho Financial Group]], Inc. to improve compliance and that its top executives report by 28 October 2013 what they knew and when about a consumer-credit affiliate found making loans to crime groups. This adds pressure to the group from the U.S. as well where an executive order in 2011 required financial institutions to freeze Yakuza assets. As of 2013, the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]] has frozen about US$55,000 of Yakuza holdings, including two Japan-issued American Express cards.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-10-22/yazkuza-mobsters-whacked-by-regulators-freezing-amexs.html | work=Bloomberg | title=Yakuza Bosses Whacked by Regulators Freezing AmEx Cards}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n\n=== Yakuza in society ===\nThe Yakuza have had mixed relations with Japanese society. They function as a police force in their areas of operation, to help reduce crime (that would be their competition). They also provide protection to businesses and relief in times of disaster. These actions have painted Yakuza in a fairly positive light within Japan. However, gang-wars, and the use of violence as a tool have caused their approval to fall with the general public.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/03/09/where-have-japan-s-yakuza-gone | work=Daily Beast | title=Where Have Japan's Yakuza Gone?}}</ref>\n\n=== Film ===\nThe Yakuza have been  in media and culture in many different fashions. Creating its own [[Yakuza film|genre]] of movies within Japan's film industry, the portrayal of the Yakuza mainly manifests in one of two archetypes; they are portrayed as either honorable and respectable men or as criminals who use fear and violence as their means of operation.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/yakuza-kind-hearted-criminals-or-monsters-in-suits | work=Japan Today | title=Yakuza: Kind-hearted criminals or monsters in suits? | date=10 October 2012 | accessdate=18 January 2019 }}</ref> Movies like ''[[Battles Without Honor and Humanity (film)|Battles Without Honor and Humanity]]'' and ''[[Dead or Alive (film)|Dead or Alive]]'' portray some of the members as violent criminals, with the focus being on the violence, while other movies focus more on the \"business\" side of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Netflix film ''[[The Outsider (2018 film)|The Outsider]]'' centers around Nick Lowell, an American who falls in with a Yakuza clan in post-war Japan and focuses on his rise within the family.\n\n===Television===\nThe Yakuza make an appearance outside 742 Evergreen Terrace in the episode of the American TV Series [[The Simpsons]] called [[The Twisted World of Marge Simpson]]. Marge's Pretzel rivals ask the Yakuza to appear outside The Simpson House. They fight the mob gang that is lead by Fat Tony.\n\nThe Yakuza play a very important role in the ''[[Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series)|Hawaii Five-0]]'' remake. Lead character [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Kono Kalakaua|Kono Kalakaua's]] husband [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Adam Noshimuri|Adam Noshimuri]] was the former head of the Yakuza who took over after his father Hiro Noshimuri died. Adam's brother [[List of Hawaii Five-0 (2010 TV series) characters#Michael Nosimuri|Michael Noshimuri]] was also part of the Yakuza.\n\nThe Yakuza are also the basis for the 2019 BBC TV Series [[Giri/Haji]].\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe video game series ''[[Yakuza (series)|Yakuza]]'', launched in 2005, portrays the actions of several different ranking members of the Yakuza throughout the series. The series addresses some of the same themes as the Yakuza genre of film does, like violence, honor, politics of the syndicates, etc. The series has been successful; spawning sequels, spin-offs, a live action [[Like a Dragon|movie]] and a web TV series.\n\n''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' features a Yakuza clan that assists the protagonist in the second and third act after they cut their ties with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]]. The Yakuza derive most of their income from a casino, Kenji's, and are currently fighting to keep other gangs from peddling drugs in their territory. Towards the end of the third act, the player assassinates the leader of the clan, and the other members are executed by Colombian gangsters.\n\n''[[Hitman 2: Silent Assassin]]'' features a mission set in Japan that sees Agent 47 assassinating the son of a wealthy arms dealer during his dinner meeting with a Yakuza boss. A mission in a later game, ''[[Hitman (2016 video game)|Hitman]]'', set at a secluded mountaintop hospital, features a notorious Yakuza lawyer as one of two targets.\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[893239]] or Yakuza-Nijusan-Ku\n* [[B\u014ds\u014dzoku]]\n* [[Chimpira]], low ranking Yakuza\n* [[Crime in Japan]]\n* [[Criminal tattoo]]\n* [[Gopnik]]\n* [[Irezumi]]\n* [[Kkangpae]] (Korean mafia)\n* [[List of criminal enterprises, gangs and syndicates]]\n* [[Organized crime]]\n* [[Punch perm]]\n* [[Russian mafia]]\n* [[Sicilian Mafia]]\n* [[American Mafia]]\n* [[Triad (organized crime)|Triads]]\n* [[Yakuza exclusion ordinances]]\n{{div col end}}\n{{Portal bar|Japan}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|2}}\n* Bruno, A.

The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself....

The show played several large cities before reaching [[New York City]]. In mid-November, Adelaide travelled from [[Chicago]] (where she'd been performing) to [[New York City]] in her [[Packard]] automobile with her husband Bert. When they arrived in New York, Adelaide was approached in 7th Avenue by a reporter who enquired about her career plans.<ref>''The Pittsburgh Courier'', Pittsburgh, 19 November 1927, front page \u2013 'They Always Come Back For More,\u2019 says Adelaide \u2013 Adelaide Hall report & photograph: https://www.newspapers.com/image/?clipping_id=30987648&fcfToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJmcmVlLXZpZXctaWQiOjQwMDA3ODExLCJpYXQiOjE1NzE0ODQ5NTEsImV4cCI6MTU3MTU3MTM1MX0.vQF9B_O3GWoXhj74SJP8_ICp4wIHl4jUNTrlrvKpgf0</ref> Adelaide, however, declined to enlighten the reporter. Nevertheless, Miss Hall's reappearance in [[New York City]] garnered much speculation, as she was featured on the front pages of several newspapers, encouraging rumours she would soon be starring in a big [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show. In the meantime, Hall and Ellington appeared together in ''Dance Mania'' at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]], Harlem from 14 November for one week before heading off with the show to play in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania at the Standard Theatre.<ref>[http://www.ellingtonweb.ca/Hostedpages/TDWAW/DropdownmenuDRAFT.html#dec27 ''Dance Mania'' dates] listed on Ellingtonweb.</ref> In ''Dance Mania'' Hall closed the first half of the bill and Duke and his orchestra performed in the second half. Duke had a new number \"[[Creole Love Call]]\", which he included in his set. When Adelaide first heard the number back in October, she recounted, \n<blockquote>I was standing in the wings behind the piano when Duke first played it (\"[[Creole Love Call]]\"). I started humming along with the band. He stopped the number and came over to me and said, \"That's just what I was looking for. Can you do it again?\" I said, \"I can't, because I don't know what I was doing.\" He begged me to try. Anyway, I did, and sang this counter melody, and he was delighted and said \"Addie, you're going to record this with the band.\" A couple of days later I did.<ref name=Voce /></blockquote> \n[[File:Cotton Club 1930.jpg|thumb|[[Cotton Club]], [[Harlem]]]]\nWhen Duke was recounting the incident to a reporter he explained, \"We had to do something to employ Adelaide Hall,\" and then added, \"I always say we are primitive artists, we only employ the materials at hand \u2026 the band is an accumulation of personalities, tonal devices.\"<ref>David Bradbury, ''Duke Ellington'', Haus Publishing Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-904341-66-7}}), p. 19.</ref> On 4 December 1927, Ellington and his Orchestra commenced their residency at Harlem's [[Cotton Club]] in a revue called ''Rhythmania''.

Plus it also talks about how she'd had a hard time growing up, because her sister \u2013 who she was very close to \u2013 had died tragically of an illness.... So anyway, there's a point in the story where she describes her close relationship with her father, which I think kind of resonated with me \u2013 where she talks about the conversations she had with him and how he used to say to her randomly 'Sing to the moon and the stars will shine', which kind of became her thing really that she just took with her everywhere.... And I don't know why, but for some reason it just struck some kind of chord with me \u2013 you know, it was just something I seemed to connect with at that time. And so because of that, it then became a saying that I liked to use myself....
