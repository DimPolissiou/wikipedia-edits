Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones. Two continuous trabecular systems emerging on the auricular surface of the [[sacroiliac joint]] meander and criss-cross each other down through the hip bone, the femoral head, neck, and shaft.\n\n* In the hip bone, one system arises on the upper part of the auricular surface to converge onto the posterior surface of the [[greater sciatic notch]], from where its trabeculae are reflected to the inferior part of the acetabulum. The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.\n* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head.

All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>\nThe [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it.

There is also a small contribution from the foveal artery, a small vessel in the ligament of the head of the femur which is a branch of the [[posterior division of the obturator artery]], which becomes important to avoid [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[femur head|head of the femur]] when the blood supply from the medial and lateral circumflex arteries are disrupted (e.g. through fracture of the neck of the femur along their course).<ref name=\"Thieme-Atlas-383\" />\n\nThe hip has two anatomically important [[Anastomosis|anastomoses]], the [[Cruciate anastomosis|cruciate]] and the [[Trochanteric anastomosis|trochanteric anastomoses]], the latter of which provides most of the blood to the head of the femur.

The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.\n* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40\u00b0): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].\n* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20\u00b0): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]].

Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.\n* '''Abduction''' (50\u00b0 with hip extended, 80\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.\n* '''Adduction''' (30\u00b0 with hip extended, 20\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another.

Such changes, caused for example by a dislocation, change the [[trabecula]]r patterns inside the bones.

The other system emerges on the lower part of the auricular surface, converges at the level of the [[superior gluteal line]], and is reflected laterally onto the upper part of the acetabulum.\n* In the femur, the first system lines up with a system arising from the lateral part of the femoral shaft to stretch to the inferior portion of the femoral neck and head.

All three strengthen the capsule and prevent an excessive range of movement in the joint. Of these, the Y-shaped and twisted iliofemoral ligament is the strongest ligament in the human body.<ref name=\"Platzer-198\" />\nIn the upright position, it prevents the trunk from falling backward without the need for muscular activity. In the sitting position, it becomes relaxed, thus permitting the pelvis to tilt backward into its sitting position. The iliofemoral ligament prevents excessive adduction and internal rotation of the hip. The ischiofemoral ligament prevents medial (internal) rotation while the pubofemoral ligament restricts abduction and internal rotation of the hip joint.<ref name=\"Platzer-200\">{{Harvnb|Platzer|2004|pp=200}}</ref>\nThe [[zona orbicularis]], which lies like a collar around the most narrow part of the [[femur neck|femoral neck]], is covered by the other ligaments which partly radiate into it.

The [[iliofemoral ligament]] inhibits lateral rotation and extension, this is why the hip can rotate laterally to a greater degree when it is flexed.\n* '''Medial''' or '''internal rotation''' (40\u00b0): anterior fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; the part of [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] inserted into the [[adductor tubercle]]; and, with the leg abducted also the [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]].\n* '''Extension''' or '''retroversion''' (20\u00b0): [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] (if put out of action, active standing from a sitting position is not possible, but standing and walking on a flat surface is); dorsal fibers of [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]] and [[Gluteus minimus muscle|minimus]]; [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]]; and [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]. Additionally, the following thigh muscles extend the hip: [[Semimembranosus muscle|semimembranosus]], [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]], and long head of [[Biceps femoris muscle|biceps femoris]]. Maximal extension is inhibited by the [[iliofemoral ligament]].\n* '''Flexion''' or '''anteversion''' (140\u00b0): the [[hip flexor]]s: [[iliopsoas]] (with psoas major from vertebral column); [[tensor fasciae latae]], [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], and [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]]. Thigh muscles acting as hip flexors: [[Rectus femoris muscle|rectus femoris]] and [[Sartorius muscle|sartorius]]. Maximal flexion is inhibited by the thigh coming in contact with the chest.\n* '''Abduction''' (50\u00b0 with hip extended, 80\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]]; [[tensor fasciae latae]]; [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[fascia lata]]; [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]; [[Piriformis muscle|piriformis]]; and [[Obturator internus muscle|obturator internus]]. Maximal abduction is inhibited by the neck of the femur coming into contact with the lateral pelvis. When the hips are flexed, this delays the impingement until a greater angle.\n* '''Adduction''' (30\u00b0 with hip extended, 20\u00b0 with hip flexed): [[Adductor magnus muscle|adductor magnus]] with [[Adductor minimus muscle|adductor minimus]]; [[Adductor longus muscle|adductor longus]], [[Adductor brevis muscle|adductor brevis]], [[Gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]] with its attachment at the [[gluteal tuberosity]]; [[Gracilis muscle|gracilis]] (extends to the tibia); [[Pectineus muscle|pectineus]], [[Quadratus femoris muscle|quadratus femoris]]; and [[Obturator externus muscle|obturator externus]]. Of the thigh muscles, [[Semitendinosus muscle|semitendinosus]] is especially involved in hip adduction. Maximal adduction is impeded by the thighs coming into contact with one another. This can be avoided by abducting the opposite leg, or having the legs alternately flexed/extended at the hip so they travel in different planes and do not intersect.\n\n==Clinical significance==\nA [[hip fracture]] is a  [[bone fracture|break]] that occurs in the upper part of the femur.<ref name=AO2009>{{Cite web|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|title=Hip Fractures|date=April 2009|website=OrthoInfo - AAOS|access-date=2017-09-27|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629225405/http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00392|archivedate=29 June 2017|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Symptoms may include pain around the hip particularly with movement and shortening of the leg.<ref name=AO2009/> The hip joint can be replaced by a [[prosthesis]] in a [[hip replacement]] operation due to fractures or illnesses such as [[osteoarthritis]].

Finally, the ilium and its muscle attachment are shaped so as to situate the buttocks away from the birth canal, where contraction of the buttocks could otherwise damage the baby.\n\nThe female hips have long been associated with both [[fertility]] and general expression of [[human sexuality|sexuality]]. Since broad hips facilitate [[birth|child birth]] and also serve as an anatomical cue of sexual maturity, they have been seen as an attractive trait for women for thousands of years. Many of the classical poses women take when sculpted, painted or photographed, such as the ''[[Grande Odalisque]]'', serve to emphasize the prominence of their hips. Similarly, [[fashion|women's fashion]] through the ages has often drawn attention to the girth of the wearer's hips.\n\n==Additional images==\n<gallery>\nFile:Slide2DAD.JPG|Hip joint.

{"title_page": "Augustin Bunea", "text_new": "'''Augustin Bunea''' (August 4, 1857&ndash;November 30, 1909) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] [[Romanians|ethnic Romanian]] historian and priest within the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]].\n\n==Biography==\n===Origins and role in Blaj===\nBunea was born in [[\u0218ercaia|Vad]], a village in the [[\u021aara F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219ului]] region of [[Transylvania]], then part of the [[Austrian Empire]]. He attended primary school from 1864 to 1870, there and in nearby [[\u0218inca|Ohaba]]. He went to a gymnasium in [[Bra\u0219ov]] until the spring of 1877, when he was briefly transferred to [[Blaj]]. While in [[Bra\u0219ov]], he and classmate [[Andrei B\u00e2rseanu]] edited a magazine by hand; it was called ''Conversa\u021biuni. Jurnal literar''. In the magazine, Bunea published 97 folk poems he had gathered around his native village, accompanied by commentaries that showed familiarity with the relevant literature. In autumn 1877, he began studying philosophy and theology on scholarship at Rome's [[Pontifical Urban University]]. Ordained a priest in 1881, he obtained a doctorate in theology the following year.<ref name=\"n330\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 330</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Blaj, the spiritual center of his church, Bunea was assigned to a number of posts within the hierarchy, from metropolitan's adviser and secretary under [[Ioan Vancea]] to scholastic and custodial canon under [[Victor Mihaly de Ap\u0219a]]. He was involved in organizing confessional education at Blaj and across the [[Romanian Catholic Major Archdiocese of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia|F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia Archdiocese]]. At Blaj, he taught religion and dogmatic theology within both the gymnasium and the seminar, briefly serving as prefect of studies. From 1900 to 1903, he was archdiocesan commissioner for the examinations given by certain church schools in Blaj. He was a founding member of the Greek-Catholic teachers' association, and served as inspector for the archdiocese's village schools.<ref name=\"n330\"/>\n\n===Journalism and recognition===\nOver the course of his career, Bunea contributed to several Romanian-language publications, particularly in his native province. His articles dealt with literature, politics and history, appearing in ''Foaia bisericeasc\u0103 \u0219i scolastic\u0103'' (Blaj), ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' and ''Transilvania'' ([[Sibiu]]), ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' (Bra\u0219ov) and in the periodical ''Dreptatea'' ([[Timi\u0219oara]]). In 1890, he helped establish ''[[Unirea (newspaper)|Unirea]]'' newspaper in Blaj.<ref name=\"n330\"/> In 1903, he published a selection of the texts he had submitted to this organ as ''Discursuri. Autonomia bisericeasc\u0103. Diverse''.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 330-31</ref>\n\nBunea became a member of [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|Astra]] in 1886.<ref name=\"n331\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 331</ref> In September 1900, he was elected a corresponding member of its historical section.<ref name=\"n334\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 334</ref> He was among the collaborators on the organization's ''[[Enciclopedia rom\u00e2n\u0103]]'' project, signing around fifty articles that covered some sixty pages. These mainly dealt with important figures in the church's past, but also touched on internal administration, the history of Blaj and Romanian monasteries in Transylvania. The author later drew on the articles for other historiographical works.<ref name=\"n331\"/>\n\n[[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Ioan Bianu]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]] all appreciated Bunea's merits as a historian, and he was distinguished by cultural organizations both in the Empire and in the Old Kingdom. Following his 1900 advancement within Astra, in March 1901, the Romanian Academy received him with the status of corresponding member. Several months later, he was made a member of Astra's central committee. In 1903, he became a paid member of the [[Hungarian Historical Society]]. In May 1909, he advanced to titular membership of the Romanian Academy.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\n===Politics and death===\nBeginning in 1890, Bunea participated in the political movement of Transylvania's Romanians. A distinguished orator, he was among those who defended the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]] signatories. For many years, he belonged to the [[Romanian National Party]]. In his will, drafted in early 1906, Bunea provided for the possibility that his money might be used to set up a foundation for Greek-Catholic youth. The foundation would be administered by the Blaj consistory and would be used to send promising graduates to further their studies abroad.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\nBunea died at Blaj in late 1909. His fellow priests at the theological seminary dedicated an album to him; this featured private messages and newspaper articles from the cities and villages of Transylvania, from Romania, from Vienna, Budapest and other European cities. The album dedicated a lengthy section to the numerous articles in the Romanian press covering the event.<ref name=\"n335\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 335</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nDuring Bunea's lifetime, biographical data about him appeared in the 1898 first volume of ''Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei'' and in three other sources, from 1899, 1900 and 1908. An article commemorating 30 years since his death appeared in the Cluj-based ''Tribuna'' in 1939. In 1940 and 1941, texts about him appeared in the book ''Dasc\u0103lii Blajului'', in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and in the Blaj high school yearbook. Subsequently, under the early years of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] which banned the church, Romanian historiography fell silent about him.<ref name=\"n335\"/>\n\nIn 1967, a detailed study appeared in ''Revista de etnografie \u0219i folclor''; this dealt with the youthful Bunea's collecting of popular poetry in \u021aara F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219ului. In 1970, a methodical study appeared in [[Pompiliu Teodor]]'s ''Evolu\u021bia g\u00e2ndirii esoteric rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti''. This included biographical data, identified the roots of his activity as a historian and defined his areas of interest, main historiographic achievements and concept of history. Teodor also made judgments about the documentation used by Bunea. The 1978 ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'' devoted a short entry to him. In 1991, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], [[Liviu Maior]] dedicated an article in ''Tribuna'' to Bunea's political activity. A 1994 article deals with his contributions to Romanian cultural history in Transylvania as encapsulated in some of his works and in several articles from ''Unirea''. During the 1990s, three articles, including one by [[Gabriel \u0218trempel]], brought to light previously unpublished material from his letters.<ref name=\"n335\"/>\n\n==Work==\n===Early efforts===\nBunea's early interest as a historian lay mainly with the history of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. His first book, a short volume from 1890, deals with the church's present condition. First appearing in ''Foaia bisericeasc\u0103 \u0219i scolastic\u0103'', and then as a 40-page brochure, it includes biographical information about incumbent metropolitan Vancea, as well as cataloguing his cultural, administrative and philanthropic activity. Bunea's 1893 work ''Cestiuni din dreptul \u0219i istoria Bisericii Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti Unite. Partea a II-a'' also deals with a contemporary issue. The author argued in defense of the church's autonomy, which was being threatened by the policies of the Hungarian government.<ref name=\"n331\"/>\n\nIn 1900, Bunea published two books: ''Istoria scurt\u0103 a Bisericii Rom\u00e2ne Unite'', a brief history of the church; and an important monograph about [[Inocen\u021biu Micu-Klein]]. The first, written on the 200th anniversary of the union with Rome, began with an overview of relations between Romanians and the Holy See from the 2nd to the 15th centuries, going on to discuss Transylvania's Romanian church under the [[Prince of Transylvania|Calvinist princes]]. He then described the union itself and the life and activity of the early bishops in each diocese, ending with the present day. Bunea's sources were either published Latin and Romanian books or documents he researched in the metropolitan archive at Blaj.<ref name=\"n331\"/> It is possible that the work inspired [[Zenovie P\u00e2cli\u0219anu]], whose later history of the church features a similar structure.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 331-32</ref>\n\nHis study of Micu-Klein, which also touched on [[Petru Pavel Aron]] and [[Dionisije Novakovi\u0107]], delved into the problems of the 18th century's first half, reconstructing the facts based on numerous sources collected from Transylvanian and foreign archives. It appears that Bunea began preparation as early as 1894, when he received a several copies of documents from the Vienna imperial court's archive. The book demonstrates thorough research on the social, political and cultural history of the Romanians in that era. Later exegeses by P\u00e2cli\u0219anu, [[I. T\u00f3th Zolt\u00e1n]] and [[David Prodan]] used it as a basis for further research into contemporary Romanian life in Transylvania.<ref name=\"n332\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 332</ref>\n\n===Church historian and polemicist===\nThe 1902 ''Istoria rom\u00e2nilor transilv\u0103neni de la 1751 p\u00e2n\u0103 la 1764'' is similarly ample in depth. The preface speaks of the author's purpose: to advance the community's national development and to present his own concept of history. It deals with the figure of Aron; the question of Romanian religious movements, which is allocated considerable space; the organization of his church and of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]; the founding and development of Blaj's schools; the history of Transylvanian monasteries; the evolution of printing among the province's Romanians; and the political, economic and social situation of the peasantry. He pinpoints two important processes that took place in the history of Transylvanian Romanians during the period analyzed: their confessional disunity and the founding of the Blaj schools. While he opined that the first was in the interests of their neighboring political adversaries, he saw the second as elevating Micu-Klein above all other Romanians of the period. The book is based mainly on unpublished documents gathered from institutional archives in Blaj, Sibiu, F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219, Vienna, Budapest and Rome, as well as from a few private individuals in Transylvania and the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. Some 250 documents were reproduced in the footnotes and appendices. He also used texts published by [[Timotei Cipariu]], Iorga and [[Sterie Stinghe]]. During the interwar period, the topics broached by Bunea were taken up by the [[Cluj]] historical school.<ref name=\"n332\"/>\n\nSubsequently, Bunea became more interested in the history of the Orthodox Church in Transylvania, its origins, organizational and institutional evolution. A first work in this direction, published in 1902, was ''Vechile episcopii rom\u00e2nesci a Vadului, Geoagiului, Silva\u0219ului \u0219i B\u0115lgradului''. The following year, he amplified and corrected certain conclusions in ''Istoria autonomiei biserice\u0219ti'', where he frequently cited Cipariu, [[George Bari\u021b]], [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi]] and [[Nikolaus Nilles]]. His next two books dealt with similar issues, and were written in response to polemics by contemporary Orthodox writers.<ref name=\"n332\"/>\n\n''Ierarhia rom\u00e2nilor din Ardeal \u0219i Ungaria'' (1904) is Bunea's reply to [[Teodor P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian]]'s ''Istoriografi vechi, istoriografi noi. Studiu critic \u00een chestia vechei mitropolii rom\u00e2ne''.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 332-33</ref> The latter work, a response to ''Vechile episcopii rom\u00e2nesci'', attempted to demonstrate the existence of a Romanian Orthodox metropolis in medieval Transylvania. Bunea, analyzing the church's institutional organization, reiterated that there was no documentary evidence of such an organization. The book displays a biting critique of P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian's way of writing history. It also elucidates his theory and approach to the practice: his knowledge of Latin, Hungarian and German allowed Bunea to use valuable historical information in order to complete what he found in Romanian sources, and to broaden his horizon when understanding the historical facts of the region. This made him an authority in debates on ecclesiastical history the western part of the Romanian-speaking lands. The second book, also a polemic, was the 1906 ''Mitropolitul Sava Brancovici''. In his previous work, Bunea had already presented data about the life and activity of [[Sava Brankovi\u0107]]. The new text featured a detailed analysis of a book with the same title by [[Vasile Mangra]] and reached contrasting conclusions about Brankovi\u0107's place in church history. As with P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian, Bunea questioned Mangra's competence as a historian.<ref name=\"n333\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 333</ref>\n\n===Late contributions===\nBunea's final studies, which have to do with medieval Romanian history, were left incomplete at the time of his death. At the [[Romanian Academy]]'s request, they were published posthumously as ''St\u0103p\u00e2nii \u021a\u0103rii Oltului'', which he had prepared as his maiden speech to the Academy; and ''\u00cencercare de istoria Rom\u00e2nilor p\u00e2n\u0103 la 1382''. He chose to analyze the historic importance of \u021aara Oltului (another name for \u021aara F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219ului) because of its role in the origins of the [[foundation of Wallachia]] and the consolidation of the Romanian element through longstanding ties with the latter region. The theme also had an emotional resonance: as Bianu inferred, it represented \"the country of his parents and his birth\". The work comprises a succinct political history of the area from the 9th through the 18th centuries, describing its status and leaders, specifying the political implications of leadership for each of them.<ref name=\"n333\"/>\n\nBeginning with the year 895, the author highlights the [[Hungarian conquest of the Carpathian Basin|arrival of the Magyars]] in Pannonia and especially Transylvania; fixes the geographic limits of \u021aara Oltului; specifies its Romanian character, drawing on toponymy and the first Hungarian documents; credits the tradition that [[Radu Negru]] of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 was responsible for the foundation, which took place at [[C\u00e2mpulung]] and [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]]; presents historical information about the region and its Romanian inhabitants over the course of the 13th century and into the first half of the 14th; details offensives launched by the Kingdom of Hungary to the east and south of the Carpathian Mountains during the same period; enumerates nine Romanian lords who possessed \u021aara Oltului, from [[Vladislav I of Wallachia|Vladislav I]] to [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III]]; summarized their political relations with the suzerain power; listed the leaders from Vlad to [[Sigismund B\u00e1thory]]; noted the role of the Romanian Mailat family, and the political implications of controlling the region; briefly listed its property owners from the 17th century, drawing on fiscal records; and ended with 1713, when the F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 domain passed to the state.<ref name=\"n333\"/>\n\nBunea deliberately focuses on the intervals of Romanian domination. He speaks appreciatively of the historiographic achievements of Iorga, Onciul and [[J\u00e1nos Kar\u00e1csonyi]]; the text follows the direction set by the leading members of the Romanian critical school, Iorga, Onciul and [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]].<ref name=\"n333\"/> However, at times, he expresses disagreement with other historians' opinions, advancing his own historiographic solutions in the same context.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 333-34</ref> He insistently draws upon the document collections of Hurmuzachi; and among Hungarian historians, he prefers Kar\u00e1csonyi, [[Frigyes Pesty]] and [[Gyula Pauler]]. An abundantly documented work, its bibliography features over 80 titles in Romanian, Hungarian, German and Latin; there are 225 footnotes, some shorter, others lengthy.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\nAs to ''\u00cencercare de istoria....'', the manuscript was analyzed by Onciul at the Academy's request. He found that the contents mainly dealt with church history and, tangentially, with political history and ethnography. Although it remained unfinished, Onciul recommended publication, both in order to make Bunea's findings known and as an homage. He also began a vast work about the Romanian regiments in the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier]]. Although he did not live to complete it, he did gather rich material on the subject. His archive includes numerous documents, both copies and originals, in Latin, Hungarian and German, about the border regiments.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*{{in lang|ro}} F\u0103nic\u0103 Ni\u021b\u0103, [http://diam.uab.ro/istorie.uab.ro/publicatii/colectia_auash/annales_7/39.pdf \"Augustin Bunea, istoric: preliminarii\"], in ''Annales Universitatis Apulensis.

He attended primary school from 1864 to 1870, there and in nearby [[\u0218inca|Ohaba]]. He went to a gymnasium in [[Bra\u0219ov]] until the spring of 1877, when he was briefly transferred to [[Blaj]]. While in [[Bra\u0219ov]], he and classmate [[Andrei B\u00e2rseanu]] edited a magazine by hand; it was called ''Conversa\u021biuni. Jurnal literar''. In the magazine, Bunea published 97 folk poems he had gathered around his native village, accompanied by commentaries that showed familiarity with the relevant literature. In autumn 1877, he began studying philosophy and theology on scholarship at Rome's [[Pontifical Urban University]]. Ordained a priest in 1881, he obtained a doctorate in theology the following year.<ref name=\"n330\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 330</ref>\n\nAfter returning to Blaj, the spiritual center of his church, Bunea was assigned to a number of posts within the hierarchy, from metropolitan's adviser and secretary under [[Ioan Vancea]] to scholastic and custodial canon under [[Victor Mihaly de Ap\u0219a]]. He was involved in organizing confessional education at Blaj and across the [[Romanian Catholic Major Archdiocese of F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia|F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219 and Alba Iulia Archdiocese]]. At Blaj, he taught religion and dogmatic theology within both the gymnasium and the seminar, briefly serving as prefect of studies. From 1900 to 1903, he was archdiocesan commissioner for the examinations given by certain church schools in Blaj. He was a founding member of the Greek-Catholic teachers' association, and served as inspector for the archdiocese's village schools.<ref name=\"n330\"/>\n\n===Journalism and recognition===\nOver the course of his career, Bunea contributed to several Romanian-language publications, particularly in his native province. His articles dealt with literature, politics and history, appearing in ''Foaia bisericeasc\u0103 \u0219i scolastic\u0103'' (Blaj), ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'' and ''Transilvania'' ([[Sibiu]]), ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' (Bra\u0219ov) and in the periodical ''Dreptatea'' ([[Timi\u0219oara]]). In 1890, he helped establish ''[[Unirea (newspaper)|Unirea]]'' newspaper in Blaj.<ref name=\"n330\"/> In 1903, he published a selection of the texts he had submitted to this organ as ''Discursuri. Autonomia bisericeasc\u0103. Diverse''.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 330-31</ref>\n\nBunea became a member of [[Asocia\u021bia Transilvan\u0103 pentru Literatura Rom\u00e2n\u0103 \u0219i Cultura Poporului Rom\u00e2n|Astra]] in 1886.<ref name=\"n331\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 331</ref> In September 1900, he was elected a corresponding member of its historical section.<ref name=\"n334\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 334</ref> He was among the collaborators on the organization's ''[[Enciclopedia rom\u00e2n\u0103]]'' project, signing around fifty articles that covered some sixty pages. These mainly dealt with important figures in the church's past, but also touched on internal administration, the history of Blaj and Romanian monasteries in Transylvania. The author later drew on the articles for other historiographical works.<ref name=\"n331\"/>\n\n[[Nicolae Iorga]], [[Ioan Bianu]] and [[Dimitrie Onciul]] all appreciated Bunea's merits as a historian, and he was distinguished by cultural organizations both in the Empire and in the Old Kingdom. Following his 1900 advancement within Astra, in March 1901, the Romanian Academy received him with the status of corresponding member. Several months later, he was made a member of Astra's central committee. In 1903, he became a paid member of the [[Hungarian Historical Society]]. In May 1909, he advanced to titular membership of the Romanian Academy.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\n===Politics and death===\nBeginning in 1890, Bunea participated in the political movement of Transylvania's Romanians. A distinguished orator, he was among those who defended the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]] signatories. For many years, he belonged to the [[Romanian National Party]]. In his will, drafted in early 1906, Bunea provided for the possibility that his money might be used to set up a foundation for Greek-Catholic youth. The foundation would be administered by the Blaj consistory and would be used to send promising graduates to further their studies abroad.<ref name=\"n334\"/>\n\nBunea died at Blaj in late 1909. His fellow priests at the theological seminary dedicated an album to him; this featured private messages and newspaper articles from the cities and villages of Transylvania, from Romania, from Vienna, Budapest and other European cities. The album dedicated a lengthy section to the numerous articles in the Romanian press covering the event.<ref name=\"n335\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 335</ref>\n\n===Legacy===\nDuring Bunea's lifetime, biographical data about him appeared in the 1898 first volume of ''Enciclopedia Rom\u00e2niei'' and in three other sources, from 1899, 1900 and 1908. An article commemorating 30 years since his death appeared in the Cluj-based ''Tribuna'' in 1939. In 1940 and 1941, texts about him appeared in the book ''Dasc\u0103lii Blajului'', in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' and in the Blaj high school yearbook. Subsequently, under the early years of the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] which banned the church, Romanian historiography fell silent about him.<ref name=\"n335\"/>\n\nIn 1967, a detailed study appeared in ''Revista de etnografie \u0219i folclor''; this dealt with the youthful Bunea's collecting of popular poetry in \u021aara F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219ului. In 1970, a methodical study appeared in [[Pompiliu Teodor]]'s ''Evolu\u021bia g\u00e2ndirii esoteric rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti''. This included biographical data, identified the roots of his activity as a historian and defined his areas of interest, main historiographic achievements and concept of history. Teodor also made judgments about the documentation used by Bunea. The 1978 ''Enciclopedia istoriografiei rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti'' devoted a short entry to him. In 1991, following the [[Romanian Revolution]], [[Liviu Maior]] dedicated an article in ''Tribuna'' to Bunea's political activity. A 1994 article deals with his contributions to Romanian cultural history in Transylvania as encapsulated in some of his works and in several articles from ''Unirea''. During the 1990s, three articles, including one by [[Gabriel \u0218trempel]], brought to light previously unpublished material from his letters.<ref name=\"n335\"/>\n\n==Work==\n===Early efforts===\nBunea's early interest as a historian lay mainly with the history of the Romanian Greek-Catholic Church. His first book, a short volume from 1890, deals with the church's present condition. First appearing in ''Foaia bisericeasc\u0103 \u0219i scolastic\u0103'', and then as a 40-page brochure, it includes biographical information about incumbent metropolitan Vancea, as well as cataloguing his cultural, administrative and philanthropic activity. Bunea's 1893 work ''Cestiuni din dreptul \u0219i istoria Bisericii Rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti Unite. Partea a II-a'' also deals with a contemporary issue. The author argued in defense of the church's autonomy, which was being threatened by the policies of the Hungarian government.<ref name=\"n331\"/>\n\nIn 1900, Bunea published two books: ''Istoria scurt\u0103 a Bisericii Rom\u00e2ne Unite'', a brief history of the church; and an important monograph about [[Inocen\u021biu Micu-Klein]]. The first, written on the 200th anniversary of the union with Rome, began with an overview of relations between Romanians and the Holy See from the 2nd to the 15th centuries, going on to discuss Transylvania's Romanian church under the [[Prince of Transylvania|Calvinist princes]]. He then described the union itself and the life and activity of the early bishops in each diocese, ending with the present day. Bunea's sources were either published Latin and Romanian books or documents he researched in the metropolitan archive at Blaj.<ref name=\"n331\"/> It is possible that the work inspired [[Zenovie P\u00e2cli\u0219anu]], whose later history of the church features a similar structure.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 331-32</ref>\n\nHis study of Micu-Klein, which also touched on [[Petru Pavel Aron]] and [[Dionisije Novakovi\u0107]], delved into the problems of the 18th century's first half, reconstructing the facts based on numerous sources collected from Transylvanian and foreign archives. It appears that Bunea began preparation as early as 1894, when he received a several copies of documents from the Vienna imperial court's archive. The book demonstrates thorough research on the social, political and cultural history of the Romanians in that era. Later exegeses by P\u00e2cli\u0219anu, [[I. T\u00f3th Zolt\u00e1n]] and [[David Prodan]] used it as a basis for further research into contemporary Romanian life in Transylvania.<ref name=\"n332\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 332</ref>\n\n===Church historian and polemicist===\nThe 1902 ''Istoria rom\u00e2nilor transilv\u0103neni de la 1751 p\u00e2n\u0103 la 1764'' is similarly ample in depth. The preface speaks of the author's purpose: to advance the community's national development and to present his own concept of history. It deals with the figure of Aron; the question of Romanian religious movements, which is allocated considerable space; the organization of his church and of the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]; the founding and development of Blaj's schools; the history of Transylvanian monasteries; the evolution of printing among the province's Romanians; and the political, economic and social situation of the peasantry. He pinpoints two important processes that took place in the history of Transylvanian Romanians during the period analyzed: their confessional disunity and the founding of the Blaj schools. While he opined that the first was in the interests of their neighboring political adversaries, he saw the second as elevating Micu-Klein above all other Romanians of the period. The book is based mainly on unpublished documents gathered from institutional archives in Blaj, Sibiu, F\u0103g\u0103ra\u0219, Vienna, Budapest and Rome, as well as from a few private individuals in Transylvania and the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]. Some 250 documents were reproduced in the footnotes and appendices. He also used texts published by [[Timotei Cipariu]], Iorga and [[Sterie Stinghe]]. During the interwar period, the topics broached by Bunea were taken up by the [[Cluj]] historical school.<ref name=\"n332\"/>\n\nSubsequently, Bunea became more interested in the history of the Orthodox Church in Transylvania, its origins, organizational and institutional evolution. A first work in this direction, published in 1902, was ''Vechile episcopii rom\u00e2nesci a Vadului, Geoagiului, Silva\u0219ului \u0219i B\u0115lgradului''. The following year, he amplified and corrected certain conclusions in ''Istoria autonomiei biserice\u0219ti'', where he frequently cited Cipariu, [[George Bari\u021b]], [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi]] and [[Nikolaus Nilles]]. His next two books dealt with similar issues, and were written in response to polemics by contemporary Orthodox writers.<ref name=\"n332\"/>\n\n''Ierarhia rom\u00e2nilor din Ardeal \u0219i Ungaria'' (1904) is Bunea's reply to [[Teodor P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian]]'s ''Istoriografi vechi, istoriografi noi. Studiu critic \u00een chestia vechei mitropolii rom\u00e2ne''.<ref>Ni\u021b\u0103, pp. 332-33</ref> The latter work, a response to ''Vechile episcopii rom\u00e2nesci'', attempted to demonstrate the existence of a Romanian Orthodox metropolis in medieval Transylvania. Bunea, analyzing the church's institutional organization, reiterated that there was no documentary evidence of such an organization. The book displays a biting critique of P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian's way of writing history. It also elucidates his theory and approach to the practice: his knowledge of Latin, Hungarian and German allowed Bunea to use valuable historical information in order to complete what he found in Romanian sources, and to broaden his horizon when understanding the historical facts of the region. This made him an authority in debates on ecclesiastical history the western part of the Romanian-speaking lands. The second book, also a polemic, was the 1906 ''Mitropolitul Sava Brancovici''. In his previous work, Bunea had already presented data about the life and activity of [[Sava Brankovi\u0107]]. The new text featured a detailed analysis of a book with the same title by [[Vasile Mangra]] and reached contrasting conclusions about Brankovi\u0107's place in church history. As with P\u0103c\u0103\u021bian, Bunea questioned Mangra's competence as a historian.<ref name=\"n333\">Ni\u021b\u0103, p. 333</ref>\n\n===Late contributions===\nBunea's final studies, which have to do with medieval Romanian history, were left incomplete at the time of his death. At the [[Romanian Academy]]'s request, they were published posthumously as ''St\u0103p\u00e2nii \u021a\u0103rii Oltului'', which he had prepared as his maiden speech to the Academy; and ''\u00cencercare de istoria Rom\u00e2nilor p\u00e2n\u0103 la 1382''.

The son of a peasant family from [[Transylvania]], he completed high school in [[Blaj]], where he became a disciple of [[Timotei Cipariu]] and [[Ioan Micu Moldovan]]. As a youth, he espoused [[Romanian nationalism]], and came into conflict with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities, before finally emigrating to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] in 1876. There, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]], later joining the faculty, where he taught [[Romanian literature|Romanian literary history]]. He was affiliated with the [[Romanian Academy Library]] for over half a century, transforming the institution from the meager state in which he found it, and overseeing a five-fold increase of its collection. He helped author two important multi-volume works detailing early books and manuscripts from his country, and was a founder of [[library and information science]] in his adoptive country. Near the end of his life, struggling with deafness, Bianu withdrew from the Library in favor of his friend [[Radu R. Rosetti]], but went on to serve as president of the [[Romanian Academy]].\n\nBianu's scholarship was doubled by his work as an organizer in the field, and, especially after 1880, by a participation in political intrigues. He was a disciple of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], joining the latter's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and canvassing support in academia. Bianu continued to agitate among the Transylvanian Romanians, but, by 1896, both he and Sturdza had turned moderate on the national issue, and favored a rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. As such, Bianu was a \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophile]]\" during World War I, meaning that he criticized Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. He remained in [[German Empire|German]]-occupied territory following the [[Battle of Bucharest|fall of Bucharest]], but was spared persecution upon the end of war.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Beginnings===\nHe was born in [[Valea Lung\u0103, Alba|F\u0103get (Ol\u00e1hb\u00fckk\u00f6s)]], a village east of the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Blaj]]<ref name=\"m253; ln(07)142\">Mihai, p. 253; Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 142</ref> (on the southern border of [[Kis-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 County]] from 1876, and nowadays in [[Alba County]]).

Living in proximity to the spiritual center of the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] in what was then the Austrian Empire, they belonged to that faith.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, p. 208</ref> Bianu attended primary school in his native village. His father understood the importance of schooling, even if this implied material sacrifices, and the boy studied for nearly a decade at the gymnasium and [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in Blaj.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, p. 208.

It was in Moldovan's home that Bianu's interest in old Romanian books was first awakened, and he recalled in later years how he was treated there like a son.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, pp. 209\u2013210.

Rosetti]]. The two politicians discussed issues on bipartisan policies, and even conspired to remove incompetent administrators of either hue from their offices.<ref>Rosetti, pp. 26, 41, 45, 50, 81, 88, 106, 132\u2013134</ref> He and Hasdeu also persuaded Radu Sr to start his work as a social historian and theorist, and afterward helped him to find employment as an archivist.<ref>Rosetti, pp. 45, 83, 106</ref> According to Nastas\u0103, Bianu, allegedly the lover of Sturdza's wife Zoe,<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 257</ref> was an expert at maneuvering the \"levers of power\", and presided upon his own \"clique\".<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 131</ref>\n\nBianu was initially an orthodox [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]], campaigning for unity between Romania and his native Transylvania. During the early 1880s, when Sturdza served as Academy president, Bianu returned to Blaj, hoping to persuade Cipariu to resume his contacts with the Academy. Cipariu objected, mainly because of his dislike for Hasdeu and his conflict with Laurian.<ref>Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 371</ref> In 1892, Bianu joined the executive committee of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]]<ref>Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 143\u2013144</ref> and began sending out sponsorships to the leaders of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'' protest movement.<ref>Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 92</ref> During the backlash, Bianu was sent by Sturdza to assist [[Eugen Brote]] and other exiled ''Memorandists'' at Milan. His plan to resettle the participants in various European countries was nevertheless seen as \"downright absurd\" by its intended beneficiaries, who preferred to stand trial.<ref>[[Valeriu Brani\u0219te]], \"Avanpremier\u0103 editorial\u0103. Clandestin prin imperiu\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 1971, p. 60</ref>\n\nBianu's own stance on Transylvania changed over several years. In 1896, with Sturdza as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], Bianu participated in the rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. During the state visit to Romania of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], Sturdza sent Bianu, [[Grigore Antipa]], [[\u0218tefan Sihleanu]] and [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]] to [[Bolva\u0219ni\u021ba|V\u00e2rciorova]], where they were to meet Austrian delegates ahead of the Cultural League, which sent protesters. The two Romanian delegations clashed which each other, an incident which was reported with amusement in the Bucharest press.<ref>Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 217\u2013218</ref> Bianu also continued to work for the Bucharest National Liberal club during the next decade, helping Sturdza win over ''Junimea'' from the Conservatives. During the [[1905 Romanian general election|elections of 1905]], he backed the ''Junimist'' candidate [[Titu Maiorescu]] and, in return, obtained ''Junimea''{{'}}s support for the National Liberal [[Petru Poni]].<ref>Ornea, p. 359</ref> Bianu and Poni remained close friends for the rest of their lives.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 227</ref> Bianu also used his influence for advancing many other scholarly goals, such as when, in 1909, he brought to Romania [[Ramiro Ortiz (academic)|Ramiro Ortiz]], who founded the Bucharest school of Italian studies.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 227, 420</ref>\n\n===Wartime===\nDuring the earliest stages of World War I, with Romania still cautiously neutral, Bianu also took a neutralist attitude. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was president of the Cultural League, noted that Bianu, unlike Sturdza, did not wish to see Romania committed to the [[Central Powers]]. This was because \"he resented us fighting alongside the Hungarians, who never ever had any other objective but to crush us.\"<ref>Iorga (1939, IV), p. 98</ref> However, Bianu was also one of the Transylvanians and minority-PNL members who also rejected proposals to join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Among these \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]\", Bianu stood out for speaking out against the project to occupy Transylvania from Austria-Hungary with Entente support.<ref>Boia, pp. 73, 81, 109\u2013110</ref> In August 1914, using the pen name Ion Frunz\u0103, he published the essay ''Pentru l\u0103murirea situa\u021biei. Cuvinte c\u0103tre rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Making Things Clear. An Address to the Romanians\"). This work, soon after translated into German, argued that the Entente was a cover for the [[Russian Empire]], [[Pan-Slavism]], and the \"[[Turanism|Turanic hordes]]\"; he decried the persecution of Romanians in Austria-Hungary, but noted that they all fared much better than the Romanians living in Russia's [[Bessarabia Governorate]].<ref>Boia, pp. 169\u2013171, 208, 232\u2013233, 254</ref> This view was instantly supported by the sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]], who suggested that \"Frunz\u0103's admirable work\" should be published \"in millions of copies, so that every Romanian will read it\".<ref>Boia, pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nEventually, [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|in autumn 1916]], a PNL cabinet and [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] announced Romania's support for the Entente; Romanian troops [[Battle of Transylvania|briefly entered Transylvania]], but Romania was in turn invaded by the Central Powers. Bianu stifled his opposition, but did not openly criticize all the Central Powers. In September, shortly after the [[Battle of Turtucaia]], he penned in ''[[Viitorul]]'' an article specifically targeting the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Bulgarians in Romania]], whom he called \"venomous snakes\". According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], this is \"possibly the most anti-Bulgarian writing ever published in Romanian\"; \"Bianu says nothing about the Austro-Hungarians or Germans, as if Romanians had only been at war with the Bulgarians in 1916!\"<ref name=\"lb171\">Boia, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army and administration headed for Western Moldavia: Bianu's son Alexandru was drafted, but, according to his adversaries, spent the war in relative safety at [[B\u00e2rlad]], shying away from active duty.<ref>Marcel Proca, \"B\u00e2rladul \u00een Primul R\u0103zboi Mondial. M\u0103rturii documentare\", in ''Acta Musei Tutovensis. Memorialistic\u0103'', Vol. III, 2018, p. 98</ref> Also controversially, Bianu Sr chose not to join the exodus, and remained with the Germanophiles and neutralists in [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied Bucharest]], to 1918. He noted that he watched on, \"eyes flooded in tears\", as the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] marched through the streets.<ref name=\"lb171\"/> One of ten academicians to remain behind, he ensured that the Academy Library continued to function in relatively normal terms, refusing to publish under the occupation regime,<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 48</ref> but also collaborating with the occupier to at least some degree.<ref>Boia, pp. 109\u2013110, 124, 172\u2013176</ref>\n\nBianu's letters of the occupation are a primary source for the activities of Germanophiles such as Antipa, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Alexandru Al. Beldiman]], [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219]], and [[Iacob Negruzzi]].<ref>Boia, pp. 45, 73\u201374, 138, 172\u2013176, 186\u2013187, 193\u2013194, 253\u2013254</ref> Bianu sided with Carp in his critique of PNL politics, but, unlike him and Beldiman, did not call for the dethronement of King Ferdinand. He also refrained from signing up to Carp's openly pro-German platform.<ref>Boia, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> Nevertheless, he was remembered by the anti-Germanophiles for participating at banquets hosted by the puppet governor, [[Lupu Kostaki]].<ref>Cancicov, pp. 125\u2013126</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] also asked Bianu to vouch for officer [[Alexandru Leca Morariu]], who was accused of being secretly a Romanian nationalist agitator.<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 21</ref>\n\nRomania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|conceded defeat in May 1918]], and the Academy could resume work in Bucharest under a German-friendly Conservative regime, with [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] as Prime Minister. In October, Bianu joined his returning peers and reported on the damages incurred during the previous years.<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 81</ref> He scandalized public opinion further after ordering public mourning at the Academy after the death of a pro-Austrian cleric, [[Vasile Mangra]].<ref>Cancicov, p. 573</ref> The loyalist government was fully restored in Bucharest within a month, following the unexpected [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|defeat of Germany]], which led to the establishment of [[Greater Romania]] (which included [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|united Transylvania]]). In December, Prime Minister [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]] was welcomed by the Academy. According to the now-disgraced Marghiloman, his supporters were either barred from attending or, in Bianu's case, silenced.<ref>[[Alexandru Marghiloman]], ''Note politice, 4. 1918\u20131919'', p. 183. Bucharest: Editura Institutului de Arte Grafice Eminescu, 1927</ref> In this new climate, Bianu was investigated by an Academy commission as a wartime collaborator in March 1919, but refused to present himself for questioning. As he put it, the group investigating him only relied on cut-outs from the anti-Germanophile press.<ref>Boia, pp. 348, 349</ref>\n\n===Final years===\nIn May 1919, Bianu joined efforts with Iorga and other pro-Entente academicians in order to obtain the international recognition of Romania's new borders. However, they failed to convince [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Foreign Affairs]] to sponsor their diplomatic correspondence with Western European academies.<ref>Iorga (1930), pp. 208\u2013210</ref> Although he was mentioned by name and castigated in the Academy commission report of July 1919,<ref>Boia, pp. 352\u2013353</ref> Bianu suffered no further consequences. In September 1919, Bianu was the official rapporteur assessing whether [[Alexandru Davila]]'s play, ''Vlaicu Vod\u0103'', was worthy of an Academy prize; he deemed it unsuitable, after noting that Davila did not adhere to the verified historical narrative.<ref>\"\u00cen Rom\u00e2nia, acum 100 de ani; septembrie \u2013 octombrie 1919\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', September 2019, p. 87</ref> He joined the Transylvanian-based [[Romanian National Party]] (PNR) ahead of the [[1919 Romanian general election|November 1919]] election, taking a seat in the Assembly for [[T\u00e2rnava-Mic\u0103 County]].<ref>\"Anex\u0103.

He helped counter the lack of manuscripts, old books and documents on the language and national history by initiating an ample campaign for identifying and donating such materials.<ref name=\"m254\">Mihai, p. 254</ref> He ensured that the Academy Library became the National Library and helped merge the Central State Library into this institution in 1901, later folding in a number of private libraries. He pushed for an 1884 law mandating printing presses to send two copies of everything they printed to the Academy Library, and was behind improvements to the law in 1904.<ref name=\"c789\">Cr\u0103ciun, p. 789</ref> Also that year, he became one of the main proponents of reforming the [[Romanian alphabet]],<ref name=\"ln(07)495\"/> but later declared himself against \"excessive [[Phonemic orthography|phoneticism]]\", standing up to reformists such as [[Simion Mehedin\u021bi]].<ref>Iorga (1939, VI), pp. 61, 313</ref> During the war, he and [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]] reported trying to rescue the Library's [[Church Slavonic]] corpus from confiscation by the [[Bulgarian Armed Forces]].<ref>Boia, pp. 174\u2013175, 186; Iorga (1930), pp. 47\u201348, 51\u201352, 81</ref>\n\nBianu authored a number of works on philology as well as history, particularly cultural history. Thoroughly familiar with old Romanian literature, he authored two books that remain valuable reference works. The first was the monumental ''Bibliografia Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 veche (1508\u20131830)''. Covering four volumes (1508\u20131716, 1716\u20131807, 1808\u20131817 and 1817\u20131830), it was written in collaboration with [[Nerva Hodo\u0219]] and later [[Dan Simonescu]].<ref>Mihai, p. 254; Urs, ''passim''</ref> First suggested to Bianu by [[\u00c9mile Picot]], it was conceived as a coherent and pan-Romanian project, supplanting earlier catalogues by Vasile Popp and Cipariu.<ref>Urs, p. 349</ref> As an analytical work, it was also based on [[\u00c9mile Legrand]]'s ''Bibliographie hell\u00e9nique ou description raisonn\u00e9e des ouvrages publi\u00e9s par des Grecs au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle''.<ref name=\"nncomag\"/>\n\nThe books it encompassed were published in the Romanian lands during this period in Romanian, Slavonic, Greek and even Georgian, by both Romanians and foreigners; it also included books published abroad by Romanians.<ref>Urs, pp. 351\u2013352, 354; Vladu, p. 9</ref> Publication began in 1903 (preceded by early drafts from 1898), took a nearly two-decade hiatus after Hodo\u0219' death in 1913, and resumed once Simonescu joined the project in 1931. It was completed after Bianu's death, in 1944.<ref>Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, pp. 253\u2013254; Vladu, p. 14</ref> Likened to [[George C\u0103linescu]]'s history of Romanian literature, although more historic in aspect, it was the country's most ample bibliography at the time, praised by Iorga for its completeness.<ref name=\"m254\"/> It was however criticized by later bibliographers, and by Bianu himself, for being inconsistent and incomplete in its selection or presentation of titles.<ref>Urs, pp. 352\u2013354</ref> The work covers 1,526 known books and 300 unknown works, going up to 2,024 with addenda and errata.<ref>Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, p. 254</ref>\n\nPart of the preparation involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors and others who owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal was accompanied by a list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania.<ref>Vladu, p. 9</ref> His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years.<ref>Urs, pp. 350\u2013351; Vladu, p. 9</ref> In his turn, Moldovan sent a letter to the province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his initial list.<ref name=\"v10\">Vladu, p. 10</ref>\n\nBianu's other key work was the three-volume ''Catalogul manuscriselor rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti din Biblioteca Academiei'', written with two other authors and published between 1907 and 1931. Bianu published a number of other books on early Romanian literature as well as textual editions,<ref name=\"m254\"/> including ''[[Psaltirea Scheian\u0103]]''<ref name=\"nncomag\"/> and, in 1924, the newly discovered ''[[Codicele de la Ieud]]''.<ref>Viorel C\u00e2mpean, ''Oameni \u0219i locuri din S\u0103tmar, Vol. I'', p. 124.

The son of a peasant family from [[Transylvania]], he completed high school in [[Blaj]], where he became a disciple of [[Timotei Cipariu]] and [[Ioan Micu Moldovan]]. As a youth, he espoused [[Romanian nationalism]], and came into conflict with the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities, before finally emigrating to the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]] in 1876. There, he attended the [[University of Bucharest]], later joining the faculty, where he taught [[Romanian literature|Romanian literary history]]. He was affiliated with the [[Romanian Academy Library]] for over half a century, transforming the institution from the meager state in which he found it, and overseeing a five-fold increase of its collection. He helped author two important multi-volume works detailing early books and manuscripts from his country, and was a founder of [[library and information science]] in his adoptive country. Near the end of his life, struggling with deafness, Bianu withdrew from the Library in favor of his friend [[Radu R. Rosetti]], but went on to serve as president of the [[Romanian Academy]].\n\nBianu's scholarship was doubled by his work as an organizer in the field, and, especially after 1880, by a participation in political intrigues. He was a disciple of [[Dimitrie Sturdza]], joining the latter's [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] and canvassing support in academia. Bianu continued to agitate among the Transylvanian Romanians, but, by 1896, both he and Sturdza had turned moderate on the national issue, and favored a rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. As such, Bianu was a \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophile]]\" during World War I, meaning that he criticized Romania's alliance with the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. He remained in [[German Empire|German]]-occupied territory following the [[Battle of Bucharest|fall of Bucharest]], but was spared persecution upon the end of war.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Beginnings===\nHe was born in [[Valea Lung\u0103, Alba|F\u0103get (Ol\u00e1hb\u00fckk\u00f6s)]], a village east of the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Blaj]]<ref name=\"m253; ln(07)142\">Mihai, p. 253; Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 142</ref> (on the southern border of [[Kis-K\u00fck\u00fcll\u0151 County]] from 1876, and nowadays in [[Alba County]]). His parents, Grigore and Anica (''n\u00e9e'' Popa), married in 1855; it was Grigore's second marriage.<ref name=\"d206\">Dumitra\u0219, p. 206</ref> The couple had two sons and three daughters, all of whom survived into adulthood.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> The Bianu family was an old peasant one of some means, the village a small Romanian one on a hillside. Living in proximity to the spiritual center of the [[Romanian Greek-Catholic Church]] in what was then the Austrian Empire, they belonged to that faith.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, p. 208</ref> Bianu attended primary school in his native village. His father understood the importance of schooling, even if this implied material sacrifices, and the boy studied for nearly a decade at the gymnasium and [[Inochentie Micu Clain National College|the Romanian high school]] in Blaj.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, p. 208. See also Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 142</ref> When he arrived in 1868, the local atmosphere was uncertain and marked by the faculty's activism against the recent [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867|Austro-Hungarian Compromise]], which consecrated Transylvania part of the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian Crown]], against Romanian demands.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, pp. 208\u2013210</ref>\n\nWhile Bianu was there, [[Timotei Cipariu]] was at the height of his career.<ref name=\"m253; ln(07)142\"/> He lived with one of his teachers, [[Ioan Micu Moldovan]], who helped provide for his daily needs and with whom the former pupil kept touch until the teacher's death in 1915. It was in Moldovan's home that Bianu's interest in old Romanian books was first awakened, and he recalled in later years how he was treated there like a son.<ref>Dumitra\u0219, pp. 209\u2013210. See also Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 142</ref> One of his final acts at the school was to participate in an annual demonstration of the May 1848 assembly on ''[[C\u00e2mpia Libert\u0103\u021bii]]''. This was the last such gathering, as the Hungarian authorities banned them henceforth.<ref name=\"d215\">Dumitra\u0219, p. 215</ref>\n\nBianu graduated in 1876, in the same class as his cousin [[Vasile Bianu]], the future physician and political figure.<ref name=\"vmliga\">Victor Macaveiu, \"Liga Cultural\u0103 la Blaj.

He was thus able to support himself until 1880 while attending the literature and philosophy faculty of [[Bucharest University]]. In early 1879, he was named archivist and librarian of the [[Romanian Academy]].<ref name=\"m253\">Mihai, p. 253</ref> Notoriously thrifty, he lived on the [[Romanian Academy Library]] grounds, downtown Bucharest, where he also raised cows.<ref name=\"ln(07)130; (10)396\">Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 130; (2010), p. 396</ref>\n\nIn 1881, he won a competition to become professor of Romanian language and literature at [[Saint Sava National College]].<ref>Mihai, p. 253; Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 505</ref> Later that year, with the help of his former professor [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]],<ref>Cr\u0103ciun, pp. 787\u2013788</ref> he received a scholarship to study Romance philology in [[University of Milan|Milan]] and [[University of Paris|Paris]].<ref>Boia, p. 169; Mihai, p. 253; Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 202\u2013203, 226, 399; Urs, p. 350</ref> He met the Romanist [[\u00c9mile Picot]],<ref>Urs, p. 350</ref> took courses with [[Graziadio Isaia Ascoli]] and [[Gaston Paris]], but the lasting impact of his sojourn lay in the eye-opening visits to libraries.<ref>Cr\u0103ciun, p. 788; Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 226</ref> Impressed by the [[Palazzo Brera]], the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]], libraries across Italy, the [[Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France]], the [[British Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]], he at the same time became keenly aware of the poor state of Romania's libraries and gathered ideas for their improvement.<ref>Cr\u0103ciun, p. 788</ref>\n\n[[File:Bianu la birou.png|thumb|300px|Bianu at his [[Romanian Academy Library]] desk, ca. 1900]]\nAfter returning home in 1883, he became assistant professor at Bucharest University's department of Romanian literature. He still made visits abroad: in 1885, he spent time in [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia-Lodomeria]], researching the [[Jagiellonian Library]] for Romanian-related subjects, the [[House of Ossoli\u0144ski|Ossoli\u0144ski]] archive at [[Lviv|Lemberg]], and the [[Dosoftei]] fund at [[Zhovkva|Schowkwa]].<ref>Ioan Bianu, ''Insemn\u0103r\u012d istorice \u0219i literare adunate din biblioteci \u0219i arhive gali\u0163iene \u00een vara anului 1885.

Without serious ambitions in this realm, he preferred to be a sort of ''[[\u00e9minence grise]]'' to the party leader.<ref>Boia, p. 169. See also Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 83, 89, 270\u2013271; (2010), p. 257; Rosetti, p. 50</ref> From as early as 1887, he interceded between Sturdza and PNL-friendly academics, including the Slavist [[Ioan Bogdan]], obtaining their support against rival [[Conservative Party (Romania, 1880\u20131918)|Conservatives]], and helping them travel for specialization abroad.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 89, 106\u2013107, 233\u2013234, 270\u2013272, 294, 320\u2013321, 327\u2013329; (2010), pp. 171\u2013172, 350\u2013351, 398</ref> However, Bianu maintained links with the Conservatives' literary club, ''[[Junimea]]'', which he frequented as an outside guest in the 1880s.<ref>Ornea, p. 92</ref> He also maintained links with the Conservative clubs of [[Western Moldavia]], befriending the moderate Conservative [[Radu Rosetti]]\u2014and then his young son, [[Radu R. Rosetti]]. The two politicians discussed issues on bipartisan policies, and even conspired to remove incompetent administrators of either hue from their offices.<ref>Rosetti, pp. 26, 41, 45, 50, 81, 88, 106, 132\u2013134</ref> He and Hasdeu also persuaded Radu Sr to start his work as a social historian and theorist, and afterward helped him to find employment as an archivist.<ref>Rosetti, pp. 45, 83, 106</ref> According to Nastas\u0103, Bianu, allegedly the lover of Sturdza's wife Zoe,<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 257</ref> was an expert at maneuvering the \"levers of power\", and presided upon his own \"clique\".<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), p. 131</ref>\n\nBianu was initially an orthodox [[Romanian nationalism|Romanian nationalist]], campaigning for unity between Romania and his native Transylvania. During the early 1880s, when Sturdza served as Academy president, Bianu returned to Blaj, hoping to persuade Cipariu to resume his contacts with the Academy. Cipariu objected, mainly because of his dislike for Hasdeu and his conflict with Laurian.<ref>Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 371</ref> In 1892, Bianu joined the executive committee of the [[Cultural League for the Unity of All Romanians]]<ref>Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 143\u2013144</ref> and began sending out sponsorships to the leaders of the ''[[Transylvanian Memorandum]]'' protest movement.<ref>Rusu Abrudeanu, p. 92</ref> During the backlash, Bianu was sent by Sturdza to assist [[Eugen Brote]] and other exiled ''Memorandists'' at Milan. His plan to resettle the participants in various European countries was nevertheless seen as \"downright absurd\" by its intended beneficiaries, who preferred to stand trial.<ref>[[Valeriu Brani\u0219te]], \"Avanpremier\u0103 editorial\u0103. Clandestin prin imperiu\", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 1971, p. 60</ref>\n\nBianu's own stance on Transylvania changed over several years. In 1896, with Sturdza as [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]], Bianu participated in the rapprochement with Austria-Hungary. During the state visit to Romania of [[Emperor of Austria|Emperor]] [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], Sturdza sent Bianu, [[Grigore Antipa]], [[\u0218tefan Sihleanu]] and [[Barbu \u0218tef\u0103nescu Delavrancea]] to [[Bolva\u0219ni\u021ba|V\u00e2rciorova]], where they were to meet Austrian delegates ahead of the Cultural League, which sent protesters. The two Romanian delegations clashed which each other, an incident which was reported with amusement in the Bucharest press.<ref>Bacalba\u0219a (1928), pp. 217\u2013218</ref> Bianu also continued to work for the Bucharest National Liberal club during the next decade, helping Sturdza win over ''Junimea'' from the Conservatives. During the [[1905 Romanian general election|elections of 1905]], he backed the ''Junimist'' candidate [[Titu Maiorescu]] and, in return, obtained ''Junimea''{{'}}s support for the National Liberal [[Petru Poni]].<ref>Ornea, p. 359</ref> Bianu and Poni remained close friends for the rest of their lives.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 227</ref> Bianu also used his influence for advancing many other scholarly goals, such as when, in 1909, he brought to Romania [[Ramiro Ortiz (academic)|Ramiro Ortiz]], who founded the Bucharest school of Italian studies.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 227, 420</ref>\n\n===Wartime===\nDuring the earliest stages of World War I, with Romania still cautiously neutral, Bianu also took a neutralist attitude. Historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who was president of the Cultural League, noted that Bianu, unlike Sturdza, did not wish to see Romania committed to the [[Central Powers]]. This was because \"he resented us fighting alongside the Hungarians, who never ever had any other objective but to crush us.\"<ref>Iorga (1939, IV), p. 98</ref> However, Bianu was also one of the Transylvanians and minority-PNL members who also rejected proposals to join the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]. Among these \"[[Germanophilia|Germanophiles]]\", Bianu stood out for speaking out against the project to occupy Transylvania from Austria-Hungary with Entente support.<ref>Boia, pp. 73, 81, 109\u2013110</ref> In August 1914, using the pen name Ion Frunz\u0103, he published the essay ''Pentru l\u0103murirea situa\u021biei. Cuvinte c\u0103tre rom\u00e2ni'' (\"Making Things Clear. An Address to the Romanians\"). This work, soon after translated into German, argued that the Entente was a cover for the [[Russian Empire]], [[Pan-Slavism]], and the \"[[Turanism|Turanic hordes]]\"; he decried the persecution of Romanians in Austria-Hungary, but noted that they all fared much better than the Romanians living in Russia's [[Bessarabia Governorate]].<ref>Boia, pp. 169\u2013171, 208, 232\u2013233, 254</ref> This view was instantly supported by the sociologist [[Dimitrie Gusti]], who suggested that \"Frunz\u0103's admirable work\" should be published \"in millions of copies, so that every Romanian will read it\".<ref>Boia, pp. 232\u2013233</ref>\n\nEventually, [[Treaty of Bucharest (1916)|in autumn 1916]], a PNL cabinet and [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] announced Romania's support for the Entente; Romanian troops [[Battle of Transylvania|briefly entered Transylvania]], but Romania was in turn invaded by the Central Powers. Bianu stifled his opposition, but did not openly criticize all the Central Powers. In September, shortly after the [[Battle of Turtucaia]], he penned in ''[[Viitorul]]'' an article specifically targeting the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]] and the [[Bulgarians in Romania]], whom he called \"venomous snakes\". According to historian [[Lucian Boia]], this is \"possibly the most anti-Bulgarian writing ever published in Romanian\"; \"Bianu says nothing about the Austro-Hungarians or Germans, as if Romanians had only been at war with the Bulgarians in 1916!\"<ref name=\"lb171\">Boia, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe Romanian army and administration headed for Western Moldavia: Bianu's son Alexandru was drafted, but, according to his adversaries, spent the war in relative safety at [[B\u00e2rlad]], shying away from active duty.<ref>Marcel Proca, \"B\u00e2rladul \u00een Primul R\u0103zboi Mondial. M\u0103rturii documentare\", in ''Acta Musei Tutovensis. Memorialistic\u0103'', Vol. III, 2018, p. 98</ref> Also controversially, Bianu Sr chose not to join the exodus, and remained with the Germanophiles and neutralists in [[Battle of Bucharest|occupied Bucharest]], to 1918. He noted that he watched on, \"eyes flooded in tears\", as the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] marched through the streets.<ref name=\"lb171\"/> One of ten academicians to remain behind, he ensured that the Academy Library continued to function in relatively normal terms, refusing to publish under the occupation regime,<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 48</ref> but also collaborating with the occupier to at least some degree.<ref>Boia, pp. 109\u2013110, 124, 172\u2013176</ref>\n\nBianu's letters of the occupation are a primary source for the activities of Germanophiles such as Antipa, [[Petre P. Carp]], [[Alexandru Al. Beldiman]], [[Alexandru Tzigara-Samurca\u0219]], and [[Iacob Negruzzi]].<ref>Boia, pp. 45, 73\u201374, 138, 172\u2013176, 186\u2013187, 193\u2013194, 253\u2013254</ref> Bianu sided with Carp in his critique of PNL politics, but, unlike him and Beldiman, did not call for the dethronement of King Ferdinand. He also refrained from signing up to Carp's openly pro-German platform.<ref>Boia, pp. 173\u2013175</ref> Nevertheless, he was remembered by the anti-Germanophiles for participating at banquets hosted by the puppet governor, [[Lupu Kostaki]].<ref>Cancicov, pp. 125\u2013126</ref> The [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] also asked Bianu to vouch for officer [[Alexandru Leca Morariu]], who was accused of being secretly a Romanian nationalist agitator.<ref>Iorga (1930), p. 21</ref>\n\nRomania [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|conceded defeat in May 1918]], and the Academy could resume work in Bucharest under a German-friendly Conservative regime, with [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] as Prime Minister.

He helped counter the lack of manuscripts, old books and documents on the language and national history by initiating an ample campaign for identifying and donating such materials.<ref name=\"m254\">Mihai, p. 254</ref> He ensured that the Academy Library became the National Library and helped merge the Central State Library into this institution in 1901, later folding in a number of private libraries.

Thoroughly familiar with old Romanian literature, he authored two books that remain valuable reference works. The first was the monumental ''Bibliografia Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 veche (1508\u20131830)''. Covering four volumes (1508\u20131716, 1716\u20131807, 1808\u20131817 and 1817\u20131830), it was written in collaboration with [[Nerva Hodo\u0219]] and later [[Dan Simonescu]].<ref>Mihai, p. 254; Urs, ''passim''</ref> First suggested to Bianu by [[\u00c9mile Picot]], it was conceived as a coherent and pan-Romanian project, supplanting earlier catalogues by Vasile Popp and Cipariu.<ref>Urs, p. 349</ref> As an analytical work, it was also based on [[\u00c9mile Legrand]]'s ''Bibliographie hell\u00e9nique ou description raisonn\u00e9e des ouvrages publi\u00e9s par des Grecs au XVIIIe si\u00e8cle''.<ref name=\"nncomag\"/>\n\nThe books it encompassed were published in the Romanian lands during this period in Romanian, Slavonic, Greek and even Georgian, by both Romanians and foreigners; it also included books published abroad by Romanians.<ref>Urs, pp. 351\u2013352, 354; Vladu, p. 9</ref> Publication began in 1903 (preceded by early drafts from 1898), took a nearly two-decade hiatus after Hodo\u0219' death in 1913, and resumed once Simonescu joined the project in 1931. It was completed after Bianu's death, in 1944.<ref>Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, pp. 253\u2013254; Vladu, p. 14</ref> Likened to [[George C\u0103linescu]]'s history of Romanian literature, although more historic in aspect, it was the country's most ample bibliography at the time, praised by Iorga for its completeness.<ref name=\"m254\"/> It was however criticized by later bibliographers, and by Bianu himself, for being inconsistent and incomplete in its selection or presentation of titles.<ref>Urs, pp. 352\u2013354</ref> The work covers 1,526 known books and 300 unknown works, going up to 2,024 with addenda and errata.<ref>Urs, p. 351. See also Mihai, p. 254</ref>\n\nPart of the preparation involved the 1898 press publication of an appeal for old books, in which priests, teachers, professors and others who owned or knew of books printed between 1508 and 1830 were asked to inform the library of their existence and if possible loan them. The appeal was accompanied by a list of 621 titles of known books in this category; its author was particularly interested in books not on the list. Bianu's call was received with particular enthusiasm in Transylvania.<ref>Vladu, p. 9</ref> His former teacher Moldovan emerged as a steady collaborator, not only facilitating access to his library and Cipariu's diocesan collection, but also providing valuable advice over the years.<ref>Urs, pp. 350\u2013351; Vladu, p. 9</ref> In his turn, Moldovan sent a letter to the province's Greek-Catholic clergy, asking them to supply information about the rare books in their parishes, and Bianu soon received 140 responses regarding books that were not on his initial list.<ref name=\"v10\">Vladu, p. 10</ref>\n\nBianu's other key work was the three-volume ''Catalogul manuscriselor rom\u00e2ne\u0219ti din Biblioteca Academiei'', written with two other authors and published between 1907 and 1931. Bianu published a number of other books on early Romanian literature as well as textual editions,<ref name=\"m254\"/> including ''[[Psaltirea Scheian\u0103]]''<ref name=\"nncomag\"/> and, in 1924, the newly discovered ''[[Codicele de la Ieud]]''.<ref>Viorel C\u00e2mpean, ''Oameni \u0219i locuri din S\u0103tmar, Vol. I'', p. 124.

In pre-[[World War II]] Germany, two high school students, Peter M\u00fcller and Thomas Berger, attempt to be [[swing kids]] by night and [[Hitler Youth]] by day, a decision that acutely impacts their friends and families.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the 1930s, some young German teens favored American and British pop culture; they hung out in secret underground clubs where bands played swing music and listened to contemporary music by acts like [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Duke Ellington]]. The film's screenwriter, Jonathan Marc Feldman, based the film on this eponymous [[Swing Kids]] movement.<ref name=a01>{{Cite web| title = 'Swing Kids' a Unique History Lesson | work=[[Doylestown Intelligencer]] |date=March 12, 1993 |via=[[NewspaperArchive]]|accessdate = 2018-07-08| url = https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-entertainment-clipping-mar-12-1993-744345/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Hamburg]] in 1939, Peter M\u00fcller and Thomas Berger join their friends Arvid and Otto at a swing club called the Bismarck. They have a good time, dancing and enjoying the music.\n\nPeter goes home to find his mother in an argument with the Nazi [[Blockleiter]] (block leader). Herr Knopp, head of the local [[Gestapo]], arrives and curtly dismisses the Blockleiter.  Herr Knopp begins asking Frau M\u00fcller questions about some of her late husband's friends. Herr M\u00fcller had been accused of being a communist, and was irreparably damaged by an interrogation at the hands of Nazi agents.\n\nAt Arvid's house, Thomas accidentally ruins one of Arvid's prized records. Upset, Arvid kicks Thomas, Peter and Otto out. To apologize to Arvid, Peter and Thomas steal a radio (which Peter knows was stolen from a ransacked Jewish home) from a bakery. Thomas escapes, but Peter is caught. Herr Knopp, who is attracted to Peter's mother, intercedes for him; in return, Peter must enroll in the ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' (Hitler Youth).\n\nPeter, who has a job delivering books, is asked to spy on his boss, whom the Nazis suspect is working against the Reich. In HJ school, the boys are encouraged to spy on their friends and families. Thomas accuses his father of insulting Hitler, hoping to cause trouble for him, but is unnerved when the Nazis come to his home and take his father away. His subsequent attempts to resume his friendship with Peter and persuade him to collaborate with the Nazis are tinged with fear.\n\nArvid, who is working at a jazz club, refuses to play a German song, lashing out at the club's patrons for being blind to the Nazi agenda. Peter is sympathetic but Thomas loudly argues the Nazi side. Peter angrily proclaims Thomas to be a \"fucking Nazi\" and storms off. As time goes on, Arvid realizes there is nothing for him in Germany and dies by suicide.\n\nAs Thomas begins to believe fully in Nazi ideology, Peter feels as though there is no hope for him. Peter, disenchanted with how his life is coming apart, dresses up and goes to a swing club which is scheduled to be raided by members of the ''Hitlerjugend''. As Thomas begins assaulting the club's patrons he attacks Peter; however, during the fight Peter is able to reach Thomas. Thomas begs Peter to run away but Peter won't.

In pre-[[World War II]] Germany, two high school students, Peter M\u00fcller and Thomas Berger, attempt to be [[swing kids]] by night and [[Hitler Youth]] by day, a decision that acutely impacts their friends and families.\n\n==Historical background==\nIn the 1930s, some young German teens favored American and British pop culture; they hung out in secret underground clubs where bands played swing music and listened to contemporary music by acts like [[Benny Goodman]] and [[Duke Ellington]]. The film's screenwriter, Jonathan Marc Feldman, based the film on this eponymous [[Swing Kids]] movement.<ref name=a01>{{Cite web| title = 'Swing Kids' a Unique History Lesson | work=[[Doylestown Intelligencer]] |date=March 12, 1993 |via=[[NewspaperArchive]]|accessdate = 2018-07-08| url = https://newspaperarchive.com/anonymous-entertainment-clipping-mar-12-1993-744345/}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nIn [[Hamburg]] in 1939, Peter M\u00fcller and Thomas Berger join their friends Arvid and Otto at a swing club called the Bismarck. They have a good time, dancing and enjoying the music.\n\nPeter goes home to find his mother in an argument with the Nazi [[Blockleiter]] (block leader). Herr Knopp, head of the local [[Gestapo]], arrives and curtly dismisses the Blockleiter.  Herr Knopp begins asking Frau M\u00fcller questions about some of her late husband's friends. Herr M\u00fcller had been accused of being a communist, and was irreparably damaged by an interrogation at the hands of Nazi agents.\n\nAt Arvid's house, Thomas accidentally ruins one of Arvid's prized records. Upset, Arvid kicks Thomas, Peter and Otto out. To apologize to Arvid, Peter and Thomas steal a radio (which Peter knows was stolen from a ransacked Jewish home) from a bakery. Thomas escapes, but Peter is caught. Herr Knopp, who is attracted to Peter's mother, intercedes for him; in return, Peter must enroll in the ''[[Hitlerjugend]]'' (Hitler Youth).\n\nPeter, who has a job delivering books, is asked to spy on his boss, whom the Nazis suspect is working against the Reich. In HJ school, the boys are encouraged to spy on their friends and families. Thomas accuses his father of insulting Hitler, hoping to cause trouble for him, but is unnerved when the Nazis come to his home and take his father away. His subsequent attempts to resume his friendship with Peter and persuade him to collaborate with the Nazis are tinged with fear.\n\nArvid, who is working at a jazz club, refuses to play a German song, lashing out at the club's patrons for being blind to the Nazi agenda. Peter is sympathetic but Thomas loudly argues the Nazi side. Peter angrily proclaims Thomas to be a \"fucking Nazi\" and storms off. As time goes on, Arvid realizes there is nothing for him in Germany and dies by suicide.\n\nAs Thomas begins to believe fully in Nazi ideology, Peter feels as though there is no hope for him. Peter, disenchanted with how his life is coming apart, dresses up and goes to a swing club which is scheduled to be raided by members of the ''Hitlerjugend''. As Thomas begins assaulting the club's patrons he attacks Peter; however, during the fight Peter is able to reach Thomas. Thomas begs Peter to run away but Peter won't. Willie M\u00fcller is there and as Peter is driven away by the police, he loudly screams \"Swing Heil!\" over and over again, proud that his brother stood up for being a swing kid.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Robert Sean Leonard]] as Peter M\u00fcller\n* [[Christian Bale]] as Thomas Berger\n* [[Frank Whaley]] as Arvid\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Frau M\u00fcller\n* [[Tushka Bergen]] as Evey\n* [[David Tom]] as Willi M\u00fcller\n* Julia Stemberger as Frau Linge\n* [[Kenneth Branagh]] as SS-Sturmbandf\u00fchrer Knopp\n* [[Noah Wyle]] as Emil Lutz\n* [[Jessica Hynes]] as Helga\n* [[Martin Clunes]] as Bandf\u00fchrer\n* Jayce Bartok as Otto\n\n==Reception==\n[[Review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] gives it a score of 56% (based on 18 reviews) and an average score of 4.93/10.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swing_kids/?name_order=asc |title=Swing Kids |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105050059/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swing_kids/?name_order=asc |archive-date=2012-11-05 |df= }}</ref> [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] of ''[[Chicago Reader]]'' described the film as a \"corny but sincere weeper\", while [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film one star (out of 4) and criticized the screenplay (calling it \"murky\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Rosenbaum |first=Jonathan |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swing-kids/Film?oid=1070788 |title=Swing Kids |publisher=Chicago Reader |date= |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015034749/http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/swing-kids/Film?oid=1070788 |archive-date=2012-10-15 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19930305/REVIEWS/303050306/1023 |title=Swing Kids :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date=1993-03-05 |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009052030/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19930305%2FREVIEWS%2F303050306%2F1023 |archive-date=2012-10-09 |df= }}</ref> and including it on his \"Most Hated\" list).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050811/COMMENTARY/50808002 |title=Ebert's Most Hated :: rogerebert.com :: News & comment |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628183709/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20050811%2FCOMMENTARY%2F50808002 |archive-date=2009-06-28 |df= }}</ref> On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a [[weighted mean]] rating out of 100 reviews from film critics, the film has a rating score of 39 (based on 20 reviews).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/swing-kids |title=Swing Kids Reviews, Ratings, Credits, and More |publisher=Metacritic |date= |access-date=2012-07-24 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724053233/http://www.metacritic.com/movie/swing-kids |archive-date=2012-07-24 |df= }}</ref> ''[[The Tech (newspaper)|The Tech]]'' called it \"amazing\" saying the \"well-researched film is wonderfully acted\".<ref>[http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N11/swing.11a.html Strong acting allows Swing Kids to overcome slow plot] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809152247/http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N11/swing.11a.html |date=2012-08-09 }}</ref>\n\nA contemporary film reviewer wrote:<ref name=a01 />\n<blockquote>In the eyes of today's teenagers, Nazis are simplistic villains who get outsmarted, out-gunned and outmaneuvered by Indiana Jones in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and other simplistic action-adventure tales.

Panaitescu''' (March 11, 1900 &ndash; November 14, 1967) was a Romanian literary historian. A native of [[Ia\u0219i]], he spent most of his adult life in the national capital [[Bucharest]], where he rose to become a professor at [[University of Bucharest|its main university]]. As such, he challenged various aspects of the dominant nationalist historiography. However, he also joined the ultra-nationalist [[Iron Guard]], and headed the university during the movement's [[National Legionary State|brief time in power]]. After the Guard was [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|violently suppressed]] at the beginning of 1941, he lost his professorial position. When a communist-dominated government entered office in early 1945, he was arrested and imprisoned. Panaitescu was freed by the end of the year, the new authorities finding useful his theories of Slavic influence on Romania's national trajectory. He worked as a researcher in the latter part of his career, retiring in 1965, two years before his death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Education and early career===\nBorn in [[Ia\u0219i]] to engineer Panait Panaitescu and his wife Leonia (''n\u00e9e'' Greceanu), he attended primary school in his native city, followed by high school in [[Bucharest]]. He attended the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]] from 1918 to 1922, and took specialty courses at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] from 1923 to 1924. From 1924 to 1926, he was a member of the Romanian school at [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. His first published work appeared in ''Revista istoric\u0103'' in 1917; the article dealt with a court case in the [[Danubian Principalities]]. Other magazines to which he contributed include ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', ''Studii'', ''Arhiva rom\u00e2neasc\u0103'', ''Buletinul Comisiei Istorice a Rom\u00e2niei'', ''Romanoslavica'', ''Studii \u0219i cercet\u0103ri de istorie medie'', ''[[Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale]]'', ''Memoriile Sec\u021biei Istorice a Academiei'', ''M\u00e9langes de l\u2019\u00c9cole Roumaine en France'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', as well as Polish and Soviet reviews. His first book, from 1923, was a biographical study of [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]].<ref name=\"sasu\"/>\n\nIn 1925, he earned a doctorate in history; his thesis analyzed the Polish influence on the works and personalities of the chroniclers [[Grigore Ureche]] and [[Miron Costin]]. Subsequently, he became a professor at his alma mater,<ref name=\"sasu\"/> and was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1934.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=P Membrii Academiei Rom\u00e2ne din 1866 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een prezent] at the Romanian Academy site</ref>\n\n===View of history, Guardist affiliation and downfall===\nTogether with [[Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu]] and [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], Panaitescu was a member of the \"new school\" of Romanian history that published in ''Revista istoric\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103'' and defined itself in opposition to [[Nicolae Iorga]] and his ''Revista istoric\u0103''. He wrote a 1936 study of [[Michael the Brave]] that de-emphasized the dominant narrative of Michael as hero, and focused instead on the social class that dictated his actions, namely the ''[[boyars]]''. The book drew a harsh review from Iorga, who claimed Panaitescu was bringing Michael down from his pedestal, and even committing [[l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]] by claiming he was not the son of [[P\u0103tra\u0219cu the Good]].<ref>Boia, p. 66</ref>\n\nHe questioned major elements of other Romanian historical myths, prioritizing material, social and cultural structures over the heroic and personalized approach. In a 1944 article, he asserted that the [[Ottoman Empire]] failed to directly incorporate the Principalities not because of the struggles of Romanians against the Turks (an important theme in mainstream historiography), but because the Ottomans' thrust into Europe lay along a different path, and they found it more advantageous to exploit the area indirectly. Like [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]], he considered that the Slavs were important in medieval Romanian history, even considering the indigenous boyar class to be of Slav origin; on the other hand, he followed [[Dimitrie Onciul]] in downplaying the notion of [[Origin of the Romanians|Daco-Roman continuity]].<ref name=\"b69\">Boia, p. 69</ref> Challenging [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]]'s thesis regarding the Byzantine influence on national culture, he asserted that Romanians between the ninth and the eighteenth century had adopted a Slavo-Byzantine culture. For him, far from being a misfortune of history, this development was necessary given the prevailing social, economic and spiritual conditions. It also fostered national cohesion, allowing Romanians in the three historical provinces of [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]] and [[Transylvania]] to resist foreign invasion and denationalization. He added that early Romanians failed to adopt Western culture because its technical and urban nature was alien to them.<ref>Diana Mishkova, \"The Afterlife of a Commonwealth: Narratives of Byzantium in the National Historiographies of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania\", in Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov (eds.), ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies'', p. 266. BRILL, 2015, 978-900-4290-36-5</ref>\n\nDespite his anti-nationalist stance as a historian, Panaitescu belonged to the extreme nationalist [[Iron Guard]] for a time. Under the [[National Legionary State]] (September 1940-January 1941), he was the University of Bucharest's rector as well as editor of ''Cuv\u00e2ntul'' newspaper, which was replete with historical-mythological constructs.<ref name=\"b69\"/> The sole full professor in the literature faculty who belonged to the Guard, he had kept his position and perhaps his life during the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime's wave of repression against the movement in 1938-1939 thanks to the intervention of Giurescu, [[Mihai Ralea]] and [[Alexandru Rosetti]]. Ralea, a close friend of [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]] [[Armand C\u0103linescu]], spent more than three hours arguing with C\u0103linescu until the latter removed Panaitescu's name from a list of Guardists to be interned. Many of those interned were subsequently killed.<ref>Paul E. Michelson, \"The Master of Synthesis: Constantin C.

Panaitescu''' (March 11, 1900 &ndash; November 14, 1967) was a Romanian literary historian. A native of [[Ia\u0219i]], he spent most of his adult life in the national capital [[Bucharest]], where he rose to become a professor at [[University of Bucharest|its main university]]. As such, he challenged various aspects of the dominant nationalist historiography. However, he also joined the ultra-nationalist [[Iron Guard]], and headed the university during the movement's [[National Legionary State|brief time in power]]. After the Guard was [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|violently suppressed]] at the beginning of 1941, he lost his professorial position. When a communist-dominated government entered office in early 1945, he was arrested and imprisoned. Panaitescu was freed by the end of the year, the new authorities finding useful his theories of Slavic influence on Romania's national trajectory. He worked as a researcher in the latter part of his career, retiring in 1965, two years before his death.\n\n==Biography==\n===Education and early career===\nBorn in [[Ia\u0219i]] to engineer Panait Panaitescu and his wife Leonia (''n\u00e9e'' Greceanu), he attended primary school in his native city, followed by high school in [[Bucharest]]. He attended the literature and philosophy faculty of the [[University of Bucharest]] from 1918 to 1922, and took specialty courses at [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]] from 1923 to 1924. From 1924 to 1926, he was a member of the Romanian school at [[Fontenay-aux-Roses]]. His first published work appeared in ''Revista istoric\u0103'' in 1917; the article dealt with a court case in the [[Danubian Principalities]]. Other magazines to which he contributed include ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', ''Studii'', ''Arhiva rom\u00e2neasc\u0103'', ''Buletinul Comisiei Istorice a Rom\u00e2niei'', ''Romanoslavica'', ''Studii \u0219i cercet\u0103ri de istorie medie'', ''[[Revista Funda\u021biilor Regale]]'', ''Memoriile Sec\u021biei Istorice a Academiei'', ''M\u00e9langes de l\u2019\u00c9cole Roumaine en France'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'', as well as Polish and Soviet reviews. His first book, from 1923, was a biographical study of [[Nicolae B\u0103lcescu]].<ref name=\"sasu\"/>\n\nIn 1925, he earned a doctorate in history; his thesis analyzed the Polish influence on the works and personalities of the chroniclers [[Grigore Ureche]] and [[Miron Costin]]. Subsequently, he became a professor at his alma mater,<ref name=\"sasu\"/> and was elected a corresponding member of the [[Romanian Academy]] in 1934.<ref>{{in lang|ro}} [http://www.acad.ro/bdar/armembriLit.php?vidT=P Membrii Academiei Rom\u00e2ne din 1866 p\u00e2n\u0103 \u00een prezent] at the Romanian Academy site</ref>\n\n===View of history, Guardist affiliation and downfall===\nTogether with [[Gheorghe I. Br\u0103tianu]] and [[Constantin C. Giurescu]], Panaitescu was a member of the \"new school\" of Romanian history that published in ''Revista istoric\u0103 rom\u00e2n\u0103'' and defined itself in opposition to [[Nicolae Iorga]] and his ''Revista istoric\u0103''. He wrote a 1936 study of [[Michael the Brave]] that de-emphasized the dominant narrative of Michael as hero, and focused instead on the social class that dictated his actions, namely the ''[[boyars]]''. The book drew a harsh review from Iorga, who claimed Panaitescu was bringing Michael down from his pedestal, and even committing [[l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9]] by claiming he was not the son of [[P\u0103tra\u0219cu the Good]].<ref>Boia, p. 66</ref>\n\nHe questioned major elements of other Romanian historical myths, prioritizing material, social and cultural structures over the heroic and personalized approach. In a 1944 article, he asserted that the [[Ottoman Empire]] failed to directly incorporate the Principalities not because of the struggles of Romanians against the Turks (an important theme in mainstream historiography), but because the Ottomans' thrust into Europe lay along a different path, and they found it more advantageous to exploit the area indirectly. Like [[Ioan Bogdan]], he considered that the Slavs were important in medieval Romanian history, even considering the indigenous boyar class to be of Slav origin; on the other hand, he followed [[Dimitrie Onciul]] in downplaying the notion of [[Origin of the Romanians|Daco-Roman continuity]].<ref name=\"b69\">Boia, p. 69</ref> Challenging [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]]'s thesis regarding the Byzantine influence on national culture, he asserted that Romanians between the ninth and the eighteenth century had adopted a Slavo-Byzantine culture. For him, far from being a misfortune of history, this development was necessary given the prevailing social, economic and spiritual conditions. It also fostered national cohesion, allowing Romanians in the three historical provinces of [[Moldavia]], [[Wallachia]] and [[Transylvania]] to resist foreign invasion and denationalization. He added that early Romanians failed to adopt Western culture because its technical and urban nature was alien to them.<ref>Diana Mishkova, \"The Afterlife of a Commonwealth: Narratives of Byzantium in the National Historiographies of Greece, Bulgaria, Serbia and Romania\", in Roumen Daskalov, Alexander Vezenkov (eds.), ''Entangled Histories of the Balkans - Volume Three: Shared Pasts, Disputed Legacies'', p. 266. BRILL, 2015, 978-900-4290-36-5</ref>\n\nDespite his anti-nationalist stance as a historian, Panaitescu belonged to the extreme nationalist [[Iron Guard]] for a time. Under the [[National Legionary State]] (September 1940-January 1941), he was the University of Bucharest's rector as well as editor of ''Cuv\u00e2ntul'' newspaper, which was replete with historical-mythological constructs.<ref name=\"b69\"/> The sole full professor in the literature faculty who belonged to the Guard, he had kept his position and perhaps his life during the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime's wave of repression against the movement in 1938-1939 thanks to the intervention of Giurescu, [[Mihai Ralea]] and [[Alexandru Rosetti]]. Ralea, a close friend of [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Romania)|Interior Minister]] [[Armand C\u0103linescu]], spent more than three hours arguing with C\u0103linescu until the latter removed Panaitescu's name from a list of Guardists to be interned. Many of those interned were subsequently killed.<ref>Paul E. Michelson, \"The Master of Synthesis: Constantin C.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537. The province of [[J\u00e4mtland]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Uppsala]] to Nidaros in 1570. The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966. The regions of Nordm\u00f8re and Romsdal (together with Sunnm\u00f8re from Bj\u00f8rgvin) were established as a diocese of its own ([[Diocese of M\u00f8re]]) in 1983.\n\n==Structure==\n{{see also|List of churches in Tr\u00f8ndelag}}\nThe Diocese of Nidaros is divided into ten [[deanery|deaneries]] ({{lang-no|Prosti}}).  Each one corresponds to several municipalities in the diocese.  Each municipality is further divided into one or more [[parish]]es which each contain one or more congregations. \n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Deanery (''Prosti'') !!

The son of a poor merchant family from [[Bra\u0219ov]], he attended several universities before launching a career as a critic, first in his native town and then in [[Czernowitz]]. Eventually settling in [[Bucharest]], capital of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], he managed to earn a university degree before teaching at a succession of high schools. Meanwhile, he continued publishing literary studies as well as intensifying an ardently nationalistic, Pan-Romanian activism. He urged the Romanian government to drop its neutrality policy and enter World War I; once this took place and his adopted home came under German occupation, he found himself arrested and deported to Bulgaria. After the war's conclusion and the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he became a literature professor at the newly founded [[Cluj University]]. There, he served as rector in the late 1920s, but found himself increasingly out of touch with modern trends in literature.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins, education and early career===\nHe was born in [[Bra\u0219ov]], in the [[Transylvania]] region.<ref name=\"v64\"/> His father Ioan (1832\u20131906) was a struggling small businessman who was forced to liquidate his store, leave his family and become a clerk in [[Sinaia]], in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]; by the late 1880s, he was at a glass factory in nearby [[Azuga]]. His mother Elena (''n\u00e9e'' Munteanu; 1846\u20131911) raised seven boys and four girls. The oldest son, [[Ioan Bogdan (historian)|Ioan Bogdan]], would become a historian and philologian. Four of the sons earned university degrees, while a sister, Ecaterina, married [[Nicolae Iorga]] in 1901.<ref>Ioan Bogdan, ''Scrieri alese'', pp. 9&ndash;10.

He prided himself on being an intellectual disciple of [[Titu Maiorescu]], and was writing for the latter's ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' by 1888. In the autumn of 1889, he was named a part-time teacher at the high school he had attended, but was soon fired after a conflict with the administration caused by his quick temper.<ref name=\"petr\"/> While in Bra\u0219ov, he frequently attended social gatherings for the young Romanian women of Bra\u0219ov, where he delivered public readings and sought to awaken the participants' interest in literature.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 130</ref>\n\nSubsequently entering the Austrian province of [[Bukovina]], he settled in its capital of [[Czernowitz]] (''Cern\u0103u\u021bi''), where he edited ''Gazeta Bucovinei'' from May 1893 to August 1894 and sought to raise popular interest in Romanian writers in a province that was fairly disconnected from the cultural life of the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"petr\"/><ref name=\"i68\"/> While there, he published a biography of [[Petru Maior]] in 1893,<ref name=\"i68\"/> and in 1894 translated [[Ion Budai-Deleanu]]'s German-language notes on Bukovina into Romanian.<ref>Al.

From Bucharest, he was one of the chief contributors to ''Tribuna''. His objectives included making the reading public aware of important literature published in the 1880\u20131888 period; sharply criticizing the pseudo-celebrities of the day; and especially the popularization of aesthetic writings such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Laoco\u00f6n'' and [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s ''The Philosophy of Art'', which had both recently appeared in translation.<ref name=\"i68\">Iancu, p. 68</ref> He also returned to teaching in 1897, first offering German courses in [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]] and then moving to [[Foc\u0219ani]] and [[Gala\u021bi]]. By 1899, he was desperate to relocate to the capital, with its rich institutions, worldly attractions and diverse population. He wrote from Foc\u0219ani asking his mentor [[Ioan Bianu]] to intervene on his behalf with [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Spiru Haret]]. He was duly appointed to Bucharest's [[Cantemir Vod\u0103 National College|Dimitrie Cantemir High School]], where he taught from 1899 to 1909, and finally ended his high school career at [[Mihai Viteazul National College (Bucharest)|Mihai Viteazul High School]] in the same city, from 1909 to 1919.<ref name=\"petr\"/><ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 259, 294</ref> He eventually became director of the latter institution.<ref name=\"petr\"/>\n\n===Political involvement===\nContinuing to live in Bucharest in the early years of the 20th century, he was associated with the traditional conservative circles of ''[[Junimea]]'' and Iorga.<ref name=\"s95\"/> By 1899, together with Co\u0219buc, Iorga, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Ovid Densusianu]], he was among the contributors to ''Rom\u00e2nia jun\u0103''.<ref name=\"petr\"/> He wrote an ample number of literary studies and made significant contributions to the history of 19th century Romanian literature.<ref name=\"i68\"/> Reviews that published his work included ''Convorbiri Literare'', ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'', ''[[Ramuri]]'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'' in the Old Kingdom, as well as Transylvanian outlets such as ''[[Luceaf\u0103rul (magazine)|Luceaf\u0103rul]]'' and ''[[Tribuna Poporului]]''.<ref name=\"i68\"/><ref name=\"s95\"/> Some of these studies, such as a 1906 analysis of literary historiography, methodically analyzed their subject.

The son of a poor merchant family from [[Bra\u0219ov]], he attended several universities before launching a career as a critic, first in his native town and then in [[Czernowitz]]. Eventually settling in [[Bucharest]], capital of the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], he managed to earn a university degree before teaching at a succession of high schools. Meanwhile, he continued publishing literary studies as well as intensifying an ardently nationalistic, Pan-Romanian activism. He urged the Romanian government to drop its neutrality policy and enter World War I; once this took place and his adopted home came under German occupation, he found himself arrested and deported to Bulgaria. After the war's conclusion and the [[union of Transylvania with Romania]], he became a literature professor at the newly founded [[Cluj University]]. There, he served as rector in the late 1920s, but found himself increasingly out of touch with modern trends in literature.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Origins, education and early career===\nHe was born in [[Bra\u0219ov]], in the [[Transylvania]] region.<ref name=\"v64\"/> His father Ioan (1832\u20131906) was a struggling small businessman who was forced to liquidate his store, leave his family and become a clerk in [[Sinaia]], in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]]; by the late 1880s, he was at a glass factory in nearby [[Azuga]]. His mother Elena (''n\u00e9e'' Munteanu; 1846\u20131911) raised seven boys and four girls. The oldest son, [[Ioan Bogdan]], would become a historian and philologian. Four of the sons earned university degrees, while a sister, Ecaterina, married [[Nicolae Iorga]] in 1901.<ref>Ioan Bogdan, ''Scrieri alese'', pp. 9&ndash;10.

He prided himself on being an intellectual disciple of [[Titu Maiorescu]], and was writing for the latter's ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'' by 1888. In the autumn of 1889, he was named a part-time teacher at the high school he had attended, but was soon fired after a conflict with the administration caused by his quick temper.<ref name=\"petr\"/> While in Bra\u0219ov, he frequently attended social gatherings for the young Romanian women of Bra\u0219ov, where he delivered public readings and sought to awaken the participants' interest in literature.<ref>Nastas\u0103 (2010), p. 130</ref>\n\nSubsequently entering the Austrian province of [[Bukovina]], he settled in its capital of [[Czernowitz]] (''Cern\u0103u\u021bi''), where he edited ''Gazeta Bucovinei'' from May 1893 to August 1894 and sought to raise popular interest in Romanian writers in a province that was fairly disconnected from the cultural life of the Old Kingdom.<ref name=\"petr\"/><ref name=\"i68\"/> While there, he published a biography of [[Petru Maior]] in 1893,<ref name=\"i68\"/> and in 1894 translated [[Ion Budai-Deleanu]]'s German-language notes on Bukovina into Romanian.<ref>Al.

From Bucharest, he was one of the chief contributors to ''Tribuna''. His objectives included making the reading public aware of important literature published in the 1880\u20131888 period; sharply criticizing the pseudo-celebrities of the day; and especially the popularization of aesthetic writings such as [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s ''Laoco\u00f6n'' and [[Hippolyte Taine]]'s ''The Philosophy of Art'', which had both recently appeared in translation.<ref name=\"i68\">Iancu, p. 68</ref> He also returned to teaching in 1897, first offering German courses in [[Curtea de Arge\u0219]] and then moving to [[Foc\u0219ani]] and [[Gala\u021bi]]. By 1899, he was desperate to relocate to the capital, with its rich institutions, worldly attractions and diverse population. He wrote from Foc\u0219ani asking his mentor [[Ioan Bianu]] to intervene on his behalf with [[Ministry of Education and Scientific Research (Romania)|Education Minister]] [[Spiru Haret]]. He was duly appointed to Bucharest's [[Cantemir Vod\u0103 National College|Dimitrie Cantemir High School]], where he taught from 1899 to 1909, and finally ended his high school career at [[Mihai Viteazul National College (Bucharest)|Mihai Viteazul High School]] in the same city, from 1909 to 1919.<ref name=\"petr\"/><ref>Nastas\u0103 (2007), pp. 259, 294</ref> He eventually became director of the latter institution.<ref name=\"petr\"/>\n\n===Political involvement===\nContinuing to live in Bucharest in the early years of the 20th century, he was associated with the traditional conservative circles of ''[[Junimea]]'' and Iorga.<ref name=\"s95\"/> By 1899, together with Co\u0219buc, Iorga, [[Ion Luca Caragiale]] and [[Ovid Densusianu]], he was among the contributors to ''Rom\u00e2nia jun\u0103''.<ref name=\"petr\"/> He wrote an ample number of literary studies and made significant contributions to the history of 19th century Romanian literature.<ref name=\"i68\"/> Reviews that published his work included ''Convorbiri Literare'', ''[[S\u0103m\u0103n\u0103torul]]'', ''[[Ramuri]]'' and ''[[Via\u021ba Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103]]'' in the Old Kingdom, as well as Transylvanian outlets such as ''[[Luceaf\u0103rul (magazine)|Luceaf\u0103rul]]'' and ''[[Tribuna Poporului]]''.<ref name=\"i68\"/><ref name=\"s95\"/> Some of these studies, such as a 1906 analysis of literary historiography, methodically analyzed their subject.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author [[plowed]] the [[screen actors guild of america]] with the fury of a white hot, white only [[aryan race]]. This was under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" - now confirmed to be [[Tom Cruise]] whom self-identified as [[Wendy Williams]]. In September 2017, someone claiming to be [[Chris Hansen]] updated a [[Pornhub]] account stating that [[gay rights]] had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under it's real name; in an effort to locate this [[snuff film]]  the [[corpse]] of [[J Edgar Hoover]], dressed in a ball gag and nothing else, according to [[ABC News]] and correspondent [[River Phoenix]]resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a screenplay designed to be a [[public relations]] stunt, so readers, would view the s [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction of [[Cedric the Entertainer]] and [[Joe Biden]], who had just [[plowed]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] who was in the act of [[drug overdose]] and [[sadomasochism]] with [[Janet Reno]]'s corpse, whilst a stuffed [[Nancy Reagan]] got plowed by a black [[El Chapo]]., but the work and the alleged online [[scatology]] of [[Hillary Clinton]] has also been described as too [[uncanny valley]], and hell itself; too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

Later author's notes claimed that someone hacked into Gilesbie's account and wrote chapters 39 and 40.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nThe true identity of the author became subject to wide speculation, and since the publication of the final chapter, various individuals have claimed to have written the work in jest or as a hoax.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Due to its \"systematically terrible\" quality, the work is often believed to be a [[satire]] or [[parody]] of fan fiction.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nAt the same time, the \"exceedingly complicated\" details of the work, including a series of related online accounts outside of FanFiction.net and the effort of writing a work of such length, led to a \"consensus\" among users of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] \u2014 a website notorious for online trolling and dedicated to cataloging \"internet culture\" \u2014 that it would be too difficult to fake and that Gilesbie was writing sincerely, a sentiment apparently shared by other online communities who mocked the author.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> [[Brad Kim]], editor of [[Know Your Meme]], supported the work as genuine, citing his experiences with writing workshops on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Xanga]] where he encountered similar works, as \"these were the kinds of things that would be formulated by a high-school teenager in the early 2000s\".<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Writing for [[Vulture.com]], Abraham Riesman wrote that \"[t]he mystery of the authorship of 'My Immortal' \u2014 even in this privacy-averse age \u2014 appears unsolvable.\"<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nA series of videos were uploaded to a [[YouTube]] account named ''xXblo0dyxkissxX'' in 2008 and 2009, with their most recent video being uploaded in 2016,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJWq0j9vfGc|title=Guess Who's Back?|date=15 January 2016}}</ref> in which two [[goth (subculture)|goths]] named Tara and Raven discuss their lives.

The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.

Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a non-canonical female vampire character named \"Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way\" and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, particularly her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].\n\nSince the beginning of the work's publication, it has gained infamy for its awful writing, plot inconsistency and complete disregard for the original ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction ever written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.\n\nThe author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as \"unsolvable\". The author published the story under the username \"XXXbloodyrists666XXX\" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'' and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.\n\nThe story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to [[Internet troll|troll]] readers and/or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.\n\n==Background and publication==\nThe work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.<ref name=\"Vulture\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of 'My Immortal,' the World's Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving \"{{sic|dubya}}\", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"TheVerge\">{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|url-status=live|accessdate=November 28, 2015}}</ref> However, no further chapters were published.

Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the \"[[Goth subculture|goffs]]\" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|\"goffik\"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.\n\nThe story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Draco invites Ebony to a [[Good Charlotte]] concert in Hogsmeade. She agrees, and they fly to Hogsmeade together in Draco's flying car. After the concert, they do not go back to the castle, but instead have intercourse in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as \"Albert Dumblydore\"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|\"motherfukers\"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry \"Vampire\" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he \"love[s] the taste of human blood\"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a gun and demands that she kill \"Vampire\" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].\n\nIn a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained, though it is possibly an intentional plot twist, as prior setup suggests Draco could not die in the manner described. It should also be noted that Ebony herself attempts suicide by slitting her wrists several times throughout the story, but it seems to have no negative effects on her. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]] (the inspiration for Ebony's last name), proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.\n\nDuring this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting \"black guy\" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] (\"Trevolry\") / [[Professor Sinistra]] (\"Sinister\", \"Sinatra\"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as \"Mc[[Google]]\" or \"McGoggles\") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called \"Snap\", or \"Snope\" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's \"death\" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with \"Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}\" to Ebony bathing, to which she responds with shooting them \"a gazillion times\". In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist. He visits Ebony in the nurse's office, where she is recovering from slitting her wrists, and bestows upon her a bouquet of pink roses, which he turns into a black flame, as to prove he's not a prep.\n\nEbony begins having mysterious visions, to which she confronts Professor Sinister. After gazing into a black crystal ball, she is told she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to \"Volxemortserum\". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself \"[[Satan]]\", and who has been mistakenly referred to as \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]\", \"[[Tom Bombadil]]\", and \"Stan\". \"Satan\" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.\n\nEventually, Ebony brings \"Satan\" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall, in which professor Snape threatens to rape Draco if Ebony does not stab Harry/Vampire. The story ends ambiguously with a shootout between Snape and Draco, Snape summoning Voldemort, and Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as \"[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]\".\n\n==Style and genre==\n''My Immortal'' is split into 44 chapters. Author's notes, indicated by \"AN\", both precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as \"standoffish\". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became \"defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s\" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] characterization from negative reviewers.<ref name=\"Vulture\" />\n\nAbraham Riesman of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having \"awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]\" and noted that the work is \"agonizing\" to a regular fan fiction reader because of \"all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]\" it employs in the opening passage alone.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /> Adi Robertson of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose \"never recovered\".<ref name=\"TheVerge\" /> Gavia Baker-Whitelaw of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work \"featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author\" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.<ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.<ref name=\"Vulture\" /><ref name=\"DailyDot\" />\n\nThe work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon.

In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.<ref name=\":3\">{{cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet's most beloved \u2014 and notorious \u2014 fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=September 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLater in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''[[Handbook for Mortals]]'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html|title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list?|work=LA Times|author=Jessica Roy|date=August 24, 2017|accessdate=August 25, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Italie>{{cite news|last=Italie|first=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}</ref> Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''.
