It was officially opened on 1 February 1920 in the presence of [[Ferdinand I of Romania|King Ferdinand]] and of the royal family. Representatives of the [[Allies of World War I]] and of countries neutral during the [[World War I|First World War]] were also present.\n\nThe following year, the [[Italy|Italian state]] made a gift to Romania of five copies of the [[Capitoline Wolf]]. One copy was sent to [[Bucharest]], to the [[Pia\u021ba Roman\u0103|Roman Square]], a second one to Cluj, [[Capitoline Wolf, Chi\u015fin\u0103u|a third to Chi\u015fin\u0103u]], a fourth to [[Timi\u0219oara]] and a fifth to [[T\u00e2rgu-Mure\u015f]]; they symbolised the unity of Romanians from all parts of the country and their [[Italic peoples|Latinity]]. The Cluj-Napoca monument, brought to Cluj by a delegation of 200 Italians, mostly students, is a faithful copy of the [[Capitoline Wolf]], with [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]] beneath her. To it was added a bas-relief of Emperor [[Trajan]], executed by sculptor Ettore Ferrari, along with the inscription ''Alla citta di Cluj, Roma Madre, MCMXXI'' (\"To the City of Cluj, Mother Rome, 1921\"). It was decided to place the monument in [[Unirii Square, Cluj-Napoca|Unirii Square]], in front of the [[Statue of Matthias Corvinus]]. The first Romanian mayor of Cluj, [[Iulian Pop]], unveiled the monument on 28 September 1921 in the presence of over 25,000 residents.\n\nAfter the [[Second Vienna Award]] in 1940, a significant part of Cluj's Romanian population was forced to leave the city; the statue too was taken away to safety. After the [[World War II|Second World War]], the statue was brought back to Cluj, but the prevailing political climate did not permit the statue to be put back in its original location, so it was placed in front of the [[Babe\u015f-Bolyai University|University]], where it remained until 1973, when the statue was again placed in Unirii Square. A group of statues of members of the [[Transylvanian School]] was set up in its place in front of the university.\n\nIn 1994 the statue was removed from its location at the intersection of [[Eroilor Boulevard, Cluj-Napoca|Eroilor Bd.]] and Unirii Square and replaced with the [[Memorandum Signers' Monument, Cluj-Napoca|Memorandum Signers' Monument]], erected in honour of the men who signed the [[Transylvanian Memorandum]] and had the strength to stand up to the [[Magyarization|de-nationalisation]] measures against Romanians being undertaken by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] government. The dedication of the monument took place exactly 100 years after the memorandum signers were sent to prison. The Statue of the She-Wolf was moved to the Transylvanian History Museum, where it was restored by the sculptor [[Liviu Mocan]], later being placed in the middle of Eroilor Boulevard.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Capitoline Wolf, Chi\u015fin\u0103u]] \n\n==References==\n* Bodea, Gheorghe.

The government felt betrayed by the LTTE in its earlier peace talks and looked into defeating the LTTE militarily. Ratwatte strongly advocated the recapture of the LTTE controlled [[Jaffna peninsula]]. Although symbolically important, the Army Commander [[Lieutenant General]] [[G. H. De Silva|Gerry De Silva]] refused to deploy troops to recapture the Jaffna peninsula due to the need for large troop numbers to defend it from the LTTE that would withdraw to the jungles of Wanni. De Silva was overruled and planning commenced under [[Major General]] [[Rohan Daluwatte]] for [[Operation Riviresa]]. Lunched in late 1995, Operation Riviresa under Daluwatte recapture of the Jaffna peninsula, but failed to cut off LTTE units that withdrew to the jungles of Wanni.

Government forces responded by recapturing the strategic town of [[Kilinochchi]]. Having the burden of defending the Jaffna peninsula and no land route to resupply, Ratwatte initiated [[Operation Jayasikurui]] in 1997; it failed to achieve its primary objective of gaining a land route to the Jaffna peninsula and was called off by President Kumaratunga in 1999. This lead to his falling out of favour with President Kumaratunga, who established the post of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sri Lanka)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] to reduce Ratwatte's influence over the operational matters of the military.

In the [[1994 Sri Lankan parliamentary election|1994 general election]], he was elected to parliament from the [[Kandy District]] from the Freedom Party and was appointed by [[Chandrika Kumaratunga]], his niece as [[Cabinet Minister]] for Power and Energy; and [[Ministry of Defense (Sri Lanka)|Deputy Defense Minister]]. While Kumaratunga held the portfolio of Minister of Defense.  \n\n==Cabinet Minister and Deputy Defence Minister==\nBecoming Kumaratunga's chief defense adviser, Lt. Colonel Ratwatte became the de-factor defence minister once hostilities in the [[Sri Lankan Civil War]] commenced following the [[Bombing of SLNS Sooraya and SLNS Ranasuru]] which started the [[Eelam War III]] in April 1995. The government felt betrayed by the LTTE in its earlier peace talks and looked into defeating the LTTE militarily. Ratwatte strongly advocated the recapture of the LTTE controlled [[Jaffna peninsula]]. Although symbolically important, the Army Commander [[Lieutenant General]] [[G. H. De Silva|Gerry De Silva]] refused to deploy troops to recapture the Jaffna peninsula due to the need for large troop numbers to defend it from the LTTE that would withdraw to the jungles of Wanni. De Silva was overruled and planning commenced under [[Major General]] [[Rohan Daluwatte]] for [[Operation Riviresa]]. Lunched in late 1995, Operation Riviresa under Daluwatte recapture of the Jaffna peninsula, but failed to cut off LTTE units that withdrew to the jungles of Wanni. The recapture of Jaffna was well celebrated and Ratwatte who oversaw it as deputy defence minister; was promoted to the rank of [[General (Sri Lanka)|General]] by President Chandrika Kumaratunga in 1995 and was awarded the [[Riviresa Campaign Services Medal]].<ref>[http://www.asiantribune.com/news/2011/11/24/sri-lanka%E2%80%99s-former-deputy-minister-defense-general-anuruddha-ratwatte-has-passed-awa Sri Lanka\u2019s former Deputy Minister of Defense General Anuruddha Ratwatte has passed away]</ref> The following year the government faced a major defeat in the [[Battle of Mullaitivu (1996)|Battle of Mullaitivu]] in which it lost an entire brigade and was forced to withdraw from Mullaitivu. Government forces responded by recapturing the strategic town of [[Kilinochchi]]. Having the burden of defending the Jaffna peninsula and no land route to resupply, Ratwatte initiated [[Operation Jayasikurui]] in 1997; it failed to achieve its primary objective of gaining a land route to the Jaffna peninsula and was called off by President Kumaratunga in 1999. This lead to his falling out of favour with President Kumaratunga, who established the post of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (Sri Lanka)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] to reduce Ratwatte's influence over the operational matters of the military. He remained a Cabinet Minister until his party was defeated in the 2001 general elections.\n\n==Later life==\nRatwatte was re-elected to Parliament in 2000 and 2001, however, he retired from politics in 2004, facing fraud and criminal charges against him since early 2000's.<ref>[http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/08/22/anuruddha-ratwatte-to-head-sl-mission-in-malaysia/ Anuruddha Ratwatte To Head SL Mission In Malaysia]</ref>\n\nHe died on 24 November 2011 at the Kandy General Hospital following complications of a fall he sustained in his home.

He is a [[pre-teen]] boy (His age is given as eight years old in the pilot episode but is changed to ten years old in the second episode) who is almost always seen wearing a striped [[T-shirt]] and shorts. Originally unnamed (as were all of the family members), the character who was apparently the prototype for Pugsley first appeared in the [[Charles Addams]] cartoons in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' during the 1930s. In this first incarnation, he was portrayed as a deviant child with a vicious nature, shown committing deplorable acts with his sister. In all incarnations, he is overweight. In the television series, Pugsley usually eats over five pieces of cake at birthday parties.\n\n{{quote|An energetic monster of a boy\u2026blond red hair, popped blue eyes and a dedicated troublemaker, in other words the kid next door\u2026genius in his own way, he makes toy [[guillotine]]s, full size [[rack (torture)|rack]]s, threatens to poison his sister, can turn himself into a [[Mr. Hyde]] with an ordinary chemical set\u2026his voice is hoarse\u2026is sometimes allowed an occasional cigar.<ref>[http://www.charlesaddams.com Tee & Charles Addams Foundation]</ref>|[[Charles Addams]]}}\n\nWhen the characters were given names for the television series, he was originally going to be called \"Pubert\" (a derivation of the word [[puberty]], possibly a reflection of his age) but it was rejected as it sounded too sexual, and the name Pugsley was chosen instead. (The name Pubert was later used when Gomez and Morticia have a third child in the film ''[[Addams Family Values]]''.) The Lurch Files' Addams Family Tree lists Pugsley's middle name as Pubert, probably as an homage to Charles Addams' original suggestion.\n\nIn the [[American television]] series, Pugsley is played by child actor [[Ken Weatherwax]]. This incarnation of the character is more jovial and inventive; he displays outlandish engineering skills, including the invention of a disintegrator gun, an anti-gravity gun, and other devices. He and Gomez created a computer named Whizzo and a robot named Smiley (played by [[Robby the Robot]]). Pugsley and his younger sister [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] often play together, rarely exhibiting signs of sibling rivalry; they share an interest in [[spider]]s, [[dynamite]], [[guillotine]]s, and other dangerous \"toys.\"\n\nIn an early episode, \"Morticia and the Psychiatrist\", the rest of the family is concerned that Pugsley is engaging in behavior they consider \"odd\": wearing a [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scout]] uniform, playing with a puppy, etc. When sent to a [[psychiatrist]], Pugsley tells of boyhood incidents involving [[hanging]]s, [[machine guns]], and [[grenades]], with no clue that others might find these accounts unusual.\n\nIn most incarnations of the character, Pugsley had an unusual hobby of [[road sign theft|stealing road signs]], which he used to adorn the walls and door of his bedroom. This may have evolved from an original Addams cartoon in which, rather than road signs, he would steal and decorate his room with cautionary signs, such as high voltage and shallow water signs, thus leading others into danger. He also has a pet [[octopus]] named [[Aristotle]].\n\nIn the 1970s, there was an [[The Addams Family (1973 animated series)|animated series]] about the family, in which Pugsley was voiced by actress [[Jodie Foster]]. Foster voiced that same character in an episode of ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]''. In the [[The Addams Family (1992 animated series)|second animated series]], Pugsley was voiced by [[Jeannie Elias]].\n\nIn the 1977 TV movie, [[Ken Weatherwax]] played a grown-up Pugsley, who has become a witch-doctor. In the interval between the original TV series and this movie his parents have had two more children, who look just like the original Pugsley and Wednesday. He is known as [[Pericles]] Addams in Spanish-speaking countries and in Brazil (Portuguese) as \"Feioso\" (Ugly).\n\nThe 1998 series ''The New Addams Family'' features Pugsley played by [[Vancouver]] native Brody Smith. He is essentially the same as the original 1960s incarnation; however the influence of director John Bell's namesake Charlie 'Edge' Bell is undeniable. Also, he is portrayed as the younger sibling, as opposed to Wednesday.\n\n==Film versions==\n[[Image:Addams kids.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] (left) and Pugsley in ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' film (1991).]]\nIn the film ''[[The Addams Family (1991 film)|The Addams Family]]'' and its [[sequel]], ''[[Addams Family Values]]'', Pugsley is played by [[Jimmy Workman]].  He acts as an unwitting accomplice to his older sister, Wednesday, who makes attempts to inflict lethal harm upon him - although he has returned the favor on occasion.\n\nIn ''The Addams Family'', Pugsley and Wednesday open a lemonade stand, but their drinks are toxic, and cause [[Lurch (The Addams family)|Lurch]] to spit flames when he tries it.\n\nIn ''Addams Family Values'', Wednesday and Pugsley are sent to Camp Chippewa, a [[summer camp]], where they are forced to participate in a [[Thanksgiving]]-themed play entitled ''A Turkey Called Brotherhood''. Pugsley is cast as a dancing [[domesticated turkey|turkey]], and leads the children in a [[refrain|chorus]] of \"''Eat Us''\"; He is later seen assisting Wednesday in overthrowing the camp counselors and setting fire to the grounds.\n\nIn the film ''[[Addams Family Reunion]]'', Pugsley (now played by [[Jerry Messing]]) behaves (for the most part) similarly to his previous two film incarnations. At the Addams Family's family reunion he falls for a young girl named Gina (played by [[Haylie Duff]]).  According to Pugsley, his name means \"stomach pump\" in [[Bulgaria]]n.\n\nIn the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[The Addams Family (musical)|The Addams Family]]'', Pugsley is played by [[Adam Riegler]] as the younger sibling, around eleven years old, seven years younger than 18-year-old [[Wednesday Addams|Wednesday]] (played by [[Krysta Rodriguez]]).\n\nIn the national tour (2011-2012), Pugsley was played by Patrick D. Kennedy (u.s. Jason Testa).
