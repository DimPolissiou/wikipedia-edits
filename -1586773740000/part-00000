Early precursors to some types of intellectual property existed in societies such as [[Ancient Rome]], but the modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The term \"intellectual property\" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.<ref name=\"Lemley 2005\">\"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations.\" in [[Mark A.

Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or literature can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of copyright law|History of patent law}}\n[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]\n\nThe [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,<ref>{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760\u20131911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}</ref> firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.\n\n\"Literary property\" was the term predominantly used in the British legal debates of the 1760s and 1770s over the extent to which authors and publishers of works also had rights deriving from the common law of property (''[[Millar v Taylor]]'' (1769), ''[[Hinton v Donaldson]]'' (1773), ''[[Donaldson v Becket]]'' (1774)).

Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,<ref>Ronald V.

They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.\n# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not.

In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{further|Criticism of patents|Opposition to copyright}}\n[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Sweden]] in support of [[file sharing]], 2006.]]\n[[File:GlamCamp NY Kippelboy nina Paley (2).JPG|thumb|\"Copying is not theft!\" badge with a character resembling [[Mickey Mouse]] in reference to the in popular culture rationale behind the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998]]\n\n===The term \"intellectual property\"===\nCriticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law.

Kinsella uses the following scenario to argue this point:\n<blockquote>[I]magine the time when men lived in caves. One bright guy&mdash;let's call him Galt-Magnon&mdash;decides to build a log cabin on an open field, near his crops. To be sure, this is a good idea, and others notice it. They naturally imitate Galt-Magnon, and they start building their own cabins. But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea. Clearly, this rule flies in the face of the first-user homesteading rule, arbitrarily and groundlessly overriding the very homesteading rule that is at the foundation of all property rights.<ref>[https://mises.org/books/against.pdf N.

In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.<ref>Dennis Wharton, \"MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin,\" Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.</ref> These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.<ref>William W.

The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls \"piracy\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[Information Society Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |last=Smith |first=Brett |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007\u20132010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref> Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.\n\nIn the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of \"trademark\", as exemplified by the [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states.

Early precursors to some types of intellectual property existed in societies such as [[Ancient Rome]], but the modern concept of intellectual property developed in England in the 17th and 18th centuries.  The term \"intellectual property\" began to be used in the 19th century, though it was not until the late 20th century that intellectual property became commonplace in the majority of the world's legal systems.<ref name=\"Lemley 2005\">\"property as a common descriptor of the field probably traces to the foundation of the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO) by the United Nations.\" in [[Mark A.

This gives economic incentive for their creation, because it allows people to profit from the information and intellectual goods they create.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}} These economic incentives are expected to stimulate innovation and contribute to the technological progress of countries, which depends on the extent of protection granted to innovators.<ref>Rod Falvey and Neil Foster (2006): \u201cThe Role of Intellectual Property Rights in Technology Transfer and Economic Growth\u201d: Theory and Evidence, In cooperation with Olga Memedovic UNITED NATIONS INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION (UNIDO),  available: https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2009-04/Role_of_intellectual_property_rights_in_technology_transfer_and_economic_growth_0.pdf</ref>\n\nThe [[Intangible property|intangible]] nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is \"indivisible\", since an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation: a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, but a producer of information or literature can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent the goods' wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18\u201319}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of copyright law|History of patent law}}\n[[File:Statute of anne.jpg|thumb|The [[Statute of Anne]] came into force in 1710]]\n\nThe [[Statute of Monopolies]] (1624) and the British [[Statute of Anne]] (1710) are seen as the origins of [[patent law]] and [[copyright]] respectively,<ref>{{cite book |last=Brad |first=Sherman |author2=Lionel Bently |title=The making of modern intellectual property law: the British experience, 1760\u20131911 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1999 |page=207 |url=https://www.google.com/books?id=u2aMRA-eF1gC&dq=statute+of+anne+copyright&lr=&as_brr=3&source=gbs_navlinks_s |isbn=978-0-521-56363-5}}</ref> firmly establishing the concept of intellectual property.\n\n\"Literary property\" was the term predominantly used in the British legal debates of the 1760s and 1770s over the extent to which authors and publishers of works also had rights deriving from the common law of property (''[[Millar v Taylor]]'' (1769), ''[[Hinton v Donaldson]]'' (1773), ''[[Donaldson v Becket]]'' (1774)).

An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Generally speaking, it is what makes a product look appealing, and as such, it increases the commercial value of goods.<ref name=\"wipo.int\"/>\n\n===Plant varieties===\n{{Main|Plant breeders' rights}}\n[[Plant breeders' rights]] or plant variety rights are the rights to commercially use a new variety of a plant.

There is no formal government protection granted; each business must take measures to guard its own trade secrets (e.g., Formula of its soft drinks is a trade secret for Coca-Cola.)\n\n==Object of intellectual property law==\nThe main purpose of intellectual property law is to encourage the creation of a wide variety of intellectual goods for consumers.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  To achieve this, the law gives people and businesses property rights to the information and intellectual goods they create, usually for a limited period of time.  Because they can then profit from them, this gives economic incentive for their creation.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|p=17}}  The intangible nature of intellectual property presents difficulties when compared with traditional property like land or goods.  Unlike traditional property, intellectual property is indivisible \u2013 an unlimited number of people can \"consume\" an intellectual good without it being depleted.  Additionally, investments in intellectual goods suffer from problems of appropriation \u2013 while a landowner can surround their land with a robust fence and hire armed guards to protect it, a producer of information or an intellectual good can usually do very little to stop their first buyer from replicating it and selling it at a lower price. Balancing rights so that they are strong enough to encourage the creation of information and intellectual goods but not so strong that they prevent their wide use is the primary focus of modern intellectual property law.{{sfnp|Goldstein|Reese|2008|pp=18\u201319}}\n\nBy exchanging limited exclusive rights for disclosure of inventions and creative works, society and the patentee/copyright owner mutually benefit, and an incentive is created for inventors and authors to create and disclose their work. Some commentators have noted that the objective of intellectual property legislators and those who support its implementation appears to be \"absolute protection\". \"If some intellectual property is desirable because it encourages innovation, they reason, more is better. The thinking is that creators will not have sufficient incentive to invent unless they are legally entitled to capture the full social value of their inventions\".<ref name=\"Mark A. Lemley\" /> This absolute protection or full value view treats intellectual property as another type of \"real\" property, typically adopting its law and rhetoric. Other recent developments in intellectual property law, such as the [[Leahy\u2013Smith America Invents Act|America Invents Act]], stress international harmonization. Recently there has also been much debate over the desirability of using intellectual property rights to protect cultural heritage, including intangible ones, as well as over risks of [[commodification]] derived from this possibility.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Farah |first1=Paolo Davide |last2=Tremolada |first2=Riccardo |title=Desirability of Commodification of Intangible Cultural Heritage: The Unsatisfying Role of Intellectual Property Rights |journal=Transnational Dispute Management |date=March 15, 2014 |volume=11 |issue=2 |ssrn=2472339 }}</ref> The issue still remains open in legal scholarship.\n\n===Financial incentive===\nThese exclusive rights allow owners of intellectual property to benefit from the property they have created, providing a financial incentive for the creation of an investment in intellectual property, and, in case of patents, pay associated [[research and development]] costs.<ref name=\"MonoProf\">{{cite web | url=http://www.uclan.ac.uk/schools/school_of_health/research_projects/files/health_innova_IPR_reform_report.pdf | title=Prudential Reasons for IPR Reform.

Personality theorists believe intellectual property is an extension of an individual. Utilitarians believe that intellectual property stimulates social progress and pushes people to further innovation. Lockeans argue that intellectual property is justified based on deservedness and hard work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/intellectual-property/|title=Intellectual Property|last=Moore|first=Adam|year=2014|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University}}</ref>\n\nVarious moral justifications for private property can be used to argue in favor of the morality of intellectual property, such as:\n\n# ''Natural Rights/Justice Argument'': this argument is based on Locke's idea that a person has a natural right over the labour and products which are produced by their body. Appropriating these products is viewed as unjust. Although Locke had never explicitly stated that natural right applied to products of the mind,<ref>Ronald V.

They argue that we own our bodies which are the laborers, this right of ownership extends to what we create. Thus, intellectual property ensures this right when it comes to production.\n# ''Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument'': according to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not.

The belief is that the human mind itself is the source of wealth and survival and that all property at its base is intellectual property.

In the United States, trade secrets are protected under state law, and states have nearly universally adopted the [[Uniform Trade Secrets Act]]. The United States also has federal law in the form of the [[Economic Espionage Act of 1996]] ({{usc|18|1831|1839}}), which makes the theft or misappropriation of a trade secret a federal crime. This law contains two provisions criminalizing two sorts of activity. The first, {{uscsub|18|1831|a}}, criminalizes the theft of trade secrets to benefit foreign powers. The second, {{usc|18|1832}}, criminalizes their theft for commercial or economic purposes. (The statutory penalties are different for the two offenses.) In [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] [[common law]] jurisdictions, confidentiality and trade secrets are regarded as an [[Equity (law)|equitable]] right rather than a [[property]] right but penalties for theft are roughly the same as in the United States.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n==Criticisms==\n{{further|Criticism of patents|Opposition to copyright}}\n[[File:Pro piracy demonstration.jpg|thumb|Demonstration in [[Sweden]] in support of [[file sharing]], 2006.]]\n[[File:GlamCamp NY Kippelboy nina Paley (2).JPG|thumb|\"Copying is not theft!\" badge with a character resembling [[Mickey Mouse]] in reference to the in popular culture rationale behind the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998]]\n\n===The term \"intellectual property\"===\nCriticism of the term ''intellectual property'' ranges from discussing its vagueness and abstract overreach to direct contention to the semantic validity of using words like ''property'' and ''rights'' in fashions that contradict practice and law.

But the first man to invent a house, according to IP advocates, would have a right to prevent others from building houses on their own land, with their own logs, or to charge them a fee if they do build houses. It is plain that the innovator in these examples becomes a partial owner of the tangible property (e.g., land and logs) of others, due not to first occupation and use of that property (for it is already owned), but due to his coming up with an idea.

In amicus briefs in important cases, in lobbying before Congress, and in its statements to the public, the MPAA has advocated strong protection of intellectual-property rights. In framing its presentations, the association has claimed that people are entitled to the property that is produced by their labor. Additionally Congress's awareness of the position of the United States as the world's largest producer of films has made it convenient to expand the conception of intellectual property.<ref>Dennis Wharton, \"MPAA's Rebel With Cause Fights for Copyright Coin,\" Variety (August 3, 1992), Vol. 348, No. 2, p. 18.</ref> These doctrinal reforms have further strengthened the industry, lending the MPAA even more power and authority.<ref>William W. Fisher III, [http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/property99/history.html The Growth of Intellectual Property:A History of the Ownership of Ideas in the United States] Eigentumskulturen im Vergleich (Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1999)</ref>\n\nThe growth of the [[Internet]], and particularly distributed search engines like [[Kazaa]] and [[Gnutella]], have represented a challenge for copyright policy. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]], in particular, has been on the front lines of the fight against [[copyright infringement]], which the industry calls \"piracy\". The industry has had victories against some services, including a highly publicized case against the file-sharing company [[Napster]], and some people have been prosecuted for sharing files in violation of copyright. The electronic age has seen an increase in the attempt to use software-based [[digital rights management]] tools to restrict the copying and use of digitally based works. Laws such as the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] have been enacted that use criminal law to prevent any circumvention of software used to enforce digital rights management systems. Equivalent provisions, to prevent circumvention of copyright protection have existed in EU for some time, and are being expanded in, for example, Article 6 and 7 the [[Information Society Directive|Copyright Directive]]. Other examples are Article 7 of the Software Directive of 1991 (91/250/EEC), and the [[Conditional Access Directive]] of 1998 (98/84/EEC). This can hinder legal uses, affecting [[public domain]] works, [[limitations and exceptions to copyright]], or uses allowed by the copyright holder. Some [[copyleft]] licenses, like [[GNU GPL 3]], are designed to counter that.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.en.html |title=A Quick Guide to GPLv3 |last=Smith |first=Brett |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2007\u20132010 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}</ref> Laws may permit circumvention under specific conditions like when it is necessary to achieve interoperability with the circumventor's program, or for [[accessibility]] reasons; however, distribution of circumvention tools or instructions may be illegal.\n\nIn the context of trademarks, this expansion has been driven by international efforts to harmonise the definition of \"trademark\", as exemplified by the [[TRIPS Agreement|Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] ratified in 1994, which formalized regulations for IP rights that had been handled by common law, or not at all, in member states. Pursuant to TRIPs, any [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is \"capable of distinguishing\" the products or services of one business from the products or services of another business is capable of constituting a trademark.<ref>Katherine Beckman and Christa Pletcher (2009) [http://ipjournal.law.wfu.edu/files/2010/10/article.10.215.pdf Expanding Global Trademark Regulation] Wake Forest Intellectual Property Law Journal 10(2): 215\u2013239</ref>\n\n===Use in corporate tax avoidance===\n{{see also|Corporate tax haven}}\n{{quote box\n|width=23em|border=1px|align=right|bgcolor=#c6dbf7|qalign=left\n|quote = Make no mistake: the headline [tax] rate is not what triggers tax evasion and aggressive tax planning.

After meeting with producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]] in Sweden, the singer recorded several songs for the album, including \"Lucky\".

In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 5, and is Spears' tenth best-selling single in the country, having sold over 225,000 copies there. It also peaked at number 23 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' in the United States. An accompanying music video was directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], and portrays Spears as herself and a melancholy movie star Lucky, who just wants to have some fun in life.

According to Jocelyn Vena of [[MTV]], Spears portrays \"a melancholy movie star who wants nothing more than to have a little fun\".<ref name=\"iwg\" />\n\nThe video begins with Spears telling a story about a very famous [[Hollywood]] actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, standing on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells \"Cut! We've got it\". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: \"Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!\" She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the [[Academy Awards]] accepting her [[Academy Award for Best Actress|award for Best Actress]]. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.\n\nA ''Billboard'' staff reviewer noted that the story \"turned out to be less than pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/464875/britney-spears-20-biggest-billboard-hits|title=Britney Spears' 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|author=Billboard Staff|date=2011-12-02|accessdate=2012-03-24|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]'' rated the video a C+ and stated that: \"Britney's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn't seem quite as telling at the time, but with a little distance, the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/britney_spears_music_video_report_4rrLUSeEJQRZusLm464f1K |title=Britney Spears' Music Video Report Card |last=Wieselman |first=Jarret |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |work=[[New York Post]] |publisher=Paul Carlucci |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706220031/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/britney_spears_music_video_report_4rrLUSeEJQRZusLm464f1K |archivedate=2013-07-06 }}</ref> A writer of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that \"Lucky\" is best known for \"being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme: her conflicted relationship to fame\".<ref name=rstone>{{cite journal|url=|title=The Complete Video Guide: \"Lucky\"|year=2009|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Reporter|first=Rolling Stone|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n\n== Live performances and cover version ==\n[[File:Taylor Swift - Speak Now tour 2011 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Taylor Swift]] covered \"Lucky\" during her [[Speak Now World Tour]], 2011.]]\n\nSpears performed \"Lucky\" for the first time during her [[Oops!...

It was released on August 8, 2000 by [[Jive Records]] as the second single from her second studio album ''[[Oops!... I Did It Again (album)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]''. After meeting with producers [[Max Martin]] and [[Rami Yacoub]] in Sweden, the singer recorded several songs for the album, including \"Lucky\". The song tells a story about a famous movie star named Lucky, who, despite seemingly having it all \u2013 fame, wealth, beauty \u2013 is truly lonely and unhappy on the inside. It was praised by [[music journalism|music critics]], who considered its melody and rhythm as sweet and catchy, and noted the lyrics to be about Spears herself.\n\n\"Lucky\" achieved commercial success worldwide, peaking at number 1 in Austria, Germany, Sweden and Switzerland, while reaching the top 10 in several European countries. In the United Kingdom, the song peaked at number 5, and is Spears' tenth best-selling single in the country, having sold over 225,000 copies there. It also peaked at number 23 on the ''[[Billboard Hot 100]]'' in the United States. An accompanying music video was directed by [[Dave Meyers (director)|Dave Meyers]], and portrays Spears as herself and a melancholy movie star Lucky, who just wants to have some fun in life. Spears has performed \"Lucky\" in a number of live appearances and in two of her [[concert tour]]s.\n\n==Background and composition==\n{{Listen\n|pos=left\n|filename=LuckySample.ogg\n|title=\"Lucky\"\n|description=A 21-second sample of the song's chorus, which features Spears singing about a lonely pop star.<ref name=sheet/><ref name=canoe/>\n|format=[[Ogg]]\n}}\nIn 1999, Spears began work on her second studio album ''[[Oops!...

According to Jocelyn Vena of [[MTV]], Spears portrays \"a melancholy movie star who wants nothing more than to have a little fun\".<ref name=\"iwg\" />\n\nThe video begins with Spears telling a story about a very famous [[Hollywood]] actress named Lucky. Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains, standing on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges, inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony. As beautiful and rich as she is, on set she sits on the star-shape in the sky, as she is acting, she is looking quite distressed. After the first chorus, she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers, then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror. Next, Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man, who then takes her in his arms, as the director yells \"Cut! We've got it\". Lucky then walks off-set into the studio, replying to the director: \"Finally! We've done it fifty-million times!\" She then goes to have her hair and makeup done; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side. Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the [[Academy Awards]] accepting her [[Academy Award for Best Actress|award for Best Actress]]. Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness. She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo, where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set. She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd. The limo drives away, leaving Spears behind on the red carpet. The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep, her make-up already stained on her face. The curtains close, ending the video.\n\nA ''Billboard'' staff reviewer noted that the story \"turned out to be less than pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/464875/britney-spears-20-biggest-billboard-hits|title=Britney Spears' 20 Biggest Billboard Hits|author=Billboard Staff|date=2011-12-02|accessdate=2012-03-24|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]}}</ref> Jarett Wieselman of the ''[[New York Post]]'' rated the video a C+ and stated that: \"Britney's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn't seem quite as telling at the time, but with a little distance, the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/britney_spears_music_video_report_4rrLUSeEJQRZusLm464f1K |title=Britney Spears' Music Video Report Card |last=Wieselman |first=Jarret |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |work=[[New York Post]] |publisher=Paul Carlucci |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706220031/http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/popwrap/britney_spears_music_video_report_4rrLUSeEJQRZusLm464f1K |archivedate=2013-07-06 }}</ref> A writer of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' said that \"Lucky\" is best known for \"being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme: her conflicted relationship to fame\".<ref name=rstone>{{cite journal|url=|title=The Complete Video Guide: \"Lucky\"|year=2009|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Reporter|first=Rolling Stone|issn=0035-791X}}</ref>\n\n== Live performances and cover version ==\n[[File:Taylor Swift - Speak Now tour 2011 02.jpg|left|thumb|[[Taylor Swift]] covered \"Lucky\" during her [[Speak Now Tour]], 2011.]]\n\nSpears performed \"Lucky\" for the first time during her [[Oops!...
