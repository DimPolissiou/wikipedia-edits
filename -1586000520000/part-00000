K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by J. K. Rowling|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The PIT: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne stuggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!\n=== Off-Off Broadway (2015) ===\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2016) ===\nThe Elektra Theater\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2017) ===\nNew World Stages\n!\n=== Entertainment Quarter (2019) ===\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990's, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by J. K. Rowling|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The PIT: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on July 2, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a two night run. The production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltsby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for more than a year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Production design was by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Herrick Goldman, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keef and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne stuggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n==== Character ====\n!\n=== Off-Off Broadway (2015) ===\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2016) ===\nThe Elektra Theater\n!\n=== Off-Broadway (2017) ===\nNew World Stages\n!\n=== Entertainment Quarter (2019) ===\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for the [[Antonov An-12]]. It was designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an [[aerial refueling]] tanker or command center.\n\nThe Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried. It has also been used as an emergency response transport for civilian evacuations as well as for humanitarian aid and disaster relief around the world. Because of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Specialized models have also been produced for aerial firefighting and zero-G training.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Volga-Dnepr IL-76 RA-76950 (8222957212) (2).jpg|thumb|The Il-76 is a [[high-wing]] freighter with [[Four-engined jet aircraft|four turbofans]] and a [[T-tail]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe aircraft was first conceived by [[Ilyushin]] in 1967 to meet a requirement for a freighter able to carry a payload of 40 tons (88,000&nbsp;lb) over a range of 5,000&nbsp;km (2,700 [[nautical mile|nmi]]; 3,100 [[statute mile|mi]]) in less than six hours, able to operate from short and unprepared airstrips, and capable of coping with the worst weather conditions likely to be experienced in Siberia and the Soviet Union's Arctic regions.

The Il-76 carried 89% of Soviet troops and 74% of the freight that was airlifted. As Afghan rebels were unable to shoot down high-flying Il-76s, their tactics were to try and damage it on takeoff or landing. Il-76s were often hit by shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] and [[9K34 Strela-3|Strela]] heat-seeking missiles and large-calibre machine gun fire, but because the strong airframes were able to take substantial damage and still remain operational, the aircraft had a remarkably low [[attrition rate]] during this period of conflict. Building on that experience, the bulk of the Canadian Forces equipment into Afghanistan was flown in using civilian Il-76s.<ref>[http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 Canadian Parliament Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150828/http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 |date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> In 2006, the Russian Air Force had about 200 Il-76s.

It was first planned as a commercial freighter in 1967, as a replacement for the [[Antonov An-12]]. It was designed to deliver heavy machinery to remote, poorly served areas. Military versions of the Il-76 have been widely used in Europe, Asia and Africa, including use as an [[aerial refueling]] tanker or command center.\n\nThe Il-76 has seen extensive service as a commercial freighter for ramp-delivered cargo, especially for outsized or heavy items unable to be otherwise carried. It has also been used as an emergency response transport for civilian evacuations as well as for humanitarian aid and disaster relief around the world. Because of its ability to operate from unpaved runways, it has been useful in undeveloped areas. Specialized models have also been produced for aerial firefighting and zero-G training.\n\n==Design and development==\n[[File:Volga-Dnepr IL-76 RA-76950 (8222957212) (2).jpg|thumb|The Il-76 is a [[high-wing]] freighter with [[Four-engined jet aircraft|four turbofans]] and a [[T-tail]]]]\n\n===Origins===\nThe aircraft was first conceived by [[Ilyushin]] in 1967 to meet a requirement for a freighter able to carry a payload of 40 tons (88,000&nbsp;lb) over a range of 5,000&nbsp;km (2,700 [[nautical mile|nmi]]; 3,100 [[statute mile|mi]]) in less than six hours, able to operate from short and unprepared airstrips, and capable of coping with the worst weather conditions likely to be experienced in Siberia and the Soviet Union's Arctic regions. It was intended to replace the [[Antonov An-12]]. Another intended version was a double-decked 250-passenger airliner but that project was cancelled.

The Il-76 carried 89% of Soviet troops and 74% of the freight that was airlifted. As Afghan rebels were unable to shoot down high-flying Il-76s, their tactics were to try and damage it on takeoff or landing. Il-76s were often hit by shoulder-launched [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] and [[9K34 Strela-3|Strela]] heat-seeking missiles and large-calibre machine gun fire, but because the strong airframes were able to take substantial damage and still remain operational, the aircraft had a remarkably low [[attrition rate]] during this period of conflict. Building on that experience, the bulk of the Canadian Forces equipment into Afghanistan was flown in using civilian Il-76s.<ref>[http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 Canadian Parliament Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013150828/http://cmte.parl.gc.ca/cmte/CommitteePublication.aspx?SourceId=187014 |date=October 13, 2007}}</ref> In 2006, the Russian Air Force had about 200 Il-76s.

The second half of the Giro began with a challenging mountain stage that finished outside Italy, the first of three stages in this Giro that did so. This stage resulted in the race lead transferring from [[Andrea No\u00e8]] to his teammate and team leader [[Danilo Di Luca]], who did not relinquish this lead and finished the race as its champion.\n\nThe battle for the other two spots on the Giro podium also began in stage 12 but was not resolved until later in the race. [[Andy Schleck]] from {{ct|SAX|2007}} won the white jersey in Milan as the [[Young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|Giro's best rider under 25]], and was in a competition with [[Eddy Mazzoleni]], [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] to see who would round out the podium with Di Luca. It was in the marquee stages of the second half of the race that Schleck and Mazzoleni distinguished themselves as podium favorites, eventually finishing the race second and third overall, respectively. {{ct|FOT|2007}} showed well, with Ricc\u00f2 and Simoni both taking mountain stage wins and [[Leonardo Piepoli]] winning the green jersey in Milan as the [[Mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia|Giro's best climber]].\n\n[[Alessandro Petacchi]] from {{ct|MRM|2007}} won two stages in the second half of the Giro, and the [[points classification in the Giro d'Italia|points classification]], but his subsequent [[2007 Giro d'Italia#Doping cases|disqualification for a non-negative salbutamol test]] given earlier in the race nullified these victories.\n\n{{-}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=4| Legend<ref>Jerseys appearing in the table on the left of the page indicate those worn by the cyclist during the particular stage, while those appearing in the table on the right of the page indicate those awarded to the cyclist after the stage.</ref>\n|-\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|alt=A pink jersey]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Denotes the leader of the [[General classification in the Giro d'Italia|General classification]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|alt=A green jersey]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Denotes the leader of the [[Mountains classification in the Giro d'Italia|Mountains classification]]\n|-\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Jersey violet.svg|20px|alt=A violet jersey]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Denotes the leader of the [[Points classification in the Giro d'Italia|Points classification]]\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;[[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|alt=A white jersey]]&nbsp;&nbsp;\n| Denotes the leader of the [[Young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|Young rider classification]]\n|-\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;\n| colspan=3|s.t. indicates that the rider crossed the finish line in the same group as the one receiving the time above him, and was therefore credited with the same finishing time.\n|}\n\n==Stage 12==\n;24 May 2007 &ndash; [[Scalenghe]] to [[Brian\u00e7on]] ([[France]]), {{convert|163|km|abbr=on}}\n\nThis was the first major mountain stage of the Giro. The course included two difficult first-category climbs, as the route passed from Italy into France. The first of these climbs was the [[Col Agnel|Colle dell'Agnello]], which crested just inside the French border. This was the ''Cima Coppi'', the highest climb in the race. The climb took stretched for {{convert|21.3|km|1|abbr=on}} and reached a vertical elevation of {{convert|2744|m|abbr=on}}. The [[Col d'Izoard]] later on is only marginally shorter and less steep, reaching {{convert|2360|m|abbr=on}} in elevation after {{convert|14.2|km|1|abbr=on}} on the road, for a steady 7.1% gradient. The finish came on a steep descent into [[Brian\u00e7on]], a popular host town for the [[Tour de France]].<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/giro07/?id=stages/giro0712\n|title=Stage 12 - Thursday, May 24: Scalenghe - Brian\u00e7on (Francia), 163 km\n|date=2007-05-11\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-14\n}}</ref>\n\nThis France-bound stage had a breakaway group consisting of two French riders each representing a French team: [[Yoann Le Boulanger]] of {{ct|BTL|2007}} and [[Christophe Riblon]] of {{ct|ALM|2007}}. By the {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} mark, the duo had a 17 and a half minute advantage on the peloton, as the other riders were conserving themselves for the big climbs ahead. The {{ct|FOT|2007}} team, and in particular [[Leonardo Piepoli]], did the pacemaking on the ascent of the Colle dell'Agnello, and after a few kilometers of the climb only a select group of overall favorites remained together as the first chase group. One surprising rider to crack was two-time Giro winner [[Paolo Savoldelli]], who lost contact with the group of favorites {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} from the summit of the Agnello and lost five minutes to them at day's end. Savoldelli was still hurt from the previous day's crash, and informed his [[Cycling domestique#Hierarchy among domestiques|lieutenant]] [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] that he should keep the pace for as long as he could and ride his own race, and that Savoldelli would look after himself.\n\n[[File:Piepoli 1C.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A cyclist in a yellow and white jersey with black trim rides alongside a yellow guard rail.|[[Leonardo Piepoli]] set a pace during this stage that cracked most of the main field.]]\n\nIn the front of the race, Le Boulanger was the first over the Agnello, winning the prize that went with conquering the ''Cima Coppi''. Riblon followed 1'30\" behind him; the group of overall favorites was still 13 minutes behind at the summit of the climb. Piepoli's pacemaking on the ascent had succeeded in whittling the group down to just himself, [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], [[Danilo Di Luca]], Mazzoleni, [[Andy Schleck]], and [[Stefano Garzelli]]. [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]], Savoldelli, [[Yaroslav Popovych]], and overnight race leader [[Andrea No\u00e8]] had all been in this group at the beginning of the climb, but were all eventually cracked by the pace.\n\nPiepoli continued to pull the Simoni group through the descent from the Agnello and the beginning of the Iozard climb, absorbing Riblon in the process. Le Boulanger was alone in the front of the race as the ascent of the Iozard began, 3 minutes ahead of Simoni's group. With {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} left in the climb, Piepoli broke away from the group he had been pacing, in a move to see who could match his acceleration. Di Luca and Schleck quickly made the bridge, with Simoni holding their wheels, but Cunego and Garzelli did not react as quickly and had to expend more energy to stay with the leaders. Later, Garzelli was dropped by this group's pace, and lost 2 minutes to them at the finish line. This group caught Le Boulanger {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=on}} before the summit of the Iozard.\n\nSeconds before reaching that summit, Di Luca attacked from the leading group and came free, taking maximum mountains points and, more importantly, opening up a time gap. He opened up a 13 second lead on Schleck, Simoni, and Mazzoleni, and 25 to Cunego. Piepoli faded further and out of contention, at last [[hitting the wall]] after doing some strenuous pacemaking for much of this difficult stage. Simoni's descending skills brought himself, Schleck, and Mazzoleni back together with Di Luca minutes later, and they were together in Brian\u00e7on for the stage finish. Di Luca attacked for the stage win {{convert|900|m|abbr=on}} from the finish line, after a sharp right-hand turn, and drew Schleck with him. Simoni went [[Glossary of bicycling#B|\u00e0 bloc]] in his attempt to reach them, and did pass Schleck, but could not come around Di Luca, who won the stage. The others in the leading group of five finished scattered behind them. {{ct|LAM|2007}}'s [[Marzio Bruseghin]], who had begun the day second in the overall standings, was in the second chase group most of the day and finished 2'33\" back, retaining second overall. No\u00e8 was 9'45\" off the pace and surrendered the pink jersey to his team leader Di Luca. Di Luca still held the green jersey as mountains classification leader after the stage; Piepoli wore it in the next three stages.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0712\n|title=Di Luca takes day: ''Rosa'' and stage\n|date=2007-05-24\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-21\n}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n{|\n|'''Stage 12 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 4h 46' 39\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| s.t.\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 7\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 15\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 19\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Stefano Garzelli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|ASA|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 17\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Yoann Le Boulanger]]|FRA}}\n| {{ct|BTL|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Franco Pellizotti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 38\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 12'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]] [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 56h 42' 25\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 03\"\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 16\"\n|- \n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 25\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Patxi Vila]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 39\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 10\"\n|-\n| 7 \n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 14\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 34\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 48\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 28\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 13==\n;25 May 2007 &ndash; [[Biella]] to [[Santuario di Oropa]], {{convert|12.6|km|1|abbr=on}} ([[individual time trial]])\n\nThe Giro's first [[individual time trial]] consisted entirely of the first-category climb to the [[Santuario di Oropa]]. The route was uphill all the way, gaining {{convert|734|m|abbr=on}} at an average gradient of 5.8%, with the steepest stretches reaching 13%.

His 29'38\" was eventually bettered by American time trial specialist [[David Zabriskie]], who stopped the clock at 29'14\". [[Leonardo Piepoli]] started slowly, well behind Zabriskie at the {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} intermediate time check, but finished strongly, gaining 4 seconds on Zabriskie at the {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} check and 18 at the finish line. {{ct|TCS|2007}}' [[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]] posted the best time at the first intermediate time check, but faded as the course wore on and could not beat Piepoli's time. [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]], [[Franco Pellizotti]], [[Andy Schleck]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Gilberto Simoni]] all posted solid times, but all fell short of overtaking Piepoli.\n\nThe last two men to take the course were Italian national time trial champion [[Marzio Bruseghin]] and race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]]. Bruseghin had the second best splits at the first two intermediate time checks and gained against Piepoli in the final {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} where the others had lost time to him, winning the stage by a single second. Di Luca also rode well, finishing 8 seconds back of Bruseghin, and gaining time on his major rivals. After the stage, Simoni expressed disappointment that Piepoli was so narrowly defeated after having worked so hard the day before. Bruseghin held second overall after the stage and slightly narrowed his time gap to Di Luca, but made it clear that his focus going forward would be to work for team leader Cunego and not for any individual aspirations.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0713\n|title=Italian Champ Bruseghin conquers Oropa\n|date=2007-05-25\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-21\n}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|'''Stage 13 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 28' 55\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Leonardo Piepoli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 1\"\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 8\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Zabriskie]]|USA}}\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 19\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Franco Pellizotti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 22\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Stefano Garzelli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|ASA|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 29\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 31\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 33\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 38\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}}\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 40\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 13'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]] [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 57h 11' 28\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 55\"\n|- \n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 57\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 40\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Patxi Vila]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 44\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 51\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 11\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 32\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 52\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 53\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 14==\n;26 May 2007 &ndash; [[Cant\u00f9]] to [[Bergamo]], {{convert|192|km|abbr=on}}\n\nThe first {{convert|85|km|abbr=on}} of this stage were flat, but two categorized climbs followed.

During the flat stretch before the Passo di San Marco climb, [[Stefano Garzelli]] tried to use his team to soften the main field so he could attack and bridge up to the leaders, but team {{ct|LIQ|2007}}, working for race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]], nullified the move.\n\nThe group thinned after cresting the climb, leaving only [[Iv\u00e1n Parra]], [[Paolo Bettini]], and [[Fortunato Baliani]] just less than two minutes ahead of the pink jersey group, which contained all of the race's overall favorites. Garzelli and teammate [[Massimo Codol]] came free of this group on the ascent of La Trinit\u00e0-Dossena and drew [[Gilberto Simoni]] and the powerful {{ct|AST|2007}} duo of [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] and [[Paolo Savoldelli]] with them. The three breakaway riders were able to stay with them, forming a leading group of seven, after Codol dropped after doing some strenuous pacemaking. They built a 30 second advantage over the pink jersey group, as Liquigas was spent from their earlier effort to keep the race together. They kept their advantage over the other race favorites at that level for most of the stage, contesting a sprint finish among themselves 38 seconds ahead of Di Luca in eighth. Simoni opened the sprint first, with {{convert|250|m|abbr=on}} to go to the finish line, but as is so often the case, the first to go was not the winner. Garzelli passed him up with {{convert|60|m|abbr=on}} left and won his first Giro stage in three years.

By the {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} mark, the 22-strong breakaway representing 17 teams had three minutes on the main field. Their advantage eventually grew to nearly seven minutes, but with such difficult parcours ahead, they stood little chance of staying away.\n\nAfter {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} on the Passo di San Pellegrino, the day's first climb, {{ct|FOT|2007}} sent [[Leonardo Piepoli]] and [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] on the attack. [[Iv\u00e1n Parra]] and [[Julio Alberto P\u00e9rez]] followed, and they quickly gapped the pink jersey group while trying to bridge up to the leaders. They reached the leading group after the descent of the San Pellegrino, holding four minutes on the pink jersey group at that time. Saunier Duval-Prodir rider [[David Ca\u00f1ada]], part of the original big breakaway, set to the pacemaking once his two teammates joined the group, and tapped out a tempo that cracked about half of the group. When Ca\u00f1ada faded, Piepoli took his turn on the front of the group, at which time only Ricc\u00f2, P\u00e9rez, Parra, and [[Michael Rasmussen (cyclist)|Michael Rasmussen]] were with him. Piepoli led them over the second-category Passo di Giau together, a little over three minutes ahead of the main field.\n\nThe pink jersey group was, during the Giau climb, some 50 riders strong until [[Paolo Savoldelli]] took a pull on the front, working for the better-placed [[Eddy Mazzoleni]], that absolutely shattered it. Race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]] lost all of his support riders from the group, and overall contenders [[Damiano Cunego]] and [[Marzio Bruseghin]] were also quickly gapped. With {{convert|2.7|km|1|abbr=on}} remaining to the summit of the Giau, Di Luca put in an attack that further broke up the field. Savoldelli was gapped for a time, but his aggressive descent from the Giau brought him back to the pink jersey group, where he again took a strenuous pull on the front, softening up the contenders enough for himself and Mazzoleni to break free.\n\nThe intermediate sprint in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] resulted in Rasmussen coming out the back of the leading group. Savoldelli and Mazzoleni caught him in the road, and the Dutchman stayed with them to form a three-man chase group. Rain began to fall on the ascent of the Passo Tre Croci, the day's third climb, making the goings even more difficult. The leading group of four had 1'24\" on the Mazzoleni group at the top of Passo Tre Croci and a further three minutes on the pink jersey group, meaning Mazzoleni was very nearly the virtual race leader on the road. Mazzoleni dropped Savoldelli and Rasmussen as the stage went on, and finished five minutes before them.\n\nOn the last ascent of the day, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Di Luca made up much of the ground he had in deficit to Mazzoleni on the road, conceding a minute and 24 seconds to him at the finish line. [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Andy Schleck]] finished just behind him. In the front of the race, Ricc\u00f2 attacked as the Lavaredo climb began and quickly got a 15 second gap. The only rider to bridge to him was his teammate Piepoli. Piepoli, having taken the lead outright in the mountains classification, allowed Ricc\u00f2 the stage win. Their team leader Simoni reflected after the stage that he thought their early break was foolhardy, and that he had not followed because he was focused only on the overall and not stages, but that he was happy that the team took the Giro's marquee stage.\n\nThe true difficulty of the stage was demonstrated by the time gaps and finishing groups. Most of the riders finished the stage alone; no more than five finished together. Only 18 other riders finished within ten minutes of Ricc\u00f2's winning time, and 78 lost more than half an hour, with {{ct|BTL|2007}}'s [[Franck Renier]] last on the day 40 minutes and 10 seconds off the pace.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0715\n|title=Ricc\u00f2 takes his first on mythical Tre Cime di Lavaredo\n|date=2007-05-27\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-21\n}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|'''Stage 15 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 5h 47' 22\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Leonardo Piepoli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| s.t.\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Iv\u00e1n Parra]]|COL}}\n| {{ct|COF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 10\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Julio Alberto P\u00e9rez]]|MEX}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 32\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 29\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 53\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 30\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 36\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}}]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 52\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +6' 03\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 15'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 68h 00' 55\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 51\"\n|- \n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 56\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 19\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 23\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 39\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +6' 05\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 02\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 29\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +9' 29\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 16==\n;29 May 2007 &ndash; [[Agordo]] to [[Lienz]] ([[Austria]]), {{convert|189|km|abbr=on}}\n\nAfter the second rest day, the Giro returned with a rolling stage that entered Austria.

Through the first hour, they covered only {{convert|25.1|km|1|abbr=on}}. The second hour was even slower, covering {{convert|24.6|km|1|abbr=on}}. No breakaways were attempted in this time, save for a quick sprint for the mountains points available on the Passo di Campolongo. Through three hours, there was still no breakaway.\n\nFinally, with only {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} left in the stage, [[Beno\u00eet Joachim]] and [[Laurent Mangel]] came free. The {{ct|LIQ|2007}} team at the head of the peloton was uninterested in chasing them down, since only a stage win was on offer this day, with the overall standings very unlikely to change. Little by little, sixteen others joined them. They did not work cohesively; Mangel, [[Stefano Garzelli]], [[Ricardo Serrano (cyclist)|Ricardo Serrano]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiera]], [[Pietro Caucchioli]], and [[Pablo Lastras]] took two minutes' advantage over the other twelve. This mattered little, as the apathetic peloton let them all go to contest the stage amongst themselves. Garzelli put in an attack on the third-category Bannberg climb, {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} from the end of the race, and stayed out front for the stage win.

After {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}, a dozen-strong breakaway group formed. Their pace was frantic, coming to the stage's intermediate sprint 20 minutes faster than the fastest time predicted by Giro organizers. They had five and a half minutes on the pink jersey group containing race favorites at this point, and three and a half minutes on them at the beginning of the Zoncolan climb.\n\n[[Jussi Veikkanen]], [[Massimo Codol]], and [[Mauricio Ardila]] took pulls at the front of the breakaway group, but {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} into the climb, only [[Dario Cioni]], [[Fortunato Baliani]], and [[Mario Aerts]] remained out front. Another kilometer later, Cioni was the lone leader. [[Franco Pellizotti]] was the last Liquigas rider left for Di Luca in the group of favorites, before he cracked and also fell off the pace. With {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} left in the climb, Simoni himself came to the front of the group and tapped out a pace that left everyone but teammate [[Leonardo Piepoli]] and best young rider [[Andy Schleck]] behind. They passed Cioni and chaser Codol on the road, and the {{ct|FOT|2007}} duo left the young Luxembourger behind them to contest the stage themselves. Since the climb had personal significance for Simoni, Piepoli allowed him to cross the line first. They had covered the {{convert|10.1|km|1|abbr=on}} climb in 39'05\", for a paltry pace of {{convert|15.05|km/h|2|abbr=on}}. The win moved Simoni into a podium position, in third, and moved Schleck into second overall.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0717\n|title=Simoni: King of Zoncolan\n|date=2007-05-30\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|'''Stage 17 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 3h 51' 52\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Leonardo Piepoli]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| s.t.\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 7\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 31\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 37\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Massimo Codol]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|ASA|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 58\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Julio Alberto P\u00e9rez]]|MEX}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 19\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Franco Pellizotti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 40\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 57\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Iv\u00e1n Parra]]|COL}}\n| {{ct|COF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 02\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 17'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 77h 35' 35\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 24\"\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 28\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 29\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 46\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +5' 19\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +10' 00\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +10' 25\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Franco Pellizotti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +10' 39\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +10' 55\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 18==\n;31 May 2007 &ndash; [[Udine]] to [[Riese Pio X]], {{convert|203|km|abbr=on}}\n\nThe 18th stage was completely flat, and was sure to be contested by the Giro's remaining sprinters.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/giro07/?id=stages/giro0718\n|title=Stage 18 - Thursday, May 31: Udine - Riese Pio X, 203 km\n|date=2007-05-11\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-14\n}}</ref>\n\nA great number of early breakaways were attempted and neutralized in the stage's first hour.

The second half of the Giro began with a challenging mountain stage that finished outside Italy, the first of three stages in this Giro that did so. This stage resulted in the race lead transferring from [[Andrea No\u00e8]] to his teammate and team leader [[Danilo Di Luca]], who did not relinquish this lead and finished the race as its champion.\n\nThe battle for the other two spots on the Giro podium also began in stage 12 but was not resolved until later in the race. [[Andy Schleck]] from {{ct|SAX|2007}} won the white jersey in Milan as the [[Young rider classification in the Giro d'Italia|Giro's best rider under 25]], and was in a competition with [[Eddy Mazzoleni]], [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] to see who would round out the podium with Di Luca.

The course included two difficult first-category climbs, as the route passed from Italy into France. The first of these climbs was the [[Col Agnel|Colle dell'Agnello]], which crested just inside the French border. This was the ''Cima Coppi'', the highest climb in the race. The climb took stretched for {{convert|21.3|km|1|abbr=on}} and reached a vertical elevation of {{convert|2744|m|abbr=on}}. The [[Col d'Izoard]] later on is only marginally shorter and less steep, reaching {{convert|2360|m|abbr=on}} in elevation after {{convert|14.2|km|1|abbr=on}} on the road, for a steady 7.1% gradient. The finish came on a steep descent into [[Brian\u00e7on]], a popular host town for the [[Tour de France]].<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007/giro07/?id=stages/giro0712\n|title=Stage 12 - Thursday, May 24: Scalenghe - Brian\u00e7on (Francia), 163 km\n|date=2007-05-11\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-14\n}}</ref>\n\nThis France-bound stage had a breakaway group consisting of two French riders each representing a French team: [[Yoann Le Boulanger]] of {{ct|BTL|2007}} and [[Christophe Riblon]] of {{ct|ALM|2007}}. By the {{convert|55|km|abbr=on}} mark, the duo had a 17 and a half minute advantage on the peloton, as the other riders were conserving themselves for the big climbs ahead. The {{ct|FOT|2007}} team, and in particular [[Leonardo Piepoli]], did the pacemaking on the ascent of the Colle dell'Agnello, and after a few kilometers of the climb only a select group of overall favorites remained together as the first chase group. One surprising rider to crack was two-time Giro winner [[Paolo Savoldelli]], who lost contact with the group of favorites {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} from the summit of the Agnello and lost five minutes to them at day's end. Savoldelli was still hurt from the previous day's crash, and informed his [[Cycling domestique#Hierarchy among domestiques|lieutenant]] [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] that he should keep the pace for as long as he could and ride his own race, and that Savoldelli would look after himself.\n\n[[File:Piepoli 1C.JPG|thumb|left|alt=A cyclist in a yellow and white jersey with black trim rides alongside a yellow guard rail.|[[Leonardo Piepoli]] set a pace during this stage that cracked most of the main field.]]\n\nIn the front of the race, Le Boulanger was the first over the Agnello, winning the prize that went with conquering the ''Cima Coppi''. Riblon followed 1'30\" behind him; the group of overall favorites was still 13 minutes behind at the summit of the climb. Piepoli's pacemaking on the ascent had succeeded in whittling the group down to just himself, [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], [[Danilo Di Luca]], Mazzoleni, [[Andy Schleck]], and [[Stefano Garzelli]]. [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]], Savoldelli, [[Yaroslav Popovych]], and overnight race leader [[Andrea No\u00e8]] had all been in this group at the beginning of the climb, but were all eventually cracked by the pace.\n\nPiepoli continued to pull the Simoni group through the descent from the Agnello and the beginning of the Iozard climb, absorbing Riblon in the process. Le Boulanger was alone in the front of the race as the ascent of the Iozard began, 3 minutes ahead of Simoni's group. With {{convert|11|km|abbr=on}} left in the climb, Piepoli broke away from the group he had been pacing, in a move to see who could match his acceleration. Di Luca and Schleck quickly made the bridge, with Simoni holding their wheels, but Cunego and Garzelli did not react as quickly and had to expend more energy to stay with the leaders. Later, Garzelli was dropped by this group's pace, and lost 2 minutes to them at the finish line. This group caught Le Boulanger {{convert|3.5|km|1|abbr=on}} before the summit of the Iozard.\n\nSeconds before reaching that summit, Di Luca attacked from the leading group and came free, taking maximum mountains points and, more importantly, opening up a time gap. He opened up a 13 second lead on Schleck, Simoni, and Mazzoleni, and 25 to Cunego. Piepoli faded further and out of contention, at last [[hitting the wall]] after doing some strenuous pacemaking for much of this difficult stage. Simoni's descending skills brought himself, Schleck, and Mazzoleni back together with Di Luca minutes later, and they were together in Brian\u00e7on for the stage finish. Di Luca attacked for the stage win {{convert|900|m|abbr=on}} from the finish line, after a sharp right-hand turn, and drew Schleck with him. Simoni went [[Glossary of bicycling#B|\u00e0 bloc]] in his attempt to reach them, and did pass Schleck, but could not come around Di Luca, who won the stage. The others in the leading group of five finished scattered behind them. {{ct|LAM|2007}}'s [[Marzio Bruseghin]], who had begun the day second in the overall standings, was in the second chase group most of the day and finished 2'33\" back, retaining second overall. No\u00e8 was 9'45\" off the pace and surrendered the pink jersey to his team leader Di Luca. Di Luca still held the green jersey as mountains classification leader after the stage; Piepoli wore it in the next three stages.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0712\n|title=Di Luca takes day: ''Rosa'' and stage\n|date=2007-05-24\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-21\n}}</ref>\n{{-}}\n{|\n|'''Stage 12 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 4h 46' 39\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| s.t.\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 7\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 15\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 19\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Stefano Garzelli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|ASA|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 17\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Yoann Le Boulanger]]|FRA}}\n| {{ct|BTL|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 33\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Franco Pellizotti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 38\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 12\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]] [[Image:Jersey green.svg|20px|Green jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 56h 42' 25\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 03\"\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 16\"\n|- \n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 25\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Patxi Vila]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 39\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 10\"\n|-\n| 7 \n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 14\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 34\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 48\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 28\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 13==\n;25 May 2007 &ndash; [[Biella]] to [[Santuario di Oropa]], {{convert|12.6|km|1|abbr=on}} ([[individual time trial]])\n\nThe Giro's first [[individual time trial]] consisted entirely of the first-category climb to the [[Santuario di Oropa]]. The route was uphill all the way, gaining {{convert|734|m|abbr=on}} at an average gradient of 5.8%, with the steepest stretches reaching 13%.

His 29'38\" was eventually bettered by American time trial specialist [[David Zabriskie]], who stopped the clock at 29'14\". [[Leonardo Piepoli]] started slowly, well behind Zabriskie at the {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} intermediate time check, but finished strongly, gaining 4 seconds on Zabriskie at the {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} check and 18 at the finish line. {{ct|TCS|2007}}' [[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]] posted the best time at the first intermediate time check, but faded as the course wore on and could not beat Piepoli's time. [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]], [[Franco Pellizotti]], [[Andy Schleck]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Gilberto Simoni]] all posted solid times, but all fell short of overtaking Piepoli.\n\nThe last two men to take the course were Italian national time trial champion [[Marzio Bruseghin]] and race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]]. Bruseghin had the second best splits at the first two intermediate time checks and gained against Piepoli in the final {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} where the others had lost time to him, winning the stage by a single second. Di Luca also rode well, finishing 8 seconds back of Bruseghin, and gaining time on his major rivals. After the stage, Simoni expressed disappointment that Piepoli was so narrowly defeated after having worked so hard the day before.

During the flat stretch before the Passo di San Marco climb, [[Stefano Garzelli]] tried to use his team to soften the main field so he could attack and bridge up to the leaders, but team {{ct|LIQ|2007}}, working for race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]], nullified the move.\n\nThe group thinned after cresting the climb, leaving only [[Iv\u00e1n Parra]], [[Paolo Bettini]], and [[Fortunato Baliani]] just less than two minutes ahead of the pink jersey group, which contained all of the race's overall favorites. Garzelli and teammate [[Massimo Codol]] came free of this group on the ascent of La Trinit\u00e0-Dossena and drew [[Gilberto Simoni]] and the powerful {{ct|AST|2007}} duo of [[Eddy Mazzoleni]] and [[Paolo Savoldelli]] with them. The three breakaway riders were able to stay with them, forming a leading group of seven, after Codol dropped after doing some strenuous pacemaking. They built a 30 second advantage over the pink jersey group, as Liquigas was spent from their earlier effort to keep the race together. They kept their advantage over the other race favorites at that level for most of the stage, contesting a sprint finish among themselves 38 seconds ahead of Di Luca in eighth.

By the {{convert|40|km|abbr=on}} mark, the 22-strong breakaway representing 17 teams had three minutes on the main field. Their advantage eventually grew to nearly seven minutes, but with such difficult parcours ahead, they stood little chance of staying away.\n\nAfter {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} on the Passo di San Pellegrino, the day's first climb, {{ct|FOT|2007}} sent [[Leonardo Piepoli]] and [[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]] on the attack. [[Iv\u00e1n Parra]] and [[Julio Alberto P\u00e9rez]] followed, and they quickly gapped the pink jersey group while trying to bridge up to the leaders. They reached the leading group after the descent of the San Pellegrino, holding four minutes on the pink jersey group at that time. Saunier Duval-Prodir rider [[David Ca\u00f1ada]], part of the original big breakaway, set to the pacemaking once his two teammates joined the group, and tapped out a tempo that cracked about half of the group. When Ca\u00f1ada faded, Piepoli took his turn on the front of the group, at which time only Ricc\u00f2, P\u00e9rez, Parra, and [[Michael Rasmussen (cyclist)|Michael Rasmussen]] were with him. Piepoli led them over the second-category Passo di Giau together, a little over three minutes ahead of the main field.\n\nThe pink jersey group was, during the Giau climb, some 50 riders strong until [[Paolo Savoldelli]] took a pull on the front, working for the better-placed [[Eddy Mazzoleni]], that absolutely shattered it. Race leader [[Danilo Di Luca]] lost all of his support riders from the group, and overall contenders [[Damiano Cunego]] and [[Marzio Bruseghin]] were also quickly gapped. With {{convert|2.7|km|1|abbr=on}} remaining to the summit of the Giau, Di Luca put in an attack that further broke up the field. Savoldelli was gapped for a time, but his aggressive descent from the Giau brought him back to the pink jersey group, where he again took a strenuous pull on the front, softening up the contenders enough for himself and Mazzoleni to break free.\n\nThe intermediate sprint in [[Cortina d'Ampezzo]] resulted in Rasmussen coming out the back of the leading group. Savoldelli and Mazzoleni caught him in the road, and the Dutchman stayed with them to form a three-man chase group. Rain began to fall on the ascent of the Passo Tre Croci, the day's third climb, making the goings even more difficult. The leading group of four had 1'24\" on the Mazzoleni group at the top of Passo Tre Croci and a further three minutes on the pink jersey group, meaning Mazzoleni was very nearly the virtual race leader on the road. Mazzoleni dropped Savoldelli and Rasmussen as the stage went on, and finished five minutes before them.\n\nOn the last ascent of the day, the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, Di Luca made up much of the ground he had in deficit to Mazzoleni on the road, conceding a minute and 24 seconds to him at the finish line. [[Gilberto Simoni]], [[Damiano Cunego]], and [[Andy Schleck]] finished just behind him. In the front of the race, Ricc\u00f2 attacked as the Lavaredo climb began and quickly got a 15 second gap. The only rider to bridge to him was his teammate Piepoli. Piepoli, having taken the lead outright in the mountains classification, allowed Ricc\u00f2 the stage win. Their team leader Simoni reflected after the stage that he thought their early break was foolhardy, and that he had not followed because he was focused only on the overall and not stages, but that he was happy that the team took the Giro's marquee stage.\n\nThe true difficulty of the stage was demonstrated by the time gaps and finishing groups. Most of the riders finished the stage alone; no more than five finished together. Only 18 other riders finished within ten minutes of Ricc\u00f2's winning time, and 78 lost more than half an hour, with {{ct|BTL|2007}}'s [[Franck Renier]] last on the day 40 minutes and 10 seconds off the pace.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0715\n|title=Ricc\u00f2 takes his first on mythical Tre Cime di Lavaredo\n|date=2007-05-27\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-21\n}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|'''Stage 15 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 5h 47' 22\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Leonardo Piepoli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| s.t.\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Iv\u00e1n Parra]]|COL}}\n| {{ct|COF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 10\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Julio Alberto P\u00e9rez]]|MEX}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| + 32\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 29\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 53\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 30\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 36\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}}]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 52\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +6' 03\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 15\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 68h 00' 55\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 51\"\n|- \n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 56\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 19\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 23\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 39\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +6' 05\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 02\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 29\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +9' 29\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 16==\n;29 May 2007 &ndash; [[Agordo]] to [[Lienz]] ([[Austria]]), {{convert|189|km|abbr=on}}\n\nAfter the second rest day, the Giro returned with a rolling stage that entered Austria. The stage began with the second-category Passo di Campolongo and a long descent from it, but the remaining terrain was not difficult enough for any riders to open up significant time gaps.

Through the first hour, they covered only {{convert|25.1|km|1|abbr=on}}. The second hour was even slower, covering {{convert|24.6|km|1|abbr=on}}. No breakaways were attempted in this time, save for a quick sprint for the mountains points available on the Passo di Campolongo. Through three hours, there was still no breakaway.\n\nFinally, with only {{convert|70|km|abbr=on}} left in the stage, [[Beno\u00eet Joachim]] and [[Laurent Mangel]] came free. The {{ct|LIQ|2007}} team at the head of the peloton was uninterested in chasing them down, since only a stage win was on offer this day, with the overall standings very unlikely to change. Little by little, sixteen others joined them. They did not work cohesively; Mangel, [[Stefano Garzelli]], [[Ricardo Serrano (cyclist)|Ricardo Serrano]], [[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiera]], [[Pietro Caucchioli]], and [[Pablo Lastras]] took two minutes' advantage over the other twelve. This mattered little, as the apathetic peloton let them all go to contest the stage amongst themselves. Garzelli put in an attack on the third-category Bannberg climb, {{convert|27|km|abbr=on}} from the end of the race, and stayed out front for the stage win. The main field, led home by [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Bodrogi]], was 8 minutes and 10 seconds back, but there was no significant change to the overall classification.<ref>{{cite web\n|author=Gregor Brown and Tim Maloney\n|url=http://autobus.cyclingnews.com/road/2007//giro07/?id=results/giro0716\n|title=Garzelli ''il Grande''\n|date=2007-05-29\n|work=Cycling News\n|publisher=Future Publishing Limited\n|accessdate=2010-03-22\n}}</ref>\n\n{|\n|'''Stage 16 result'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|- \n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Stefano Garzelli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|ASA|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 5h 34' 07\"\n|- \n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Laurent Mangel]]|FRA}}\n| {{ct|ALM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 01\"\n|-\n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Ricardo Serrano (cyclist)|Ricardo Serrano]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 01\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Jos\u00e9 Luis Rubiera]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|DSC|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 01\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Pietro Caucchioli]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|C.A|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 01\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Pablo Lastras]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 01\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[Salvatore Commesso]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 29\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Giovanni Visconti (cyclist)|Giovanni Visconti]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|QST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 29\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Assan Bazayev]]|KAZ}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 29\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Lorenzo Bernucci]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|THR|2007a}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 29\"\n|}\n||\n|'''General classification after stage 16\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!\n!Rider\n!Team\n!Time\n|-\n| 1\n| {{flagathlete|[[Danilo Di Luca]]|ITA}} [[Image:Jersey pink.svg|20px|Pink jersey]]\n| {{ct|LIQ|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| 73h 43' 12\"\n|-\n| 2\n| {{flagathlete|[[Eddy Mazzoleni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|AST|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +1' 51\"\n|- \n| 3\n| {{flagathlete|[[Andy Schleck]]|LUX}} [[Image:Jersey white.svg|20px|White jersey]]\n| {{ct|SAX|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +2' 56\"\n|-\n| 4\n| {{flagathlete|[[Gilberto Simoni]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 19\"\n|-\n| 5\n| {{flagathlete|[[Damiano Cunego]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 23\"\n|-\n| 6\n| {{flagathlete|[[Riccardo Ricc\u00f2]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|FOT|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +3' 39\"\n|-\n| 7\n| {{flagathlete|[[David Arroyo]]|ESP}}\n| {{ct|GCE|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +6' 05\"\n|-\n| 8\n| {{flagathlete|[[Emanuele Sella]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|CSF|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 02\"\n|-\n| 9\n| {{flagathlete|[[Evgeni Petrov (cyclist)|Evgeni Petrov]]|RUS}}\n| {{ct|TCS|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +7' 29\"\n|-\n| 10\n| {{flagathlete|[[Marzio Bruseghin]]|ITA}}\n| {{ct|LAM|2007}}\n| align=\"right\"| +9' 29\"\n|}\n|}\n\n==Stage 17==\n;30 May 2007 &ndash; Lienz (Austria) to [[Monte Zoncolan]], {{convert|142|km|abbr=on}}\n\nThis stage brought the riders back into Italy.

After {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}}, a dozen-strong breakaway group formed. Their pace was frantic, coming to the stage's intermediate sprint 20 minutes faster than the fastest time predicted by Giro organizers. They had five and a half minutes on the pink jersey group containing race favorites at this point, and three and a half minutes on them at the beginning of the Zoncolan climb.\n\n[[Jussi Veikkanen]], [[Massimo Codol]], and [[Mauricio Ardila]] took pulls at the front of the breakaway group, but {{convert|2|km|abbr=on}} into the climb, only [[Dario Cioni]], [[Fortunato Baliani]], and [[Mario Aerts]] remained out front. Another kilometer later, Cioni was the lone leader. [[Franco Pellizotti]] was the last Liquigas rider left for Di Luca in the group of favorites, before he cracked and also fell off the pace. With {{convert|5|km|abbr=on}} left in the climb, Simoni himself came to the front of the group and tapped out a pace that left everyone but teammate [[Leonardo Piepoli]] and best young rider [[Andy Schleck]] behind. They passed Cioni and chaser Codol on the road, and the {{ct|FOT|2007}} duo left the young Luxembourger behind them to contest the stage themselves.

SL stands for Stored Logic.<ref name=\"L'empire Invisible\">\"L'empire Invisible\" by Jean-Guy Rens, History of telecommunications in Canada, 1956-Today</ref>\n\nThe original products were developed in a [[Bell-Northern Research]] developed proprietary toolset and language, similar to [[Pascal_(programming_language)|Pascal]] called SL1, and ran without an specific [[operating system]].  In the 1990s it was evolved onto [[VxWorks]], a commercial real time embedded operating system, at which time the model numbers were evolved to add the letter C to the end of the option numbers.\n\nIt was introduced by [[Nortel|Northern Telecom]] in December 1975, with an original capacity from 100 to 7,600 lines, and became the first fully digital PBX announced on the global market aimed at the smaller [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] market. In the early 1970s, most PBXs were either electromechanical (e.g. cross-bar) or based on a hybrid technology (e.g. switching matrix made from a two-dimensional array of contacts but control performed by an electronic logic). For this reason, the SL-1 enjoyed a great success on the enterprise market both in North-America and globally.<ref name=\"L'empire Invisible\"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Meridian 1 System Software Release History | work  = Nortel Networks website  | url = http://products.nortel.com/go/product_assoc.jsp?segId=0&parId=0&catId=null&rend_id=5181&contOid=100177491&prod_id=27582&locale=en-US | accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.phworld.org/switch/ntess.htm Nortel (Northern Telecom) Modern Telephone Systems]</ref>\n\nIts success went on to power the company into a leadership position in the telephony world, and led to expanded designs \"up and down\" to provide products at all sizes, including the [[Digital Multiplex System|DMS]] series high-end machines, and the [[Meridian Norstar]] for smaller installations up to 200 users.

It provides 16 voice and 16 data communication links between a Meridian 1 switch and modular digital telephones.\n\nThe digital [[line card]] supports voice only or simultaneous voice and data service over a single twisted pair of standard telephone wiring. When a Meridian digital telephone is equipped with the data option, an asynchronous ASCII terminal, or a PC acting as an asynchronous ASCII terminal, can be connected to the system through the digital telephone.\n\n===Physical description===\nDigital line cards are housed in the Intelligent Peripheral Equipment (IPE) Modules. Up to 16 cards are supported.\n\nThe digital line card circuitry is mounted on a {{nowrap|31.75 cm}} by {{nowrap|25.40 cm}} ({{nowrap|12.5 in}} by {{nowrap|10 in}}) double-sided [[printed circuit board]]. The card connects to the backplane through a 160-pin [[edge connector]]. The faceplate of the digital line card is equipped with a red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] that lights when the card is disabled.\n\nWhen the card is installed, the LED remains lit for two to five seconds as a self-test runs. If the self-test completes successfully, the LED flashes three times and remains lit until the card is configured and enabled in software, then the LED goes out. If the LED continually flashes or remains weakly lit, there is a fault detected in the card.\n\n===Functional description===\nThe digital line card is equipped with 16 identical digital line interfaces. Each interface provides a multiplexed voice, data, and signaling path to and from a digital terminal (telephone) over a 2-wire full duplex 512&nbsp;kHz [[Time Division Multiplex]] (TDM) digital link. Each digital telephone and associated data terminal is assigned a separate Terminal Number (TN) in the system database, giving a total of 32 addressable units per card.\n\n===References===\nExtracts from [[Nortel]] IP Telephony\n\n==TCM Loop==\n[[Time-division multiplexing|Time Compression Multiplexing]] (TCM) is the standard communication protocol used by Nortel digital telephones on a 2-wire tip and ring circuit. Each digital phone line terminates at a station port on a Digital Voice Card (DVC) in the PBX.

SL stands for Stored Logic.<ref name=\"L'empire Invisible\">\"L'empire Invisible\" by Jean-Guy Rens, History of telecommunications in Canada, 1956-Today</ref>\n\nThe original products were developed in a [[Bell-Northern Research]] developed proprietary toolset and language, similar to [[Pascal_(programming_language)|Pascal]] called SL1, and ran without an specific [[operating system]].  In the 1990's it was evolved onto [[VxWorks]], a commercial real time embedded operating system, at which time the model numbers were evolved to add the letter C to the end of the option numbers.\n\nIt was introduced by [[Nortel|Northern Telecom]] in December 1975, with an original capacity from 100 to 7,600 lines, and became the first fully digital PBX announced on the global market aimed at the smaller [[Private branch exchange|PBX]] market. In the early 1970s, most PBXs were either electromechanical (e.g. cross-bar) or based on a hybrid technology (e.g. switching matrix made from a two-dimensional array of contacts but control performed by an electronic logic). For this reason, the SL-1 enjoyed a great success on the enterprise market both in North-America and globally.<ref name=\"L'empire Invisible\"/><ref>{{cite web  | title = Meridian 1 System Software Release History | work  = Nortel Networks website  | url = http://products.nortel.com/go/product_assoc.jsp?segId=0&parId=0&catId=null&rend_id=5181&contOid=100177491&prod_id=27582&locale=en-US | accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref><ref>[http://www.phworld.org/switch/ntess.htm Nortel (Northern Telecom) Modern Telephone Systems]</ref>\n\nIts success went on to power the company into a leadership position in the telephony world, and led to expanded designs \"up and down\" to provide products at all sizes, including the [[Digital Multiplex System|DMS]] series high-end machines, and the [[Meridian Norstar]] for smaller installations up to 200 users. The SL-1 was gradually enhanced (peripheral hardware, packaging, etc.) and renamed Meridian-1 in the late 1980s.

It provides 16 voice and 16 data communication links between a Meridian 1 switch and modular digital telephones.\n\nThe digital [[line card]] supports voice only or simultaneous voice and data service over a single twisted pair of standard telephone wiring. When a Meridian digital telephone is equipped with the data option, an asynchronous ASCII terminal, or a PC acting as an asynchronous ASCII terminal, can be connected to the system through the digital telephone.\n\n===Physical description===\nDigital line cards are housed in the Intelligent Peripheral Equipment (IPE) Modules. Up to 16 cards are supported.\n\nThe digital line card circuitry is mounted on a {{nowrap|31.75 cm}} by {{nowrap|25.40 cm}} ({{nowrap|12.5 in}} by {{nowrap|10 in}}) double-sided [[printed circuit board]]. The card connects to the backplane through a 160-pin [[edge connector]]. The faceplate of the digital line card is equipped with a red [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] that lights when the card is disabled.\n\nWhen the card is installed, the LED remains lit for two to five seconds as a self-test runs. If the self-test completes successfully, the LED flashes three times and remains lit until the card is configured and enabled in software, then the LED goes out. If the LED continually flashes or remains weakly lit, there is a fault detected in the card.\n\n===Functional description===\nThe digital line card is equipped with 16 identical digital line interfaces. Each interface provides a multiplexed voice, data, and signaling path to and from a digital terminal (telephone) over a 2-wire full duplex 512&nbsp;kHz [[Time Division Multiplex]] (TDM) digital link. Each digital telephone and associated data terminal is assigned a separate Terminal Number (TN) in the system database, giving a total of 32 addressable units per card.\n\n===References===\nExtracts from [[Nortel]] IP Telephony\n\n==TCM Loop==\n[[Time-division multiplexing|Time Compression Multiplexing]] (TCM) is the standard communication protocol used by Nortel digital telephones on a 2-wire tip and ring circuit. Each digital phone line terminates at a station port on a Digital Voice Card (DVC) in the PBX.
