Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 119.</ref> The trip cost $1,372.30. Mr. Gotcher\u2019s employer, Economy Motors, paid $348.73 while the remainder, $1023.53, was paid by Volkswagen of Germany and [[Volkswagen of America]].<ref name=\"Gotcher_119\"/> Mr. and Mrs. Gotcher failed to include any part of the $1,372.30 in gross income for income tax purposes for 1960.<ref name=\"Gotcher_119\"/> The [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] assessed a tax deficiency after determining the taxpayers (the Gotchers) had realized income of $1,372.30 from the trip. The Gotchers paid the deficiency and filed suit for a refund.<ref>''United States v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 120.</ref> The district court held that the cost of the trip was not income, or in the alternative, that the cost of the trip was income and deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense.<ref name=\"Gotcher_121\">''United States v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 121.</ref>\n\n==Issue==\nAt issue was whether the cost of the trip was taxable income to Mr. and Mrs. Gotcher under [[Internal Revenue Code section 61|Section 61]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].\n\n==Analysis and holding==\nFor an item to constitute taxable income to the taxpayer, there must be economic gain to the taxpayer, and the economic gain must primarily benefit the taxpayer personally.<ref name=\"Gotcher_121\"/> The Gotchers received an indirect economic gain by receiving a benefit (the value of the trip) without any reduction in their wealth.

Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 119.</ref> The trip cost $1,372.30. Mr. Gotcher\u2019s employer, Economy Motors, paid $348.73 while the remainder, $1023.53, was paid by Volkswagen of Germany and [[Volkswagen of America]].<ref name=\"Gotcher_119\"/> Mr. and Mrs. Gotcher failed to include any part of the $1,372.30 in gross income for income tax purposes for 1960.<ref name=\"Gotcher_119\"/> The [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue]] assessed a tax deficiency after determining the taxpayers (the Gotchers) had realized income of $1,372.30 from the trip. The Gotchers paid the deficiency and filed suit for a refund.<ref>''United States v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 120.</ref> The district court held that the cost of the trip was not income, or in the alternative, that the cost of the trip was income and deductible as an ordinary and necessary business expense.<ref name=\"Gotcher_121\">''United States v. Gotcher'', 401 F.2d at 121.</ref>\n\n==Issue==\nAt issue was whether the cost of the trip was taxable income to Mr. and Mrs. Gotcher under [[Internal Revenue Code section 61|Section 61]] of the [[Internal Revenue Code]].\n\n==Analysis and holding==\nFor an item to constitute taxable income to the taxpayer, there must be economic gain to the taxpayer, and the economic gain must primarily benefit the taxpayer personally.<ref name=\"Gotcher_121\"/> The Gotchers received an indirect economic gain by receiving a benefit (the value of the trip) without any reduction in their wealth. The court considered the specific details of the trip, including the purpose of the trip, time spent in meetings, the location of day trips, and whether the trip was an award for past service.<ref name=\"Gotcher_122\">''United States v.

Within two years of his putting forward his plan, over 3400 Townsend Plan Clubs were organized all over America, and began exerting pressure on Congress to pass an old age pension.  [[Frances Perkins]], President Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor, in her memoir, ''The Roosevelt I Knew'' (p. 294) says that Roosevelt told her, \"We have to have it [Social Security]. Congress can't stand the pressure of the Townsend Plan unless we have a real old-age insurance system.\"  As Roosevelt said, Social Security was passed by Congress substituting a pay-as-you-go \"insurance\" scheme for Townsend's far more generous pension plan, but as he told Perkins, it was the Townsend Clubs that forced Congress to act at all.\n\n===After the adoption of Social Security and Townsend's death===\nThe movement continued after the Roosevelt administration adopted Social Security in 1935 and beyond Townsend's death in 1960.<ref name=\"plandeath\">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Townsend Plan, Once the Hope Of Thousands, Is Near Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/02/23/archives/townsend-plan-once-the-hope-of-thousands-is-near-death.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=New York |date=February 23, 1978 |agency=[[The Associated Press]] |access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref> In 1978, [[The Associated Press]] reported that the National Townsend Plan would be shut down by the end of February that year, with only state chapters surviving, and that by then it had a \"dwindling and aging membership\".<ref name=\"plandeath\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat|Francis Townsend}}\n* US Social Security Administration, [https://www.ssa.gov/history/towns5.html \"The Townsend Plan Movement,\"] ''Social Security History.''\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Townsend, Francis}}\n[[Category:1867 births]]\n[[Category:1960 deaths]]\n[[Category:Candidates in the 1936 United States presidential election]]\n[[Category:20th-century American politicians]]\n[[Category:People from Belle Fourche, South Dakota]]\n[[Category:American political party founders]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the old-age pension advocate|the U.S. Homeland Security advisor|Frances Townsend}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name          = Francis Townsend\n| image         = Francis Townsend, seated at desk, with microphones hec.27728.jpg\n| alt           = Francis Townsend, seated at desk, with microphones, c. 1939\n| caption       = Townsend c. 1939\n| birth_name    = Francis Everett Townsend\n| birth_date    = {{Birth date|1867|01|13}}\n| birth_place   = [[Fairbury, Illinois]]\n| death_date    = {{Death date and age|1960|09|01|1867|01|13}}\n| death_place   = [[Los Angeles]]\n| nationality   = [[United States|American]]\n| alma_mater    = [[Omaha Medical College]]\n| occupation    = [[Physician]], [[public health]] officer\n| known_for     = Townsend Plan\n| spouse        = Wilhelmina \"Minnie\" Bogue\n}}\n'''Francis Everett Townsend''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|a\u028a|n|z|\u0259n|d}}; January 13, 1867 \u2013 September 1, 1960) was an [[United States|American]] [[physician]] who was best known for his revolving old-age [[pension]] proposal during the [[Great Depression]].

Once reperfusion occurs, these cellular products are returned to the systemic circulation, and are exposed to other organs.  Organs involved in filtration (e.g., the kidneys and the liver), may be overwhelmed by the high load of cellular break down products, and face injury themselves (e.g., acute kidney injury).\n\n*Tissue swelling and [[fasciotomy]]\nFollowing ischemia, reperfusion induces local tissue swelling.  Tissue that swells within a confined space (e.g., muscle within its overlaying fascia) is susceptible to compartment syndrome in this situation.  Recognizing this, surgeons frequently prophylactically release (i.e., incise) fascia of arm and leg fascial compartments after repair of a proximal vascular injury.\n\n==Tourniquets==\n{{main article|Tourniquet}}\n* Pneumatic / Surgical \nPneumatic, surgical tourniquets are frequently applied in the controlled environment of the operating room in order to control blood loss during an upper or lower extremity operative case.  Aside from lower blood loss in itself, this improves visualization and surgical efficiency.  Modern examples are found in many different sizes to accommodate different patients and sites of applications, with adult cuffs approximately 4\u2033 wide.  This distributes the pressure over, generally, a broader area than field (emergency, combat) tourniquets.  The cuff is typically attached to an adjustable pneumatic pump with a built-in timer.  Surgical tourniquet times in excess of two hours have been associated with an increased risk of nerve damage (e.g., [[neuropraxia]]), likely related to both direct nerve compression as well as decreased arterial inflow and oxygenation.  The ischemia-reperfusion injury associated with surgical tourniquets is typically not clinically apparent when used for less than two hours.\n\n* Field / Combat\nEmergency field tourniquets have been used for many centuries, and have seen a resurgence in the recent combat operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, as well as expanded use in civilian trauma and mass casualty settings.  Expedient and widespread tourniquet use in the modern combat setting is frequently cited as a primary driver for increased survival following major battlefield trauma.  These tourniquets are often 1\u20132\u2033 in width, which concentrates the pressure to a narrow band of tissue.  They can result in tissue necrosis if kept in place for long periods, and should only be applied after other methods to control bleeding (e.g., elevation or direct pressure to the wound) have failed, except in settings where time does not allow waiting.  Generally, tissue distal to a field tourniquet that has been in place for greater than 6 hours is considered likely to be non-viable.\n\n* Tourniquet equivalents\nIn the same way that external compression tourniquets reduce or eliminate arterial blood flow, aortic cross clamping has the same effect.  The [[resuscitative endovascular balloon occlusion of the aorta]] (REBOA) device achieves this as well.  By design, these devices induce ischemia to the lower extremities (as a secondary effect, or less commonly as their primary use).  Releasing the cross clamp or removing the REBOA initiates reperfusion, and IR injury to the lower extremities may follow.\n\n==Treatment approaches==\nAvailable hind limb IR animal model are either artery vein ligation or tourniquet application (by rubber band or [[O-ring]]).<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Tan, X.|displayauthors=etal|title=Angiopoietin-2 impairs collateral artery growth associated with the suppression of the infiltration of macrophages in mouse hindlimb ischemia|journal=J Transl Med|year=2016|volume=14|issue=1|p=306|doi=10.1186/s12967-016-1055-x|pmc=5080762|pmid=27784306}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=Wu, J.|displayauthors=et al.|title=Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 inhibits angiogenic signaling by uncoupling vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2-alphaVbeta3 integrin cross talk|journal=Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol|year=2015|volume=35|issue=1|pp=111\u201320|pmc=4270947|pmid=25378411|doi=10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.304554}}</ref>\nPossible treatments are the application of IR related-pathway derived drug/inhibitor and [[cell therapy]].
