{"title_page": "Valuation ring", "text_new": "In [[abstract algebra]], a '''valuation ring''' is an [[integral domain]] ''D'' such that for every element ''x'' of its [[field of fractions]] ''F'', at least one of ''x'' or ''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup> belongs to ''D''.\n\nGiven a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'', if ''D'' is a [[subring]] of ''F'' such that either ''x'' or ''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup> belongs to\n''D'' for every nonzero ''x'' in ''F'', then ''D'' is said to be '''a valuation ring for the field ''F''''' or a '''place''' of ''F''. Since ''F'' in this case is indeed the field of fractions of ''D'', a valuation ring for a field is a valuation ring. Another way to characterize the valuation rings of a field ''F'' is that valuation rings ''D'' of ''F'' have ''F'' as their field of fractions, and their [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s are [[totally ordered]] by inclusion; or equivalently their [[principal ideal]]s are totally ordered by inclusion. In particular, every valuation ring is a [[local ring]].\n\nThe valuation rings of a field are the maximal elements of the set of the local subrings in the field partially ordered by '''dominance''' or '''refinement''',<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem I.6.1A}}</ref> where \n:<math>(A,\\mathfrak{m}_A)</math> dominates <math>(B,\\mathfrak{m}_B)</math> if <math>A \\supset B</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_A \\cap B = \\mathfrak{m}_B</math>.<ref>Efrat (2006) p.55</ref>\nEvery local ring in a field ''K'' is dominated by some valuation ring of ''K''.\n\nAn integral domain whose localization at any prime ideal is a valuation ring is called a [[Pr\u00fcfer domain]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nThere are several equivalent definitions of valuation ring (see below for the characterization in terms of dominance). For an integral domain ''D'' and its [[field of fractions]] ''K'', the following are equivalent:\n# For every nonzero ''x'' in ''K'', either ''x'' in ''D'' or ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> in ''D''.\n# The ideals of ''D'' are [[totally ordered]] by inclusion.\n# The principal ideals of ''D'' are [[totally ordered]] by inclusion (i.e., the elements in ''D'' are totally ordered by [[divisibility (ring theory)|divisibility]].)\n# There is a [[totally ordered group|totally ordered]] [[abelian group]] \u0393 (called the '''value group''') and a surjective group homomorphism (called the '''[[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]''') \u03bd : ''K''<sup>&times;</sup> \u2192 \u0393 with ''D'' = { ''x'' &isin; ''K''<sup>&times;</sup> | \u03bd(''x'') \u2265 0 } \u222a {0}.\n\nThe equivalence of the first three definitions follows easily. A theorem of {{harv|Krull|1939}} states that any ring satisfying the first three conditions satisfies the fourth: take \u0393 to be the quotient ''K''<sup>&times;</sup>/''D''<sup>&times;</sup> of the [[unit group]] of ''K'' by the unit group of ''D'', and take \u03bd to be the natural projection. We can turn \u0393 into a [[ordered group|totally ordered group]] by declaring the residue classes of elements of D as \"positive\".<ref>More precisely, \u0393 is totally ordered by defining <math> [x] \\geq [y] </math> [[if and only if]] <math> x y^{ - 1 } \\in D</math> where [x] and [y] are equivalence classes in \u0393. cf. Efrat (2006) p.39</ref>\n\nEven further, given any totally ordered abelian group \u0393, there is a valuation ring D with value group \u0393 (see a section below).\n\nFrom the fact that the ideals of a valuation ring are totally ordered, one can conclude that a valuation ring is a local domain, and that every finitely generated ideal of a valuation ring is principal (i.e., a valuation ring is a [[B\u00e9zout domain]]). In fact, it is a theorem of Krull that an integral domain is a valuation ring if and only if it is a local B\u00e9zout domain.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|1968|loc=Proposition 1.5}}</ref> It also follows from this that a valuation ring is Noetherian if and only if it is a [[principal ideal domain]]. In this case, it is either a field or it has exactly one non-zero prime ideal; in the latter case it is called a [[discrete valuation ring]]. (By convention, a field is not a discrete valuation ring.)\n\nA value group is called ''discrete'' if it is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers, and a valuation ring has a discrete valuation group if and only if it is a discrete valuation ring.<ref name=Efr43>Efrat (2006) p.43</ref>\n\nVery rarely, ''valuation ring'' may refer to a ring that satisfies the second or third condition but is not necessarily a domain.  A more common term for this type of ring is \"'''[[serial module|uniserial ring]]'''\".\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* Any field <math>\\mathbb{F}</math> is a valuation ring. For example, the ring of rational functions <math>\\mathbb{F}(X)</math> on an algebraic variety <math>X</math>.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/946933 The role of valuation rings in algebraic geometry]</ref><ref>[https://mathoverflow.net/q/28595 Does there exist a Riemann surface corresponding to every field extension? Any other hypothesis needed?]</ref>\n\n* A simple non-example is the integral domain <math>\\Complex[X]</math> since the inverse of a generic <math>f/g \\in \\Complex(X)</math> is <math>g/f \\not\\in \\Complex[X]</math>\n\n* The field of power series:\n::<math>\\mathbb{F}((X)) =\\left\\{ f(X) = \\sum_{i> -\\infty}^\\infty a_iX^i \\right\\}</math> \n:has the valuation <math>v(f) = \\inf\\nolimits_{a_n \\neq 0} n</math>. The subring <math>\\mathbb{F}[[X]]</math> is a valuation ring as well.\n\n* <math>\\Z_{(p)},</math> the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the integers <math>\\Z</math> at the prime ideal (''p''), consisting of ratios where the numerator is any integer and the denominator is not divisible by ''p''. The field of fractions is the field of rational numbers <math>\\Q.</math>\n\n* The ring of [[meromorphic function]]s on the entire [[complex plane]] which have a [[Maclaurin series]] ([[Taylor series]] expansion at zero) is a valuation ring. The field of fractions are the functions meromorphic on the whole plane. If ''f'' does not have a Maclaurin series then 1/''f'' does.\n* Any ring of [[p-adic integer]]s <math>\\Z_p</math> for a given prime ''p'' is a [[local ring]], with field of fractions the ''p''-adic numbers <math>\\Q_p</math>. The [[integral closure]] <math>\\Z_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> of the ''p''-adic integers is also a local ring, with field of fractions <math>\\Q_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> (the algebraic closure of ''p''-adic numbers). Both <math>\\Z_p</math> and <math>\\Z_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> are valuation rings.\n\n* Let '''k''' be an [[ordered field]]. An element of '''k''' is called finite if it lies between two integers ''n'' < ''x'' < ''m''; otherwise it is called infinite. The set ''D'' of finite elements of '''k''' is a valuation ring. The set of elements ''x'' such that ''x'' \u2208 ''D'' and ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2209''D'' is the set of [[infinitesimal]] elements; and an element ''x'' such that ''x'' \u2209 ''D'' and ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> \u2208 ''D'' is called infinite.\n\n* The ring '''F''' of finite elements of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]] *'''R''' (an ordered field containing the real numbers) is a valuation ring of *'''R'''. '''F''' consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, which is equivalent to saying a hyperreal number ''x'' such that \u2212''n'' < ''x'' < ''n'' for some standard integer ''n''. The [[residue field]], finite hyperreal numbers modulo the ideal of infinitesimal hyperreal numbers, is isomorphic to the real numbers.\n\n* A common geometric example comes from [[algebraic plane curve]]s.  Consider the polynomial ring <math>\\Complex[x, y]</math> and an irreducible polynomial <math>f</math> in that ring. Then the ring <math>\\Complex[x, y] / (f)</math> is the ring of polynomial functions on the curve <math>\\{(x, y) : f(x, y) = 0\\}</math>.  Choose a point <math>P = (P_x, P_y) \\in \\Complex^2</math> such that <math>f(P) = 0</math> and it is a [[regular point]] on the curve; i.e., the local ring ''R'' at the point is a [[regular local ring]] of Krull dimension one or a [[discrete valuation ring]].<!-- by assumption, it is a valuation ring Then the [[localization of a ring|localization]] <math>\\Complex[x, y]_{(x - P_x, y - P_y)} / (f)</math> is a discrete valuation ring. This ring represents [[germ (mathematics)|germ]]s of polynomial functions at the point <math>P</math>.  The fraction field is the ring of germs of rational functions at <math>P</math>, and the valuation ring property means that if a rational function has a pole at <math>P</math>, then its reciprocal does not. The valuation of a polynomial <math>g</math> can be computed as the length of the [[Artinian ring]] <math>\\Complex[x, y]_{(x-P_x, y-P_y)} / (f, g)</math> (assuming that ''g'' is in a general position) and the valuation of a quotient <math>g / h</math> can be computed as the difference of valuations.-->\n\n*For example, consider the inclusion <math>(\\mathbb{C}[[X^2]],(X^2)) \\hookrightarrow (\\mathbb{C}[[X]],(X))</math>. These are all subrings in the field of bounded-below power series <math>\\mathbb{C}((X))</math>.\n\n== Construction ==\nFor a given totally ordered abelian group \u0393 and a residue [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', define ''K'' = ''k''((\u0393)) to be the [[ring of formal power series]] whose powers come from \u0393, that is, the elements of ''K'' are functions from \u0393 to ''k'' such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] (the elements of \u0393 where the function value is not the zero of ''k'') of each function is a [[well-ordered]] subset of ''\u0393''.  Addition is pointwise, and multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]] or convolution, that is the natural operation when viewing the functions as power series:\n:<math> \\sum_{g \\in G} f(g) x^g</math> with <math>x^g \\cdot x^h = x^{g+h}.</math>\n\nThe valuation \u03bd(''f'') for ''f'' in ''K'' is defined to be the least element of the support of ''f'', that is the least element ''g'' of \u0393 such that ''f''(''g'') is nonzero.  The ''f'' with \u03bd(''f'')\u22650 (along with 0 in ''K''), form a subring ''D'' of ''K'' that is a valuation ring with value group \u0393, valuation \u03bd, and residue field ''k''.  This construction is detailed in {{harv|Fuchs|Salce|2001|pp=66\u201367}}, and follows a construction of {{harv|Krull|1939}} which uses quotients of polynomials instead of power series.\n\n== Dominance and integral closure ==\nThe [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s, or invertible elements, of a valuation ring are the elements ''x'' such that ''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup> is also a member of D. The other elements of ''D'', called nonunits, do not have an inverse, and they form an ideal ''M''. This ideal is maximal among the (totally ordered) ideals of D. Since ''M'' is a [[maximal ideal]], the [[quotient ring]] ''D''/''M'' is a field, called the '''residue field''' of ''D''.\n\nIn general, we say a local ring <math>(S,\\mathfrak{m}_S)</math> dominates a local ring <math>(R,\\mathfrak{m}_R)</math> if <math>S \\supset R</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_S \\cap R = \\mathfrak{m}_R</math>; in other words, the inclusion <math>R \\subset S</math> is a [[local ring homomorphism]]. Every local ring <math>(A, \\mathfrak{p})</math> in a field ''K'' is dominated by some valuation ring of ''K''. Indeed, the set consisting of all subrings ''R'' of ''K'' containing ''A'' and <math>1 \\not\\in \\mathfrak{p}R</math> is nonempty and is inductive; thus, has a maximal element <math>R</math> by Zorn's lemma. We claim ''R'' is a valuation ring. ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal containing <math>\\mathfrak{p}R</math> by maximality. Again by maximality it is also integrally closed. Now, if <math>x \\not\\in R</math>, then, by maximality, <math>\\mathfrak{p}R[x] = R[x]</math> and thus we can write:\n:<math>1 = r_0 + r_1 x + \\cdots + r_n x^n, \\quad r_i \\in \\mathfrak{p}R</math>.\nSince <math>1 - r_0</math> is a unit element, this implies that <math>x^{-1}</math> is integral over ''R''; thus is in ''R''. This proves ''R'' is a valuation ring. (''R'' dominates ''A'' since its maximal ideal contains <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> by construction.)\n\nA local ring ''R'' in a field ''K'' is a valuation ring if and only if it is a maximal element of the set of all local rings contained in ''K'' partially ordered by dominance. This easily follows from the above.<ref>Proof: if ''R'' is a maximal element, then it is dominated by a valuation ring; thus, it itself must be a valuation ring. Conversely, let ''R'' be a valuation ring and ''S'' a local ring that dominates ''R'' but not ''R''. There is ''x'' that is in ''S'' but not in ''R''. Then <math>x^{-1}</math> is in ''R'' and in fact in the maximal ideal of ''R''. But then <math>x^{-1} \\in \\mathfrak{m}_S</math>, which is absurd. Hence, there cannot be such ''S''.</ref>\n\nLet ''A'' be a subring of a field ''K'' and <math>f: A \\to k</math> a ring homomorphism into an [[algebraically closed field]] ''k''. Then ''f'' extends to a ring homomorphism <math>g: D \\to k</math>, ''D'' some valuation ring of ''K'' containing ''A''. (Proof: Let <math> g: R \\to k </math> be a maximal extension, which clearly exists by Zorn's lemma. By maximality, ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal containing the kernel of ''f''. If ''S'' is a local ring dominating ''R'', then ''S'' is algebraic over ''R''; if not, <math>S</math> contains a polynomial ring <math>R[x]</math> to which ''g'' extends, a contradiction to maximality. It follows <math>S/\\mathfrak{m}_S</math> is an algebraic field extension of <math>R/\\mathfrak{m}_R</math>. Thus, <math>S \\to S/\\mathfrak{m}_S \\hookrightarrow k</math> extends ''g''; hence, ''S'' = ''R''.)\n\nIf a subring ''R'' of a field ''K'' contains a valuation ring ''D'' of ''K'', then, by checking Definition 1, ''R'' is also a valuation ring of ''K''. In particular, ''R'' is local and its maximal ideal contracts to some prime ideal of ''D'', say, <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Then <math>R = D_\\mathfrak{p}</math> since <math>R</math> dominates <math>D_\\mathfrak{p}</math>, which is a valuation ring since the ideals are totally ordered. This observation is subsumed to the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Zariski\u2212Samuel|loc=Ch. VI, Theorem 3}}</ref> there is a bijective correspondence <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\mapsto D_\\mathfrak{p}, \\operatorname{Spec}(D) \\to</math> the set of all subrings of ''K'' containing ''D''. In particular, ''D'' is integrally closed,<ref name=Efr38>Efrat (2006) p.38</ref><ref>To see more directly that valuation rings are integrally closed, suppose that ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>0</sub> = 0.  Then dividing by\n''x''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> gives us ''x'' = &nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>0</sub>''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>. If ''x'' were not in ''D'', then ''x<sup>&nbsp;-1</sup>'' would be in ''D'' and this would express ''x'' as a finite sum of elements in ''D'', so that ''x'' would be in ''D'', a contradiction.\n</ref> and the [[Krull dimension]] of ''D'' is the [[cardinality]] of proper subrings of ''K'' containing ''D''.\n\nIn fact, the [[integral closure]] of an integral domain ''A'' in the field of fractions ''K'' of ''A'' is the intersection of all valuation rings of ''K'' containing ''A''.<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1986|loc=Theorem 10.4}}</ref> Indeed, the integral closure is contained in the intersection since the valuation rings are integrally closed. Conversely, let ''x'' be in ''K'' but not integral over ''A''. Since the ideal <math>x^{-1} A[x^{-1}]</math> is not <math>A[x^{-1}]</math>,<ref>In general, <math>x^{-1}</math> is integral over ''A'' if and only if <math>xA[x] = A[x].</math></ref> it is contained in a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Then there is a valuation ring ''R'' that dominates the localization of <math>A[x^{-1}]</math> at <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Since <math>x^{-1} \\in \\mathfrak{m}_R</math>, <math>x \\not\\in R</math>.\n\nThe dominance is used in algebraic geometry. Let ''X'' be an algebraic variety over a field ''k''. Then we say a valuation ring ''R'' in <math>k(X)</math> has \"center ''x'' on ''X''\" if <math>R</math> dominates the local ring <math>\\mathcal{O}_{x, X}</math> of the structure sheaf at ''x''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Ch II. Exercise 4.5}}</ref>\n\n== Ideals in valuation rings ==\nWe may describe the ideals in the valuation ring by means of its value group.\n\nLet \u0393 be a [[totally ordered abelian group]]. A subset \u0394 of \u0393 is called a ''segment'' if it is nonempty and, for any \u03b1 in \u0394, any element between -\u03b1 and \u03b1 is also in \u0394 (end points included). A subgroup of \u0393 is called an ''isolated subgroup'' if it is a segment and is a proper subgroup.\n\nLet ''D'' be a valuation ring with valuation ''v'' and value group \u0393. For any subset ''A'' of ''D'', we let <math>\\Gamma_A</math> be the complement of the union of <math>v(A - 0)</math> and <math>-v(A - 0)</math> in <math>\\Gamma</math>. If ''I'' is a proper ideal, then <math>\\Gamma_I</math> is a segment of <math>\\Gamma</math>. In fact, the mapping <math>I \\mapsto \\Gamma_I</math> defines an inclusion-reversing bijection between the set of proper ideals of ''D'' and the set of segments of <math>\\Gamma</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Zariski\u2212Samuel|loc=Ch. VI, Theorem 15}}</ref> Under this correspondence, the nonzero prime ideals of ''D'' correspond bijectively to the isolated subgroups of \u0393.\n\nExample: The ring of ''p''-adic integers <math>\\Z_p</math> is a valuation ring with value group <math>\\Z</math>. The zero subgroup of <math>\\Z</math> corresponds to the unique maximal ideal <math>(p) \\subset \\Z_p</math> and the whole group to the zero ideal. The maximal ideal is the only isolated subgroup of <math>\\Z</math>.\n\nThe set of isolated subgroups is totally ordered by inclusion. The '''height''' or '''rank''' ''r''(\u0393) of \u0393 is defined to be the [[cardinality]] of the set of isolated subgroups of \u0393. Since the nonzero prime ideals are totally ordered and they correspond to isolated subgroups of \u0393, the height of \u0393 is equal to the [[Krull dimension]] of the valuation ring ''D'' associated with \u0393.\n\nThe most important special case is height one, which is equivalent to \u0393 being a subgroup of the [[real number]]s \u211d under addition (or equivalently, of the [[positive real numbers]] \u211d<sup>+</sup> under multiplication.) A valuation ring with a valuation of height one has a corresponding [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] defining an [[ultrametric]] [[place (mathematics)|place]]. A special case of this are the [[discrete valuation ring]]s mentioned earlier.\n\nThe '''rational rank''' ''rr''(\u0393) is defined as the rank of the value group as an abelian group, \n:<math>\\mathrm{dim}_\\Q(\\Gamma \\otimes_\\Z \\Q).</math>\n\n==Places==\nThe reference to this section is Zariski\u2013Samuel.\n\n=== General definition ===\nA ''[[place (mathematics)|place]]'' of a field ''K'' is a ring homomorphism ''p'' from a valuation ring ''D'' of ''K'' to some field such that, for any <math>x \\not\\in D</math>, <math>p(1/x) = 0</math>. The image of a place is a field called the '''residue field''' of ''p''. For example, the canonical map <math>D \\to D/\\mathfrak{m}_D</math> is a place.\n\n==== Example ====\nLet ''A'' be a [[Dedekind domain]] and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> a prime ideal. Then the canonical map <math>A_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\to k(\\mathfrak{p})</math> is a place.\n\n=== Specialization of places ===\nWe say a '''place ''p'' ''specializes to'' a place ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>'',''' denoted by <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math>, if the valuation ring of ''p'' contains the valuation ring of ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>''. In algebraic geometry, we say a prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> specializes to <math>\\mathfrak{p}'</math> if <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathfrak{p}'</math>. The two notions coincide: <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math> if and only if a prime ideal corresponding to ''p'' specializes to a prime ideal corresponding to ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' in some valuation ring (recall that if <math>D \\supset D'</math> are valuation rings of the same field, then ''D'' corresponds to a prime ideal of <math>D'</math>.)\n\n==== Example ====\nFor example, in the function field <math>\\mathbb{F}(X)</math> of some algebraic variety <math>X</math> every prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\in \\text{Spec}(R)</math> contained in a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> gives a specialization <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\rightsquigarrow \\mathfrak{m}</math>.\n\n==== Remarks ====\nIt can be shown: if <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math>, then <math>p' = q \\circ p|_{D'}</math> for some place ''q'' of the residue field <math>k(p)</math> of ''p''. (Observe <math>p(D')</math> is a valuation ring of <math>k(p)</math> and let ''q'' be the corresponding place; the rest is mechanical.) If ''D'' is a valuation ring of ''p'', then its Krull dimension is the cardinarity of the specializations other than ''p'' to ''p''. Thus, for any place ''p'' with valuation ring ''D'' of a field ''K'' over a field ''k'', we have:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{tr.deg}_k k(p) + \\dim D \\le \\operatorname{tr.deg}_k K</math>.\n\nIf ''p'' is a place and ''A'' is a subring of the valuation ring of ''p'', then <math>\\operatorname{ker}(p) \\cap A</math> is called the ''center'' of ''p'' in ''A''.\n\n=== Places at infinity ===\nFor the function field on an affine variety <math>X</math> there are valuations which are not associated to any of the primes of <math>X</math>. These valuations are called '''the places at infinity'''.[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3330320/place-at-infinity-in-function-fields] For example, the affine line <math>\\mathbb{A}^1_k</math> has function field <math>k(x)</math>. The place associated to the localization of <blockquote><math>k\\left[\\frac{1}{x}\\right]</math> </blockquote>at the maximal ideal<blockquote><math>\\mathfrak{m}=\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math></blockquote>is a place at infinity.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], ''Commutative Algebra'', Addison-Wesley, 1972\n* {{citation\n   |author=Cohn, P.

In particular, every valuation ring is a [[local ring]].\n\nThe valuation rings of a field are the maximal elements of the set of the local subrings in the field partially ordered by '''dominance''' or '''refinement''',<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Theorem I.6.1A}}</ref> where \n:<math>(A,\\mathfrak{m}_A)</math> dominates <math>(B,\\mathfrak{m}_B)</math> if <math>A \\supset B</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_A \\cap B = \\mathfrak{m}_B</math>.<ref>Efrat (2006) p.55</ref>\nEvery local ring in a field ''K'' is dominated by some valuation ring of ''K''.\n\nAn integral domain whose localization at any prime ideal is a valuation ring is called a [[Pr\u00fcfer domain]].\n\n== Definitions ==\nThere are several equivalent definitions of valuation ring (see below for the characterization in terms of dominance). For an integral domain ''D'' and its [[field of fractions]] ''K'', the following are equivalent:\n# For every nonzero ''x'' in ''K'', either ''x'' in ''D'' or ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> in ''D''.\n# The ideals of ''D'' are [[totally ordered]] by inclusion.\n# The principal ideals of ''D'' are [[totally ordered]] by inclusion (i.e., the elements in ''D'' are totally ordered by [[divisibility (ring theory)|divisibility]].)\n# There is a [[totally ordered group|totally ordered]] [[abelian group]] \u0393 (called the '''value group''') and a surjective group homomorphism (called the '''[[valuation (algebra)|valuation]]''') \u03bd : ''K''<sup>&times;</sup> \u2192 \u0393 with ''D'' = { ''x'' &isin; ''K''<sup>&times;</sup> | \u03bd(''x'') \u2265 0 } \u222a {0}.\n\nThe equivalence of the first three definitions follows easily. A theorem of {{harv|Krull|1939}} states that any ring satisfying the first three conditions satisfies the fourth: take \u0393 to be the quotient ''K''<sup>&times;</sup>/''D''<sup>&times;</sup> of the [[unit group]] of ''K'' by the unit group of ''D'', and take \u03bd to be the natural projection. We can turn \u0393 into a [[ordered group|totally ordered group]] by declaring the residue classes of elements of D as \"positive\".<ref>More precisely, \u0393 is totally ordered by defining <math> [x] \\geq [y] </math> [[if and only if]] <math> x y^{ - 1 } \\in D</math> where [x] and [y] are equivalence classes in \u0393. cf. Efrat (2006) p.39</ref>\n\nEven further, given any totally ordered abelian group \u0393, there is a valuation ring D with value group \u0393 (see a section below).\n\nFrom the fact that the ideals of a valuation ring are totally ordered, one can conclude that a valuation ring is a local domain, and that every finitely generated ideal of a valuation ring is principal (i.e., a valuation ring is a [[B\u00e9zout domain]]). In fact, it is a theorem of Krull that an integral domain is a valuation ring if and only if it is a local B\u00e9zout domain.<ref>{{harvnb|Cohn|1968|loc=Proposition 1.5}}</ref> It also follows from this that a valuation ring is Noetherian if and only if it is a [[principal ideal domain]]. In this case, it is either a field or it has exactly one non-zero prime ideal; in the latter case it is called a [[discrete valuation ring]]. (By convention, a field is not a discrete valuation ring.)\n\nA value group is called ''discrete'' if it is isomorphic to the additive group of the integers, and a valuation ring has a discrete valuation group if and only if it is a discrete valuation ring.<ref name=Efr43>Efrat (2006) p.43</ref>\n\nVery rarely, ''valuation ring'' may refer to a ring that satisfies the second or third condition but is not necessarily a domain.  A more common term for this type of ring is \"'''[[serial module|uniserial ring]]'''\".\n\n== Examples ==\n\n* Any field <math>\\mathbb{F}</math> is a valuation ring. For example, ring ring of rational functions <math>\\mathbb{F}(X)</math> on an algebraic variety <math>X</math>.<ref>[https://math.stackexchange.com/q/946933 The role of valuation rings in algebraic geometry]</ref><ref>[https://mathoverflow.net/q/28595 Does there exist a Riemann surface corresponding to every field extension? Any other hypothesis needed?]</ref>\n\n* A simple non-example is the integral domain <math>\\Complex[X]</math> since the inverse of a generic <math>f/g \\in \\Complex(X)</math> is <math>g/f \\not\\in \\Complex[X]</math>\n\n* The field of power series:\n::<math>\\mathbb{F}((X)) =\\left\\{ f(X) = \\sum_{i> -\\infty}^\\infty a_iX^i \\right\\}</math> \n:has the valuation <math>v(f) = \\inf\\nolimits_{a_n \\neq 0} n</math>. The subring <math>\\mathbb{F}[[X]]</math> is a valuation ring as well.\n\n* <math>\\Z_{(p)},</math> the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of the integers <math>\\Z</math> at the prime ideal (''p''), consisting of ratios where the numerator is any integer and the denominator is not divisible by ''p''. The field of fractions is the field of rational numbers <math>\\Q.</math>\n\n* The ring of [[meromorphic function]]s on the entire [[complex plane]] which have a [[Maclaurin series]] ([[Taylor series]] expansion at zero) is a valuation ring. The field of fractions are the functions meromorphic on the whole plane. If ''f'' does not have a Maclaurin series then 1/''f'' does.\n* Any ring of [[p-adic integer]]s <math>\\Z_p</math> for a given prime ''p'' is a [[local ring]], with field of fractions the ''p''-adic numbers <math>\\Q_p</math>. The [[integral closure]] <math>\\Z_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> of the ''p''-adic integers is also a local ring, with field of fractions <math>\\Q_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> (the algebraic closure of ''p''-adic numbers). Both <math>\\Z_p</math> and <math>\\Z_p^{\\text{cl}}</math> are valuation rings.\n\n* Let '''k''' be an [[ordered field]]. An element of '''k''' is called finite if it lies between two integers ''n'' < ''x'' < ''m''; otherwise it is called infinite. The set ''D'' of finite elements of '''k''' is a valuation ring. The set of elements ''x'' such that ''x'' \u2208 ''D'' and ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup>\u2209''D'' is the set of [[infinitesimal]] elements; and an element ''x'' such that ''x'' \u2209 ''D'' and ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> \u2208 ''D'' is called infinite.\n\n* The ring '''F''' of finite elements of a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal field]] *'''R''' (an ordered field containing the real numbers) is a valuation ring of *'''R'''. '''F''' consists of all hyperreal numbers differing from a standard real by an infinitesimal amount, which is equivalent to saying a hyperreal number ''x'' such that \u2212''n'' < ''x'' < ''n'' for some standard integer ''n''. The [[residue field]], finite hyperreal numbers modulo the ideal of infinitesimal hyperreal numbers, is isomorphic to the real numbers.\n\n* A common geometric example comes from [[algebraic plane curve]]s.  Consider the polynomial ring <math>\\Complex[x, y]</math> and an irreducible polynomial <math>f</math> in that ring. Then the ring <math>\\Complex[x, y] / (f)</math> is the ring of polynomial functions on the curve <math>\\{(x, y) : f(x, y) = 0\\}</math>.  Choose a point <math>P = (P_x, P_y) \\in \\Complex^2</math> such that <math>f(P) = 0</math> and it is a [[regular point]] on the curve; i.e., the local ring ''R'' at the point is a [[regular local ring]] of Krull dimension one or a [[discrete valuation ring]].<!-- by assumption, it is a valuation ring Then the [[localization of a ring|localization]] <math>\\Complex[x, y]_{(x - P_x, y - P_y)} / (f)</math> is a discrete valuation ring. This ring represents [[germ (mathematics)|germ]]s of polynomial functions at the point <math>P</math>.  The fraction field is the ring of germs of rational functions at <math>P</math>, and the valuation ring property means that if a rational function has a pole at <math>P</math>, then its reciprocal does not. The valuation of a polynomial <math>g</math> can be computed as the length of the [[Artinian ring]] <math>\\Complex[x, y]_{(x-P_x, y-P_y)} / (f, g)</math> (assuming that ''g'' is in a general position) and the valuation of a quotient <math>g / h</math> can be computed as the difference of valuations.-->\n\n*For example, consider the inclusion <math>(\\mathbb{C}[[X^2]],(X^2)) \\hookrightarrow (\\mathbb{C}[[X]],(X))</math>. These are all subrings in the field of bounded-below power series <math>\\mathbb{C}((X))</math>.\n\n== Construction ==\nFor a given totally ordered abelian group \u0393 and a residue [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k'', define ''K'' = ''k''((\u0393)) to be the [[ring of formal power series]] whose powers come from \u0393, that is, the elements of ''K'' are functions from \u0393 to ''k'' such that the [[support (mathematics)|support]] (the elements of \u0393 where the function value is not the zero of ''k'') of each function is a [[well-ordered]] subset of ''\u0393''.  Addition is pointwise, and multiplication is the [[Cauchy product]] or convolution, that is the natural operation when viewing the functions as power series:\n:<math> \\sum_{g \\in G} f(g) x^g</math> with <math>x^g \\cdot x^h = x^{g+h}.</math>\n\nThe valuation \u03bd(''f'') for ''f'' in ''K'' is defined to be the least element of the support of ''f'', that is the least element ''g'' of \u0393 such that ''f''(''g'') is nonzero.  The ''f'' with \u03bd(''f'')\u22650 (along with 0 in ''K''), form a subring ''D'' of ''K'' that is a valuation ring with value group \u0393, valuation \u03bd, and residue field ''k''.  This construction is detailed in {{harv|Fuchs|Salce|2001|pp=66\u201367}}, and follows a construction of {{harv|Krull|1939}} which uses quotients of polynomials instead of power series.\n\n== Dominance and integral closure ==\nThe [[unit (ring theory)|unit]]s, or invertible elements, of a valuation ring are the elements ''x'' such that ''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;1</sup> is also a member of D. The other elements of ''D'', called nonunits, do not have an inverse, and they form an ideal ''M''. This ideal is maximal among the (totally ordered) ideals of D. Since ''M'' is a [[maximal ideal]], the [[quotient ring]] ''D''/''M'' is a field, called the '''residue field''' of ''D''.\n\nIn general, we say a local ring <math>(S,\\mathfrak{m}_S)</math> dominates a local ring <math>(R,\\mathfrak{m}_R)</math> if <math>S \\supset R</math> and <math>\\mathfrak{m}_S \\cap R = \\mathfrak{m}_R</math>; in other words, the inclusion <math>R \\subset S</math> is a [[local ring homomorphism]]. Every local ring <math>(A, \\mathfrak{p})</math> in a field ''K'' is dominated by some valuation ring of ''K''. Indeed, the set consisting of all subrings ''R'' of ''K'' containing ''A'' and <math>1 \\not\\in \\mathfrak{p}R</math> is nonempty and is inductive; thus, has a maximal element <math>R</math> by Zorn's lemma. We claim ''R'' is a valuation ring. ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal containing <math>\\mathfrak{p}R</math> by maximality. Again by maximality it is also integrally closed. Now, if <math>x \\not\\in R</math>, then, by maximality, <math>\\mathfrak{p}R[x] = R[x]</math> and thus we can write:\n:<math>1 = r_0 + r_1 x + \\cdots + r_n x^n, \\quad r_i \\in \\mathfrak{p}R</math>.\nSince <math>1 - r_0</math> is a unit element, this implies that <math>x^{-1}</math> is integral over ''R''; thus is in ''R''. This proves ''R'' is a valuation ring. (''R'' dominates ''A'' since its maximal ideal contains <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> by construction.)\n\nA local ring ''R'' in a field ''K'' is a valuation ring if and only if it is a maximal element of the set of all local rings contained in ''K'' partially ordered by dominance. This easily follows from the above.<ref>Proof: if ''R'' is a maximal element, then it is dominated by a valuation ring; thus, it itself must be a valuation ring. Conversely, let ''R'' be a valuation ring and ''S'' a local ring that dominates ''R'' but not ''R''. There is ''x'' that is in ''S'' but not in ''R''. Then <math>x^{-1}</math> is in ''R'' and in fact in the maximal ideal of ''R''. But then <math>x^{-1} \\in \\mathfrak{m}_S</math>, which is absurd. Hence, there cannot be such ''S''.</ref>\n\nLet ''A'' be a subring of a field ''K'' and <math>f: A \\to k</math> a ring homomorphism into an [[algebraically closed field]] ''k''. Then ''f'' extends to a ring homomorphism <math>g: D \\to k</math>, ''D'' some valuation ring of ''K'' containing ''A''. (Proof: Let <math> g: R \\to k </math> be a maximal extension, which clearly exists by Zorn's lemma. By maximality, ''R'' is a local ring with maximal ideal containing the kernel of ''f''. If ''S'' is a local ring dominating ''R'', then ''S'' is algebraic over ''R''; if not, <math>S</math> contains a polynomial ring <math>R[x]</math> to which ''g'' extends, a contradiction to maximality. It follows <math>S/\\mathfrak{m}_S</math> is an algebraic field extension of <math>R/\\mathfrak{m}_R</math>. Thus, <math>S \\to S/\\mathfrak{m}_S \\hookrightarrow k</math> extends ''g''; hence, ''S'' = ''R''.)\n\nIf a subring ''R'' of a field ''K'' contains a valuation ring ''D'' of ''K'', then, by checking Definition 1, ''R'' is also a valuation ring of ''K''. In particular, ''R'' is local and its maximal ideal contracts to some prime ideal of ''D'', say, <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Then <math>R = D_\\mathfrak{p}</math> since <math>R</math> dominates <math>D_\\mathfrak{p}</math>, which is a valuation ring since the ideals are totally ordered. This observation is subsumed to the following:<ref>{{harvnb|Zariski\u2212Samuel|loc=Ch. VI, Theorem 3}}</ref> there is a bijective correspondence <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\mapsto D_\\mathfrak{p}, \\operatorname{Spec}(D) \\to</math> the set of all subrings of ''K'' containing ''D''. In particular, ''D'' is integrally closed,<ref name=Efr38>Efrat (2006) p.38</ref><ref>To see more directly that valuation rings are integrally closed, suppose that ''x''<sup>''n''</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>''x''<sup>''n''&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;1</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;...&nbsp;+&nbsp;''a''<sub>0</sub> = 0.  Then dividing by\n''x''<sup>''n''&minus;1</sup> gives us ''x'' = &nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;...&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''a''<sub>0</sub>''x''<sup>&nbsp;&minus;&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</sup>. If ''x'' were not in ''D'', then ''x<sup>&nbsp;-1</sup>'' would be in ''D'' and this would express ''x'' as a finite sum of elements in ''D'', so that ''x'' would be in ''D'', a contradiction.\n</ref> and the [[Krull dimension]] of ''D'' is the [[cardinality]] of proper subrings of ''K'' containing ''D''.\n\nIn fact, the [[integral closure]] of an integral domain ''A'' in the field of fractions ''K'' of ''A'' is the intersection of all valuation rings of ''K'' containing ''A''.<ref>{{harvnb|Matsumura|1986|loc=Theorem 10.4}}</ref> Indeed, the integral closure is contained in the intersection since the valuation rings are integrally closed. Conversely, let ''x'' be in ''K'' but not integral over ''A''. Since the ideal <math>x^{-1} A[x^{-1}]</math> is not <math>A[x^{-1}]</math>,<ref>In general, <math>x^{-1}</math> is integral over ''A'' if and only if <math>xA[x] = A[x].</math></ref> it is contained in a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Then there is a valuation ring ''R'' that dominates the localization of <math>A[x^{-1}]</math> at <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math>. Since <math>x^{-1} \\in \\mathfrak{m}_R</math>, <math>x \\not\\in R</math>.\n\nThe dominance is used in algebraic geometry. Let ''X'' be an algebraic variety over a field ''k''. Then we say a valuation ring ''R'' in <math>k(X)</math> has \"center ''x'' on ''X''\" if <math>R</math> dominates the local ring <math>\\mathcal{O}_{x, X}</math> of the structure sheaf at ''x''.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartshorne|1977|loc=Ch II. Exercise 4.5}}</ref>\n\n== Ideals in valuation rings ==\nWe may describe the ideals in the valuation ring by means of its value group.\n\nLet \u0393 be a [[totally ordered abelian group]]. A subset \u0394 of \u0393 is called a ''segment'' if it is nonempty and, for any \u03b1 in \u0394, any element between -\u03b1 and \u03b1 is also in \u0394 (end points included). A subgroup of \u0393 is called an ''isolated subgroup'' if it is a segment and is a proper subgroup.\n\nLet ''D'' be a valuation ring with valuation ''v'' and value group \u0393. For any subset ''A'' of ''D'', we let <math>\\Gamma_A</math> be the complement of the union of <math>v(A - 0)</math> and <math>-v(A - 0)</math> in <math>\\Gamma</math>. If ''I'' is a proper ideal, then <math>\\Gamma_I</math> is a segment of <math>\\Gamma</math>. In fact, the mapping <math>I \\mapsto \\Gamma_I</math> defines an inclusion-reversing bijection between the set of proper ideals of ''D'' and the set of segments of <math>\\Gamma</math>.<ref>{{harvnb|Zariski\u2212Samuel|loc=Ch. VI, Theorem 15}}</ref> Under this correspondence, the nonzero prime ideals of ''D'' correspond bijectively to the isolated subgroups of \u0393.\n\nExample: The ring of ''p''-adic integers <math>\\Z_p</math> is a valuation ring with value group <math>\\Z</math>. The zero subgroup of <math>\\Z</math> corresponds to the unique maximal ideal <math>(p) \\subset \\Z_p</math> and the whole group to the zero ideal. The maximal ideal is the only isolated subgroup of <math>\\Z</math>.\n\nThe set of isolated subgroups is totally ordered by inclusion. The '''height''' or '''rank''' ''r''(\u0393) of \u0393 is defined to be the [[cardinality]] of the set of isolated subgroups of \u0393. Since the nonzero prime ideals are totally ordered and they correspond to isolated subgroups of \u0393, the height of \u0393 is equal to the [[Krull dimension]] of the valuation ring ''D'' associated with \u0393.\n\nThe most important special case is height one, which is equivalent to \u0393 being a subgroup of the [[real number]]s \u211d under addition (or equivalently, of the [[positive real numbers]] \u211d<sup>+</sup> under multiplication.) A valuation ring with a valuation of height one has a corresponding [[absolute value (algebra)|absolute value]] defining an [[ultrametric]] [[place (mathematics)|place]]. A special case of this are the [[discrete valuation ring]]s mentioned earlier.\n\nThe '''rational rank''' ''rr''(\u0393) is defined as the rank of the value group as an abelian group, \n:<math>\\mathrm{dim}_\\Q(\\Gamma \\otimes_\\Z \\Q).</math>\n\n==Places==\nThe reference to this section is Zariski\u2013Samuel.\n\n=== General definition ===\nA ''[[place (mathematics)|place]]'' of a field ''K'' is a ring homomorphism ''p'' from a valuation ring ''D'' of ''K'' to some field such that, for any <math>x \\not\\in D</math>, <math>p(1/x) = 0</math>. The image of a place is a field called the '''residue field''' of ''p''. For example, the canonical map <math>D \\to D/\\mathfrak{m}_D</math> is a place.\n\n==== Example ====\nLet ''A'' be a [[Dedekind domain]] and <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> a prime ideal. Then the canonical map <math>A_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\to k(\\mathfrak{p})</math> is a place.\n\n=== Specialization of places ===\nWe say a '''place ''p'' ''specializes to'' a place ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>'',''' denoted by <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math>, if the valuation ring of ''p'' contains the valuation ring of ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>''. In algebraic geometry, we say a prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p}</math> specializes to <math>\\mathfrak{p}'</math> if <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\subset \\mathfrak{p}'</math>. The two notions coincide: <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math> if and only if a prime ideal corresponding to ''p'' specializes to a prime ideal corresponding to ''p<nowiki>'</nowiki>'' in some valuation ring (recall that if <math>D \\supset D'</math> are valuation rings of the same field, then ''D'' corresponds to a prime ideal of <math>D'</math>.)\n\n==== Example ====\nFor example, in the function field <math>\\mathbb{F}(X)</math> of some algebraic variety <math>X</math> every prime ideal <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\in \\text{Spec}(R)</math> contained in a maximal ideal <math>\\mathfrak{m}</math> gives a specialization <math>\\mathfrak{p} \\rightsquigarrow \\mathfrak{m}</math>.\n\n==== Remarks ====\nIt can be shown: if <math>p \\rightsquigarrow p'</math>, then <math>p' = q \\circ p|_{D'}</math> for some place ''q'' of the residue field <math>k(p)</math> of ''p''. (Observe <math>p(D')</math> is a valuation ring of <math>k(p)</math> and let ''q'' be the corresponding place; the rest is mechanical.) If ''D'' is a valuation ring of ''p'', then its Krull dimension is the cardinarity of the specializations other than ''p'' to ''p''. Thus, for any place ''p'' with valuation ring ''D'' of a field ''K'' over a field ''k'', we have:\n\n:<math> \\operatorname{tr.deg}_k k(p) + \\dim D \\le \\operatorname{tr.deg}_k K</math>.\n\nIf ''p'' is a place and ''A'' is a subring of the valuation ring of ''p'', then <math>\\operatorname{ker}(p) \\cap A</math> is called the ''center'' of ''p'' in ''A''.\n\n=== Places at infinity ===\nFor the function field on an affine variety <math>X</math> there are valuations which are not associated to any of the primes of <math>X</math>. These valuations are called '''the places at infinity'''.[https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3330320/place-at-infinity-in-function-fields] For example, the affine line <math>\\mathbb{A}^1_k</math> has function field <math>k(x)</math>. The place associated to the localization of <blockquote><math>k\\left[\\frac{1}{x}\\right]</math> </blockquote>at the maximal ideal<blockquote><math>\\mathfrak{m}=\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)</math></blockquote>is a place at infinity.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* [[Nicolas Bourbaki]], ''Commutative Algebra'', Addison-Wesley, 1972\n* {{citation\n   |author=Cohn, P.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4\u201389.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart. The three implements on the left represent (''from top to bottom'') the pump, the oxygenator, and the reservoir.]]\nCardiopulmonary bypass is commonly used in operations involving the heart. The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward. Similarly, CPB can be used to rewarm individuals suffering from [[hypothermia]].<ref>{{Cite journal  |last1 = McCullough | first1 = L. | last2 = Arora | first2 = S. | title = Diagnosis and treatment of hypothermia. | journal = Am Fam Physician | volume = 70 | issue = 12 | pages = 2325\u201332 |date=Dec 2004 | doi =  | pmid = 15617296 }}</ref> This rewarming method of using CPB is successful if the core temperature of the patient is above 16&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lich |first1=Bryan |last2=Brown |first2=Mark |title=The Manual of Clinical Perfusion |publisher=PERFUSION.COM, INC. |location=Fort Myers, Florida |isbn=978-0-9753396-0-2 |pages=117 |edition=2nd|year=2004 }}</ref>\n\nExtracorporeal membrane oxygenation ([[ECMO]]) is a simplified version of the [[heart lung machine]] that includes a [[centrifugal pump]] and an oxygenator to temporarily take over the function of heart and/or the lungs. ECMO is useful in post cardiac surgery patients with cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction, in patients with acute pulmonary failure, massive [[pulmonary embolisms]], lung trauma from infections, and a range of other problems that impair cardiac or pulmonary function.

As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. CPB is known to activate the coagulation cascade and stimulate inflammatory mediators. leading to hemolysis and coagulopathies. This problem worsens as complement proteins build on the membrane oxygenators.<ref name=\":4\" /> For this reason, most oxygenators come with a manufacturer's recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of six hours, although they are sometimes used for up to ten hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, an [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days \u2013 such as in this Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news126460484.html Man survives 16 days without a heart] United Press International.

For Type III reactions, heparin is redosed and the patient may need to go back on bypass.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nCPB may contribute to immediate cognitive decline. The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes. Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine \"Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?\"] ''Scientific American'', January 9, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Components==\nCardiopulmonary bypass consists of two main functional units, the [[pump]] and the [[oxygenator]] which removes relatively oxygen-depleted blood from a patient's body and replaces it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes (hoses). A [[heat exchanger]] is used to control body temperature by heating or cooling the blood in the circuit. It is important that all components of the circuit are coated internally by [[heparin]] or another anticoagulant to prevent clotting within the circuit.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n[[File:Perfusionist opearting heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|250px|Perfusionist operating a modern heart lung machine]]\n\n===Tubing===\nThe components of the CPB circuit are interconnected by a series of tubes made of [[silicone rubber]] or [[PVC]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ebme.co.uk/articles/clinical-engineering/cardiopulmonary-bypass-machine-cpb|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass machine - CPB|last=Davies|first=Huw|website=www.ebme.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-11-21}}</ref>\n\n===Pumps===\n\n====Centrifugal pump====\nMany CPB circuits now employ a [[centrifugal pump]] for the maintenance and control of blood flow during CPB. By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat Exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. The heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath. A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus).<ref name=\":0\" /> These delivery methods are referred to antegrade and retrograde, respectively. Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]]. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium's actions on [[myocyte]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Technique==\n\n===Pre-operative planning===\nCPB requires significant forethought before surgery. In particular, the cannulation, cooling, and cardio-protective strategies must be coordinated between the [[surgeon]], [[Anesthesiology|anesthesiologist]], [[perfusionist]], and [[Nursing|nursing staff]].<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiopulmonary bypass : a primer|last=Mokadam, Nahush A., author, editor.|oclc=922073684}}</ref>\n\n==== Cannulation strategy ====\nThe cannulation strategy varies on several operation-specific and patient-specific details. The typical arterial cannulation involves the placement of a single cannulation within distal [[Aorta|ascending aorta]]. The most simple form on involves placement of a single cannula (known as a dual-stage cannula) passed through the [[right atrium]] and into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In some operations, such as those involving the [[Tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] or [[mitral valve]], two cannula are used\u2014one is passed though the inferior vena cava and one through the [[superior vena cava]]. This is known as single-stage cannulation.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=TSRA Primer of Cardiothoracic Surgery|last=Youssef|first=Samuel J.|last2=Williams|first2=Jason A.|publisher=TSRA/TSDA|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9894023-0-9|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==== Cooling strategy ====\n\n==== Cardio-protective strategy ====\n\n=== Intra-operative technique ===\nA CPB circuit must be primed with fluid and all air expunged from the arterial line/cannula before connection to the patient. The circuit is primed with a [[intravenous therapy|crystalloid]] solution and sometimes blood products are also added. Prior to cannulation (typically after opening the pericardium when using central cannulation), [[heparin]] or another [[anticoagulant]] is administered until the [[activated clotting time]] is above 480 seconds.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Kirklin/Barratt-Boyes cardiac surgery : morphology, diagnostic criteria, natural history, techniques, results, and indications|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|others=Kouchoukos, Nicholas T., Kirklin, John W.

Preoperative imaging or an [[ultrasound]] probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or [[stroke]]. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

Much work since the 1960s focused on overcoming the gas exchange handicap of the membrane barrier, leading to the development of high-performance microporous hollow-fibre oxygenators that eventually replaced direct-contact oxygenators in cardiac theatres.<ref name=\"Lim 2006\">{{cite journal|author=Lim M|year=2006|title=The history of extracorporeal oxygenators|journal=Anaesthesia|volume=61|issue=10|pages=984\u201395|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2044.2006.04781.x|pmid=16978315}}</ref>[[File:Patent autojektor.gif|thumb|right|Brukhonenko's ''Autojektor'']]\n\nIn 1983, Ken Litzie patented a closed emergency heart bypass system which reduced circuit and component complexity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://patents.justia.com/patent/4540399|title=US Patent for Emergency bypass system Patent (Patent # 4,540,399 issued September 10, 1985) - Justia Patents Search|website=patents.justia.com|access-date=2019-09-28}}</ref> This device improved patient survival after cardiac arrest because it could be rapidly deployed in non-surgical settings.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Reichman|first=Robert|date=1990|title=Improved Patient Survival Using a Cardiopulmonary Support System After Cardiac Arrest|url=https://www.annalsthoracicsurgery.org/article/0003-4975(90)90363-B/pdf|journal=Annals of Thoracic Surgery|volume=49|issue=1|pages=101\u2013105|via=|doi=10.1016/0003-4975(90)90363-B|pmid=2297254}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Cardiopulmonary bypass}}\n*[http://www.bestpracticeperfusion.org International Consortium For Evidence-Based Perfusion]\n*[http://circuitsurfers.com/ CircuitSurfers: A Perfusion Blog about Cardiopulmonary Bypass]\n*{{cite book |vauthors=Hessel EA, Edmunds LH |chapter=Extracorporeal Circulation: Perfusion Systems |veditors=Cohn LH, Edmunds LH |title=Cardiac Surgery in the Adult |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |pages=317\u201338 |chapter-url=http://cardiacsurgery.ctsnetbooks.org/cgi/content/full/2/2003/317 |access-date=2006-12-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061210154850/http://cardiacsurgery.ctsnetbooks.org/cgi/content/full/2/2003/317# |archive-date=2006-12-10 |url-status=dead }}\n*[http://mmcts.ctsnetjournals.org/cgi/collection/cardiopulmonary_bypass Multimedia Manual of Cardiothoracic Surgery.

The CPB pump itself is often referred to as a '''heart\u2013lung machine''' or \"the pump\". Cardiopulmonary bypass pumps are operated by [[perfusionist]]s.  CPB is a form of [[extracorporeal]] circulation. [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] is generally used for longer-term treatment.\n\nCPB mechanically circulates and oxygenates blood for the body while bypassing the heart and lungs. It uses a heart\u2013lung machine to maintain perfusion to other body organs and tissues while the surgeon works in a bloodless surgical field. The surgeon places a [[cannula]] in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the body. Venous blood is removed from the body by the cannula and then filtered, cooled or warmed, and oxygenated before it is returned to the body by a mechanical pump. The cannula used to return oxygenated blood is usually inserted in the ascending aorta, but it may be inserted in the femoral artery, axillary artery, or brachiocephalic artery (among others).<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Cardiac surgery in the adult|others=Cohn, Lawrence H., 1937-2016|isbn=978-0-07-184487-1|edition=Fifth|location=New York|oclc=930496902|date = 2017-08-28}}</ref><ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThe patient is administered [[heparin]] to prevent clotting, and [[protamine sulfate]] is given after to reverse effects of heparin. During the procedure, hypothermia may be maintained; body temperature is usually kept at 28&nbsp;\u00b0C to 32&nbsp;\u00b0C (82.4\u201389.6&nbsp;\u00b0F). The blood is cooled during CPB and returned to the body. The cooled blood slows the body's basal metabolic rate, decreasing its demand for oxygen. Cooled blood usually has a higher viscosity, but the crystalloid solution used to prime the bypass tubing dilutes the blood.\n\n==Uses==\n[[File:Blausen 0468 Heart-Lung Machine.png|thumb|300px|Illustration of one typical way that a heart-lung machine may be connected to the veins and arteries near the heart.

The technique allows the surgical team to oxygenate and circulate the patient's blood, thus allowing the surgeon to operate on the heart.<ref name=\":3\" /> In many operations, such as [[Coronary artery bypass surgery|coronary artery bypass grafting]] (CABG), the heart is arrested (i.e., stopped) because of the difficulty of operating on the beating heart. Operations requiring the opening of the chambers of the heart, for example, [[mitral valve repair]] or [[Mitral valve replacement|replacement]], requires the use of CPB to avoid engulfing air systemically and to provide a bloodless field to increase visibility for the surgeon. The machine pumps the blood and, using an oxygenator, allows red blood cells to pick up oxygen, as well as allowing carbon dioxide levels to decrease.<ref name=\":2\" /> This mimics the function of the heart and the lungs, respectively.\n\nCPB can be used for the induction of total body [[therapeutic hypothermia|hypothermia]], a state in which the body can be maintained for up to 45 minutes without [[perfusion]] (blood flow).<ref name=\":3\" /> If blood flow is stopped at normal [[body temperature]], permanent [[brain damage]] normally occurs in three to four minutes \u2013 death may follow shortly afterward.

As a consequence, CPB is only used during the several hours a cardiac surgery may take. CPB is known to activate the coagulation cascade and stimulate inflammatory mediators. leading to hemolysis and coagulopathies. This problem worsens as complement proteins build on the membrane oxygenators.<ref name=\":4\" /> For this reason, most oxygenators come with a manufacturer's recommendation that they are only used for a maximum of six hours, although they are sometimes used for up to ten hours, with care being taken to ensure they do not clot off and stop working. For longer periods than this, an [[Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation|ECMO]] (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) is used, which can be in operation for up to 31 days \u2013 such as in this Taiwanese case, for 16 days, after which the patient received a heart transplant.<ref>[http://www.physorg.com/news126460484.html Man survives 16 days without a heart] United Press International.

The heart-lung blood circulation system and the connection surgery itself release a variety of debris into the bloodstream, including bits of blood cells, tubing, and plaque. For example, when surgeons clamp and connect the aorta to tubing, resulting emboli may block blood flow and cause mini strokes. Other heart surgery factors related to mental damage may be events of hypoxia, high or low body temperature, abnormal blood pressure, irregular heart rhythms, and fever after surgery.<ref>Stutz, Bruce [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=pumphead-heart-lung-machine \"Pumphead: Does the heart-lung machine have a dark side?\"] ''Scientific American'', January 9, 2009.</ref>\n\n==Components==\nCardiopulmonary bypass consists of two main functional units, the [[pump]] and the [[oxygenator]] which removes relatively oxygen-depleted blood from a patient's body and replaces it with oxygen-rich blood through a series of tubes (hoses).

By altering the speed of revolution (RPM) of the pump head, blood flow is produced by [[centrifugal force]]. This type of pumping action is considered to be superior to the action of the roller pump by many because it is thought to prevent overpressurization, clamping or kinking of lines, and produce less damage to blood products ([[hemolysis]], etc.).<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n====Roller pump====\nThe pump console usually comprises several rotating motor-driven pumps that [[peristalsis|peristaltically]] \"massage\" tubing.  This action gently propels the blood through the tubing. This is commonly referred to as a roller pump, or [[peristaltic pump]]. The pumps are more affordable than their centrifugal counterparts, but are susceptible to overpressurization if the lines become clamped or kinked.<ref name=\":0\" /> They are also more likely to cause a massive air embolism and require constant, close supervision by the perfusionist.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Oxygenator===\nThe [[oxygenator]] is designed to add [[oxygen]] to infused [[blood]] and remove some of the [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[venous blood]].  Cardiac surgery was made possible by CPB using [[bubble oxygenator]]s, but [[membrane oxygenator]]s have supplanted bubble oxygenators since the 1980s. The main reasons for this are that [[membrane oxygenator]]s tend to generate many fewer micro-bubbles, referred to as gaseous microemboli, which is generally considered harmful to the patient <ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=15\u201326|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> and reduce damage to blood cells,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pearson|first=D.T.|author2=Holden M |author3=Poslad S |author4=Murray A |author5=Waterhouse P. |title=A clinical comparison of the gas transfer characteristics and gaseous microemboli production of one membrane and five bubble oxygenators: haemocompatibility|year=1984|journal=Perfusion|volume=1|issue=1|pages=81\u201398|doi=10.1177/026765918600100103}}</ref> compared to [[bubble oxygenator]]s. More recently, the use of hollow-fiber oxygenators has become more widespread. These derivatives of membrane oxygenators further reduce the occurrence of microemboli by reducing the direct air-blood interface while simultaneously providing adequate gas exchange.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAnother type of oxygenator gaining favour recently is the heparin-coated blood oxygenator which is believed to produce less systemic inflammation and decrease the propensity for blood to clot in the CPB circuit.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n=== Heat Exchangers ===\nBecause hypothermia is frequently used in CPB to reduce metabolic demands (including that of the heart), heat exchangers are implemented to warm and cool blood within the circuit. The heating and cooling is accomplished by passing the line through a warm or ice water bath. A separate heat exchanger is required for the cardiopledgia line.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n===Cannulae===\nMultiple [[cannula]]e are sewn into the patient's body in a variety of locations, depending on the type of surgery. A venous cannula removes oxygen depleted venous blood from a patient's body. An arterial cannula infuses oxygen-rich blood into the arterial system. The main determinants of cannula size selection is determined by the patient's size and weight, anticipated flow rate, and the size of the vessel being cannulated.<ref name=\":3\" /> A [[cardioplegia]] cannula delivers a cardioplegia solution to cause the heart to stop beating.\n\nSome commonly used cannulation sites:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It is delivered via a cannula to the opening of the coronary arteries (usually by way of the aortic root) and/or to the cardiac veins (by way of the coronary sinus).<ref name=\":0\" /> These delivery methods are referred to antegrade and retrograde, respectively. Cardiopledgia solution protects the heart by arresting (i.e. stopping) the heart, thereby decreasing its metabolic demand. There are multiple types of cardiopledgia solutions, but most work by inhibiting [[Sodium channel|fast sodium currents]] in the heart, thereby preventing conduction of the [[action potential]]. Other types of solutions act by inhibiting calcium's actions on [[myocyte]]s.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Technique==\n\n===Pre-operative planning===\nCPB requires significant forethought before surgery.

The typical arterial cannulation involves the placement of a single cannulation within distal [[Aorta|ascending aorta]]. The most simple form on involves placement of a single cannula (known as a dual-stage cannula) passed through the [[right atrium]] and into the [[inferior vena cava]]. In some operations, such as those involving the [[Tricuspid valve|tricuspid]] or [[mitral valve]], two cannula are used\u2014one is passed though the inferior vena cava and one through the [[superior vena cava]].

Preoperative imaging or an [[ultrasound]] probe may be used to help identify aortic calcifications that could potentially become dislodged and cause an occlusion or [[stroke]]. Once the cannulation site has been deemed safe, two concentric, diamond-shaped [[Purse string|pursestring]] sutures are placed in the distal ascending aorta. A stab incision with a [[scalpel]] is made within the pursestrings and the arterial cannula is passed through the incision. It is important the cannula is passed perpendicular to the aorta to avoid creating an [[aortic dissection]].<ref name=\":1\" /> The pursestrings sutures are cinched around the cannula using a tourniquet and secured to the cannula.<ref name=\":0\" /> At this point, the perfusionist advances the arterial line of the CPB circuit and the surgeon connects the arterial line coming from the patient to the arterial line coming from the CPB machine. Care must be taken to ensure no air is in the circuit when the two are connected, or else the patient could suffer from an [[air embolism]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> Other sites for arterial cannulation include the [[axillary artery]], [[brachiocephalic artery]], or [[femoral artery]].\n\nAside from the differences in location, [[Vein|venous]] cannulation is performed similarly to arterial cannulation. Since calcification of the [[Vein|venous system]] is less common, the inspection or use of an ultrasound for calcification at the cannulation sites is unnecessary. Also, because the venous system is under much less pressure than the arterial system, only a single suture is required to hold the cannula in place.<ref name=\":1\" /> If only a single cannula is to be used (dual-stage cannulation), it is passed though the [[right atrial appendage]], through the tricuspid valve, and into the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> If two cannula are required (single-stage cannulation), the first one is typically passed through the superior vena cava and the second through the inferior vena cava.<ref name=\":2\" /> The [[femoral vein]] may also be cannulated in select patients.\n\nIf the heart must be stopped for the operation, [[cardioplegia]] cannulas are also required. Antegrade cardiopledgia (forward flowing, through the heart's arteries), retrograde cardiopledgia (backwards flowing, through the heart's veins), or both types may be used depending on the operation and surgeon preference. For antegrade cardiopledgia, a small incision is made in the aorta proximal to the arterial cannulation site (between the heart and arterial cannulation site) and the cannula is placed through this to deliver cardiopledgia to the [[coronary arteries]]. For retrograde cardiopledgia, an incision is made on the posterior (back) surface of the heart through the [[right ventricle]]. The cannula is placed in this incision, passed through the tricuspid valve, and into the [[coronary sinus]].<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" /> The cardiopledgia lines are connected to the CPB machine.\n\nAt this point, the patient is ready to go on bypass. Blood from the venous cannula(s) enters the CPB machine by gravity where it is oxygenated and cooled (if necessary) before returning to the body through the arterial cannula. Cardiopledgia can now be administered to stop the heart, and a cross-clamp is placed across the aorta between the arterial cannula and cardiopledgia cannula to prevent the arterial blood from flowing backwards into the heart.\n\nOnce the patient is ready to come off of bypass support, the cross-clamp and cannulas are removed and [[protamine sulfate]] is administered to reverse the anticoagulative effects of heparin.\n\n==History==\n[[File:1955 heart lung machine.jpg|thumb|right|A heart lung machine used in London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] in 1958.

Membrane oxygenators introduce a gas-permeable membrane between blood and oxygen that decreases the [[clotting|blood trauma]] of direct-contact oxygenators.
