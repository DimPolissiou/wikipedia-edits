For example, an ARexx script could extract data from a [[database]], insert the data into a [[spreadsheet]] to perform calculations on it, then insert tables and charts based on the results into a [[word processor]] document.\n\n==History==\nARexx was first created in 1987, developed for the Amiga by [[William S. Hawes]]. It is based on the REXX language described by [[Mike Cowlishaw]] in the book ''The REXX Language: A Practical Approach to Programming''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The REXX Language: A Practical Approach to Programming|first=Michael|last=Cowlishaw|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=1985|edition=1st|isbn=0-13-780651-5}}</ref> ARexx was included by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] with [[AmigaOS]] 2.0 in 1990, and has been included with all subsequent AmigaOS releases.

Using ARexx, for example, one could request data from a database application and send it to a spreadsheet application. To support this facility, an application must be \"ARexx compatible\" by being able to receive commands from ARexx and execute them. A database program might have commands to search for, retrieve, and save data &mdash; the MicroFiche Filer database has an extensive ARexx command set. A text editor might have ARexx commands corresponding to its editing command set &mdash; the Textra editor supplied with JForth can be used to provide an integrated programming environment. The AmigaVision multimedia presentation program also has ARexx port built in and can control other programs using ARexx.\n\nARexx can increase the power of a computer by combining the capabilities of various programs. Because of the popularity of a stand-alone ARexx package, Commodore included it with Release 2 of [[AmigaDOS]].\n\nLike all REXX implementations, ARexx uses ''typeless'' data representation. Other programming languages made distinctions between integers, floating point numbers, strings, characters, vectors, ''etc''. In contrast, REXX systems treat all data as strings of characters, making it simpler to write expressions and algorithms.\nAs is often the case in dynamically scoped languages, variables are not declared before using them, they come into being on their first use.\n\nARexx scripts benefit from an error handling system which monitors execution and responds accordingly. The programmer can choose to suspend and resume the execution of the program as needed.\n\nThe ARexx command set is simple, but in addition to the commands there are the functions of its Amiga reference library (rexxsyslib.library).  It is also easy to add other libraries or individual functions. ARexx scripts can also be invoked as functions from other ARexx scripts.

With regard to build, they are substantially larger than typical sled dogs but smaller than the [[Alaskan Malamute]].\n\n[[File:Sylar.jpg|thumb|right|A black Tamaskan puppy]]\nOn average, Tamaskan adults measure around 24-28&nbsp;inches (60\u201370&nbsp;cm) tall at the shoulder and typically weigh between 55-88 pounds (25\u201340&nbsp;kg). The heaviest recorded Tamaskan males (to date) weigh just under 50&nbsp;kg. Females are usually slightly smaller and lighter than males, with a distinct feminine appearance. Males are more heavyset with broader heads and a heavier bone structure. Tamaskans have a [[Wiktionary:lupine|lupine]] appearance with a straight bushy tail and thick double coat that comes in three main colors: wolf gray, red gray, and black gray. Each individual [[guard hair]] is [[Agouti gene|agouti]] banded along its length. The almond-shaped eyes range from yellow through to amber and brown, with lighter colored eyes being very rare. Blue eyes are not acceptable, nor are mismatched eyes.<ref name=\"Tamaskan Pictorial Standard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tamaskan-dog.com/The%20Standard/pictorial%20standard/pic_standard.htm|title=Tamaskan Pictorial Standard|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\n[[Image:Summer04.jpg|thumb|An adult female]]\n\nOverall, the Tamaskan variety is healthy; only a few notable health issues affect a small percentage of the bloodlines to date. Roughly 10% of males suffer from [[cryptorchidism]]: undescended testes. With these cases, usually only one testicle fully descends within the scrotum, while the other testicle remains \"hidden\" up within the abdominal cavity. [[Epilepsy in animals|Epilepsy]] has been diagnosed in five dogs, affecting about 1 out of every 100 registered Tamaskans worldwide. Several dogs have been found to be carriers of [[Canine degenerative myelopathy|degenerative myelopathy]]. As with all large breed dogs, [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]] is a risk.\n\n==History==\nIn 2009, the Tamaskan Dog Register introduced a [[Saarloos Wolfdog]] as a single out-cross to bring some fresh blood into the breed.

With regard to build, they are substantially larger than typical sled dogs but smaller than the [[Alaskan Malamute]].\n\n[[File:Sylar.jpg|thumb|right|A black Tamaskan puppy]]\nOn average, Tamaskan adults measure around 24-28&nbsp;inches (60\u201370&nbsp;cm) tall at the shoulder and typically weigh between 55-88 pounds (25\u201340&nbsp;kg)\u2013the heaviest recorded Tamaskan males (to date) weigh just under 50&nbsp;kg. Females are usually slightly smaller and lighter than males, with a distinct feminine appearance. Males are more heavyset with broader heads and a heavier bone structure. Tamaskans have a [[Wiktionary:lupine|lupine]] appearance with a straight bushy tail and thick double coat that comes in three main colors: wolf gray, red gray, and black gray. Each individual [[guard hair]] is [[Agouti gene|agouti]] banded along its length. The almond-shaped eyes range from yellow through to amber and brown, with lighter colored eyes being very rare. Blue eyes are not acceptable, nor are mismatched eyes.<ref name=\"Tamaskan Pictorial Standard\">{{cite web|url=http://www.tamaskan-dog.com/The%20Standard/pictorial%20standard/pic_standard.htm|title=Tamaskan Pictorial Standard|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Health==\n[[Image:Summer04.jpg|thumb|An adult female]]\n\nOverall, the Tamaskan variety is healthy; only a few notable health issues affect a small percentage of the bloodlines to date. Roughly 10% of males suffer from [[cryptorchidism]]: undescended testes. With these cases, usually only one testicle fully descends within the scrotum, while the other testicle remains \"hidden\" up within the abdominal cavity. [[Epilepsy in animals|Epilepsy]] has been diagnosed in five dogs, affecting about 1 out of every 100 registered Tamaskans worldwide. Several dogs have been found to be carriers of [[Canine degenerative myelopathy|degenerative myelopathy]].

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is 6 feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

He has released solo records under the moniker 'Masvidal' and previously led the alternative rock band [[\u00c6on Spoke]]. He is also known for having worked with the metal band, [[Death (metal band)|Death]], as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader [[Raul Masvidal]]. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and Eastern philosophy. He became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000,. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0 Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM ''Lack of Comprehension''].\n\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.\n\nCynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded \u00c6on Spoke, whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single ''Silence''. The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film, ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus. In his review<ref>{{Cite news|last=Times|first=The New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>, ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\"\n\nSince Traced In Air, Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''Re-Traced'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'' (2011). Rolling Stone music critic Hank Shteamer raved in his review<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/16034-carbon-based-anatomy-ep/|title=Cynic: Carbon-Based Anatomy EP|website=Pitchfork|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> of ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'': \"The title track is a perfectly paced stunner...Cynic sounds fully liberated, not just from their metal past but from any aesthetic concern other than assembling a great song.\" \n\nIn 2013, Paul joined forces with other original members of the Death 'Human' line up and toured worldwide in honor of Chuck Schuldiner's legacy with the group DTA (Death to All). \n\nCynic's third full-length album, ''Kindly Bent to Free Us'', released in 2014, was hailed by [[Malcolm Dome|Malcome Dome]] of Prog Magazine U.K. \u00a0as \"an album that transcends all the limitations of genre and era... There are few albums which can claim such a remarkable hold.\" The album rose to No. 4 on Billboard's Heatseekers chart in Feb. 2014 and was No. 1 on CMJ's Loud Rock Chart the following month.\n\n\"Kindly Bent to Free Us [is] an album that, while most definitely in the realm of prog rock, has the kind of open, unpretentious air that makes Rush such an easy-to-love band.\" - [[AllMusic.com|allmusic.com]]\n\n\"The alchemy of front man Paul Masvidal (vocals, guitars & keyboards) combined with rhythmaniac Sean Reinert (drums) and the technically divine Sean Malone (bass), make Cynic one of the finest Prog Rock bands to have ever of landed on Planet Earth\" - [https://burningfist.co.uk burningfist.co.uk]\n\nIn 2015, Masvidal ventured into the performing-arts world with masked duo Onward with Love (OwL), a musical collaboration with acclaimed singer-songwriter [[Amy Correia]]. The pair's singular points of view make for an intriguing synthesis of Eastern-influenced philosophy, symbolist poetry, American blues, jazz and experimental rock. OwL has performed in concert venues, hospices and art galleries around greater Los Angeles. In 2015, Onward with Love unveiled a video for the song 'Kali In My Arms, which was featured in the HBO TV series and film,'[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'. The duo officially released the song [https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/onwardwithlove/kali-in-my-arms digitally] in 2019 have plans to release a full length record by 2021.\n\nIn 2016, Masvidal along with collaborator, [[Amy Correia]] composed the musical score for the award winning feature film [[The Tiger Hunter]], featuring lead actor, [[Danny Pudi]] \n\nMasvidal also writes and performs music for television and motion pictures, credits include main title (composer credit) on an Emmy nominated NBC teen series show ''[[Operation Junkyard]]'', short films ''The Yellow Umbrella'', ''A Bride in Black'', assistant to [[Ben Vaughn]] and session musician for Carsey Warner network sitcoms ''[[That '70s Show]]'' and ''[[3rd Rock from the Sun]]''. Masvidal has a library songs regularly performed on network and cable television. Music writer Jeff Wagner, in ''[[Mean Deviation (book)|Mean Deviation]]'', stated that \"any viewer of ''3rd Rock from the Sun'', ''That '70s Show'', ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (2000 TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and any number of random television programs has probably stumbled across Cynic's core members without even knowing it.\" In 2015, Masvidal produced a children's album for actor [[Jim Carrey]] titled ''How Roland Rolls''.\n\nIn January 2018, Cynic released a digital single, titled ''Humanoid''. The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album Kindly Bent To Free Us. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums title ''Mythical Human Vessel.'' Produced by three-time [[Grammy Award|GRAMMY]] winner Warren Riker (Lauryn Hill, Fugees, Santana).

He is also known for having worked with the metal band, [[Death (metal band)|Death]], as a guitarist.\n\n==Early life==\n\nPaul Masvidal was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico to Cuban-American civic and business leader [[Raul Masvidal]]. Masvidal's early days were spent in the Miami area where he studied classical guitar from an early age with Carlos Molina and in college, with guitar teacher, Dave Weissbrot who became a major influence and spurred Masvidal's love of jazz, [[Steinberger|Steinberger guitars]], and Eastern philosophy; .He \u00a0became an initiate to [[Kriya Yoga]] in his late teens and has been a Buddhist practitioner since around 2000,. Masvidal met drummer [[Sean Reinert]] in 1984 at [[Gulliver Schools|Gulliver Academy]] and the duo began making music the day they met, eventually forming the pre-Cynic groups, Crypha and Seaweed.\n\nMasvidal talked in detail about his experiences in his early life in some posts in his Mett\u0101 Mind Journal<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metalsucks.net/2010/04/07/metta-mind-journal-with-cynics-paul-masvidal-the-bird-outside-my-window/|title=METTA MIND JOURNAL WITH CYNIC'S PAUL MASVIDAL: \"THE BIRD OUTSIDE MY WINDOW\"|date=2010-04-07|website=MetalSucks|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> series, which he published on the music blog [[MetalSucks]].\n\n== Career ==\n\nCynic released four demos from 1988 through 1991, with Masvidal developing a reputation in the Florida music scene for his musicianship. In 1989, when Masvidal was in high school, he toured Mexico as a replacement guitarist for the band [[Death (metal band)|Death]] but declined an invitation to permanently join the band in order to remain committed to Cynic. This had many journalists curious at the time, since Death were emerging as an influential and popular underground act, but Masvidal stuck to his guns and claimed to firmly believe in Cynic. However, Masvidal returned to the Death fold replacing guitarist [[James Murphy (metal guitarist)|James Murphy]] for tour dates on the international ''[[Spiritual Healing (album)|Spiritual Healing]]'' tour in 1990, leading in 1991 to Masvidal and fellow Cynic member Reinert being recruited by Death to record the \"groundbreaking\" ''[[Human (Death album)|Human]]''.\u00a0 Masvidal did extensive world tours, in addition to appearing in the [[music video]] for [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7j8vUbMmOwM ''Lack of Comprehension''].\n\nIn addition, in 1991 Masvidal helped Chicago band [[Master (American band)|Master]] to record their album ''[[On the Seventh Day God Created... Master]]''. Masvidal handled all guitar duties on this album. After finishing their world tour with Death, both Masvidal and Reinert returned to Cynic in 1992.\n\n1993 saw the release of [[Focus (Cynic album)|''Focus'']] on the [[Roadrunner Records|Roadrunner]] label, the only album Cynic recorded until 2008. Roadrunner released a reissue of ''Focus'' in 2004 as a special collector's edition due to high demand. Masvidal also recorded the Cynic spin-off Portal, but by 2007 Cynic returned to touring, featuring Masvidal and Reinert.\n\nCynic took a hiatus in 1995 after record ''The Portal Tapes'' demos and Masvidal moved to Los Angeles in the fall of 1996, upon being offered a full scholarship at [[Musicians Institute]]. During Cynic's hiatus, Masvidal founded \u00c6on Spoke, whose ethereal indie rock was heralded as \"beautiful, exquisite [and] destined for greatness\" by Janice Long, BBC Radio. In 2004, the band received airplay on BBC Radio 2 and XFM for the single ''Silence''. The following year, the track \"Emmanuel\" appeared in the indie breakout film, ''[[What the Bleep Do We Know!?]]'' \u00c6on Spoke songs have also appeared on the Warner Bros. television series ''[[Smallville]]'', ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' and the motion picture ''[[Cry Wolf (2005 film)|Cry Wolf]]''. \u00a0Their self-titled debut LP was released in 2007 on SPV Records.\n\nCynic reunited in 2008 after a 13-year break to record ''Traced In Air'', their comeback opus. In his review<ref>{{Cite news|last=Times|first=The New York|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/01/arts/music/01choi.html|title=New CDs|date=2008-11-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-09|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>, ''New York Times'' music critic Ben Ratliff wrote that Cynic \"should be understood not so much alongside any metal bands but along with the radical harmonic progressives in the last 45 years of pop and jazz: composers like Milton Nascimento, the Beach Boys or Pat Metheny.\"\n\nSince Traced In Air, Cynic has released two conceptual records: ''Re-Traced'' (2010), featuring re-interpretations of several ''Traced in Air'' tracks, and ''Carbon-Based Anatomy'' (2011).

In 2015, Onward with Love unveiled a video for the song 'Kali In My Arms, which was featured in the HBO TV series and film,'[[Looking (TV series)|Looking]]'.

The song marked the first new music from the progressive pioneers since the band's 2014 album Kindly Bent To Free Us. The artwork for \"Humanoid\" features a detail from the painting \"Ayahuasca Dream\" by [[Robert Venosa]], Cynic's longtime collaborator and celebrated artist who passed away in 2011.\n\nIn 2019 and 2020 Masvidal ventured into releasing work as a solo artist under the name 'Masvidal' releasing three conceptual albums title ''Mythical Human Vessel.''

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army. In order of precedence, they are the [[Special Forces Tab]], the [[Ranger Tab]], the [[Sapper Tab]], and the [[President's Hundred Tab]].

On the [[Army Combat Uniform]], the tabs are worn above a unit's [[Shoulder Sleeve Insignia (United States Army)|shoulder patch]] and are used to identify a unit's or a soldier's special skill(s) or are worn on shoulder patches as part of a unit's unique heritage. Individual tabs are also worn as small metal arches above or below [[Awards and decorations of the United States Army|medals or ribbons]] on the [[Army Service Uniform]].\n\nTabs are valued uniquely in the U.S. Army because images rather than words are traditionally used for the [[symbol]]ism of the shoulder patch worn to identify a soldier's unit. It is only to identify an individual soldier's or a whole unit's special skill that an additional shoulder patch is worn that uses words rather than images to symbolize this skill. For example, while any member of a special forces unit will wear the unit identifying patch that includes an arrowhead, sword, lightning, and Airborne Tab, only soldiers who have completed special forces training will have been awarded and wear an additional tab containing the words \"SPECIAL FORCES\" (i.e. the Special Forces Tab).\n\nSome tabs are awarded to recognize an individual soldier's combat related skills or marksmanship and are worn by a soldier permanently. These tabs are also considered [[Badges of the United States Army|special skill badges]] and have metal equivalents that are worn on the soldier's chest if their uniform does not have a place for shoulder patches (e.g. the Army Service Uniform). Other tabs recognize a whole unit's special skill and are considered to be part of a specific unit's shoulder sleeve patch and are worn by a soldier only while they belong to that unit.<ref>[http://www.tioh.hqda.pentagon.mil/Tab/Tabs.htm Pentagon.mil]</ref> The Jungle Expert Tab is unique in that while it is awarded to recognize an individual soldier's skill, it is only worn by soldiers while they belong to certain units.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usmedals.com/detail.aspx?ID=5717|title=USmedals.com|publisher=|accessdate=3 March 2018}}</ref> Similarly, tabs awarded at the state level by the U.S. Army National Guard can only be worn by soldiers while they are on state-level orders.\n\n==Individual tabs==\nThere are currently four permanent individual skill/marksmanship tabs authorized for wear by the U.S. Army.

The title \"Recondo\" stood for \"Reconnaissance Commando\". The standard Recondo insignia was a downward-pointing arrowhead with \"RECONDO\" printed above. The Recondo patch was standardly worn on each graduate's right breast pocket. Recondo was also sometimes worn in the style of the more traditional shoulder tab.\n\nIn designing the unit patch for the [[Security Force Assistance Brigade]] stood up in 2018, the US Army took inspiration from the classic Recondo arrowhead design. The original unit patch design was eventually softened to less directly replicate the Recondo arrowhead patch after complaints from the US Army special forces community.<ref>{{cite web |title=Beret for Soldiers of 1st SFAB \u2013 Concern in SF Community |url=https://sof.news/sfa/sfab-beret/}}</ref> The SFAB unit patches also introduced the new \"ADVISOR\" unit level tab to the Army uniform.\n\nThe US Army ROTC still issues a Recondo Badge to cadets who successfully complete Recondo training at the Leader Development and Assessment Course.\n\n===Pershing===\n[[File:US Army Pershing Tab of the Former 56th Field Artillery Command.png|right|thumb|160px|Pershing Tab]]\nThe Pershing Tab was worn as part of the shoulder sleeve insignia (SSI) for units supporting the [[Pershing missile]] system.

The [[3rd Battalion, 9th Field Artillery Regiment]] wore the Pershing tab with the SSI of [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] from 1971 to 1981, then with that of the [[214th Field Artillery Brigade]] when it had a SSI created in 1981.
