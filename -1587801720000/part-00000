Shinra uses mako, the Planet's spiritual energy, harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis city of [[Midgar]] and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]], Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization, led by [[Barret Wallace]], who believes excessive mako harvesting will cause environmental disaster, which they attempt to prevent by bombing a mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Although Cloud intends to leave Avalanche after receiving his pay, mysterious ghost-like entities, who often reappear at pivotal moments in the game, cause him to be recruited for another reactor bombing, which goes awry, separating him from the group.\n\nCloud meets Aerith again and protects her from Shinra forces, who pursue her for unknown reasons. While attempting to reunite with his party with Aerith's help, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled-in city, and, reuniting with her, learn that she is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. Thanks to Aerith, most of the population is able to evacuate in time, but she is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the plate's fall, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she suffers the same fate. She reveals that she is the last descendant of the Cetra, a near-extinct precursor race who resided in a \"Promised Land\", which Shinra covets due to its boundless mako reserves. The group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, who explains that the strange ghost-like entities the group has encountered are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny (implied to be the events of the original game) is not altered, by correcting any deviations from this course. Meanwhile, Sephiroth infiltrates Shinra and steals a mysterious entity known as \"Jenova\", somehow connected to the extinction of the Cetra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra and also impales Barret, although the Whispers save him, while the party fights a hallucinatory apparition of Jenova. With the death of President Shinra, his son Rufus assumes control of the company and briefly fights Cloud, but is defeated. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Expressway, but find Sephiroth waiting for them at the end. Sephiroth cryptically challenges Cloud, opening a portal to another dimension. Aerith somehow alters the portal, stating that they will change destiny if they continue. The group enters the portal and battles the Whisper Harbinger, an entity formed by an amalgamate of Whispers. While this happens, in what appears to be an alternate timeline also engulfed by Whispers, SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]] fights an army of Shinra troops determined to kill him and Cloud.\n\nAfter the Whisper Harbinger is defeated, Sephiroth confronts the group, seemingly seizing the remnants of the Whisper's power. Together, the party overwhelms him, but as Cloud seems poised to finish him, Sephiroth transports the both of them to a metaphysical realm he calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him, and defy fate together. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth, but is no match for him alone and is defeated, although Sephiroth spares him before departing, cryptically stating that he will have seven seconds to defy fate. \n\nMeanwhile, in the alternate timeline, Zack Fair triumphs over the Shinra forces. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is a greater threat to the Planet than Shinra, and commit to pursuing him. However, as the group departs Midgar, Aerith expresses concern over their now uncertain future.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> \n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic. They also needed to make decisions about what could be carried over from the original and what needed adjustment due to changes in [[social norms]] since the original's release.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/> The scenario for the first installment was completed in December 2015.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game is fully voiced, with the original plan being for the voice actors from the [[List of computer-animated films|CGI]] movie ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]'' to reprise their roles.<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> Ultimately, the English characters were recast for ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeVoiceChance\"/> According to Kitase, choosing a new generation of voices for the characters was part of the game's rebirth as ''Remake''.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\nRather than using the character models and graphical style of ''Advent Children'', which by that point had been developed using ten-year-old technology, the team decided to create new designs and models for characters: Nomura wished to balance the realism of ''Advent Children'' with deformed stylization. Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314083618/https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|archive-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202132615/https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" /> The theme song \"Hollow\" is meant to reflect Cloud's state of mind with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals.

The staff redesigned the characters to balance realism and stylization.\n\nThe game was generally well received for its graphics, gameplay, narrative, and faithfulness to the original. It has become one of the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 games.\n\n==Premise==\n[[File:Final Fantasy VII Remake gameplay screenshot.png|thumb|left|Gameplay screenshot of ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'']]\n''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' is the first in a planned series of games [[Video game remake|remaking]] the 1997 [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] game ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.

Shinra uses mako, the Planet's spiritual energy, harvested by massive reactors, to power the metropolis city of [[Midgar]] and develop cutting-edge technology. Disillusioned with Shinra, and at the request of his childhood friend [[Tifa Lockhart]], Cloud takes a mercenary job for Avalanche, an ecoterrorist organization, led by [[Barret Wallace]], who believes excessive mako harvesting will cause environmental disaster, which they attempt to prevent by bombing a mako reactor. In the aftermath, Cloud is haunted by memories of [[Sephiroth (Final Fantasy)|Sephiroth]], an enigmatic former SOLDIER member, and meets the florist [[Aerith Gainsborough]]. Although Cloud intends to leave Avalanche after receiving his pay, mysterious ghost-like entities, who often reappear at pivotal moments in the game, cause him to be recruited for another reactor bombing, which goes awry, separating him from the group.\n\nCloud meets Aerith again and protects her from Shinra forces, who pursue her for unknown reasons. While attempting to reunite with his party with Aerith's help, they see Tifa entering Wall Market, a lawless walled-in city, and, reuniting with her, learn that she is trying to gain information from Wall Market's crime lord Don Corneo. Corneo reveals that Shinra plans to collapse a piece of the \"plate,\" home to Midgar's upper class, onto the slums of Sector 7 to retaliate for Avalanche's destruction of the mako reactors. Cloud, Tifa, and Barret fail to stop Shinra's plan, and the plate falls. Thanks to Aerith, most of the population is able to evacuate in time, but she is captured by Shinra.\n\nWhile clearing the rubble left by the plate's fall, Cloud, Tifa, and Barret discover an underground Shinra research lab. Horrified by the experiments they find inside, they infiltrate Shinra headquarters and rescue Aerith before she suffers the same fate. She reveals that she is the last descendant of the Cetra, a near-extinct precursor race who resided in a \"Promised Land\", which Shinra covets due to its boundless mako reserves. The group also meets a talking wolf-like creature called Red XIII, who explains that the strange ghost-like entities the group has encountered are called Whispers. They exist to ensure that the course of destiny (implied to be the events of the original game) is not altered, by correcting any deviations from this course. Meanwhile, Sephiroth infiltrates Shinra and steals a mysterious entity known as \"Jenova\", somehow connected to the extinction of the Cetra.\n\nIn a confrontation at the top of Shinra headquarters, Sephiroth murders the president of Shinra and also impales Barret, although the Whispers save him, while the party fights a hallucinatory apparition of Jenova. With the death of President Shinra, his son Rufus assumes control of the company and briefly fights Cloud, but is defeated. Cloud and his allies flee the scene via the Midgar Expressway, but find Sephiroth waiting for them at the end. Sephiroth cryptically challenges Cloud, opening a portal to another dimension. Aerith somehow alters the portal, stating that they will change destiny if they continue. The group enters the portal and battles the Whisper Harbinger, an entity formed by an amalgamate of Whispers. While this happens, in what appears to be an alternate timeline also engulfed by Whispers, SOLDIER [[Zack Fair]] fights an army of Shinra troops determined to kill him and Cloud.\n\nAfter the Whisper Harbinger is defeated, Sephiroth confronts the group, seemingly seizing the remnants of the Whisper's power. Together, the party overwhelms him, but as Cloud seems poised to finish him, Sephiroth transports the both of them to a metaphysical realm he calls the Edge of Creation. Sephiroth urges Cloud to join him, and defy fate together. Cloud refuses and fights Sephiroth, but is no match for him alone and is defeated, although Sephiroth spares him before departing, cryptically stating that he will have seven seconds to defy fate. \n\nMeanwhile, in the alternate timeline, Zack Fair triumphs over the Shinra forces. After Cloud returns to his group, they agree that Sephiroth is a greater threat to the Planet than Shinra, and commit to pursuing him. However, as the group departs Midgar, Aerith expresses concern over their now uncertain future.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\n[[File:Square-enix dissidia yoshinori-kitase.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Yoshinori Kitase, original director of ''Final Fantasy VII'' and producer of ''Remake'', in 2009]]\n''Final Fantasy VII'' was developed by [[Square (video game company)|Square]] for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] console and released in 1997.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> Its staff included producer and series creator [[Hironobu Sakaguchi]], director and co-writer Yoshinori Kitase, artist [[Yusuke Naora]], character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]], and writer [[Kazushige Nojima]].<ref name=\"EdgeMaking\"/> The game was a critical and commercial success, and established the ''Final Fantasy'' series as a major franchise.<ref name=\"VIIretro\"/> It was expanded through the multimedia project ''[[Compilation of Final Fantasy VII]]'', comprising additional games, films, and other media.<ref name=\"CompilationGS\"/>\n\nIn the early 2000s, Square announced a remake for [[PlayStation 2]] alongside ''[[Final Fantasy VIII]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy IX|IX]]'', but nothing further was heard of the project.<ref name=\"GSps2remake\" /><ref name=\"SilPS2remake\" /> It was abandoned because of the increased challenge of developing on new hardware, and would have necessitated cutting content.<ref name=\"GemSummary\" /> The staff were also preoccupied with developing ''[[Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and its sequels, and ''Remake'' would have been an equally large or larger project hard to undertake at the same time. Once the ''XIII'' series ended, the team was free to pursue other projects.<ref name=\"GIquestions\" />\n\nDemand for a remake grew following a [[PlayStation 3]] tech demo at the 2005 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]], showcasing the opening of ''VII'' with Square's new [[Crystal Tools]] engine. Further demand came during the game's impending tenth anniversary in 2007. On both occasions, Square denied that any remake was in development,<ref name=\"PS3vii\" /><ref name=\"RemakeNomura\" /><ref name=\"IGNresponce\" /> for reasons including their focus on new games, the necessity to cut elements to make a remake manageable, the difficulty of developing for modern hardware, and the amount of development time it would require.<ref name=\"VG247a\" /><ref name=\"VG247b\" /><ref name=\"AndriaVII\" /><ref name=\"XboxVII\" /><ref name=\"1UPresponce\" />\n\nThe ''Remake'' project finally began when ''Final Fantasy'' producer [[Shinji Hashimoto]] broached the subject to Kitase, Nojima, and Nomura. All three were reaching a stage of life that they defined as \"that age\": all felt that if they waited much longer, they might not be alive to or would be too old to develop a remake, and passing the project on to a new generation did not feel right.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"EuroVIIpreport\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> Another reason for developing the remake was that Square Enix was creating a growing library of PlayStation 4 titles, and the team hoped to increase the console's popularity.<ref name=\"Sil4G\"/>\n\n===Design===\nThe game entered full production by late 2015, led by Business Division 1, an internal production team within [[Square Enix]].<ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/><ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdev\"/> While Nomura was involved with the project from the start, he only discovered he was the director after seeing himself credited in an internal company presentation video, as he had expected Kitase to fill the role. He revealed that Kitase himself thought Nomura expected to become director.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Nomura worked as director for both ''Final Fantasy VII Remake'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts III]]''.<ref name=\"Nomura2018a\"/> Despite there already being a story in place, which greatly simplified production on some fronts, Nojima was brought back in to create new story material.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/><ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/> Another project leader was Naoki Hamaguchi, who had previously served as a programmer for ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'' and project lead for ''[[Mobius Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> \n\nWhile the team had the option of merely creating a remastered version of ''VII'' with better graphics as many fans had requested, they noted that its graphics and many of its mechanics had become dated by modern standards. With this in mind, they decided to do a full remake, rebuilding the game systems to suit contemporary tastes and using current gaming technology to recreate the world of ''VII''.<ref name=\"VIIfamInterview\"/><ref name=\"Sil4G\"/> This decision triggered the creation of ''Remake''{{'s}} action-based battle system, in addition to the most representative modern title for the ''Final Fantasy'' series being the 2009 fighting game ''Dissidia Final Fantasy''. With this in mind, the battle system draws from that action-based style while not going over to an entirely action-based system.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> Nomura and Mitsunori Takahashi are handling the battle system, the latter of whom had worked on both the ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]'' series and ''[[Dissidia 012 Final Fantasy]]''.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/> One of the game designers was Kyohei Suzuki, a veteran of the company's Business Division 4 who had previously worked as a planner for ''[[Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days]]'' and ''[[Kingdom Hearts Coded]]''.<ref name=\"VIIRdesigner\"/> The team aimed to retain all the original gameplay mechanics that were well-liked by players.<ref name=\"GemFam2017\"/>\n\nWhile developing the scenario, the team needed to work carefully, so the game did not come over as too nostalgic.

Nomura was in charge of the revamped main character designs, while designer Roberto Ferrari was in charge of designs for secondary characters. Character modeling was supervised by [[Visual Works]], Square Enix's CGI development branch.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/><ref name=\"VIIRdiscussion\"/>\n\nRather than developing their own engine, Square Enix licensed [[Epic Games]]' [[Unreal Engine 4]] to develop the game, with Square Enix and Epic Games Japan working together to optimize the engine for ''Remake''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unreal Engine 4 Powering FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Development|url=https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|website=Unreal Engine Official News|accessdate=14 December 2015|date=7 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314083618/https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/final-fantasy-vii-remake-built-with-ue4|archive-date=March 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Final Fantasy VII Remake by Square Enix - E3 2019 Interview |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TB0CMHn7cPM |website=Unreal Engine Official YouTube Channel |date=13 June 2019}}</ref> The team also received technical assistance from the developers of ''Kingdom Hearts III'', as the latter game was developed using the same engine.<ref name=\"VII1scen\"/> The game's lighting is augmented with the lighting engine Enlighten.<ref name=\"VIIgeometrics\"/> To help with the action gameplay and video quality, Square Enix originally partnered with video game developer [[CyberConnect2]], with the two companies keeping in close contact due to different development styles.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> \n\nIn 2017, the game's development focus shifted from being developed with external partners to being a primarily internal project.<ref name=\"VIIRhamaguchi\"/> One of the most significant changes was the fact that the game was planned as a multi-game release: according to Kitase, this was because trying to fit the game onto a single release would entail cutting large parts of the game, which went against the team's vision. By splitting the game into multiple parts, the team can give players more substantial access to areas in the game, such as within the city of Midgar, which was mostly inaccessible in the original.<ref name=\"GemSummary\"/> Each game is planned to be on a similar scale to ''Final Fantasy XIII''.<ref name=\"GIquestions\"/> The first installment focused on the city of Midgar due to its iconic status among the ''Final Fantasy'' community.<ref name=\"RemakeE3Comments\"/>\n\n===Music===\nThe game's soundtrack has contributions from original ''Final Fantasy VII'' composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]], along with [[Masashi Hamauzu]] and Mitsuto Suzuki.<ref name=\"Music\">{{cite web |author1=FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE Team |title=The music of FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE - comments from the composers |url=https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |website=square-enix-games.com |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200202132615/https://square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-composers |archive-date=February 2, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> It was the first time Uematsu and Kitase had worked together since ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' (2001), with Kitase initially believing Uematsu would refuse as he had long since left Square Enix and found success as an independent composer.<ref name=\"VIIRuematsu2\" /> The theme song \"Hollow\" is meant to reflect Cloud's state of mind with Nomura placing high emphasis on the rock music and male vocals.

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma! (1955 film)|film adaptation]].  It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine reported in its [http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1807032,00.html May 26, 2008 issue], p. 51, that ''Oklahoma!'' tied (with ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'') as the eighth most frequently produced musical by U.S. high schools in 2007.</ref>  Rodgers and Hammerstein won a [[Pulitzer Prize Special Citations and Awards|special Pulitzer Prize]] for ''Oklahoma!'' in 1944.\n\nThis musical, building on the innovations of the earlier ''[[Show Boat]]'', epitomized the development of the \"[[book musical]]\", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter.<ref>Everett, p. 137, chapter by Riis, Thomas L., with Ann Sears and Everett</ref>  In addition, ''Oklahoma!'' features musical themes, or [[Motif (music)|motifs]], that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story.<ref>Wilk, Max.

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/1940bway2.htm \"History of the Musical Stage, 1940s Part II: Oklahoma, OK!\"] Musicals101.com, accessed October 11, 2011</ref>\n\n===Casting and development===\nBetween the world wars, roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing, but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose, conversely, to cast singers who could act. Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

The New Haven and [[Boston]] audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping [[Number (music)|musical number]], \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.<ref>[[Helene Hanff|Hanff, Helene]].

Its critic felt that while the songs were pleasant enough, they sounded much alike.<ref>Lewis, David H., ''Broadway musicals: A Hundred Year History'', 2002, McFarland & Company, p. 35</ref>  The show's creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein's contemporaries and ushered in the \"Golden Age\" of American musical theatre.<ref name=Heritage/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!--NOTE: This plot description is overlong; the plot should be no more than 1100 words, per the article structure guidelines at [[WP: MUSICALS]].--> \n\n=== Act I ===\nIn Oklahoma Territory, in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to the beautiful day ahead as he wanders into farm girl Laurey Williams's yard (\"[[Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin']]\").  He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.  Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller's urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the [[Surrey (carriage)|surrey]] with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").\n\n==Principal roles and notable performers==\n<!--this list is for stage performers only, please do not add film cast.

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.  Lyrics in the song about a [[burlesque]] stripteaser were slightly changed to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\"/>  In a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. [[Jerome Kern|Kern's]] exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\"<ref>Bordman, Gerald and Thomas Hischak, eds.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|jstor=463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!

The musical is based on [[Lynn Riggs]]' 1931 play, ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]''.  Set in farm country outside the town of [[Claremore, Oklahoma|Claremore]], [[Indian Territory]], in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry.  A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fianc\u00e9e, Ado Annie.\n\nThe original [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production opened on March 31, 1943.  It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-winning 1955 [[Oklahoma!

Rodgers, with [[Lorenz Hart]], had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as ''[[Babes in Arms]]'' (1937), ''[[The Boys from Syracuse]]'' (1938) and ''[[Pal Joey (musical)|Pal Joey]]'' (1940).<ref>Secrest, pp. 403\u201304</ref>  Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for ''[[Rose-Marie]]'' (1924), ''[[The Desert Song]]'' (1926), ''[[The New Moon]]'' (1927) and ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927).  Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an [[Academy Award]] for his song with [[Jerome Kern]], \"[[The Last Time I Saw Paris (song)|The Last Time I Saw Paris]]\", which was included in the 1941 film ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]''.<ref>[http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 \u201cOscar Hammerstein II\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217193407/http://www.songwritershalloffame.org/exhibits/C13 |date=December 17, 2010 }}.  Songwriters Hall of Fame, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>  By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.<ref>Layne, Joslyn. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p84807|pure_url=yes}} Lorenz Hart Biography], Allmusic, accessed December 22, 2010</ref>\n\n===Conception===\nIn 1931, the [[Theatre Guild]] produced [[Lynn Riggs]]'s ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', a play about settlers in [[Oklahoma]]'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, [[Theresa Helburn]], one of the Guild's producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional [[folk song]]s and [[square dance]]s and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Lorenz Hart]], whose first successful [[Rodgers and Hart|collaboration]], ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925.  Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart.  Rodgers had asked [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart's ''[[By Jupiter]]'' in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place.<ref name=Nolan>Nolan, pp. 1\u201325.</ref>  Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', but when he had approached [[Jerome Kern]] about it, the latter declined.  Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity.  Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in ''Green Grow the Lilacs'' corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing.  He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.<ref name=Kantor>Kantor and Malson, pp. 196\u2013202</ref><ref name=Heritage/>\n\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein's previous collaborators included composers [[Rudolf Friml]], [[Herbert Stothart]], [[Vincent Youmans]], and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics.  The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it.<ref name=Nolan/> As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, ''Green Grow the Lilacs'', not by musical comedy conventions.<ref name=Kantor/>  Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.<ref name=Kenrick2>Kenrick, John.

Though [[Theresa Helburn]], codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested [[Shirley Temple]] as Laurey and [[Groucho Marx]] as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director [[Rouben Mamoulian|Rouben Mamoulian's]] support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast.  As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step.<ref name=Nolan/> The production was choreographed by [[Agnes de Mille]] (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show's most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the [[dream ballet]]) depicting Laurey's struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.<ref name=Kenrick2/>\n\nThe first title given to the work was ''Away We Go!'' which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]]'s [[Shubert Theatre (New Haven)|Shubert Theatre]] on March 11, 1943.<ref>[http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php Information on the tryout from Capa.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511195305/http://www.capa.com/newhaven/venues/shubert_history.php |date=May 11, 2008 }}</ref>  Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power.

The New Haven and [[Boston]] audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping [[Number (music)|musical number]], \"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.<ref>[[Helene Hanff|Hanff, Helene]].

He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a [[box social]] dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"[[The Surrey with the Fringe on Top]]\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\n\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] (\"[[Kansas City (Oklahoma!)|Kansas City]]\").  He won $50 (${{Inflation|US|50|1906|r=-2|fmt=c}} today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a [[Persia]]n peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"[[I Cain't Say No]]\").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (\"[[Many a New Day]]\").\n\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"[[It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!]]\").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"[[People Will Say We're in Love]]\").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"[[Lonely Room]]\").\n\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as [[smelling salts]], but actually [[laudanum]]) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\n\n===Act II===\nAt the social, during an upbeat [[square dance]] (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the [[Range war|rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys]] over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone.<ref>Carter, Tim. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wn_RDxA6wxAC&pg=PA198&dq=Oklahoma+%22Aunt+Eller%22&hl=en#v=onepage&q=Oklahoma%20%22Aunt%20Eller%22&f=true \"Reading Oklahoma!\"] ''Oklahoma!: The Making of an American Musical'', Yale University Press, 2007, {{ISBN|0-300-10619-X}}, p. 177</ref> Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"[[All Er Nuthin']]\").\n\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farmhand, screaming at him to get off her property.  Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly.  She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now.  Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We're In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterward, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\n\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory's impending statehood (\"[[Oklahoma (Rodgers and Hammerstein song)|Oklahoma]]\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being [[Forced marriage#Shotgun wedding|threatened by her father]] with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fistfight.  Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife.

The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs.  For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City.  Lyrics in the song about a [[burlesque]] stripteaser were slightly changed to pass [[censorship|film censorship]].<ref name=\"Chapin\"/>  In a nod to ''[[Green Grow the Lilacs (play)|Green Grow the Lilacs]]'', which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife.

It was the first U.S. [[cast album]] featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical.  It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as ''Oklahoma! Volume Two''.  In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors' item.  All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deccabroadway.com/product/default.aspx?pid=56721&aid=96945 |title='Decca Broadway \u2013 Oklahoma' web page.

Musical Cyberspace, March 31, 2003, accessed September 26, 2010</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nThe original production of ''Oklahoma!'' was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the ''[[New York Journal American]]'' pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers's music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\".<ref name=Suskin/> In the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Louis Kronenberger of [[PM (newspaper)|''PM'']] opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein's lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart's at their best, but the songs in ''Oklahoma!'' call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\nIn the ''[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]'', [[Burns Mantle]] declared that \"''Oklahoma!'' really is different \u2013 beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, ''Oklahoma!'' seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since [[Edna Ferber]]'s ''Show Boat''\".<ref name=Suskin/> ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' critic [[Burton Rascoe]] particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ...  They are spinetingling, out of this world.\"<ref name=Suskin/>  In ''[[The New York Sun]]'', [[Ward Morehouse]] commented that \"''Oklahoma!'' is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night's audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\"<ref name=Suskin/> Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in [[Sardi's]] restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"<ref name=Nolan/>\n\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the ''[[New York Post]]'': The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers's songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\"  She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"<ref name=Suskin/>\n\n==Antecedents and influence==\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is ''Oklahoma!'' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ...  It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\"<ref>Hischak, p. 201</ref>  William Zinsser observed that ''Oklahoma!'' broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot.<ref>Zinsser, William.  ''Easy to Remember:The Great American Songwriters and Their Songs'', David R. Godine Publisher, 2006, {{ISBN|1-56792-325-9}}, p. 180</ref>  The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to ''Oklahoma!''\"<ref>Everett, p. 124.</ref>  ''Oklahoma!'' made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".<ref>Lubbock, Mark.

He concludes: \"But ''Oklahoma!'' was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"<ref name=Mordden140/>\n\nCritic Andrea Most argues that the musical reflected author's and composer's Jewish heritage and desires for Jewish-Americans. Most asserts that the musical was written at a time when America presented Jews with an opportunity to gain privileged status by assimilating into mainstream American culture and passing as white Americans. Most claims that although there were rarely any identifiably Jewish characters in plays of this time period, characters such as Ali and Jud allowed for subtle Jewish representation, Ali embodying an accepted and friendly ideal for Jewish-Americans and Jud embodying Jewish-Americans' fear of becoming a marginalized minority like black Americans. He also feels that the play contained subtle odes to [[Zionism]] as well.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Most|first=Andrea|date=1998|title='We Know We Belong to the Land': The Theatricality of Assimilation in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Oklahoma!''|journal=PMLA|volume=113|issue=1|pages=77\u201389|doi=10.2307/463410|jstor=463410|issn=0030-8129}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n\n===Original Broadway production===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=\"95%\"\n|-\n!
