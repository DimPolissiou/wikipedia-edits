The Nahkampf cannon 1 was built onto the chassis of the armoured car Panzerwagen 39, [[Panzer 38(t)]] type LTL-H CSSR armoured fighting vehicle. The chassis was extended by a roller produced by the company [[Berna]] in [[Olten]]. Since only a few parts were available, it was partially constructed using parts of armoured cars, mainly the chassis and transmissions. The armour consisted of only thin sheet metal and, in initial experiments, only a 75-millimeter cannon was installed, before future designs sported a 10.5-cm howitzer. The prototype was used by the Swiss Army with the car plate (M + number 7236).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Nahkampfkanone 2]]\n\n== References ==\n* Book Urs Heller: Die Panzer der Schweizer Armee von 1920 bis 2008 [http://www.militaerfahrzeuge.ch/unter_1.html]\n* Military Museum Thun AG Switzerland\n\n[[Category:Military vehicles of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Abandoned military projects of Switzerland]]\n[[Category:Tank destroyers]]\n", "text_old": "{{no footnotes|date=July 2013}}\n\n{{Infobox weapon\n|name= Nahkampfkanone 1\n|image=[[File:Nahkamofkanone I pic04.JPG|300px|Nahkampfkanone I im Panzermuseum Thun]]\n|caption=Nahkampfkanone I at Panzermuseum Thun\n|origin=Switzerland\n|type=Light [[tank destroyer]]\n|is_vehicle=yes\n|is_UK=no\n|service=1944 - 1947\n|used_by=Switzerland\n|wars=\n|designer=\n|design_date=1943\n|manufacturer= Berna at Olten & [[Saurer]]\n|unit_cost=\n|production_date=\n|number=1\n|variants= \n|weight=12.5 tonnes\n|length={{convert|6.45|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|width= {{convert|2.60|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|height={{convert|2.50|m|ftin|abbr=on}}\n|crew= 5\n|armour= 50 mm \n|primary_armament=75 mm cannon<br> later 10.5 cm howitzer\n|secondary_armament= \n|engine= 6-cylinder gasoline engine<br>four-stroke [[Saurer]] CT1D\n|engine_power= {{convert| 123|hp|abbr=on}} \n|transmission=\n|fuel_capacity=\n|pw_ratio= 9.8 hp/tonne\n|suspension=leaf spring\n|clearance= \n|vehicle_range={{convert|200|km|abbr=on}}<br> 120&nbsp;km off-road\n|speed= {{convert|55|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}<br> off-road:{{convert|25|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Nahkampfkanone 1''' was an experimental Swiss [[tank destroyer]] that saw service between 1944 and 1947.
