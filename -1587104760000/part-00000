Constructed in the late 19th century and reconstructed in 1927, the \"Springfield Mile\" as it is known has hosted competitive auto racing since 1910, making it one of the oldest speedways in the United States.  It is the oldest track to continually host national championship dirt track racing, holding its first national championship race in 1934 under the American Automobile Association banner.  It is the home of five world records for automobile racing, making it one of the fastest dirt tracks in the world. Since 1993, the venue is managed by Bob Sargent's Track Enterprises.\n\nThe Illinois State Fair mile currently hosts the [[Allen Crowe Memorial 100]] [[Automobile Racing Club of America|ARCA]] stock car race, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] Silver Crown championship dirt cars, [[United Midwestern Promoters|UMP]] [[late model|Late Models]] and Modifieds and the [[A.M.A. Grand National Championship]].\n\nBilly Winn won the first national championship dirt track race held at the Illinois State Fairgrounds in 1934.  A.J. Foyt ran his first national championship race there in August 1957.  The track is host to two of the older memorial events in the United States, the Bettenhausen 100 for the USAC dirt championship cars, first run in 1961 and the [[Allen Crowe]] Memorial 100 stock car event for USAC, now ARCA, stock cars, first held in 1963.  Both races are now held on the last weekend of the Illinois State Fair.  Chuck Gurney is the only seven-time winner of the Bettenhausen 100, while ARCA driver [[Frank Kimmel]] won the Allen Crowe Memorial for the seventh time in 2008.\n\nThe Bettenhausen 100 was part of the AAA/USAC [[Championship Car]] schedule from 1934 to 1940, 1947 to 1970 and again in 1981 and 1982.\n\nFrom 1946 to 1953, the A.M.A. Grand National Champion was crowned based solely on the results of the Springfield Mile held at the fairground racetrack.<ref name=\"The First Sixty Years; An Illustrated History of the American Motorcyclist Association\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M_kDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA34&dq=1972+american+motorcyclist+motocross+rules+book&hl=en&ei=XNKnTJbKGcK78ga-84yBDQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=false |title=The First Sixty Years; An Illustrated History of the American Motorcyclist Association |author= |publisher=Books.Google.com |date = January 1984|work=American Motorcyclist |accessdate=1 January 2011 }}</ref>\n\n==AAA/USAC Champ Car/Silver Crown race history==\n''All winners were {{Flagicon|USA}} American''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

It is more common for multiple births to be stillborn, while for singletons the risk is not as high.

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

Such complications can include uterine bleeding and children not receiving equal nutrients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guntram|first=Lisa|last2=Zeiler|first2=Kristin|date=2019-05-17|title=The Ethics of the Societal Entrenchment-approach and the case of live uterus transplantation-IVF|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557\u2013571|doi=10.1007/s11019-019-09891-w|pmid=31102175|issn=1386-7423|doi-access=free}}</ref> IVF has also revealed some pre term deliveries and lower birth weights in babies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porta|first=Roser|last2=Capdevila|first2=Eva|last3=Botet|first3=Francesc|last4=Verd|first4=Sergi|last5=Ginovart|first5=Gemma|last6=Moliner|first6=Elisenda|last7=Nicol\u00e0s|first7=Marta|last8=Rios|first8=Jose|date=2017-09-22|title=Morbidity and mortality of very low birth weight multiples compared with singletons|journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine|volume=32|issue=3|pages=389\u2013397|doi=10.1080/14767058.2017.1379073|pmid=28936899|issn=1476-7058}}</ref> While some view medically assisted procreation as a saving grace to have children, others consider these procedure to be unnatural and costly to the community.\n\n===Multifetal pregnancy reduction===\n\nMultifetal pregnancy reduction is the reduction of one or more embryos from the bearing woman. [[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.

Identical triplets are very rare.]]\nA '''multiple birth''' is the culmination of one multiple [[pregnancy]], wherein the mother delivers two or more offspring. A term most applicable to [[vertebrate]] species, multiple births occur in most kinds of mammals, with varying frequencies. Such births are often named according to the number of offspring, as in ''[[twin]]s'' and ''triplets''. In non-humans, the whole group may also be referred to as a ''[[Litter (animal)|litter]]'', and multiple births may be more common than single births. Multiple births in humans are the exception and can be exceptionally rare in the largest mammals.\n\nA multiple pregnancy may be the result of the fertilization of a single egg that then splits to create identical fetuses, or it may be the result of the fertilization of multiple eggs that create fraternal fetuses, or it may be a combination of these factors.  A multiple pregnancy from a single zygote is called ''monozygotic'', from two zygotes is called ''dizygotic'', or from three or more zygotes is called ''polyzygotic''. \nSimilarly, the siblings themselves from a multiple birth may be referred to as monozygotic if they are identical or as polyzygotic if they are fraternal.\n\nEach fertilized [[ovum|egg]] ([[zygote]]) may produce a single embryo, or it may split into two or more embryos, each carrying the same genetic material. Fetuses resulting from different zygotes are called ''fraternal'' and share only 50% of their genetic material, as ordinary full siblings from separate births do. Fetuses resulting from the same zygote share 100% of their genetic material and hence are called ''identical''. Identical twins are always the same sex, except in cases of [[Klinefelter syndrome]] (also known as XXY syndrome and 47,XXY syndrome).\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:TwinsTwins.JPG|right|thumb|Fraternal twins at two weeks old. The technical term for \"fraternal\" is \"polyzygotic\".]]\n[[File:Being a twin means you always have a pillow or blanket handy.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Fraternal twin sisters taking a nap.

This average decreases for each additional fetus: to thirty-six weeks for twin births, thirty-two weeks for triplets, and thirty weeks for quadruplets. With the decreasing gestation time, the risks from immaturity at birth and subsequent viability increase with the size of the sibling group. Only as of the twentieth century have more than four all survived infancy.\n\nRecent history has also seen increasing numbers of multiple births. In the United States, it has been estimated that by 2011, 36% of twin births and 78% of triplet and higher-order births resulted from conception by [[assisted reproductive technology]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Kulkarni AD, Jamieson DJ, Jones HW, Kissin DM, Gallo MF, Macaluso M, Adashi EY | title = Fertility Treatments and Multiple Births in the United States | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 369 | issue = 23 | pages = 2218\u20132225 | year = 2013 | pmid = 24304051 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa1301467 }}</ref>\n\n===Twins===\n{{Main|Twin}}\n\nTwins are by far the most common form of multiple births in humans.

The hyperovulation gene is the cause for having twins and is only a factor for the mother. Although the male does not influence his partner's chances of having twins, he could influence his children's chances for having twins. If a male carries the gene for hyperovulation and has a daughter, she may also have the gene for hyperovulation and then have twins herself.\n\nMonozygotic (identical) twins do not run in families. The twinning is random, due to the egg splitting, so all parents have an equal chance of conceiving identical twins.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bellefonds |first1=Colleen |title=Do Twins Really Run in Families? |url=https://www.whattoexpect.com/pregnancy/twins-and-multiples/do-twins-really-run-in-families/ |website=What to Expect |accessdate=10 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Triplets===\n{{further|List of triplets}}\n[[File:TripletsGirls.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Identical triplets like these three sisters occur when a single fertilized egg splits in two and then one of the resulting two eggs splits again.]]\n[[File:Nurse checking triplets.jpg|thumb|A pediatric nurse checking recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria 2004]]\n[[File:UOTW 19 - Ultrasound of the Week 1.webm|thumb|Monoamniotic triplets as seen on ultrasound<ref>{{cite web|title=UOTW #19 - Ultrasound of the Week|url=https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|website=Ultrasound of the Week|accessdate=27 May 2017|date=23 September 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509073218/https://www.ultrasoundoftheweek.com/uotw-19/|archivedate=9 May 2017}}</ref>]]\n\nTriplets can be either fraternal, identical, or a combination of both. The most common are strictly fraternal triplets, which come from a polyzygotic pregnancy of three eggs. Less common are triplets from a dizygotic pregnancy, where one zygote divides into two identical fetuses, and the other does not. Least common are identical triplets; three fetuses from one egg. In this case the original zygote divides into two, and then one of those two zygotes divides again but the other does not.\n[[File:2004-03-29 Evangel Triplets 10 cropped.jpg|thumb|Recently-born triplets in an incubator at ECWA Evangel Hospital, Jos, Nigeria March 29, 2004.]]\nTriplets are far less common than twins, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, accounting for only about 4300 sets in 3.9 million births, just a little more than 0.1%, or 1 in 1000.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, only about 10% of these are identical triplets: about 1 in ten thousand.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> Nevertheless, only 4 sets of identical triplets were reported in the U.S. during 2015, about one in a million.<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" /> According to Victor Khouzami, Chairman of Obstetrics at Greater Baltimore Medical Center, \"No one really knows the incidence\".<ref name=\"BaltimoreSun2015\" />\n\nIdentical triplets or quadruplets are very rare and result when the original fertilized egg splits and then one of the resultant cells splits again (for triplets) or, even more rarely, a further split occurs (for quadruplets).

Medical practitioners are doing this by limiting the number of embryos per embryo transfer to one or two. That way, the risks for the mother and fetuses are decreased.\n\nThe appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available.

Such complications can include uterine bleeding and children not receiving equal nutrients.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Guntram|first=Lisa|last2=Zeiler|first2=Kristin|date=2019-05-17|title=The Ethics of the Societal Entrenchment-approach and the case of live uterus transplantation-IVF|journal=Medicine, Health Care and Philosophy|volume=22|issue=4|pages=557\u2013571|doi=10.1007/s11019-019-09891-w|pmid=31102175|issn=1386-7423|doi-access=free}}</ref> IVF has also revealed some pre term deliveries and lower birth weights in babies.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Porta|first=Roser|last2=Capdevila|first2=Eva|last3=Botet|first3=Francesc|last4=Verd|first4=Sergi|last5=Ginovart|first5=Gemma|last6=Moliner|first6=Elisenda|last7=Nicol\u00e0s|first7=Marta|last8=Rios|first8=Jose|date=2017-09-22|title=Morbidity and mortality of very low birth weight multiples compared with singletons|journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal & Neonatal Medicine|volume=32|issue=3|pages=389\u2013397|doi=10.1080/14767058.2017.1379073|pmid=28936899|issn=1476-7058}}</ref> While some view medically assisted procreation as a saving grace to have children, others consider these procedure to be unnatural and costly to the community.\n\n===Multifetal pregnancy reduction===\n\nMultifetal pregnancy reduction is the reduction of one or more embryos from the bearing woman. [[Selective reduction]] usually occurs for pregnancies assisted by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The first multifetal pregnancy reductions to occur in a clinical setting took place in the 1980s. Multiple pregnancies do not occur from a genetic predisposition. The genetic biology that results in twins is the fertilization of an egg or more at the time of conception. The procedure aims to reduce pregnancies down to approximately one to two fetuses. The overarching purpose of the procedure is not primarily to simply terminate life, but to increase the survival and success of the mother and babies. However, multifetal pregnancy reduction raises some ethical questions. The main argument is similar to abortion ethics ([[Abortion debate]]) in reduction of fetus versus fetus life. The protection of maternal well being versus harm of newly formed fetal life is an extension of the aforementioned ethical question.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rao|first=Radhika|date=August 2015|title=Selective Reduction: \"A Soft Cover for Hard Choices\" or Another Name for Abortion?|journal=The Journal of Law, Medicine & Ethics|volume=43|issue=2|pages=196\u2013205|doi=10.1111/jlme.12233|pmid=26242939|issn=1073-1105}}</ref> It can be viewed that all life is important and that no life should be terminated without consent from the life that is being terminated.
