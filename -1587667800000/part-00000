They follow the Chinese lunar calendar of the 12-year cycle and their typical song-dance which is famously known as Tamang selo, which include the songs of humor and wit, satire, joy and sorrow. Tamangs have their own music. Their musical instrument is called Damphu (a small round drum covered with goat skin).

Due to the lack of irrigation at higher altitudes, their crops are often limited to corn, millet, wheat, barley, and potatoes.  They often supplement their farming income with manual labour.  Due to the discrimination experienced by the Tamang people in the past, they have remained on the whole poorly educated, and the majority have been limited to working as farmers, mountain trekking, portering, and driving in Kathmandu. They also work in manufacture of Tibetan rugs, Thankas (Tibetan painting), driving and labour.  As far as farming is concerned, Tamang are dependent on rainfall and do not employ modern machinery.<ref name=\"Ghimire\" />\n\n==Trekking and tourism==\nTamang villages are often visited on Nepal's numerous trekking routes, one being labelled ''Tamang Heritage Trail''.<ref>{{cite web |author=Post Report |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |title=The Kathmandu Post :: Tamang Heritage Trail reopens after quake |publisher=Kathmandupost.ekantipur.com |accessdate=2015-12-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065012/http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/printedition/news/2015-07-30/tamang-heritage-trail-reopens-after-quake.html |archivedate=2015-12-08 }}</ref>\n== Notable Tamangs ==\n[[File:Navneet-Aditya-Waiba-Live.jpg|thumb|Navneet Aditya Waiba- Nepali Folk Singer|alt=Nepali Folk Singer]]\n[[File:Kulman-Ghising-Nepal-Electricity-Authority MD.jpg|thumb|Kulman Ghising]]\n\nTamangs are known in Nepali Art/Music, Politics, Novels and Civil servants of Nepal.

George and Arthur Dobson set out in March 1864, later to be joined by their brother Edward at [[Craigieburn, New Zealand|Craigieburn]]. While George surveyed road lines there, Edward and Arthur proceeded to explore the high country. On the advice of West Coast [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] chief Tarapuhi, they found a pass that steeply descended to what became known as [[Otira]]; the route had long been used by M\u0101ori for trading [[pounamu]].

Edward Dobson was commissioned to examine every possible pass to the West Coast from the watersheds of the Waimakariri, [[Taramakau River|Taramakau]] and [[Hurunui River]]s. After finishing his examination, he declared that \"Arthur's pass\" was by far the most suitable to get to the gold fields.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The provincial government decided that a road was to be built between Christchurch and Hokitika, a distance of {{convert|156|miles|km}}, and Edward Dobson was put in charge of the project.<ref name=\"Te Ara Dobson Brothers\" /> The road was opened on 20 March 1866.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /> The alpine pass became known as [[Arthur's Pass (mountain pass)|Arthur's Pass]], with a [[Arthur's Pass|nearby village]] and a later a [[Arthur's Pass National Park|national park]] also taking this name.<ref name=\"Arthur's Pass discovery\" />\n\n;Australia\nDobson resigned as provincial engineer in 1868 and moved to Australia the following year.

He returned to New Zealand in 1876.<ref name=\"NZHPT bio\" />\n\n;New Zealand again\nIn 1878, Edward Dobson went into a formal partnership with his son Arthur, which lasted until 1885. They were working on water supply schemes for [[Timaru]] and the [[Canterbury Plains]]. They surveyed the [[Midland Line, New Zealand|Midland Line]] over the [[Southern Alps (New Zealand)|Southern Alps]] and, in partnership with others, launched the [[New Zealand Midland Railway Company|Midland Railway Company]]. The venture was a failure, as it was underfunded. Eventually, the government took over the scheme, but the line between Christchurch and [[Greymouth]] was not finished until 1923.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" />\n\nIn his later years, Edward Dobson concentrated on education. He had lectured since the 1860s, and his lectures to the Christchurch High School are regarded as \"the first attempt to make Physical Science a branch of regular instruction in this colony\". He published papers for the Philosophical Institute of Canterbury and the [[Institution of Civil Engineers]] in London, which awarded him the [[Telford Medal]] for the 1868\u20131869 session for a paper entitled ''The public works of the province of Canterbury, New Zealand''.<ref name=\"DNZB Dobson\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=Engineering: Volume 10|year=1870|publisher=Design Council|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0xCAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA306 |accessdate=9 May 2011|page=306}}</ref>\n\nHe helped establish the Engineering School of the Canterbury College, which became the [[University of Canterbury]], and lectured until 1892.
