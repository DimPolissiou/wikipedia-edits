The county formed part of the Nation\u2019s [[Pushmataha District]], or Third District, one of three administrative super-regions.\n\n== History ==\nThe county was created in 1850 as Shappaway County, a name it held until 1854.  Shappaway was a corruption of the Chickasaw or Choctaw words, ''shapah'', or \u201cflag,\u201d and ''welih'', \u201cto hold up to view.\u201d  In late 1854 the General Council of the Choctaw Nation renamed it Atoka County in honor of Captain William Atoka.  His surname, \u201cAtoka,\u201d is derived from the Choctaw word ''hitoka'' or ''hetoka'', meaning \u201cball ground.\u201d<ref>\"Organization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations.\" ''Chronicles of Oklahoma''. Vol. 8, No. 3: 324, 330. September 1930.</ref>\n\nCaptain Atoka was a noted athlete, distinguishing himself on the [[stickball]] playing field.  Those who excelled in stickball were thought to be strong, brave, courageous, and intelligent.  Atoka was a leader before the Choctaw removed to the west of the Mississippi River; he was a co-signer of the [[Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek]] in 1830.  \n\nAtoka lived in several locations in and around the present-day town of Atoka, dying at his home in October 1876.  His grave was protected by a shed, which was maintained by friends and neighbors until Oklahoma\u2019s statehood.  It remained in place through at least 1937.<ref>\u201cWilliam Atoka Biography,\u201d Indian-Pioneer Papers, Western History Collections, University of Oklahoma Libraries; \u201cOrganization of Counties in the Choctaw and Chickasaw Nations,\u201d ''Chronicles of Oklahoma'', Vol. 8, No. 3, September 1930, pp. 317\u2013318, 324, 330.</ref>\n\nThe county seat of Atoka County was the town of Atoka. This county was unusual among the Choctaw Nation\u2019s 19 counties for having a county seat that was also a population center. County seats were generally campgrounds used for tribal judicial or other proceedings. They had few if any permanent residents. Atoka, by contrast, was served by a railroad and developed as a trading center.\n\nAtoka County\u2019s boundaries were established and designated according to easily recognizable natural landmarks, as were the boundaries of all Choctaw Nation counties. Its western boundary was the Choctaw Nation\u2019s western boundary with the [[Chickasaw Nation]]. [[Clear Boggy Creek]] formed most of its southern border, and [[Muddy Boggy Creek]] and North Boggy Creek formed its eastern borders. Its northern border skirted the Shawnee Hills to their south, and connected with North Boggy Creek.  \n\nAtoka County served as an election district for members of the National Council; it was also a unit of local administration. Constitutional officers, all of whom served for two-year terms and were elected by the voters, included the county judge, sheriff, and a ranger. The judge\u2019s duties included oversight of overall county administration. The sheriff collected taxes, monitored unlawful intrusion by intruders (usually white Americans from the United States), and conducted the census. The county ranger advertised and sold strayed livestock.<ref>''Constitution and Laws of the Choctaw Nation'', 1890, p. 312; John W. Morris, ''Historical Atlas of Oklahoma'', plates 38 & 56; and Angie Debo, ''The Rise and Fall of the Choctaw Republic'', p. 152.</ref>\n\n== Statehood ==\nAs Oklahoma\u2019s statehood approached, its leading citizens, who were gathered for the Oklahoma Constitutional Convention, realized in laying out the future state\u2019s counties that, while logically designed, most the Choctaw Nation\u2019s counties could not exist as economically viable political subdivisions. In most the county seat existed generally for holding county court and not as a population center. This was not true of the town of Atoka, nor was it true of Atoka County, which included large coal mines at Atoka, Coalgate and Lehigh within its territory.  While Atoka County contained more sizable towns and industry than most, it would have to be dismantled in order to accommodate changes required by the region at large.\n\nThis conundrum was also recognized by the framers of the proposed [[State of Sequoyah]], who met in 1905 to propose statehood for the Indian Territory. The [[Sequoyah Constitutional Convention]] also proposed a county structure that abolished the Choctaw counties. Atoka County was divided principally into the proposed Bixby, Blue, and Moseley counties. In so doing Sequoyah\u2019s framers first established the separation of [[Coalgate, Oklahoma|Coalgate]] and [[Lehigh, Oklahoma|Lehigh]] into their own county (Moseley County), separate from [[Atoka, Oklahoma|Atoka]] (in Bixby County), despite the short distance between the towns.<ref>Amos Maxwell, ''Sequoyah Constitutional Convention''. Although the map carried in Wikipedia\u2019s article on the State of Sequoyah speaks to the matter of borders, Maxwell\u2019s book offers further insight.</ref>\n\nMuch of this proposition was borrowed by Oklahoma\u2019s framers two years later, who largely adopted the eastern boundary of the proposed Bixby County for the future Atoka County in Oklahoma, and formalized the split-off of Coalgate and Lehigh into an adjacent county.\n\nThe territory comprising Atoka County, Choctaw Nation now falls within the present-day [[Atoka County, Oklahoma|Atoka]], [[Coal County, Oklahoma|Coal]], [[Hughes County, Oklahoma|Hughes]], and [[Pittsburg County, Oklahoma|Pittsburg]] counties.

A later DVD series was released, entitled ''Disney Princess Stories'', featuring content similar to the previous release.\n\nBelle had her own live-action television series titled ''[[Sing Me a Story with Belle]]''. The first eight Disney Princesses also made appearances on the animated TV series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' and Belle also made an appearance (along with her husband, Beast) on a short episode from the TV animated series ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''.

The first movie in the series entitled ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', was released on September 4, 2007. It is a musical film featuring new tales about Princess Jasmine and the first new tale about Princess Aurora since the original ''Sleeping Beauty''.\n\nOriginally, ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness'' was announced as the first film in the series, which contained a different Princess Aurora story, and had a Belle story rather than a Princess Jasmine story.

A later DVD series was released, entitled ''Disney Princess Stories'', featuring content similar to the previous release.\n\nBelle had her own live-action television series titled ''[[Sing Me a Story with Belle]]''. The first eight Disney Princesses also made appearances on the animated TV series ''[[Disney's House of Mouse|House of Mouse]]'' and Belle also made an appearance (along with her husband, Beast) on a short episode from the TV animated series ''[[Mickey Mouse (TV series)|Mickey Mouse]]''. The television special ''[[The Little Mermaid Live!]]'' starred [[Auli\u02bbi Cravalho]] as Ariel.\n\nIn early 2007, Disney announced ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales'', a new series of [[direct-to-video]] features that feature new stories for the Disney Princesses. The first movie in the series entitled ''[[Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: Follow Your Dreams]]'', was released on September 4, 2007. It is a musical film featuring new tales about Princess Jasmine and the first new tale about Princess Aurora since the original ''Sleeping Beauty''.\n\nOriginally, ''Disney Princess Enchanted Tales: A Kingdom of Kindness'' was announced as the first film in the series, which contained a different Princess Aurora story, and had a Belle story rather than a Princess Jasmine story. Disney made this change without any sort of notice.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Currently,{{When|date=June 2015}} the series is cancelled and only \"Follow Your Dreams\" exists.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2007/06/20/say-so-long-to-direct-to-video-sequels-disneytoon-studios-tunes-out-sharon-morrill.aspx |title=Say \"So Long !\" to direct-to-video sequels : DisneyToon Studios tunes out Sharon Morrill |publisher=Jimhillmedia.com |accessdate=2012-06-09 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214085017/http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2007/06/20/say-so-long-to-direct-to-video-sequels-disneytoon-studios-tunes-out-sharon-morrill.aspx |archivedate=February 14, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe TV series ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV Series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' that aired on the Disney-owned [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], featured live-action versions of Snow White, Cinderella, Belle, Aurora, Mulan, Ariel, Rapunzel, Merida, Jasmine and Tiana in addition to Anna and Elsa. Snow White and Belle were main characters while the rest made recurring and or guest appearances. Beginning in season 7, Cinderella, Tiana and Rapunzel were main characters. Many of these characters are patterned after the Disney versions, but a few draw inspiration from older stories.\n\nThe TV series ''[[Sofia the First]]'' premiered on January 11, 2013, on [[Disney Junior]]. Cinderella appeared in the first movie ''Once Upon A Princess''. Jasmine, Belle, Aurora, Snow White, Mulan, Tiana, and Merida have appeared on the show, and Ariel and Rapunzel appeared in the TV Specials ''The Floating Palace'' and ''The Curse of Princess Ivy'', respectively. However, Sofia is a minor princess and not in the royal court. She is voiced by ''[[Modern Family]]'' star [[Ariel Winter]]. In 2017, the TV series ''[[Rapunzel's Tangled Adventure]]'' debuted with the made-for-television movie ''[[Tangled: Before Ever After]]'' serving as the pilot.\n\nThe 2014 and 2019 films ''[[Maleficent (film)|Maleficent]]'' and ''[[Maleficent: Mistress of Evil]]'', [[Elle Fanning]] played Aurora. [[Lily James]] portrayed Cinderella in the [[Cinderella (2015 Disney film)|2015 film of the same name]].

Mulan, however, makes her first appearance as the player visits her world.

The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then. Their lineup stable, Phish performed together for 15 years before beginning a two-year hiatus in October 2000.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

The band is known for [[musical improvisation]], extended [[Jam session#Rock|jams]], blending of [[Music genre|genres]], and a dedicated [[Fandom|fan base]]. The band consists of guitarist [[Trey Anastasio]], bassist [[Mike Gordon]], drummer [[Jon Fishman]], and keyboardist [[Page McConnell]], all of whom perform vocals, with Anastasio being the primary lead vocalist.\n\nThe band was formed by Anastasio, Gordon, Fishman and guitarist [[Jeff Holdsworth]], who were joined by McConnell in 1985. Holdsworth departed the band in 1986, and the quartet lineup has remained in place since then.

[[psychedelic rock]], [[progressive rock]], [[jazz fusion]], [[funk]], [[reggae]], [[hard rock]], [[alternative rock]], [[post-punk]] and various \"acoustic\" genres, such as [[folk music|folk]] and [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]]. Some Phish songs use different vocal approaches, such as [[a cappella]] (unaccompanied) sections of [[barbershop quartet]]-style vocal harmonies.\n\nSome of their original compositions tend towards a [[psychedelic rock]] fusion, with more progressive, jazz and [[funk]] elements than the [[Grateful Dead]] and other earlier [[jam band]]s. Their more ambitious, epic compositions (such as \"[[You Enjoy Myself]]\" and \"Guyute\") are often said to resemble classical music in a rock setting, much like the music of one of their heroes, [[Frank Zappa]].\n\nIn the 1990s, Phish were often compared to the Grateful Dead, a comparison that the band members often resisted or distanced themselves from. In November 1995, Anastasio told the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' \"When we first came into the awareness of the media, it would always be the Dead or Zappa they'd compare us to.

Each a production unto itself, the band is known to consistently change set lists and details, as well as the addition of their own antics to ensure that no two shows are ever the same. With fans flocking to venues hours before they open, the concert is the centerpiece of an event that includes a temporary community in the parking lot, complete with \"Shakedown Street\": at times a garment district, art district, food court, or pharmacy.<ref>{{Cite book | author=Gibbon, Sean | title=Run Like an Antelope: On the Road with Phish | year=2001 | publisher=Thomas Dunne Books/St. Martin's Griffin | location=New York | isbn=0-312-26330-9 | page=[https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 95] | url=https://archive.org/details/runlikeantelopeo0000gibb/page/95 }}</ref> For many, one concert is simply a prelude to the next as the community follows the band around the country. Their image and fan devotion could be compared to that of the [[Grateful Dead]].\n\nPhish concerts typically feature two sets, with an intermission in between. During concerts, songs often [[segue]] into one another, or produce improvisational jams that can last 10 minutes or more depending on the song.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gibbs |first1=Ryan |title=Freshwater Phish: Introduction |url=https://www.theyoungfolks.com/music/126520/freshwater-phish-introduction/ |website=The Young Folks |accessdate=11 April 2019 |date=20 October 2018}}</ref> Several regularly performed songs in Phish's repertoire have never appeared on one of their studio albums; Those include \"Possum\", \"Mike's Song\", \"I Am Hydrogen\", \"Weekapaug Groove\", \"Harry Hood\", \"Runaway Jim\", \"Suzy Greenberg\", \"AC/DC Bag\" and \"The Lizards\", all of which date to 1990 or earlier and have been played by Phish over 300 times in concert.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song Histories |url=http://phish.net/song |website=phish.net |accessdate=11 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nBecause Phish's reputation is so grounded in their live performances, concert recordings are commonly traded commodities. Official [[soundboard recording]]s can be purchased through the Live Phish website.

Although technically not allowed, live videos of Phish shows are also traded by fans and are tolerated as long as they are for non-profit, personal use. Phish fans have been noted for their extensive collections of fan-taped concert recordings; owning recordings of entire tours and years is widespread.\n\nFans recordings are generally sourced from the officially designated tapers' section at each show, by fans with devoted sound recording rigs. Tickets for the tapers' section are acquired separately from regular audience tickets, and directly from the band's website, instead of the venue or a service like [[Ticketmaster]].

Among the first was ''Analyze Phish'' which was hosted by comedians [[Harris Wittels]] and [[Scott Aukerman]] for the [[Earwolf]] podcast network, and ran for ten episodes posted between 2011 and 2014.<ref>{{cite web |title=Phish 101, episode #1 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/phish-101/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fuego, episode #10 of Analyze Phish on Earwolf |url=https://www.earwolf.com/episode/fuego/ |website=www.earwolf.com |accessdate=5 January 2020}}</ref> The podcast followed Wittels, a devoted fan of the band, in his humorous attempts to get Aukerman to enjoy their music.<ref>{{cite web |title=Harris Wittels: The Parks and Rec Writer Gets to \"Analyze Phish\" (Throwback) |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/harris-wittels-the-parks-and-rec-writer-gets-to-analyze-phish/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=26 February 2015}}</ref> Despite its truncated run, ''Analyze Phish'' inspired Phish lyricist Tom Marshall to start his own Phish podcast, ''Under the Scales'', in 2016.<ref name=\"osiris\">{{cite web |last1=Greenhaus |first1=Mike |title=Interview: Tom Marshall and RJ Bee on New Podcast Network Osiris |url=https://relix.com/articles/detail/interview_tom_marshall_and_rj_bee_on_new_podcast_network_osiris/ |website=Relix Media |accessdate=5 January 2020 |date=22 February 2018}}</ref> In 2018, Marshall co-founded the Osiris Podcasting Network, which hosts ''Under the Scales'' and other music podcasts, many of which are devoted to Phish or other jam bands.<ref name=\"osiris\"/> On 15 September 2019, C13Originals debuted ''Long May They Run'', a music documentary podcast series.
