She married James in 1660 and two months later gave birth to the couple's first child, who had been conceived out of wedlock. Some observers disapproved of the marriage, but James's brother, King [[Charles II of England]], wanted the marriage to take place.  Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century. James and Anne had eight children, but six died in early childhood.{{sfn|Weir|2008|pp=259\u201360}} The two who survived to adulthood were future monarchs, [[Mary II]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]. James was a known philanderer who kept many mistresses, for which Anne often reproached him, and fathered [[Descendants of James II of England#Illegitimate issue|many illegitimate children]].\n\nOriginally an [[Anglican]], Anne converted to [[Catholicism]] soon after her marriage to James. She had been exposed to Catholicism during visits to the Netherlands and France and was strongly attracted thereto. Partly due to Anne's influence, James later also converted to Catholicism, which would ultimately lead to the [[Glorious Revolution]]. She suffered from advanced [[breast cancer]] and died shortly after giving birth to her last child.\n\n== Early years (1637\u201360) ==\n\nIn 1629, [[Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon|Edward Hyde]] married his first wife, Anne Ayliffe of Grittenham. Six months into the marriage Anne caught [[smallpox]], miscarried and died.{{sfn|Lister|1838|p=9}} Three years later, Hyde married [[Frances Hyde, Countess of Clarendon|Frances Aylesbury]]. In 1637, Anne, the couple's eldest daughter, was born at [[Cranbourne Lodge]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]].{{sfn|Weir|2008|p=259}} Almost nothing except that she was named after Edward Hyde's first wife is known of her life before 1649, when her family fled to the [[Netherlands]] after the execution of the deposed [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]].{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=18}} They settled in [[Breda]], where they were offered a home by [[Mary, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]], who had done the same with many English fugitives.{{sfn|Henslowe|1915|p=19}} The Princess appointed Anne a maid of honour, apparently against the wishes of her mother and late father.{{sfn|Everett Green|1857|p=235}}\n\nAnne became a general favourite with the people she met either at [[The Hague]] or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish,{{sfn|Melville|2005|p=3}} and attracted many men.

Some observers disapproved of the marriage, but James's brother, King [[Charles II of England]], wanted the marriage to take place.  Another cause of disapproval was the public affection James showed toward Anne, such as kissing and leaning against each other, which was considered improper behaviour from man to wife during the seventeenth century. James and Anne had eight children, but six died in early childhood.{{sfn|Weir|2008|pp=259\u201360}} The two who survived to adulthood were future monarchs, [[Mary II]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]].

Pepys also wrote that when James fell in love with [[Elizabeth Stanhope, Countess of Chesterfield (d. 1665)|Lady Chesterfield]], Anne complained to King Charles so insistently that Lady Chesterfield had to retreat to the countryside, where she remained until she died.{{sfn|Melville|2005|pp=21\u20132}} {{sfn|Melville|2005|pp=25\u20137}}\n\nAnne became drawn to [[Catholicism]], to which both she and James had been exposed during their time abroad{{sfn|Miller|2000|pp=58\u20139}}{{sfn|Callow|2000|pp=144\u20135}} and converted to it almost immediately after the Restoration.
