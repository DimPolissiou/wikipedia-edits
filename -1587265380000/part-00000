Arthur suggested Warren to seek out postkeynesian economists [[L. Randall Wray]], [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]], and [[Stephanie Kelton]] to discuss his ideas. These [[post-Keynesian]] economists taught Mosler about [[chartalism]], and in turn Mosler convinced the economists that taxation and borrowing does not finance US federal government spending.<ref name=\"Vice\" />  Laffer also introduced Warren to his future collaborator economist Mark McNary.  Warren drew on McNary's research on taxes among other research to underpin his self-published [[monograph]], \"Soft-Currency Economics\".<ref name=\"thenation\" />\n\n==Academic work==\nAcademically, he is known for his writings on [[Modern Monetary Theory]], an economic theory that describes the way [[fiat money]] is created and used in modern economies. His unorthodox views have gained a substantial following among participants in Internet discussion groups and academics.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> His most recent publication was in fact published in a leading mainstream academic journal.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2010 he published ''Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy'' outlining errors that can be made in the development of policy and explains what he deems \"true\" as proper alternatives.<ref name=about/>\n\nIn recognition that his ''\"leadership in the field of economics is notable\"'' Mosler was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Franklin University Switzerland]] in 2014,<ref>http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/graphs/2014/01/credentials.pdf.

Specifically, Mosler's law states that \"[...] no financial crisis [is] so deep that a sufficiently large fiscal adjustment cannot deal with it.\"<ref>{{cite web| title =Mosler's Law| work =Kenne Turner| date =Feb 20, 2009| url =http://kenneturner.com/tag/moslers-law/}}</ref>  He stated that the recent recession could have been alleviated much quicker from a full payroll tax holiday that suspended FICA taxes (or massive government spending increases, depending on one's politics) until unemployment fell.<ref name=nytimes/>  He opposes overly high taxes since they discourage consumption within an economy but does agree a certain tax level is needed to guarantee citizens use the dollar as a currency.<ref name=cd>{{cite web| title =Warren Mosler| work =Car & Driver Report | url =http://www.caranddriver.com/features/warren-mosler-what-id-do-differently}}</ref><ref name=nytimes/>  He is confident that inflation is a non-factor in his analysis given current procurement policy as long as there is sufficient excess capacity.  In his theory the government has the complete ability to constantly expand net spending and guarantee consumption and growth.<ref name=nytimes/>  He supports unlimited FDIC deposit insurance for all bank deposits for US banks.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Sada| title =Alternative Bank Liquidity Proposal| work =Center of the Universe| date =May 20, 2008| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/05/20/alternative-bank-liquidity-proposal/}}</ref>\n\nHe stresses that federal spending is in no way constrained by tax revenues, therefore the government will always be able to make payments in its own currency, stating \"Federal Government checks don't bounce\".<ref name=seven>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =The Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds| work =Center of the Universe| url =http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/powerpoints/7DIF.pdf}}</ref>  He goes on to state that any and all debt passed on to future generations will never be burdensome, since they will undoubtedly consume whatever is produced.<ref name=seven/>\n\nHe developed much of his belief from his time as a hedge fund manager when many investors predicted the Italian government defaulting on bonds, whereas he predicted, correctly, that Italian government would not default and thus made considerable returns.<ref name=nytimes/>\n\n===Economic views===\n; Healthcare\nMosler supports government funding for full-time employment with full health care coverage for employees and dependents, thus triggering all firms providing health care to remain competitive.  He states health cannot be viewed as a production cost, therefore the government should fund for at least 90% of the cost paid by the firms.  Finally, he supports issuing medical debit cards to all citizens, for a fixed amount.  This covers any medical costs and any amount above this will be covered by \"catastrophe insurance\".  At the end of every year, citizens would receive a portion of their unused medical debit card.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Mosler Healthcare Proposal | work =The Center of the Universe| date =Mar 2, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2009/03/02/mosler-health-care-proposal/}}</ref>\n\n; Energy\nIn a brief proposal, Mosler stated the energy crisis could be solved by lowering the speed limit nationally to 30&nbsp;mph.  According to Mosler, this would cut gasoline consumption and pollution since automobiles run more efficiently at slower speeds, while also greatly increase the demand for public transportation.<ref name=energy>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Energy Crisis Solution| work =Center of the Universe| date =May 22, 2008| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/05/22/energy-crisis-solution/}}</ref>  He states that such an initiative would eventually lead to a supply shock forcing prices down, and improve real terms of trade.<ref name=energy/>\n\n; Housing\nMosler supports government purchases of houses in the foreclosure process from the bank at the lower of the fair market value or remaining mortgage balance.  The government then would rent the house back to the original owner and after two years the house is put on the market with the original owner having the first rights of purchase.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Mosler housing proposal| work =Center of the Universe| date =Feb 18, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2009/02/18/mosler-housing-proposal/}}</ref>\n\n; Taxes\nMosler supports eliminating the income tax and replacing it with a real estate tax to \"anchor the currency\".<ref name=taxes>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Current Proposals| work =Center of the Universe| date =Apr 26, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2008/04/26/current-proposals/}}</ref>  He also supports eliminating tax advantages for any savings accounts, since he states savings do not increase investments necessarily.<ref name=taxes/>  He supports luxury taxes being used to limit the consumption of undesirable goods.<ref name=taxes/>\n\n==Sportscar and maritime engineer==\n{{main|Mosler Automotive}}\nMosler developed several luxury sports cars and [[supercars]], including the [[Consulier GTP]] and the [[Mosler MT900]]. Starting in 1985, his cars were marketed by startup company Consulier, later renamed [[Mosler Automotive]].<ref name=cd/>\n\nHis designs were marked by excellent performance and high-speeds.<ref name=jpnik>{{cite web| last =Petrany| first =Mate| title =Mosler Made The First Production Car With No Structural Metal In 1985| work =Jalopnik| date =Jun 17, 2013| url =http://jalopnik.com/mosler-made-the-first-production-car-with-no-structural-513809846}}</ref> Mosler was so confident of one of his models, the Consulier GTP, that he offered a bounty of $25,000 to anyone who could beat it in a race. ''[[Car and Driver]]'' took up the gauntlet and defeated his car. Mosler noted that the model used in the race was a worn out Consulier and even so offered to pay if he was allowed to use his own driver and replace the brake pads. ''Car and Driver'' refused.  Mosler subsequently offered the challenge once more for a higher bounty of $100,000 and held an event at Sebring where the Consulier again proved to be far quicker than any other road car.<ref name=cd/>\n\nIn the 90s he developed environmentally friendly vehicles including both electric cars and composite-bodied automobiles.<ref name=cd/> The company was sold off in June 2013.<ref name=jpnik/>\n\nMosler also designed his own [[catamaran]] that he prides on being much lighter, faster, and more fuel-efficient than other models.<ref name=cd/> He is currently operating a unique 'tandem' four hulled ferry that doesn't promote sea sickness to take passengers from St. Croix to St. Thomas.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}\n\n==Political campaigns==\n\nIn February 2009, Mosler declared his candidacy with the Federal Elections Commission to run for the office of President of the United States as an independent.<ref name=\"president\" /> In April 2010, he withdrew to run for a [[United States Senate election in Connecticut, 2010|U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut]],<ref name=\"mosler\"/> briefly as a Democrat, but ultimately as an independent.

Arthur suggested Warren to seek out postkeynesian economists [[L. Randall Wray]], [[Bill Mitchell (economist)|Bill Mitchell]], and [[Stephanie Kelton]] to discuss his ideas. These [[post-Keynesian]] economists taught Mosler about [[chartalism]], and in turn Mosler convinced the economists that taxation and borrowing does not finance US federal government spending.<ref name=\"Vice\" />  Laffer also introduced Warren to his future collaborator economist Mark McNary.  Warren drew on McNary's research on taxes among other research to underpin his self-published [[monograph]], \"Soft-Currency Economics\".<ref name=\"thenation\" />\n\n==Academic work==\nAcademically, he is known for his writings on [[Modern Monetary Theory]], an economic theory that describes the way [[fiat money]] is created and used in modern economies. His unorthodox views have gained a substantial following among participants in Internet discussion groups and academics.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> His most recent publication was in fact published in a leading mainstream academic journal.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn 2010 he published ''Seven Deadly Innocent Frauds of Economic Policy'' outlining errors that can be made in the development of policy and explains what he deems \"true\" as proper alternatives.<ref name=about/>\n\nIn recognition that his ''\"leadership in the field of economics is notable\"'' Mosler was awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Franklin University Switzerland]] in 2014,<ref>http://moslereconomics.com/wp-content/graphs/2014/01/credentials.pdf.

He states health cannot be viewed as a production cost, therefore the government should fund for at least 90% of the cost paid by the firms.  Finally, he supports issuing medical debit cards to all citizens, for a fixed amount.  This covers any medical costs and any amount above this will be covered by \"catastrophe insurance\".  At the end of every year, citizens would receive a portion of their unused medical debit card.<ref>{{cite web| last =Mosler| first =Warren| title =Mosler Healthcare Proposal | work =The Center of the Universe| date =Mar 2, 2009| url =http://moslereconomics.com/2009/03/02/mosler-health-care-proposal/}}</ref>\n\n; Energy\nIn a brief proposal, Mosler stated the energy crisis could be solved by lowering the speed limit nationally to 30&nbsp;mph.

Downing had his premises on [[Chancery Lane]]. This location was spared from the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, but in December of the same year, Downing died. It is believed that Charles continued his apprenticeship under Cordelia Downing, Humphrey\u2019s wife, and later worked as a journeyman until he was made a [https://www.clockmakers.org/about/becoming-a-freeman/ freeman] of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] (the 'Clockmakers' Company') on 3 June 1772.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes 3/6/1672 - MS2010/1.</ref> \n\nCharles Gretton established his first workshop on Fleet Street with John Johnson but in 1778 moved into his own premises, \u2018The Ship,\u2019 in the vicinity of [[Fleet Street]] and Fetter Lane.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a [[journeyman]] for four years rather than the more customary two years. Sully then moved to France, becoming quite famous in the Continent and in Great Britain. Sully is remembered for his efforts to develop a seagoing clock for determining [[longitude]] at sea.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''.P.522 - 533, 536 - 540.</ref> Charles Gretton was a prolific maker of clocks and watches for home and abroad. ''[http://www.grettonbook.com/home Charles Gretton: Clock and Watchmaking Through The Golden Age]'', published in 2016, lists 74 extant longcase clocks, 52 spring clocks, five [[Lantern clock|lantern clocks]] and 29 [[Watch|watches]], but more have been discovered since.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. pp. 577\u2013591.</ref> \n\nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. p. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. pp. 419, 443\u2013447.</ref> Gretton produced [https://www.lexico.com/definition/timepiece timepieces], [[mwod:clock watch|clock watches]], alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches (i.e., which contained [[Repeater (horology)|repeaters]]), and [[polychrome]] decorated watches with [https://anordain.com/blogs/news/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enamel-dials-part-1 enamel dials] and [[porcelain]] boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable to those of London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, [[ebony]]-veneered cases, and [[lacquer]]-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-[[Striking clock|striking]] control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter [[maintaining power]].\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. pp. 279\u2013281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. pp. 270\u2013278.</ref>\n\n== The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers ==\nGretton was very active in the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]]. He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was elected Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>  Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the [[Bank of England]] in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of urban and rural properties. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref> In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund.

He also was a Common Councilman for the Ward of [[Farringdon Without]], representing the [[parish]] of St Dunstan-in-the-West for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for [[Ludgate]] and for both precincts of the parish of [[St Martin, Ludgate]].\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Mary Gretton died in December 1698, as did two of the children.\n\nTheir son Phillips attended [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul\u2019s School]], London, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], attaining his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree at the latter.<ref>Gardiner, Robert (Ed.). (1884). ''The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876''. London: George Gardiner. p. 61.</ref> Phillips became the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] in [[Springfield, Essex]], where he stayed for the rest of his life. Phillips was married in the newly completed [[St Paul's Cathedral|St Paul\u2019s Cathedral]], London, in March 1712/13.\n\nDaughter Ann married John Houghton, a glover. Charles Gretton lived the very last years of his life with Ann at the Houghton home in [[Milk Street, London|Milk Street]], London. Ann was buried in Springfield in January 1752/53, where her nephew, Phillips' son, had become the rector.\n\nLittle is known about Thomas, the youngest son. He married Elizabeth Turner, a widow.

Downing had his premises on [[Chancery Lane]]. This location was spared from the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, but in December of the same year, Downing died. It is believed that Charles continued his apprenticeship under Cordelia Downing, Humphrey\u2019s wife, and later worked as a journeyman until he was made a [https://www.clockmakers.org/about/becoming-a-freeman/ freeman] of the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]] (the 'Clockmakers' Company') on 3 June 1772.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes 3/6/1672 - MS2010/1.</ref> \n\nCharles Gretton established his first workshop on Fleet Street with John Johnson but in 1778 moved into his own premises, \u2018The Ship,\u2019 in the vicinity of [[Fleet Street]] and Fetter Lane.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila.

He took at least eight apprentices, including his nephew Charles Kemp (who became the master to Tom Tompion\u2019s nephew), John Farewell, and Joseph Antram, the latter of whom became a clockmaker to [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]]. The best known of Gretton\u2019s apprentices was [[Henry Sully]], who after completing his apprenticeship stayed with Gretton as a [[journeyman]] for four years rather than the more customary two years. Sully then moved to France, becoming quite famous in the Continent and in Great Britain. Sully is remembered for his efforts to develop a seagoing clock for determining [[longitude]] at sea.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''.P.522 - 533, 536 - 540.</ref> Charles Gretton was a prolific maker of clocks and watches for home and abroad. ''[http://www.grettonbook.com/home Charles Gretton: Clock and Watchmaking Through The Golden Age]'', published in 2016, lists 74 extant longcase clocks, 52 spring clocks, five [[Lantern clock|lantern clocks]] and 29 [[Watch|watches]], but more have been discovered since.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 577 - 591.</ref> \n\nGretton made more watches than clocks, as did many of his contemporaries. Based on dating of his extant clocks and watches, it would seem that his workshop began producing watches in about 1673, followed by clocks in the mid-1670s. Gretton\u2019s peak production lasted about 25 years, from approximately 1685 until about 1710, when his output dropped significantly.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 541</ref> He continued to make at least clocks until the mid-1720s, when it is believed he retired from clockmaking. However, Gretton maintained a strong relationship with the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers|Clockmakers\u2019 Company]] until the very last years of his life.\n\nGretton's earliest known extant watch dates to before 1675 and is on display at the [[British Museum]], London. The watch has crystals on both front and back, the back revealing the gilt brass top plate, which includes a subsidiary seconds dial, even though this is a pre-balance spring watch. Because of its complexity, this certainly would not have been Gretton's first watch.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 419, 443 - 447.</ref> Gretton produced [https://www.lexico.com/definition/timepiece timepieces], [[mwod:clock watch|clock watches]], alarm watches, several forms of repeating watches (i.e., which contained [[Repeater (horology)|repeaters]]), and [[polychrome]] decorated watches with [https://anordain.com/blogs/news/this-is-everything-you-need-to-know-about-enamel-dials-part-1 enamel dials] and [[porcelain]] boxes. Many of the extant watches retain their boxes and cases; some of the makers of these items can be identified.\n\nGretton clocks were always of the highest quality, comparable to those of London's best makers. His early [[Grandfather clock|longcase clocks]] were housed in walnut cases. Later, the cases had [[parquetry]] decoration, followed by floral [[marquetry]], arabesque and then seaweed marquetry, [[ebony]]-veneered cases, and [[lacquer]]-decorated cases. He returned to walnut for his late longcase clocks.\n\nMost of Gretton\u2019s longcase movements had countwheel-[[Striking clock|striking]] control, although some had rack striking and quarter striking. Many early clocks had bolt-and-shutter [[maintaining power]].\n\nGretton's spring clocks were usually in an ebony-veneered or ebonized case with little or no decoration, other than the carrying handle. Gretton was, however, an early user of gilt basket-top cases. Most clocks originally stood on ebonized pad feet. Some peak-period spring clocks could be housed in a marquetry or [[Kingwood (wood)|kingwood]] case.\n\nAlmost all spring clocks employed rack striking. Gretton was an early adopter, if not the originator, of a strike/silent mechanism. Clocks employing this mechanism, but signed by at least one other maker (Hessenius), certainly originated from Gretton's workshop.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 279 - 281.</ref> \n\nGretton was also an early adopter of mechanisms for silent-pull timepieces, several forms of which are known. Most Gretton spring clocks after about 1685 have a pull quarter repeat mechanism; several complex forms of this have been documented.<ref>Radage, Dennis, Meinen, Warner, and Radage, Laila. (2016). ''Charles Gretton: Clock & Watchmaking Through The Golden Age''. P. 270 - 278.</ref>\n\n== The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers ==\nGretton was very active in the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]]. He became a steward in 1684 and a warden in 1688, and he was elected Master of the Company in 1700.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 30 September 1700, MS2710/3.</ref>  Gretton continued his commitment to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company until his late years, when ill health likely prevented his direct participation. The Clockmakers\u2019 Company Court appointed Gretton to represent the Company as a proprietor with the [[Bank of England]] in 1714, and he held this position for several years.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 5 April 1714, MS2701/3.</ref>\n\n== Philanthropic Activities ==\nCharles Gretton became very successful in business and had the means to acquire wealth and a number of urban and rural properties. He had a keen interest in philanthropy, particularly relating to education. In 1701, he donated \u00a350 to the Clockmakers\u2019 Company to fund apprenticeships for orphaned sons of clockmakers.<ref>The Worshipful Company of Clockmakers: Court Minutes, 1 September 1701, MS2710/3.</ref> In 1704, the first boy started his apprenticeship with the help of this fund.

He also was a Common Councilman for the Ward of [[Farringdon Without]], representing the [[parish]] of St Dunstan-in-the-West for many years.\n\nHe served as a tax commissioner, and at times as an adjuster, for [[Ludgate]] and for both precincts of the parish of [[St Martin, Ludgate]].\n\n== Marriages ==\nCharles Gretton and Mary (n\u00e9e Phillips) married in 1678. They had ten children, only three of whom survived into adulthood. Mary Gretton died in December 1698, as did two of the children.\n\nTheir son Phillips attended [[St Paul's School, London|St Paul\u2019s School]], London, and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], attaining his [[Doctor of Divinity]] degree at the latter.<ref>The Admission Registers of St Paul's School from 1748 to 1876, edited by Robert Gardiner.

It is dedicated to [[Dunstan]], Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is of medieval origin, although the present building, with an octagonal nave, was constructed in the 1830s to the designs of John Shaw.\n\n==History==\n\n===Medieval church===\n[[File:ONL (1887) 1.133 - Old St Dunstan&#039;s Church, 1814.jpg|thumb|Old St Dunstan&#039;s Church, 1814 with the clock prominent on the left]]\nFirst founded between AD 988 and 1070, there is a possibility that a church on this site was one of the ''[[Lundenwic]]'' strand settlement churches, like [[St Martin in the Fields]], the first [[St Mary le Strand]], [[St Clement Danes]] and [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's]], which  may pre-date any within the walls of the city. It is not known exactly when the original church was built, but it was possibly erected by [[Dunstan]] himself, or priests who knew him well. It was first mentioned in written records in 1185.<ref>''The London Encyclopaedia'', C. Hibbert, D. Weinreb, J. Keay: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993, 2008) {{ISBN|978-1-4050-4924-5}}</ref> [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] gained possession of it and its endowments from [[Westminster Abbey]] by 1237 and then granted these and the advowson to the ''[[Domus Conversorum]]'' ('House of the Converts' i.e. of converted [[Jews]]), which led to neglect of its parochial responsibilities.\n\n[[William Tyndale]], the celebrated translator of the [[Bible]], was a [[lecturer]] at the church and sermons were given by the poet [[John Donne]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] mentions the church in his diary.<ref>''The City of London Churches'', [[John Betjeman|Betjeman,J]] Andover, Pikin, 1967 {{ISBN|0-85372-112-2}}</ref> The church narrowly escaped the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.  The [[Dean of Westminster]] roused 40 scholars from [[Westminster School]] in the middle of the night, who formed a fire brigade which extinguished the flames with buckets of water to only three doors away.\n\nThe medieval church underwent many alterations before its demolition in the early 19th century. Small shops were built against its walls, St Dunstan's Churchyard becoming a centre for bookselling and publishing.<ref name=Godwin/> Later repairs were carried out in an Italianate style: rusticated stonework was used, and some of the Gothic windows were replaced with round headed ones, resulting in what George Godwin called \"a most heterogeneous appearance\".<ref name=Godwin/> In 1701 the church's old vaulted roof was replaced with a flat ceiling, ornamented with recessed panels.<ref name=Godwin/>\n\nThe [[Worshipful Company of Cordwainers]] has been associated with the church since the 15th century. The company holds an annual service of commemoration to honour two of its benefactors, John Fisher and Richard Minge, after which children were traditionally given a penny for each time they ran around the church.\n\n===Rebuilding===\n[[File:London st dunstan in the west 09.03.2013 14-53-51.jpg|thumb|St Dunstan-in-the-West (2013)]]\nIn the early 19th century the medieval church of St Dunstan was removed to allow the widening of [[Fleet Street]] and a new church was built on its burial ground.  An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained authorising the demolition of the church in July 1829 and trustees were appointed to carry it into effect.<ref>\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p123:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917</ref>  In December 1829 and September 1830 there were auctions of some of the materials of the old church.  The first stone of the new building, to the design of [[John Shaw, Sr.]] (1776\u20131832), was laid in July 1831 and construction proceeded rapidly.  In August 1832 the last part of the old church, which had been left as a screen between Fleet Street and the new work, was removed.<ref name =Godwin/>\n\nShaw dealt with the restricted site by designing a church with an octagonal central space.  Seven of the eight sides open into arched recesses, the northern one containing the altar.  The eighth side opens into a short corridor, leading beneath the organ to the lowest stage of the tower, which serves as an entrance porch.  Above the recesses Shaw designed a [[clerestory]], and above that a groined ceiling.  The tower is square in plan, with an octagonal lantern, resembling those of [[St Botolph's Church, Boston]], and [[St Helen's Church, Stonegate, York|St Helen's, York]]. [[George Godwin]] suggested that the form of the lantern might have been immediately inspired by that of St George's church in [[Ramsgate]] (where Shaw was architect to the docks), built in 1825 to the designs of H. E. Kendall.<ref name =Godwin>{{cite book |title=The Churches of London |last= Godwin|first= George|authorlink=  |author2=John Britton  |year=1829 |publisher= |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> John Shaw Sr. died in 1833, before the church was completed, leaving it in the hands of his son [[John Shaw Jr.]] (1803\u20131870).\n[[File:St Dunstan-in-the-West Interior, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of St Dunstan-in-the-West]]\n\nThe [[communion rail]] is a survivor of the old church, having been carved by [[Grinling Gibbons]] during the period when [[John Donne]] served as vicar (1624\u20131631).  Some of the monuments from the medieval building were reinstituted in the new church and a fragment of the old churchyard remains between [[Clifford's Inn]] and [[Fetter Lane|Bream's Buildings]].<ref>''London: the City Churches'', N.

An appeal to raise money to install a new ring of bells in the tower, replacing those removed in 1969, was successfully completed in 2012 with the dedication and hanging of 10 new bells.<ref>[http://www.london.anglican.org/NewsShow_16100 Diocese of London]</ref>\n\nThe church was designated a Grade I [[listed building]] on 4 January 1950.<ref>{{NHLE |num=1064663 |accessdate=23 January 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Clock==\n[[File:City of London, St. Dunstan-in-the-West clock - geograph.org.uk - 865114.jpg|thumb|The clock, dating from 1671]]\nOn the fa\u00e7ade is a chiming clock, with figures of giants, perhaps representing [[Gog and Magog]], who strike the bells with their clubs.  It was installed on the previous church in 1671, perhaps commissioned to celebrate its escape from destruction by the [[Great Fire of 1666]].  It was the first public clock in London to have a minute hand. The figures of the two giants strike the hours and quarters, and turn their heads.  There are numerous literary references to the clock, including in [[Thomas Hughes]]' ''[[Tom Brown's Schooldays]]'', [[Oliver Goldsmith]]\u2019s ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'', both ''[[David Copperfield (novel)|David Copperfield]]'' and ''[[Barnaby Rudge]]'' by [[Charles Dickens]], ''[[The Warden]]'' by [[Anthony Trollope]], the [[penny dreadful]] serial ''[[The String of Pearls]]'' (in which the character [[Sweeney Todd]] first appears), David Lyddal's ''The Prompter'' (1810)<ref>Lyddal, David. \u201cThe Prompter, or Cursory Hints to Young Actors: A Didactic Poem. 1810\u201d in Acting Theory and the English Stage, 1700\u20131830.

During [[World War I]], a hostel for blinded soldiers was lent the house, and the new charity took the name [[Blind Veterans UK|St Dunstan's]].<ref>[http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk/ www.st-dunstans.org.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722101318/http://www.st-dunstans.org.uk/ |date=2009-07-22 }}</ref>\n\nThe clock was returned by [[Harold Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Rothermere]] (the brother of [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe]]) in 1935 to mark the [[Silver Jubilee]] of [[King George V]].\n\n==Statues and monuments==\n[[File:Monument to Northcliffe - geograph.org.uk - 1222895.jpg|thumb|Monument to Northcliffe]]\nAbove the entrance to the old [[parochial school]] is a statue of [[Queen Elizabeth I]], taken from the old [[Ludgate]], which was demolished in 1760.  This statue, by William Kerwin and  dating from 1586, is contemporaneous with its subject and thought to be the oldest outdoor statue in London.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}  In the porch below are three statues of [[ancient Britons]] also from the gate, probably meant to represent [[King Lud]] and his two sons.\n\nAdjacent to Queen Elizabeth is a memorial to [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], the newspaper proprietor, co-founder of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and the ''Daily Mirror''. Unveiled in 1930, the obelisk was designed by [[Edwin Lutyens]] and the bronze bust is by [[Kathleen Scott]]. Next to Lord Northcliffe is a memorial tablet to [[James Louis Garvin]], another pioneering British journalist.\n\nClose to the font, there is bronze memorial plaque for [[Thomas Mudge (horologist)|Thomas Mudge]] (1715/16-1794), inventor of the [[lever escapement]] and watchmaker to [[George III]]. The tablet was made and engraved by noted sundial maker, hand-engraver and sculptor Joanna Midgal. It was commissioned by the [[Worshipful Company of Clockmakers]], and installed in March 2019.\n\nBehind the iconostasis to the left side of the church, high on a wall, there is a marble memorial tablet to the highly-regarded seventeenth century clockmaker Henry Jones (1634-1695) who worked in the [[Inner Temple]], and his wife Hannah, who continued their business after his death.

It is dedicated to [[Dunstan]], Bishop of London and Archbishop of Canterbury. The church is of medieval origin, although the present building, with an octagonal nave, was constructed in the 1830s to the designs of John Shaw.\n\n==History==\n\n===Medieval church===\n[[File:ONL (1887) 1.133 - Old St Dunstan&#039;s Church, 1814.jpg|thumb|Old St Dunstan&#039;s Church, 1814 with the clock prominent on the left]]\nFirst founded between AD 988 and 1070, there is a possibility that a church on this site was one of the ''[[Lundenwic]]'' strand settlement churches, like [[St Martin in the Fields]], the first [[St Mary le Strand]], [[St Clement Danes]] and [[St Bride's Church|St Bride's]], which  may pre-date any within the walls of the city. It is not known exactly when the original church was built, but it was possibly erected by [[Dunstan]] himself, or priests who knew him well. It was first mentioned in written records in 1185.<ref>''The London Encyclopaedia'', C. Hibbert, D. Weinreb, J. Keay: London, Pan Macmillan, 1983 (rev 1993, 2008) {{ISBN|978-1-4050-4924-5}}</ref> [[Henry III of England|King Henry III]] gained possession of it and its endowments from [[Westminster Abbey]] by 1237 and then granted these and the advowson to the ''[[Domus Conversorum]]'' ('House of the Converts' i.e. of converted [[Jews]]), which led to neglect of its parochial responsibilities.\n\n[[William Tyndale]], the celebrated translator of the [[Bible]], was a [[lecturer]] at the church and sermons were given by the poet [[John Donne]]. [[Samuel Pepys]] mentions the church in his diary.<ref>''The City of London Churches'', [[John Betjeman|Betjeman,J]] Andover, Pikin, 1967 {{ISBN|0-85372-112-2}}</ref> The church narrowly escaped the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.  The [[Dean of Westminster]] roused 40 scholars from [[Westminster School]] in the middle of the night, who formed a fire brigade which extinguished the flames with buckets of water to only three doors away.\n\nThe medieval church underwent many alterations before its demolition in the early 19th century. Small shops were built against its walls, St Dunstan's Churchyard becoming a centre for bookselling and publishing.<ref name=Godwin/> Later repairs were carried out in an Italianate style: rusticated stonework was used, and some of the Gothic windows were replaced with round headed ones, resulting in what George Godwin called \"a most heterogeneous appearance\".<ref name=Godwin/> In 1701 the church's old vaulted roof was replaced with a flat ceiling, ornamented with recessed panels.<ref name=Godwin/>\n\nThe [[Worshipful Company of Cordwainers]] has been associated with the church since the 15th century. The company holds an annual service of commemoration to honour two of its benefactors, John Fisher and Richard Minge, after which children were traditionally given a penny for each time they ran around the church.\n\n===Rebuilding===\n[[File:London st dunstan in the west 09.03.2013 14-53-51.jpg|thumb|St Dunstan-in-the-West (2013)]]\nIn the early 19th century the medieval church of St Dunstan was removed to allow the widening of [[Fleet Street]] and a new church was built on its burial ground.  An [[Act of Parliament]] was obtained authorising the demolition of the church in July 1829 and trustees were appointed to carry it into effect.<ref>\"The City Churches\" Tabor, M. p123:London; The Swarthmore Press Ltd; 1917</ref>  In December 1829 and September 1830 there were auctions of some of the materials of the old church.  The first stone of the new building, to the design of [[John Shaw, Sr.]] (1776\u20131832), was laid in July 1831 and construction proceeded rapidly.  In August 1832 the last part of the old church, which had been left as a screen between Fleet Street and the new work, was removed.<ref name =Godwin/>\n\nShaw dealt with the restricted site by designing a church with an octagonal central space.  Seven of the eight sides open into arched recesses, the northern one containing the altar.  The eighth side opens into a short corridor, leading beneath the organ to the lowest stage of the tower, which serves as an entrance porch.  Above the recesses Shaw designed a [[clerestory]], and above that a groined ceiling.  The tower is square in plan, with an octagonal lantern, resembling those of [[St Botolph's Church, Boston]], and [[St Helen's Church, Stonegate, York|St Helen's, York]]. [[George Godwin]] suggested that the form of the lantern might have been immediately inspired by that of St George's church in [[Ramsgate]] (where Shaw was architect to the docks), built in 1825 to the designs of H. E. Kendall.<ref name =Godwin>{{cite book |title=The Churches of London |last= Godwin|first= George|authorlink=  |author2=John Britton  |year=1829 |publisher= |location=London |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}</ref> John Shaw Sr. died in 1833, before the church was completed, leaving it in the hands of his son [[John Shaw Jr.]] (1803\u20131870).\n[[File:St Dunstan-in-the-West Interior, London, UK - Diliff.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of St Dunstan-in-the-West]]\n\nThe [[communion rail]] is a survivor of the old church, having been carved by [[Grinling Gibbons]] during the period when [[John Donne]] served as vicar (1624\u20131631).

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the Ducktown Basin Museum chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level.

The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.<ref name=ross95/>\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]].

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the nearby landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987.
