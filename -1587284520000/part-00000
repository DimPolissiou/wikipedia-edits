First of all, their reduced squad meant that they omitted Gilberto Quinteros and Miguel Gonz\u00e1lez. According to [[Luis Guevara Mora]], the 20-year-old goalkeeper, the [[Salvadoran Football Federation]] decided to take members of the Federation, as well as their friends and family, and spent so much money they could not afford to bring a full squad.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} The team took many stops throughout Europe under the direction of the Federation, taking three days to arrive in Spain and were the last team to do so. Once they arrived, there was more trouble. [[Adidas]] sent four white and three blue uniforms for each player, but only three white and one blue arrived. The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek. When Guevara Mora called to him to stop a ball, the defender did not hear him, and the ball went past Jovel in front of the net.{{cn|date=April 2020}} After the match, the Salvadoran squad had a tense meeting with the coaching staff and Federation.

The remaining uniforms were said to have been taken away by the association.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} They decided to play with the white uniform and keep the blue as a keepsake. Next, someone stole the balls that the team needed to train with. The day before the match against Hungary, the Hungarians had the 25 balls the organization had given them while El Salvador had none and were unable to train.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} To make things even worse, El Salvador had never seen Hungary play, and the only knowledge that they had about the team was an outdated video that they had bought.{{cn|date=April 2020}} On the field there were more problems. Hungary's fourth goal was caused by [[Jos\u00e9 Francisco Jovel|Francisco Jovel]]'s sudden deafness after he had received a heavy blow on the cheek.
