Serbian is written in two alphabets, the [[Serbian Cyrillic]], a variation of [[Cyrillic alphabet]], and [[Gaj's Latin]], a variation of the [[Latin alphabet]]. Serbian language is an example of [[digraphia]].\n[[File: Scripts in Europe (1901).jpg|thumb|250px|Main alphabets used in Europe around 1900:\n\n{{legend|#84CFEE|outline=#ccc|[[Latin script]]: [[Fraktur (script)|Fraktur]] variant}}\n{{legend|#F8D2D1|outline=#ccc|Latin script: [[Antiqua (typeface class)|Antiqua]] variant}}\n{{legend|#DAF6D0|outline=#ccc|[[Cyrillic script]]}}\n{{legend|#D4CAA7|outline=#ccc|[[Greek alphabet]]}}\n{{legend|#FEFF88|outline=#ccc|[[Arabic script]]}}\n{{legend|#ffffff|outline=#ccc|[[Clear script|Kalmyk]]\u2013[[Mongolian script|Mongolian]] script}}\n]]\n\n[[Gaj's Latin alphabet]] is widely used in Serbia. The two are almost directly and completely interchangeable. Romanization can be done with no errors, but in some cases knowledge of Serbian is required to do proper transliteration from Latin back to Cyrillic. Standard Serbian uses both alphabets currently. A survey from 2014 showed that 47% of the Serbian population favors the Latin alphabet whereas 36% favors the Cyrillic one.<ref>http://www.b92.net/kultura/vesti.php?nav_category=1087&yyyy=2014&mm=12&dd=16&nav_id=936784</ref>\n\nApart from Serbian, Gaj's Latin alphabet is also used in [[Bosnian language|\nBosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] standards of [[Serbo-Croatian]].

The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, after which the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]\n{{Securities}}\nIn finance, being '''short''' in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of a more conventional \"long\" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises.\n\nThere are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most fundamental method is so-called \"physical\" short-selling, which involves borrowing assets (often [[Security (finance)|securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) and selling them. The investor will later purchase the same number of type of securities in order to return them to the lender. If the price has fallen between the time of the initial sale and the time the equivalent securities are repurchased, the investor will have made a profit equal to the difference. Conversely, if the price has risen then the investor will bear a loss. The short seller must usually pay a fee to borrow the securities (charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment), and reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out, such as any dividends that would have been payable to the lender if they were still the holder of shares that they had lent out.\n\nShort positions can also be achieved through [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]] or [[Option (finance)|options]], where the investor can assume an obligation or a right to sell an asset at a future date at a price that is fixed at the time the contract is created. If the price of the asset falls below the agreed price, then the asset can be bought at the lower price before immediately before being sold at the higher price specified in the forward or option contract. A short position can also be achieved through certain types of [[Swap (finance)|swap]], such as [[Contract for difference|contracts for differences]]. These are agreements between two parties to pay each other the difference if the price of an asset rises or falls, under which the party that will benefit if the price falls will have a short position.\n\nBecause a short seller can incur a liability to the lender if the price rises, and because it normally does the short sale through a broker, a short seller is typically required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] to its broker as collateral to ensure that any such liabilities can be met, and to post additional margin if losses begin to accrue. For analogous reasons, short positions in derivatives also usually involve the posting of margin with the [[counterparty]]. Any failure to post margin promptly would prompt the broker or counterparty to close the position.\n\nShort selling is nearly always undertaken only in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]] that are [[Fungibility|fungible]] and reasonably [[liquidity|liquid]].\n\nA short sale may have a variety of objectives. [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. Alternatively, traders or fund managers may use offsetting short positions to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks that exist in a long position or a portfolio.\n\nResearch indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.<ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf</ref><ref>http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf</ref><ref>http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&context=njilb</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf</ref> Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.<ref>http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n{{Finance sidebar}}\nThe following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term \"borrowing\" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a bicycle, where the same bicycle must be returned, not merely one that is the same model).\n\nA short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.<ref name=\"langasset\">{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling \u2013 A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.\n\nThe act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called \"covering the short\" or \"covering the position\". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.\n\n\"Shorting\" or \"going short\" (and sometimes also \"short selling\") also refer more broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. Derivatives contracts that can be used in this way include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].<ref name=Harris>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195144703 |page=41}}</ref><ref name=Chance>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.\n\nThe vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.\n\nBrokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)\n\nMost brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the \"locate\" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.\n\nStock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the \"short interest\" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e., despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.\n\n=== Securities lending ===\n{{Main|Securities lending}}\n\nWhen a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].\n\n=== Sources of short interest data ===\nTime delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.<ref>NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].</ref>\n\nSome market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems<ref>SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.</ref>) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.<ref>SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.</ref>\n\n=== Short selling terms ===\n'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10&nbsp;million / 1 million).\n\n'''Short Interest''' relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10&nbsp;million / 100&nbsp;million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, \"fails\" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.\n\n'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account \u2013 in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become \"hard to borrow\" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant \u2013 in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.<ref name=\"marketForborrowing\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) \u2013 for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.<ref name=\"hardToBorrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Major lenders ====\n* [[State Street Corporation]] (Boston, United States)\n* [[Merrill Lynch]] (New Jersey, United States)\n* [[JP Morgan Chase]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Northern Trust]] (Chicago, United States)\n* [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, now defunct)\n* [[ABN AMRO]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, formerly Fortis)\n* [[Citibank]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] Corporation (New York, United States)\n* [[UBS AG]] (Zurich, Switzerland)\n* [[Barclays]] (London, United Kingdom)\n\n===Naked short selling===\n{{Main|Naked short selling}}\nA naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.) This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.\n\nWhen the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.\n\nNaked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a \"failure to deliver\" or simply \"fail.\"  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.\n\nIn the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.\n\n== Fees ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nWhen a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.\n\nIf the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.\n\nWhen a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.\n\nFor some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.\n\n== Dividends and voting rights ==\nWhere shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate\u2014though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.\n\nA similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Markets ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Futures and options contracts ===\nWhen trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.\n\nAn investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or \"strike\") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.\n\n=== Currency ===\nSelling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.\n\nNovice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a contract is always long in terms of one medium and short another.\n\nWhen the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.\n\nAn example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the US dollar and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs. 50 and the trader borrows Rs. 100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs. 51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs. 102.  He returns Rs. 100 and keeps the Rs. 2 profit (minus fees).\n\nOne may also take a short position in a currency using [[Currency future|futures]] or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.\n\n== Risks ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''\n\nShort selling is sometimes referred to as a \"negative income investment strategy\" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called \"going long\") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a \"long's\" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.\n\nMany short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short\u2014an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.\n\nShort sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[Margin calls|margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the \"short interest\" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.\n\nAnother risk is that a given stock may become \"hard to borrow.\" As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time (\"buy in\").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is \"failing to deliver\" stock, which leads to the buy-in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: \"He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n.\" To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nShort sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&pg=PP7#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J.

The farmer would take a short position in wheat futures.\n* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.\n* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that they are not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie their options\n\n=== Arbitrage ===\n{{Further|Arbitrage}}\nA short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are\n* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].\n\n=== Against the box ===\nOne variant of selling short involves a long position. \"Selling short against the box\" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.\n\nU.S. investors considering entering into a \"short against the box\" transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction.  Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a \"short against the box\" position to be a \"constructive sale\" of the long position, which is a taxable event.  These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e8793 |title=United States IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Regulations==\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] gave the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the power to regulate short sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |year=1934 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}</ref> The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the [[uptick rule]] that dictated that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price.

The short seller [[securities lending|borrows shares]] and immediately sells them. The short seller then expects the price to decrease, after which the seller can profit by purchasing the shares to return to the lender.]]\n{{Securities}}\nIn finance, being '''short''' in an asset means investing in such a way that the investor will profit if the value of the asset falls. This is the opposite of a more conventional \"long\" position, where the investor will profit if the value of the asset rises.\n\nThere are a number of ways of achieving a short position. The most fundamental method is so-called \"physical\" short-selling, which involves borrowing assets (often [[Security (finance)|securities]] such as [[Share (finance)|shares]] or [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]) and selling them. The investor will later purchase the same number of type of securities in order to return them to the lender. If the price has fallen between the time of the initial sale and the time the equivalent securities are repurchased, the investor will have made a profit equal to the difference. Conversely, if the price has risen then the investor will bear a loss. The short seller must usually pay a fee to borrow the securities (charged at a particular rate over time, similar to an interest payment), and reimburse the lender for cash returns the lender would have received had the securities not been loaned out, such as any dividends that would have been payable to the lender if they were still the holder of shares that they had lent out.\n\nShort positions can also be achieved through [[Futures contract|futures]], [[Forward contract|forwards]] or [[Option (finance)|options]], where the investor can assume an obligation or a right to sell an asset at a future date at a price that is fixed at the time the contract is created. If the price of the asset falls below the agreed price, then the asset can be bought at the lower price before immediately before being sold at the higher price specified in the forward or option contract. A short position can also be achieved through certain types of [[Swap (finance)|swap]], such as [[Contract for difference|contracts for differences]]. These are agreements between two parties to pay each other the difference if the price of an asset rises or falls, under which the party that will benefit if the price falls will have a short position.\n\nBecause a short seller can incur a liability to to the lender if the price rises, and because it normally does the short sale through a broker, a short seller is typically required to post [[Margin (finance)|margin]] to its broker as collateral to ensure that any such liabilities can be met, and to post additional margin if losses begin to accrue. For analogous reasons, short positions in derivatives also usually involve the posting of margin with the [[counterparty]]. Any failure to post margin promptly would prompt the broker or counterparty to close the position.\n\nShort selling is nearly always undertaken only in [[Financial market|public securities, futures or currency markets]] that are [[Fungibility|fungible]] and reasonably [[liquidity|liquid]].\n\nA short sale may have a variety of objectives. [[speculation|Speculators]] may sell short hoping to realize a profit on an instrument that appears overvalued, just as [[long (finance)|long]] investors or speculators hope to profit from a rise in the price of an instrument that appears undervalued. Alternatively, traders or fund managers may use offsetting short positions to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] certain risks that exist in a long position or a portfolio.\n\nResearch indicates that banning short selling is ineffective and has negative effects on markets.<ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/staff_reports/sr518.pdf</ref><ref>http://people.stern.nyu.edu/mbrenner/research/short_selling.pdf</ref><ref>http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1704&context=njilb</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=5 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722034426/http://www.imd.org/news/upload/Report.pdf |archive-date=22 July 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/research/current_issues/ci18-5.pdf</ref> Nevertheless short selling is subject to criticism and periodically faces hostility from society and policymakers.<ref>http://www.nber.org/reporter/winter05/lamont.html</ref>\n\n== Concept ==\n{{Finance sidebar}}\nThe following example describes the short sale of a security. To profit from a decrease in the price of a security, a short seller can [[Securities lending|borrow the security]] and sell it, expecting that it will be cheaper to repurchase in the future. When the seller decides that the time is right (or when the lender recalls the securities), the seller buys equivalent securities and returns them to the lender. The process relies on the fact that the securities (or the other assets being sold short) are [[Fungibility|fungible]]; the term \"borrowing\" is therefore used in the sense of borrowing cash, where different bank notes or coins can be returned to the lender (as opposed to borrowing a bicycle, where the same bicycle must be returned, not merely one that is the same model).\n\nA short seller typically borrows through a [[brokerage firm|broker]], who is usually holding the securities for another investor who owns the securities; the broker himself seldom purchases the securities to lend to the short seller.<ref name=\"langasset\">{{cite web|url=http://langasset.com/ishort.htm |title=Understanding Short Selling \u2013 A Primer |publisher=Langasset.com |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref> The lender does not lose the right to sell the securities while they have been lent, as the broker usually holds a large pool of such securities for a number of investors which, as such securities are fungible, can instead be transferred to any buyer. In most market conditions there is a ready supply of securities to be borrowed, held by pension funds, mutual funds and other investors.\n\nThe act of buying back the securities that were sold short is called \"covering the short\" or \"covering the position\". A short position can be covered at any time before the securities are due to be returned. Once the position is covered, the short seller is not affected by subsequent rises or falls in the price of the securities, as he already holds the securities required to repay the lender.\n\n\"Shorting\" or \"going short\" (and sometimes also \"short selling\") also refer more broadly to any transaction used by an investor to profit from the decline in price of a borrowed asset or financial instrument. Derivatives contracts that can be used in this way include [[Futures contract|futures]], [[option (finance)|options]], and [[swap (finance)|swaps]].<ref name=Harris>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd9hDRR1Yx4C&pg=PA41 |author=Larry Harris |title=Trading and Exchange: Market Microstructure for Practitioners |year=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0195144703 |page=41}}</ref><ref name=Chance>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DT0nnLDMYTgC&pg=PA6 |authors=Don M.

This is referred to as a ''[[Locate (finance)|locate]].''  Brokers have a variety of means to borrow stocks to facilitate locates and make good on delivery of the shorted security.\n\nThe vast majority of stocks borrowed by U.S. brokers come from loans made by the leading custody banks and fund management companies (see list below). Institutions often lend out their shares to earn extra money on their investments. These institutional loans are usually arranged by the custodian who holds the securities for the institution.  In an institutional stock loan, the borrower puts up cash collateral, typically 102% of the value of the stock.  The cash collateral is then invested by the lender, who often rebates part of the interest to the borrower. The interest that is kept by the lender is the compensation to the lender for the stock loan.\n\nBrokerage firms can also borrow stocks from the accounts of their own customers.  Typical margin account agreements give brokerage firms the right to borrow customer shares without notifying the customer.  In general, brokerage accounts are only allowed to lend shares from accounts for which customers have ''debit balances'', meaning they have borrowed from the account. SEC Rule 15c3-3 imposes such severe restrictions on the lending of shares from cash accounts or excess margin (fully paid for) shares from margin accounts that most brokerage firms do not bother except in rare circumstances. (These restrictions include that the broker must have the express permission of the customer and provide collateral or a letter of credit.)\n\nMost brokers allow retail customers to borrow shares to short a stock only if one of their own customers has purchased the stock on [[Margin (finance)|margin]].  Brokers go through the \"locate\" process outside their own firm to obtain borrowed shares from other brokers only for their large institutional customers.\n\nStock exchanges such as the [[NYSE]] or the [[NASDAQ]] typically report the \"short interest\" of a stock, which gives the number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short as a percent of the total [[Float (finance)|float]].  Alternatively, these can also be expressed as the [[short interest ratio]], which is the number of shares ''legally'' sold short as a multiple of the average daily volume.  These can be useful tools to spot trends in stock price movements but for them to be reliable, investors must also ascertain the number of shares brought into existence by naked shorters.  Speculators are cautioned to remember that for every share that has been shorted (owned by a new owner), a 'shadow owner' exists (i.e., the original owner) who also is part of the universe of owners of that stock, i.e., despite having no voting rights, he has not relinquished his interest and some rights in that stock.\n\n=== Securities lending ===\n{{Main|Securities lending}}\n\nWhen a security is sold, the seller is contractually obliged to deliver it to the buyer. If a seller sells a security short without owning it first, the seller must borrow the security from a third party to fulfill its obligation. Otherwise, the seller ''fails to deliver,'' the transaction does not [[settlement (finance)|settle]], and the seller may be subject to a claim from its [[counterparty]]. Certain large holders of securities, such as a [[custodian bank|custodian]] or [[investment management]] firm, often lend out these securities to gain extra income, a process known as [[securities lending]]. The lender receives a fee for this service. Similarly, retail investors can sometimes make an extra fee when their broker wants to borrow their securities. This is only possible when the investor has full [[title (property)|title]] of the security, so it cannot be used as collateral for [[margin buying]].\n\n=== Sources of short interest data ===\nTime delayed short interest data (for ''legally'' shorted shares) is available in a number of countries, including the US, the UK, Hong Kong, and Spain. The number of stocks being shorted on a global basis has increased in recent years for various structural reasons (e.g., the growth of [[130/30]] type strategies, short or bear ETFs). The data is typically delayed; for example, the NASDAQ requires its [[broker-dealer]] member firms to report data on the 15th of each month, and then publishes a compilation eight days later.<ref>NASDAQ. [http://www.nasdaq.com/quotes/short-interest.aspx About the Short Interest Page].</ref>\n\nSome market data providers (like [[Data Explorers]] and SunGard Financial Systems<ref>SunGard's [http://www.sungard.com/financialsystems/products/shortsidecom.aspx ShortSide.com] discusses the product.</ref>) believe that stock lending data provides a good proxy for short interest levels (excluding any naked short interest). SunGard provides daily data on short interest by tracking the proxy variables based on borrowing and lending data it collects.<ref>SunGard. [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SunGard+Launches+Borrow+Indices%3B+First+Proxy+for+Measuring+Short...-a0123159715 SunGard Launches Borrow Indices; First Proxy for Measuring Short Interest on a Daily Basis]. Business Wire.</ref>\n\n=== Short selling terms ===\n'''Days to Cover (DTC)''' is the relationship between the number of shares in a given equity that has been ''legally'' short-sold and the number of days of typical trading that it would require to 'cover' all legal short positions outstanding.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short-sold and the average daily volume of XYZ shares traded each day is one million, it would require ten days of trading for all legal short positions to be covered (10&nbsp;million / 1 million).\n\n'''Short Interest''' relates the number of shares in a given equity that have been legally shorted divided by the total shares outstanding for the company, usually expressed as a percent.  For example, if there are ten million shares of XYZ Inc. that are currently legally short sold, and the total number of shares issued by the company is one hundred million, the Short Interest is 10% (10&nbsp;million / 100&nbsp;million).  If however, shares are being created through naked short selling, \"fails\" data must be accessed to assess accurately the true level of short interest.\n\n'''Borrow cost''' is the fee paid to a securities lender for borrowing the stock or other security. The cost of borrowing the stock is usually negligible compared to fees paid and interest accrued on the margin account \u2013 in 2002, 91% of stocks could be shorted for less than a 1% fee per annum, generally lower than interest rates earned on the margin account. However, certain stocks become \"hard to borrow\" as stockholders willing to lend their stock become more difficult to locate. The cost of borrowing these stocks can become significant \u2013 in February 2001, the cost to borrow (short) [[Krispy Kreme]] stock reached an annualized 55%, indicating that a short seller would need to pay the lender more than half the price of the stock over the course of the year, essentially as interest for borrowing a stock in limited supply.<ref name=\"marketForborrowing\">{{cite web|url=http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/john.Cochrane/teaching/35150_advanced_investments/davolio_borrowing_stock_JF.pdf|title=The market for borrowing stock|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref> This has important implications for derivatives pricing and strategy, as the borrow cost itself can become a significant [[convenience yield]] for holding the stock (similar to additional [[dividend]]) \u2013 for instance, [[put-call parity]] relationships are broken and the [[Exercise (options)|early exercise]] feature of American call options on non-dividend paying stocks can become [[Exercise (options)#Exercise Considerations|rational to exercise early]], which otherwise would not be economical.<ref name=\"hardToBorrow\">{{cite web|url=http://www.math.nyu.edu/faculty/avellane/Lecture13Quant.pdf|title=Lecture 13: Hard to Borrow Securities|accessdate=25 December 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Major lenders ====\n* [[State Street Corporation]] (Boston, United States)\n* [[Merrill Lynch]] (New Jersey, United States)\n* [[JP Morgan Chase]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Northern Trust]] (Chicago, United States)\n* [[Fortis (finance)|Fortis]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, now defunct)\n* [[ABN AMRO]] (Amsterdam, Netherlands, formerly Fortis)\n* [[Citibank]] (New York, United States)\n* [[Bank of New York Mellon]] Corporation (New York, United States)\n* [[UBS AG]] (Zurich, Switzerland)\n* [[Barclays]] (London, United Kingdom)\n\n===Naked short selling===\n{{Main|Naked short selling}}\nA naked short sale occurs when a security is sold short without borrowing the security within a set time (for example, three days in the US.) This means that the buyer of such a short is buying the short-seller's promise to deliver a share, rather than buying the share itself. The short-seller's promise is known as a hypothecated share.\n\nWhen the holder of the underlying stock receives a dividend, the holder of the hypothecated share would receive an equal [[dividend]] from the short seller.\n\nNaked shorting has been made illegal except where allowed under limited circumstances by [[market maker]]s.  It is detected by the [[Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation]] (in the US) as a \"failure to deliver\" or simply \"fail.\"  While many fails are settled in a short time, some have been allowed to linger in the system.\n\nIn the US, arranging to borrow a security before a short sale is called a ''locate''.  In 2005, to prevent widespread failure to deliver securities, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) put in place [[Regulation SHO]], intended to prevent speculators from selling some stocks short before doing a locate.  Requirements that are more stringent were put in place in September 2008, ostensibly to prevent the practice from exacerbating market declines.  The rules were made permanent in 2009.\n\n== Fees ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\nWhen a broker facilitates the delivery of a client's short sale, the client is charged a fee for this service, usually a standard commission similar to that of purchasing a similar security.\n\nIf the short position begins to move against the holder of the short position (i.e., the price of the security begins to rise), money is removed from the holder's cash balance and moved to their [[margin balance]].  If short shares continue to rise in price, and the holder does not have sufficient funds in the cash account to cover the position, the holder begins to borrow on margin for this purpose, thereby accruing margin interest charges.  These are computed and charged just as for any other margin debit. Therefore, only margin accounts can be used to open a short position.\n\nWhen a security's [[ex-dividend date]] passes, the dividend is deducted from the shortholder's account and paid to the person from whom the stock is borrowed.\n\nFor some brokers, the short seller may not earn interest on the proceeds of the short sale or use it to reduce outstanding margin debt.  These brokers may not pass this benefit on to the retail client unless the client is very large. The interest is often split with the lender of the security.\n\n== Dividends and voting rights ==\nWhere shares have been shorted and the company that issues the shares distributes a dividend, the question arises as to who receives the dividend. The new buyer of the shares, who is the ''holder of record'' and holds the shares outright, receives the dividend from the company. However, the lender, who may hold its shares in a [[margin account]] with a [[Prime brokerage|prime broker]] and is unlikely to be aware that these particular shares are being lent out for shorting, also expects to receive a dividend.  The short seller therefore pays the lender an amount equal to the dividend to compensate\u2014though technically, as this payment does not come from the company, it is not a dividend. The short seller is therefore said to be ''short the dividend''.\n\nA similar issue comes up with the voting rights attached to the shorted shares.  Unlike a dividend, voting rights cannot legally be synthesized and so the buyer of the shorted share, as the holder of record, controls the voting rights. The owner of a margin account from which the shares were lent agreed in advance to relinquish voting rights to shares during the period of any short sale.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\nAs noted earlier, victims of naked shorting sometimes report that the number of votes cast is greater than the number of shares issued by the company.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.com/almID/1202430726911/?slreturn=20180410051827|title=Over-voting at Taser in 2005|author=Greg LandContactAll Articles|date=15 May 2009|website=|publisher=Law.com|accessdate=10 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Markets ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}\n\n=== Futures and options contracts ===\nWhen trading [[futures contract]]s, being 'short' means having the legal obligation to deliver something at the expiration of the contract, although the holder of the short position may alternately buy back the contract prior to expiration instead of making delivery.  Short futures transactions are often used by producers of a commodity to fix the future price of goods they have not yet produced.  Shorting a futures contract is sometimes also used by those holding the underlying asset (i.e. those with a long position) as a temporary hedge against price declines.  Shorting futures may also be used for speculative trades, in which case the investor is looking to profit from any decline in the price of the futures contract prior to expiration.\n\nAn investor can also purchase a put option, giving that investor the right (but not the obligation) to sell the underlying asset (such as shares of stock) at a fixed price.  In the event of a market decline, the option holder may exercise these put options, obliging the counterparty to buy the underlying asset at the agreed upon (or \"strike\") price, which would then be higher than the current quoted spot price of the asset.\n\n=== Currency ===\nSelling short on the currency markets is different from selling short on the stock markets.  Currencies are traded in pairs, each currency being priced in terms of another.  In this way, selling short on the currency markets is identical to going long on stocks.\n\nNovice traders or stock traders can be confused by the failure to recognize and understand this point: a contract is always long in terms of one medium and short another.\n\nWhen the exchange rate has changed, the trader buys the first currency again; this time he gets more of it, and pays back the loan.  Since he got more money than he had borrowed initially, he makes money.  Of course, the reverse can also occur.\n\nAn example of this is as follows: Let us say a trader wants to trade with the US dollar and the [[Indian rupee]] currencies.  Assume that the current market rate is USD 1 to Rs. 50 and the trader borrows Rs. 100.  With this, he buys USD 2.  If the next day, the conversion rate becomes USD 1 to Rs. 51, then the trader sells his USD 2 and gets Rs. 102.  He returns Rs. 100 and keeps the Rs. 2 profit (minus fees).\n\nOne may also take a short position in a currency using [[Currency future|futures]] or options; the preceding method is used to bet on the spot price, which is more directly analogous to selling a stock short.\n\n== Risks ==\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2009}}\n'''Note: this section does not apply to currency markets.'''\n\nShort selling is sometimes referred to as a \"negative income investment strategy\" because there is no potential for dividend income or interest income. Stock is held only long enough to be sold pursuant to the contract, and one's return is therefore limited to short term [[capital gain]]s, which are taxed as ordinary income. For this reason, buying shares (called \"going long\") has a very different [[risk]] profile from selling short.  Furthermore, a \"long's\" losses are limited because the price can only go down to zero, but [[Gain (accounting)|gain]]s are not, as there is no limit, in theory, on how high the price can go.  On the other hand, the short seller's possible gains are limited to the original price of the stock, which can only go down to zero, whereas the loss potential, again in theory, has no limit.  For this reason, short selling probably is most often used as a [[hedge (finance)|hedge]] strategy to manage the risks of long investments.\n\nMany short sellers place a ''[[stop order]]'' with their stockbroker after selling a stock short\u2014an order to the brokerage to cover the position if the price of the stock should rise to a certain level. This is to limit the loss and avoid the problem of unlimited liability described above.  In some cases, if the stock's price skyrockets, the stockbroker may decide to cover the short seller's position immediately and without his consent to guarantee that the short seller can make good on his debt of shares.\n\nShort sellers must be aware of the potential for a [[short squeeze]].  When the price of a stock rises significantly, some people who are shorting the stock cover their positions to limit their losses (this may occur in an automated way if the short sellers had stop-loss orders in place with their brokers); others may be forced to close their position to meet a [[Margin calls|margin call]]; others may be forced to cover, subject to the terms under which they borrowed the stock, if the person who lent the stock wishes to sell and take a profit. Since covering their positions involves buying shares, the short squeeze causes an ever further rise in the stock's price, which in turn may trigger additional covering.  Because of this, most short sellers restrict their activities to heavily traded stocks, and they keep an eye on the \"short interest\" levels of their short investments.  Short interest is defined as the total number of shares that have been ''legally'' sold short, but not covered. A short squeeze can be deliberately induced. This can happen when large investors (such as companies or wealthy individuals) notice significant short positions, and buy many shares, with the intent of selling the position at a profit to the short sellers, who may be panicked by the initial uptick or who are forced to cover their short positions to avoid margin calls.\n\nAnother risk is that a given stock may become \"hard to borrow.\" As defined by the SEC and based on lack of availability, a broker may charge a hard to borrow fee daily, without notice, for any day that the SEC declares a share is hard to borrow. Additionally, a broker may be required to cover a short seller's position at any time (\"buy in\").  The short seller receives a warning from the broker that he is \"failing to deliver\" stock, which leads to the buy-in.<ref>{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Roger |url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/862233/1/knowing-the-rules-of-the-shorting-game.html |title=Knowing the Rules of the Shorting Game |publisher=TheStreet |date=14 January 2000 |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause short sellers must eventually deliver the shorted securities to their broker, and need money to buy them, there is a credit risk for the broker. The penalties for failure to deliver on a short selling contract inspired financier [[Daniel Drew]] to warn: \"He who sells what isn't his'n, Must buy it back or go to pris'n.\" To manage its own risk, the broker requires the short seller to keep a [[margin (finance)|margin]] account, and charges interest of between 2% and 8% depending on the amounts involved.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scottrade.com/online-brokerage/interest-margin-rates.html | work=ScotTrade | title=margin account rates schedule | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, the eruption of the massive [[Securities fraud|China stock frauds]] on North American equity markets brought a related risk to light for the short seller. The efforts of research-oriented short sellers to expose these frauds eventually prompted NASDAQ, NYSE and other exchanges to impose sudden, lengthy [[trading halt]]s that froze the values of shorted stocks at artificially high values. Reportedly in some instances, brokers charged short sellers excessively large amounts of interest based on these high values as the shorts were forced to continue their borrowings at least until the halts were lifted.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111904113704576383892664177456.html?ru=yahoo&mod=yahoobarrons | work=Barrons | title=Even Short-Sellers Burned by Chinese Shares | date=18 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nShort sellers tend to temper overvaluation by selling into exuberance.  Likewise, short sellers are said to provide price support by buying when negative sentiment is exacerbated after a significant price decline.  Short selling can have negative implications if it causes a premature or unjustified share price collapse when the fear of cancellation due to bankruptcy becomes contagious.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pwXWZzxXxfwC&pg=PP7#PPA253,M1 |title=The Theory and Practice of Short Selling, Chapter 9, Conclusions and Implications for Investors by Frank J.

The farmer would take a short position in wheat futures.\n* A [[market maker]] in [[corporate bond]]s is constantly trading bonds when clients want to buy or sell.  This can create substantial bond positions.  The largest risk is that interest rates overall move.  The trader can hedge this risk by selling government bonds short against his long positions in corporate bonds.  In this way, the risk that remains is [[credit risk]] of the corporate bonds.\n* An options trader may short shares to remain [[delta neutral]] so that they are not exposed to risk from price movements in the stocks that underlie their options\n\n=== Arbitrage ===\n{{Further|Arbitrage}}\nA short seller may be trying to benefit from market inefficiencies arising from the mispricing of certain products.  Examples of this are\n* An arbitrageur who buys long futures contracts on a [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]], and sells short the underlying [[Treasury security|US Treasury security]].\n\n=== Against the box ===\nOne variant of selling short involves a long position. \"Selling short against the box\" consists of holding a long position on which the shares have already risen, whereupon one then enters a short sell order for an equal number of shares. The term ''box'' alludes to the days when a [[safe deposit box]] was used to store (long) shares.  The purpose of this technique is to lock in paper profits on the long position without having to sell that position (and possibly incur taxes if said position has appreciated). Once the short position has been entered, it serves to balance the long position taken earlier. Thus, from that point in time, the profit is locked in (less brokerage fees and short financing costs), regardless of further fluctuations in the underlying share price. For example, one can ensure a profit in this way, while delaying sale until the subsequent tax year.\n\nU.S. investors considering entering into a \"short against the box\" transaction should be aware of the tax consequences of this transaction.  Unless certain conditions are met, the IRS deems a \"short against the box\" position to be a \"constructive sale\" of the long position, which is a taxable event.  These conditions include a requirement that the short position be closed out within 30 days of the end of the year and that the investor must hold their long position, without entering into any hedging strategies, for a minimum of 60 days after the short position has been closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550/ch04.html#d0e8793 |title=United States IRS Publication 550 Investment Income and Expenses |publisher=Irs.gov |accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Regulations==\n\n===United States===\nThe [[Securities and Exchange Act of 1934]] gave the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] the power to regulate short sales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/about/laws/sea34.pdf |title=Securities Exchange Act of 1934 |year=1934 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission}}</ref> The first official restriction on short selling came in 1938, when the SEC adopted a rule known as the [[uptick rule]] that dictated that a short sale could only be made when the price of a particular stock was higher than the previous trade price.
