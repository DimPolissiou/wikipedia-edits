The [[screenplay|teleplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the best-selling 1987 non-fiction book ''[[And the Band Played On|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and the AIDS Epidemic]]'' by [[Randy Shilts]].\n\nThe film premiered at the [[Montreal World Film Festival]] before being broadcast by [[HBO]] on September 11, 1993. It later was released in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Spain]], [[Germany]], [[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[Sweden]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Denmark]], [[New Zealand]], and [[Australia]]. The HBO movie was later aired on [[NBC]] in 1994. NBC (as well as [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) were some of the networks considered to make a miniseries based on the book in the late 1980s, but the networks turned it down because they could not find a way to structure it as a two-night, four-hour miniseries. In 1994, NBC finally aired the movie with a parental discretion warning due to its sensitive subject matter.\n\n==Plot==\nIn a prologue set in 1976, American [[epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Don Francis]] arrives in a village on the banks of the [[Ebola River]] in [[Zaire]] and discovers many of the residents and the doctor working with them have died from a mysterious illness later identified as [[Ebola virus disease|Ebola hemorrhagic fever]]. It is his first exposure to such an [[epidemic]], and the images of the dead he helps [[cremation|cremate]] will haunt him when he later becomes involved with [[HIV/AIDS]] research at the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]].\n\nIn 1981, Francis becomes aware of a growing number of deaths from unexplained sources among [[gay]] men in [[Los Angeles]], [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], and is prompted to begin an in-depth investigation of the possible causes. Working with no money, limited space, and outdated equipment, he comes in contact with politicians, numerous members of the medical community (many of whom resent his involvement because of their personal agendas), and gay activists. Of the latter, some such as [[Bill Kraus]] support him, while others express resentment at what they see as unwanted interference in their lifestyles, especially in his attempts to close the local [[Gay bathhouse|bathhouses]]. One day, when exercising at a local gym, Kraus notices a spot at the base of his leg, worrying that it might be [[Kaposi's sarcoma]]. After a series of blood tests, Kraus is horrified that his worst fears have been confirmed when he learns that he has been diagnosed with AIDS. While Francis pursues his theory that AIDS is caused by a [[sexually transmitted infection|sexually transmitted virus]] on the model of [[feline leukemia virus|feline leukemia]], he finds his efforts are stonewalled by the CDC, which is unwilling to prove the disease is transmitted through blood, and competing [[France|French]] and [[United States|American]] scientists, particularly [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]]. These medical researchers squabble about who should receive credit for discovering the virus. Meanwhile, the death toll climbs rapidly.\n\n==Principal cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Matthew Modine]] as [[Don Francis|Dr. Don Francis]], an epidemiologist, [[HIV/AIDS]] researcher, and one of the first scientists to suggest that AIDS was caused by an [[Pathogen|infectious agent]]\n* [[Alan Alda]] as [[Robert Gallo|Dr. Robert Gallo]], a biomedical researcher and one of the discoverers of HIV as the infectious agent responsible for [[HIV/AIDS|AIDS]]\n* [[Ian McKellen]] as [[Bill Kraus]], a [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] and AIDS activist and congressional aide\n* [[Glenne Headly]] as [[Mary Guinan|Dr. Mary Guinan]], an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]]\n* [[Richard Masur]] as [[William Darrow|Dr. William Darrow]], one of the discoverers of HIV as the virus that causes AIDS\n* [[Saul Rubinek]] as Dr. James Curran, an investigator of the HIV/AIDS epidemic for the CDC\n* [[Lily Tomlin]] as [[Selma Dritz|Dr. Selma Dritz]], a physician and epidemiologist\n* [[Jeffrey Nordling]] as [[Ga\u00ebtan Dugas]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[flight attendant]] who was an early AIDS patient\n* [[Donal Logue]] as [[Bobbi Campbell]], an AIDS activist\n* [[B.

Many critics praised the results.

The stars lend warmth to a movie necessarily preoccupied with cold research and politics, and they lend prestige: The movie must be important, since actors of this stature agreed to appear. The result of the stars' generosity, however, works against the movie by halting the flow of the drama every time a familiar face pops up on screen. The emotions and agony involved in this subject give ''Band'' an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich\u00e9d. The best compliment one can pay this TV movie is to say that unlike so many fact-based films, it does not exploit or diminish the tragedy of its subject.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=[[Ken Tucker]] |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,307958,00.html |title=And the Band Played On |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=September 10, 1993 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn a review from ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'', the writing team thought \"so keen were the makers of this adaptation of Randy Shilts's best-seller to bombard us with the facts and figures of the history of AIDS that they forgot to offer a properly dramatic human framework to make us care fully about the characters.\" The review also says that the multiple issues the film attempts to cover \"make for a disjointed, clich\u00e9d narrative.\"<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/77950/And_the_Band_Played_On.html |title=And the Band Played On |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]] |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=December 4, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRichard Zoglin of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine wrote \"Shilts's prodigiously researched 600-page book has been boiled down to a fact-filled, dramatically coherent, occasionally moving 2 hours and 20 minutes.

The result of the stars' generosity, however, works against the movie by halting the flow of the drama every time a familiar face pops up on screen. The emotions and agony involved in this subject give ''Band'' an irresistible power, yet the movie's rhythm is choppy and the dialogue frequently stiff and clich\u00e9d.

His father, the ''duc de Berry'', had been assassinated seven months before his birth.  \n\nAt birth, Henri was given the title of ''duc de Bordeaux.'' Because of his birth after his father's death, when the senior male line of the [[House of Bourbon]] was on the verge of extinction, Henri was named ''Dieudonn\u00e9'' (\"God-given\").

As a consequence, after seven days, a period in which legitimist monarchists considered that Henri had been the rightful monarch of France, the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] decreed that the throne should pass to Louis Philippe, who was proclaimed King of the French on 9 August.<ref>{{cite book |first=Munro |last=Price |title=The Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4050-4082-2 |pages=177, 181\u2013182, 185 }}</ref>\n\nHenri and his family left France and went into exile on 16 August 1830.  While some French monarchists recognized him as their sovereign, others disputed the validity of the abdications of his grandfather and of his uncle{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Still others recognised the ''[[July Monarchy]]'' of Louis Philippe. With the death of his 79-year-old grandfather in 1836 and of his uncle in 1844, young Henri became the genealogically senior claimant to the French throne. His supporters were called ''[[Legitimists]]'' to distinguish them from the ''[[Orl\u00e9anists]]'', the supporters of the family of Louis Philippe.\n\nHenri, who preferred the courtesy title of '''''comte de Chambord''''' (from the [[ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]], which had been presented to him by the [[French Restoration|Restoration]] government, and which was the only significant piece of personal property of which he was allowed to retain ownership upon his exile), continued his claim to the throne throughout the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] of [[Napoleon III of France|Napol\u00e9on III]], and the [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]].\n\nIn November 1846, the ''comte de Chambord'' married his second cousin [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], daughter of Duke [[Francis IV, Duke of Modena|Francis IV]] of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] and Princess [[Maria Beatrice of Savoy]].

The Orl\u00e9anists agreed to support the aging ''comte de Chambord'''s claim to the throne, with the expectation that at his childless death he would be succeeded by their own claimant, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, comte de Paris]]. Henri was then pretender for both Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists, and the restoration of monarchy in France seemed a close possibility. However, Henri insisted that he would accept the crown only on condition that France abandon its [[Flag of France|tricolour flag]] and return to the use of the white [[fleur-de-lis|''fleur de lys'']] flag.<ref>D. W. Brogan, ''The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1945), pp. 83-84.</ref> He rejected a compromise, whereby the ''fleur-de-lys'' would be the new king's personal standard, and the tricolour would remain the national flag.\n\n==Defeat==\nA temporary [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established, to wait for Henri's death and his replacement by the more liberal [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Comte de Paris]]. By the time this occurred in 1883, public opinion had however swung behind the Republic as the form of government which, in the words of the former President [[Adolphe Thiers]], \"divides us least\". Thus, Henri could be mockingly hailed by republicans such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] as \"the French Washington\"&nbsp;\u2014 the one man without whom the Republic could not have been founded.\n\nHenri died on 24 August 1883 at his residence in [[Frohsdorf]], [[Austria]], at the age of sixty-two, bringing the Louis XV male-only line to an end. He was buried in his grandfather Charles X's crypt in the church of the Franciscan [[Kostanjevica Monastery]] in [[Gorizia]], then [[Austria]], now in [[Slovenia]]n city of [[Nova Gorica]]. His personal property, including the [[ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]], was left to his nephew, [[Robert I, Duke of Parma]] (son of Henri's late sister).\n\nHenri's death left the Legitimist line of succession distinctly confused. On one hand, Henri himself had accepted that the head of the ''Maison de France'' (as distinguished from the ''Maison de Bourbon'') would be the head of the Orl\u00e9ans line, i.e. the [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Comte de Paris]]. This was accepted by many Legitimists, and was the default on legal grounds; the only surviving Bourbon line more senior was the Spanish branch, which had renounced its right to inherit the throne of France as a condition of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. However, many if not most of Henri's supporters, including his widow, chose to disregard his statements and this law, arguing that no one had the right to deny to the senior direct-male-line male Bourbon to be the head of the ''Maison de France'' and thus the legitimate King of France; the renunciation of the Spanish branch is under this interpretation illegitimate and therefore void. Thus these Legitimists settled on [[Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n]], the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish throne]] (the [[Salic law]] having been suspended in Spain, the actual king, [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], was not the senior descendant in the male line), as their claimant to the French crown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard - La duchesse de Berry et ses enfants,1822.jpg|The Duchess of Berry and her children by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]], 1822\nFile:Portrait, The Duke of Bordeaux, Dubois-Drahonet.jpg|The young Duke of Bordeaux in a military uniform, by [[Alexandre-Jean Dubois-Drahonet]], 1828\nImage:Carolina, Duchess of Berry and her son the Duke of Bordeaux by Fran\u00e7ois Pascal Simon G\u00e9rard (1770-1837).png|The Duchess of Berry and her son by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]], 1828\nImage:Henri d'Artois as a child.jpg|Detail of portrait, c.1830\nImage:Bordeaux, duc de.jpg|Portrait, c.1833\n</gallery>\n\n== Honours ==\n* [[File:Royal Standard of the King of France.svg|25px]] [[House of Bourbon]]: Grand Master and Grand Croix of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]]\n* {{flag|Spain|1785}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (1823)<ref>[http://www.antiquesatoz.com/sgfleece/knights6.htm \"Toison Espagnole (Spanish Fleece) - 19th century\"] (in French), ''Chevaliers de la Toison D'or''.

As a consequence, after seven days, a period in which legitimist monarchists considered that Henri had been the rightful monarch of France, the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]] decreed that the throne should pass to Louis Philippe, who was proclaimed King of the French on 9 August.<ref>{{cite book |first=Munro |last=Price |title=The Perilous Crown: France between Revolutions |location=London |publisher=Macmillan |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-4050-4082-2 |pages=177, 181\u2013182, 185 }}</ref>\n\nHenri and his family left France and went into exile on 16 August 1830.  While some French monarchists recognized him as their sovereign, others disputed the validity of the abdications of his grandfather and of his uncle{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. Still others recognised the ''[[July Monarchy]]'' of Louis Philippe. With the death of his 79-year-old grandfather in 1836 and of his uncle in 1844, young Henri became the genealogically senior claimant to the French throne. His supporters were called ''[[Legitimists]]'' to distinguish them from the ''[[Orl\u00e9anists]]'', the supporters of the family of Louis Philippe.\n\nHenri, who preferred the courtesy title of '''''comte de Chambord''''' (from the [[ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]], which had been presented to him by the [[French Restoration|Restoration]] government, and which was the only significant piece of personal property of which he was allowed to retain ownership upon his exile), continued his claim to the throne throughout the July Monarchy of Louis Philippe, the [[French Second Republic|Second Republic]], the [[Second French Empire|Second Empire]] of [[Napoleon III of France|Napol\u00e9on III]], and the [[Third Republic of France|Third Republic]].\n\nIn November 1846, the ''comte de Chambord'' married his second cousin [[Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este (1817\u20131886)|Archduchess Maria Theresa of Austria-Este]], daughter of Duke [[Francis IV, Duke of Modena|Francis IV]] of [[Duchy of Modena|Modena]] and Princess [[Maria Beatrice of Savoy]].

The Orl\u00e9anists agreed to support the aging ''comte de Chambord'''s claim to the throne, with the expectation that at his childless death he would be succeeded by their own claimant, [[Philippe, comte de Paris|Philippe d'Orl\u00e9ans, comte de Paris]]. Henri was then pretender for both Legitimists and Orl\u00e9anists, and the restoration of monarchy in France seemed a close possibility. However, Henri insisted that he would accept the crown only on condition that France abandon its [[Flag of France|tricolour flag]] and return to the use of the white [[fleur-de-lis|''fleur de lys'']] flag.<ref>D. W. Brogan, ''The Development of Modern France (1870-1939)'' (London: Hamish Hamilton, 1945), pp. 83-84.</ref> He rejected a compromise, whereby the ''fleur-de-lys'' would be the new king's personal standard, and the tricolour would remain the national flag.\n\n==Defeat==\nA temporary [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] was established, to wait for Henri's death and his replacement by the more liberal [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Comte de Paris]]. By the time this occurred in 1883, public opinion had however swung behind the Republic as the form of government which, in the words of the former President [[Adolphe Thiers]], \"divides us least\". Thus, Henri could be mockingly hailed by republicans such as [[Georges Clemenceau]] as \"the French Washington\"&nbsp;\u2014 the one man without whom the Republic could not have been founded.\n\nHenri died on 24 August 1883 at his residence in [[Frohsdorf]], [[Austria]], at the age of sixty-two, bringing the Louis XV male-only line to an end. He was buried in his grandfather Charles X's crypt in the church of the Franciscan [[Kostanjevica Monastery]] in [[Gorizia]], then [[Austria]], now in [[Slovenia]]n city of [[Nova Gorica]]. His personal property, including the [[ch\u00e2teau de Chambord]], was left to his nephew, [[Robert I, Duke of Parma]] (son of Henri's late sister).\n\nHenri's death left the Legitimist line of succession distinctly confused. On one hand, Henri himself had accepted that the head of the ''Maison de France'' (as distinguished from the ''Maison de Bourbon'') would be the head of the Orl\u00e9ans line, i.e. the [[Prince Philippe, Count of Paris|Comte de Paris]]. This was accepted by many Legitimists, and was the default on legal grounds; the only surviving Bourbon line more senior was the Spanish branch, which had renounced its right to inherit the throne of France as a condition of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. However, many if not most of Henri's supporters, including his widow, chose to disregard his statements and this law, arguing that no one had the right to deny to the senior direct-male-line male Bourbon to be the head of the ''Maison de France'' and thus the legitimate King of France; the renunciation of the Spanish branch is under this interpretation illegitimate and therefore void. Thus these Legitimists settled on [[Juan, Count of Montiz\u00f3n]], the [[Carlism|Carlist]] pretender to the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish throne]] (the [[Salic law]] having been suspended in Spain, the actual king, [[Alfonso XII of Spain|Alfonso XII]], was not the senior descendant in the male line), as their claimant to the French crown.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery class=\"center\">\nImage:Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard - La duchesse de Berry et ses enfants,1822.jpg|The Duchess of Berry and her children by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]], 1822\nFile:Portrait, The Duke of Bordeaux, Dubois-Drahonet.jpg|The young Duke of Bordeaux in a military uniform, by [[Alexandre-Jean Dubois-Drahonet]], 1828\nImage:Carolina, Duchess of Berry and her son the Duke of Bordeaux by Fran\u00e7ois Pascal Simon G\u00e9rard (1770-1837).png|The Duchess of Berry and her son by [[Fran\u00e7ois G\u00e9rard]], 1828\nImage:Henri d'Artois as a child.jpg|Detail of portrait, c.1830\nImage:Bordeaux, duc de.jpg|Portrait, c.1833\n</gallery>\n\n== Honours ==\n* [[File:Royal Standard of the King of France.svg|25px]] [[House of Bourbon]]: Grand Master and Grand Croix of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]]\n* {{flag|Spain|1785}}: Knight of the [[Order of the Golden Fleece]] (1823)<ref>[http://www.antiquesatoz.com/sgfleece/knights6.htm \"Toison Espagnole (Spanish Fleece) - 19th century\"] (in French), ''Chevaliers de la Toison D'or''.

E-mail and scanning operations were obvious early candidates; many organizations with document-intensive operations are deploying scanning centers as a shared service.\n\nMany large organizations, in both the public and private sectors, are now considering deploying [[Enterprise Content Management|enterprise content management (ECM)]] technology as a shared service.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Integration Competency Center]]\n* [[Offshoring]]\n* [[Outsourcing]]\n* [[Offshoring Research Network]]\n* [[Portable Employer of Record]]\n* [[Shared Services Center]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n* Overview: [https://web.archive.org/web/20110718154209/http://zinnov.com/pdf/Shared-Services.pdf Shared Services Outsourcing & Consolidated Centers of Excellence]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shared Services}}\n[[Category:Business economics]]\n[[Category:Service-oriented (business computing)]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: long term \u2192 long-term, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared_services"}

For example, if a customer wants 10 units per week, then, given a 40-hour work week and steady flow through the production line, the average time between production starts should be 4 hours (actually less than that in order to account for things like machine downtime and scheduled paid employee breaks), yielding 10 units produced per week. In fact, takt time simply reflects the rate of production needed to match the demand.  In the previous example, whether it takes 4 minutes or 4 years to produce the product, the takt time is based on customer demand.  If a process or a production line are unable to produce at takt time, either demand leveling, additional resources, or process re-engineering is needed to correct the issue.\n\n== Etymology ==\nTakt time is a borrowing of the [[Wasei-eigo|Japanese word]] {{nihongo||\u30bf\u30af\u30c8\u30bf\u30a4\u30e0|takuto taimu}}, which in turn was borrowed from the German word ''{{Lang|de|Taktzeit}}'', meaning 'cycle time'. The word was likely introduced to Japan by German engineers in the 1930s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/engineering-systems-division/esd-60-lean-six-sigma-processes-summer-2004/lecture-notes/8_1assembly_op.pdf|title=Takt Time|\nlast1=Graban|first1=Mark|last2=Ducharme|first2=Colin|last3=Ruddick|first3=Todd}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nAssuming a product is made one unit at a time at a constant rate during the net available work time, the takt time is the amount of time that must elapse between two consecutive unit completions in order to meet the demand.\n\nTakt time can be first determined with the formula:\n:<math>T = \\frac{T_{a}}{D}</math>\n\nWhere<br>\nT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= Takt time, e.g. [work time between two consecutive units]<br>\nT<sub>a</sub> = Net time available to work, e.g. [work time per period]<br>\nD = Demand (customer demand), e.g. [units required per period]\n\nNet available time is the amount of time available for work to be done. This excludes [[Break (work)|break time]]s and any expected stoppage time (for example [[scheduled maintenance]], team briefings, etc.).\n<blockquote>\n'''Example''':<br> If there are a total of 8 hours (or 480 minutes) in a shift (gross time) less 30 minutes lunch, 30 minutes for breaks (2 \u00d7 15 mins), 10 minutes for a team briefing and 10 minutes for basic maintenance checks, then the net ''Available Time to Work'' = 480 - 30 - 30 - 10 - 10 = 400 minutes.\n\nIf customer demand were 400 units a day and one shift were being run, then the line would be required to output at a minimum rate of one part per minute in order to be able to keep up with customer demand.\n</blockquote>\nIn reality, people and machines cannot maintain 100% efficiency and there will be stoppages for other reasons. Allowances should be made for these instances, and thus the line will be set up to run at a faster rate to account for this.\n\nAlso, takt time may be adjusted according to requirements within the company. For example, if one department delivers parts to several manufacturing lines, it often makes sense to use similar takt times on all lines to smooth out flow from the preceding station. Customer demand can still be met by adjusting daily working time, reducing [[down time]]s on machines and so on.\n\nSome of the early literature uses ''cycle time'' for takt time.\n\n== Implementation ==\nTakt time is calculated on virtually every task in a business environment. It is used in manufacturing ([[casting]] of parts, drilling holes, or preparing a workplace for another task), control tasks (testing of parts or adjusting machinery), or in administration (answering standard inquiries or [[call center]] operation). It is, however, most common in production lines that move a product along a line of stations that each performs a set of predefined tasks.\n\nOnce a takt system is implemented there are a number of benefits:\n* The product moves along a line, so [[bottleneck (project management)|bottleneck]]s (stations that need more time than planned) are easily identified when the product does not move on in time.\n* Correspondingly, stations that don't operate reliably (suffer frequent breakdown, etc.) are easily identified.\n* The takt leaves only a certain amount of time to perform the actual [[value added]] work. Therefore, there is a strong motivation to get rid of all non value-adding tasks (like machine set-up, gathering of tools, transporting products, etc.)\n* Workers and machines perform sets of similar tasks, so they don't have to adapt to new processes every day, increasing their productivity.\n* There is no place in the takt system for removal of a product from the assembly line at any point before completion, so opportunities for [[shrinkage (accounting)|shrink]] and damage in transit are minimized.\n\nDownsides of takt time organization include:\n* When customer demand rises so much that takt time has to come down, quite a few tasks have to be either reorganized to take even less time to fit into the shorter takt time, or they have to be split up between two stations (which means another station has to be squeezed into the line and workers have to adapt to the new setup)\n* When one station in the line breaks down for whatever reason the whole line comes to a grinding halt, unless there are buffer capacities for preceding stations to get rid of their products and following stations to feed from. A built-in buffer of three to five percent downtime allows needed adjustments or recovery from failures.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Kaizen Blitz: accelerating breakthroughs in productivity and performance |last=Laraia|first=Anthony C. |author2=Patricia E.

In later years, five of the Deacons worked in law enforcement and two were the first blacks to run for county sheriff.<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 179-186</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, African Americans struggled to integrate schools. and to register and vote.<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp.</ref> In 1965 [[NAACP]] leader [[Charles Evers]] (brother of Medgar, who had been assassinated) became very active in Claiborne County and other areas of southwest Mississippi, including [[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams]] and [[Jefferson County, Mississippi|Jefferson]] counties. He gained an increase in voter registration as well as increasing membership in the [[NAACP]] throughout the region. Evers was influential in a developing a moderate coalition of blacks and white liberals in Mississippi. They wanted to develop alternatives to the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] and the all-white [[Democratic Regulars]].<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 193-194</ref>\n\nIn the June 1966 Democratic primary, blacks in Claiborne and Jefferson counties cast decisive majorities, voting for the MFDP candidate, [[Marcus Whitley (political candidate)|Marcus Whitley]], for Congress and giving him victory in those counties. In the November election, Evers led an African-American vote for the Independent senatorial candidate, [[Prentiss Walker]], who won in those counties but lost to the incumbent [[James O. Eastland]].<ref>Crosby (2006), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 195-196</ref>  (Claiborne County and southwest Mississippi were then in the [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]].) Walker was a conservative who in 1964 was elected as the first Republican Congressman from Mississippi in the 20th century, as part of a major realignment of political parties in the South.\n\nTo gain integration of public facilities and more opportunities in local businesses, where no black clerks were hired, African Americans undertook an economic boycott of merchants in the county seat of [[Port Gibson]]. (Similar economic boycotts were conducted in this period in Jackson and Greenville.) Evers led the boycott, enforced its maintenance, and later negotiated with merchants and their representatives on how to end it. While criticized for some of his methods, Evers gained support from the national NAACP for his apparent effectiveness, from the segregationist [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] for negotiating on certain elements, and from local African Americans and white liberals.<ref name=\"Crosby\"/> This boycott was upheld as a form of political protest by the [[United States Supreme Court]].\n\nThe economic boycott was concluded in late January 1967, when merchants agreed to hire blacks as clerks. Nearly two dozen people were hired, and merchants promised more courteous treatment and ease of shopping. In addition, by this time 50 students were attending formerly whites-only public schools. In November 1966 Floyd Collins ran for the school board as the county's first black candidate since [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]]. He was defeated, but a majority of blacks carried the county against Democratic Regular candidates for the Senate and Congress, incumbent senator [[James Eastland]] and [[John Bell Williams]].<ref>Crosby (2006), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 205-206</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Frank Davis was elected as the county's first black sheriff since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite web |url=http://claibornecountysheriff.org/history_view.php?id=1 |title=Untitled Bio of Sheriff Frank Davis |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Claiborne County Sheriff's Office |publisher=Claiborne County Sheriff's Office |access-date=22 Jul 2015 |quote=Sheriff Davis made history in 1979.

It is bordered by the [[Mississippi River]] on the west and the [[Big Black River (Mississippi)|Big Black River]] on the north.\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, this small county has the third-highest percentage of African-American residents of any U.S. county, an 84% majority of the population.<ref>\"Minorities now in the majority in nearly 10% of U.S. counties\", ''Lexington Herald-Leader'' August 8, 2007, p.

Using enslaved [[African Americans]] as laborers, planters created long, narrow plantations that fronted on the Mississippi to the west and the Big Black River to the north,<ref name=\"dunbar420\"/> the transportation byways.

It has also been a retail center of trade.\n\nAfter the Reconstruction era, white Democrats regained power in the state legislature by the mid-1870s; paramilitary groups such as the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] suppressed black voting through violence and fraud in many parts of the state.<ref>[[Nicholas Lemann]], ''Redemption: The Last Battle of the Civil War,'' New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux, Paperback, 2007</ref> These groups acted as \"the military arm of the Democratic Party.\"<ref>George C.

These rural blacks migrated to the North and Midwest cities, such as [[Chicago]], in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] to seek jobs and other opportunities elsewhere. Rural whites also migrated out of the South.<ref>Gregory, James N. (2005), ''The Southern Diaspora: How the Great Migrations of Black and White Southerners Transformed America''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, pp. 12-17.</ref>\n\nAfter national civil rights legislation was passed in the mid-1960s, African Americans in Claiborne County had to continue to struggle against white supremacy in most aspects of their lives. The [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] continued to try to spy on and disrupt black meetings. \"African Americans insisted on dignified treatment and full inclusion in the community's public life, while whites clung to paternalistic notions of black inferiority and defended inherited privilege.\"<ref>Crosby (2005), ''Little Taste of Freedom'', p. xv</ref> In reaction to harassment and violence, in 1966 blacks formed a group, [[Deacons for Defense]], which armed to protect the people and was strictly for self-defense. They learned the law and stayed within it. After shadowing police to prevent abuses, its leaders eventually began to work closely with the county sheriff to keep relations peaceful. In later years, five of the Deacons worked in law enforcement and two were the first blacks to run for county sheriff.<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 179-186</ref>\n\nIn the late 1960s, African Americans struggled to integrate schools. and to register and vote.<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp.</ref> In 1965 [[NAACP]] leader [[Charles Evers]] (brother of Medgar, who had been assassinated) became very active in Claiborne County and other areas of southwest Mississippi, including [[Adams County, Mississippi|Adams]] and [[Jefferson County, Mississippi|Jefferson]] counties. He gained an increase in voter registration as well as increasing membership in the [[NAACP]] throughout the region. Evers was influential in a developing a moderate coalition of blacks and white liberals in Mississippi. They wanted to develop alternatives to the [[Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party]] and the all-white [[Democratic Regulars]].<ref>Crosby (2005), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 193-194</ref>\n\nIn the June 1966 Democratic primary, blacks in Claiborne and Jefferson counties cast decisive majorities, voting for the MFDP candidate, [[Marcus Whitley (political candidate)|Marcus Whitley]], for Congress and giving him victory in those counties. In the November election, Evers led an African-American vote for the Independent senatorial candidate, [[Prentiss Walker]], who won in those counties but lost to the incumbent [[James O. Eastland]].<ref>Crosby (2006), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 195-196</ref>  (Claiborne County and southwest Mississippi were then in the [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]].) Walker was a conservative who in 1964 was elected as the first Republican Congressman from Mississippi in the 20th century, as part of a major realignment of political parties in the South.\n\nTo gain integration of public facilities and more opportunities in local businesses, where no black clerks were hired, African Americans undertook an economic boycott of merchants in the county seat of [[Port Gibson]]. (Similar economic boycotts were conducted in this period in Jackson and Greenville.) Evers led the boycott, enforced its maintenance, and later negotiated with merchants and their representatives on how to end it. While criticized for some of his methods, Evers gained support from the national NAACP for his apparent effectiveness, from the segregationist [[Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission]] for negotiating on certain elements, and from local African Americans and white liberals.<ref name=\"Crosby\"/> This boycott was upheld as a form of political protest by the [[United States Supreme Court]].\n\nThe economic boycott was concluded in late January 1967, when merchants agreed to hire blacks as clerks. Nearly two dozen people were hired, and merchants promised more courteous treatment and ease of shopping. In addition, by this time 50 students were attending formerly whites-only public schools. In November 1966 Floyd Collins ran for the school board as the county's first black candidate since [[Reconstruction era (United States)|Reconstruction]]. He was defeated, but a majority of blacks carried the county against Democratic Regular candidates for the Senate and Congress, incumbent senator [[James Eastland]] and [[John Bell Williams]].<ref>Crosby (2006), ''A Little Taste of Freedom'', pp. 205-206</ref>\n\nIn 1979, Frank Davis was elected as the county's first black sheriff since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].<ref name=\"Davis\">{{cite web |url=http://claibornecountysheriff.org/history_view.php?id=1 |title=Untitled Bio of Sheriff Frank Davis |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=Claiborne County Sheriff's Office |publisher=Claiborne County Sheriff's Office |access-date=22 Jul 2015 |quote=Sheriff Davis made history in 1979.

{"title_page": "Ecological trap", "text_new": "{{Short description|Phenomenon in which species sometimes prefer low-quality habitat}}\n'''Ecological traps''' are scenarios in which rapid [[environmental change]] leads organisms to prefer to settle in poor-quality [[habitat]]s.\nThe concept stems from the idea that organisms that are actively selecting [[habitat]] must rely on environmental cues to help them identify high-quality habitat.  If either the habitat quality or the cue changes so that one does not reliably indicate the other, organisms may be lured into poor-quality habitat.\n\n== Overview ==\nEcological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, [[Indigo bunting]]s typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.<ref name=weldon05/>\n\nWhile the demographic consequences of this type of maladaptive habitat selection behavior have been explored in the context of the sources and sinks, ecological traps are an inherently behavioral phenomenon of individuals.<ref name=robertson06>{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=B.A. |authorlink= |author2=Hutto, R.L. |year=2006 |title=A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=1075\u20131085 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1075:AFFUET]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=16761584 |issn=0012-9658|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&context=biosci_pubs }}</ref>  Despite being a behavioural mechanism, ecological traps can have far-reaching population consequences for species with large dispersal capabilities, such as the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos'').<ref name=lamb17>{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2017 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201365 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= 27677529|issn=}}</ref> The ecological trap concept was introduced in 1972 by Dwernychuk and Boag<ref name=dwernychuk72>{{cite journal |last=Dwernychuk |first=L.W. |authorlink= |author2=Boag, D.A. |year=1972 |title=Ducks nesting in association with gulls-an ecological trap? |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]] |volume=50 |pages=559\u2013563 |doi=10.1139/z72-076 |issue=5 }}</ref> and the many studies that followed suggested that this trap phenomenon may be widespread because of anthropogenic habitat change.<ref name=robertson06/><ref name=schlaepfer02>{{cite journal |last=Schlaepfer |first=M.A. |authorlink= |author2=Runge, M.C. |author3=Sherman, P.W. |year=2002 |title=Ecological and evolutionary traps |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=17 |pages=474\u2013480 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02580-6 |issue=10 }}</ref><ref name=battin04>{{cite journal |last=Battin |first=J. |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=When good animals love bad habitats: Ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations |journal=[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] |volume=18 |issue= 6|pages=1482\u20131491 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00417.x }}</ref>\n\nAs a corollary, novel environments may represent fitness opportunities that are unrecognized by native species if high-quality habitats lack the appropriate cues to encourage settlement; these are known as [[perceptual trap]]s.<ref name=Patten>{{cite journal | last1 = Patten | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Kelly | first2 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Habitat selection and the perceptual trap | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 2148\u201356 | doi = 10.1890/09-2370.1 | pmid = 21265448 }}</ref> Theoretical<ref name=delibes01>{{cite journal |last=Delibes |first=M. |authorlink= |author2=Gaona, P. |author3=Ferreras, P. |year=2001 |title=Effects of an attractive sink leading into maladaptive habitat selection |journal=[[American Naturalist]] |volume=158 |pages=277\u2013285 |doi=10.1086/321319 |pmid=18707324 |issue=3 |hdl=10261/50227 }}</ref><!-- Donovan and Thompson 2001, Kokko and Sutherland 2001 --> and empirical studies<ref name=weldon05>{{cite journal |last=Weldon |first=A.J. |authorlink= |author2=Haddad, N.M. |year=2005 |title=The effects of patch shape on Indigo Buntings: Evidence for an ecological trap |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=86 |pages=1422\u20131431 |doi=10.1890/04-0913 |issue=6 }}</ref><ref name=dwernychuk72/><!-- Robertson and Hutto 2007 --> have shown that errors made in judging habitat quality can lead to population declines or extinction. Such mismatches are not limited to habitat selection, but may occur in any behavioral context (e.g. predator avoidance, mate selection, navigation, foraging site selection, etc.). Ecological traps are thus a subset of the broader phenomena of evolutionary traps.<ref name=schlaepfer02/>\n\nAs ecological trap theory developed, researchers have recognized that traps may operate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales which might also hinder their detection.  For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales.<ref name=misenhelter00>{{cite journal |last=Misenhelter |first=M.D. |authorlink= |author2=Rotenberry, J.T. |year=2000 |title=Choices and consequences of habitat occupancy and nest site selection in sage sparrows |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=81 |pages=2892\u20132901 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2892:CACOHO]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0012-9658 |issue=10 }}</ref> Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism's life, yet have positive effects on later life stages.<ref name=schlaepfer02/> As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility.<ref name=robertson06/> However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity.\n\nA 2006 review of the literature on ecological traps provides guidelines for demonstrating the existence of an ecological trap.<ref name=robertson06/> A study must show a preference for one habitat over another (or equal preference) and that individuals selecting the preferred habitat (or equally preferred habitat) have lower fitness (i.e., experience lower survival or reproductive success).  Since the publication of that paper which found only a few well-documented examples of ecological traps, interest in ecological and evolutionary traps has grown very rapidly and new empirical examples are being published at an accelerating rate. There are now roughly 30 examples of ecological traps affecting a broad diversity of taxa including birds, mammals, arthropods, fish and reptiles.\n\nBecause ecological and evolutionary traps are still very poorly understood phenomena, many questions about their proximate and ultimate causes as well as their ecological consequences remain unanswered. Are traps simply an inevitable consequence of the inability of evolution to anticipate novelty or react quickly to rapid environmental change? How common are traps? Do ecological traps necessarily lead to population declines or extinctions or is it possible that they may persist indefinitely? Under what ecological and evolutionary conditions should this occur? Are organisms with certain characteristics predisposed to being \"trapped\"? Is rapid environmental change necessary to trigger traps? Can global warming, pollution or exotic invasive species create traps? Embracing genetic and phylogenetic approaches may provide more robust answers to the above questions as well as providing deeper insight into the proximate and ultimate basis for maladaptation in general{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!-- (see Crespi 2000) -->. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are predicted to add in concert with other sources of population decline, traps are an important research priority for conservation scientists. Given the rapid current rate of global environmental change, traps may be far more common than it is realized and it will be important to examine the proximate and ultimate causes of traps if management is to prevent or eliminate traps in the future.\n\n==Polarized light pollution==\n[[Polarized light pollution]] is perhaps the most compelling and well-documented cue triggering ecological traps.<ref>Horvath et al., in press as of Jan, 2013</ref> Orientation to polarized sources of light is the most important mechanism that guides at least 300 species of [[dragonflies]], [[mayflies]], [[caddisflies]], [[Tabanidae|tabanid flies]], [[diving beetle]]s, [[Heteroptera#.22Waterbug.22|water bugs]], and other [[aquatic insect]]s in their search for the water bodies they require for suitable feeding/breeding habitat and [[oviposition]] sites (Schwind 1991; Horv\u00e1th and Kriska 2008). Because of their strong linear polarization signature, artificial polarizing surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravestones, cars, plastic sheeting, oil pools, windows) are commonly mistaken for bodies of water (Horv\u00e1th and Zeil 1996; Kriska et al. 1998, 2006a, 2007, 2008; Horv\u00e1th et al. 2007, 2008). Light reflected by these surfaces is often more highly polarized than that of light reflected by water, and artificial polarizers can be even more attractive to polarotactic aquatic insects than a water body (Horv\u00e1th and Zeil 1996; Horv\u00e1th et al. 1998; Kriska et al. 1998) and appear as exaggerated water surfaces acting as supernormal optical stimuli. Consequently, dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, and other water-seeking species actually prefer to mate, settle, swarm, and oviposit upon these surfaces than available water bodies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evolutionary mismatch]]\n* [[Source\u2013sink dynamics]]\n* [[Perceptual trap]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00746.x | last1 = Crespi | first1 = B.J. | author-link1=Bernard Crespi | year = 2001 | title = The evolution of maladaptation | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 84 | issue = 6| pages = 623\u20139 | pmid = 10886377 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2007.03.014 | last1 = Gilroy | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Sutherland | first2 = W.J. | year = 2007 | title = Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 351\u2013356 | pmid = 17416438 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G\u00e1bor | last2 = Kriska | first2 = Gy\u00f6rgy | last3 = Malik | first3 = P\u00e9ter | last4 = Robertson | first4 = Bruce | title = Polarized light pollution: a new kind of ecological photopollution | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 7 | pages = 317\u2013325 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1890/080129 | issue = 6 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/379303a0 | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Zeil | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Kuwait oil lakes as insect traps | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 379 | issue = 6563| pages = 303\u2013304 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s001140050503 | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Bern\u00e1th | first2 = B | last3 = Moln\u00e1r | first3 = G. | year = 1998 | title = Dragonflies find crude oil visually more attractive than water: Multiple-choice experiments on dragonfly polarotaxis | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 292\u2013297 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01798.x | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Malik | first2 = P | last3 = Kriska | first3 = G | last4 = Wildermuth | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Ecological traps for dragonflies in a cemetery: the attraction of Sympetrum species (Odonata: Libellulidae) by horizontally polarizing black gravestones | url = | journal = Freshwater Biol | volume = 52 | issue = 9| pages = 1700\u20131709 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Kriska | first1 = G | last2 = Horv\u00e1th | first2 = G | last3 = Andrikovics | first3 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Why do mayflies lay their eggs en masse on dry asphalt roads?

If either the habitat quality or the cue changes so that one does not reliably indicate the other, organisms may be lured into poor-quality habitat.\n\n== Overview ==\nEcological traps are thought to occur when the attractiveness of a habitat increases disproportionately in relation to its value for survival and reproduction. The result is preference of falsely attractive habitat and a general avoidance of high-quality but less-attractive habitats. For example, [[Indigo bunting]]s typically nest in shrubby habitat or broken forest transitions between closed canopy forest and open field. Human activity can create 'sharper', more abrupt forest edges and buntings prefer to nest along these edges. However, these artificial sharp forest edges also concentrate the movement of predators which predate their nests. In this way, Buntings prefer to nest in highly altered habitats where their nest success is lowest.<ref name=weldon05/>\n\nWhile the demographic consequences of this type of maladaptive habitat selection behavior have been explored in the context of the sources and sinks, ecological traps are an inherently behavioral phenomenon of individuals.<ref name=robertson06>{{cite journal |last=Robertson |first=B.A. |authorlink= |author2=Hutto, R.L. |year=2006 |title=A framework for understanding ecological traps and an evaluation of existing evidence |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=87 |issue=5 |pages=1075\u20131085 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2006)87[1075:AFFUET]2.0.CO;2 |pmid=16761584 |issn=0012-9658|url=http://scholarworks.umt.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1275&context=biosci_pubs }}</ref>  Despite being a behavioural mechanism, ecological traps can have far-reaching population consequences for species with large dispersal capabilities, such as the grizzly bear (''Ursus arctos'').<ref name=lamb17>{{cite journal |last=Lamb |first=C.T.. |authorlink= |author2=Mowat, G. |author3=McLellan, B.N. |author4=Nielsen, S.E. |author5=Boutin, S. |year=2017 |title=Forbidden fruit: human settlement and abundant fruit create an ecological trap for an apex omnivore |journal=[[Journal of Animal Ecology]]  |volume=86 |issue=1 |pages=55\u201365 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12589|pmid= 27677529|issn=}}</ref> The ecological trap concept was introduced in 1972 by Dwernychuk and Boag<ref name=dwernychuk72>{{cite journal |last=Dwernychuk |first=L.W. |authorlink= |author2=Boag, D.A. |year=1972 |title=Ducks nesting in association with gulls-an ecological trap? |journal=[[Canadian Journal of Zoology]] |volume=50 |pages=559\u2013563 |doi=10.1139/z72-076 |issue=5 }}</ref> and the many studies that followed suggested that this trap phenomenon may be widespread because of anthropogenic habitat change.<ref name=robertson06/><ref name=schlaepfer02>{{cite journal |last=Schlaepfer |first=M.A. |authorlink= |author2=Runge, M.C. |author3=Sherman, P.W. |year=2002 |title=Ecological and evolutionary traps |journal=[[Trends in Ecology and Evolution]] |volume=17 |pages=474\u2013480 |doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02580-6 |issue=10 }}</ref><ref name=battin04>{{cite journal |last=Battin |first=J. |authorlink= |year=2004 |title=When good animals love bad habitats: Ecological traps and the conservation of animal populations |journal=[[Conservation Biology (journal)|Conservation Biology]] |volume=18 |issue= 6|pages=1482\u20131491 |doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2004.00417.x }}</ref>\n\nAs a corollary, novel environments may represent fitness opportunities that are unrecognized by native species if high-quality habitats lack the appropriate cues to encourage settlement; these are known as [[perceptual trap]]s.<ref name=Patten>{{cite journal | last1 = Patten | first1 = M.A. | last2 = Kelly | first2 = J.F. | year = 2010 | title = Habitat selection and the perceptual trap | url = | journal = Ecological Applications | volume = 20 | issue = 8| pages = 2148\u201356 | doi = 10.1890/09-2370.1 | pmid = 21265448 }}</ref> Theoretical<ref name=delibes01>{{cite journal |last=Delibes |first=M. |authorlink= |author2=Gaona, P. |author3=Ferreras, P. |year=2001 |title=Effects of an attractive sink leading into maladaptive habitat selection |journal=[[American Naturalist]] |volume=158 |pages=277\u2013285 |doi=10.1086/321319 |pmid=18707324 |issue=3 |hdl=10261/50227 }}</ref><!-- Donovan and Thompson 2001, Kokko and Sutherland 2001 --> and empirical studies<ref name=weldon05>{{cite journal |last=Weldon |first=A.J. |authorlink= |author2=Haddad, N.M. |year=2005 |title=The effects of patch shape on Indigo Buntings: Evidence for an ecological trap |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=86 |pages=1422\u20131431 |doi=10.1890/04-0913 |issue=6 }}</ref><ref name=dwernychuk72/><!-- Robertson and Hutto 2007 --> have shown that errors made in judging habitat quality can lead to population declines or extinction. Such mismatches are not limited to habitat selection, but may occur in any behavioral context (e.g. predator avoidance, mate selection, navigation, foraging site selection, etc.). Ecological traps are thus a subset of the broader phenomena of evolutionary traps.<ref name=schlaepfer02/>\n\nAs ecological trap theory developed, researchers have recognized that traps may operate on a variety of spatial and temporal scales which might also hinder their detection.  For example, because a bird must select habitat on several scales (a habitat patch, an individual territory within that patch, as well as a nest site within the territory), traps may operate on any one of these scales.<ref name=misenhelter00>{{cite journal |last=Misenhelter |first=M.D. |authorlink= |author2=Rotenberry, J.T. |year=2000 |title=Choices and consequences of habitat occupancy and nest site selection in sage sparrows |journal=[[Ecology (journal)|Ecology]] |volume=81 |pages=2892\u20132901 |doi=10.1890/0012-9658(2000)081[2892:CACOHO]2.0.CO;2 |issn=0012-9658 |issue=10 }}</ref> Similarly, traps may operate on a temporal scale so that an altered environment may appear to cause a trap in one stage of an organism\u2019s life, yet have positive effects on later life stages.<ref name=schlaepfer02/> As a result, there has been a great deal of uncertainty as to how common traps may be, despite widespread acceptance as a theoretical possibility.<ref name=robertson06/> However, given the accelerated rate of ecological change driven by human land-use change, global warming, exotic species invasions, and changes in ecological communities resulting from species loss, ecological traps may be an increasing and highly underappreciated threat to biodiversity.\n\nA 2006 review of the literature on ecological traps provides guidelines for demonstrating the existence of an ecological trap.<ref name=robertson06/> A study must show a preference for one habitat over another (or equal preference) and that individuals selecting the preferred habitat (or equally preferred habitat) have lower fitness (i.e., experience lower survival or reproductive success).  Since the publication of that paper which found only a few well-documented examples of ecological traps, interest in ecological and evolutionary traps has grown very rapidly and new empirical examples are being published at an accelerating rate. There are now roughly 30 examples of ecological traps affecting a broad diversity of taxa including birds, mammals, arthropods, fish and reptiles.\n\nBecause ecological and evolutionary traps are still very poorly understood phenomena, many questions about their proximate and ultimate causes as well as their ecological consequences remain unanswered. Are traps simply an inevitable consequence of the inability of evolution to anticipate novelty or react quickly to rapid environmental change? How common are traps? Do ecological traps necessarily lead to population declines or extinctions or is it possible that they may persist indefinitely? Under what ecological and evolutionary conditions should this occur? Are organisms with certain characteristics predisposed to being \"trapped\"? Is rapid environmental change necessary to trigger traps? Can global warming, pollution or exotic invasive species create traps? Embracing genetic and phylogenetic approaches may provide more robust answers to the above questions as well as providing deeper insight into the proximate and ultimate basis for maladaptation in general{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}<!-- (see Crespi 2000) -->. Because ecological and evolutionary traps are predicted to add in concert with other sources of population decline, traps are an important research priority for conservation scientists. Given the rapid current rate of global environmental change, traps may be far more common than it is realized and it will be important to examine the proximate and ultimate causes of traps if management is to prevent or eliminate traps in the future.\n\n==Polarized light pollution==\n[[Polarized light pollution]] is perhaps the most compelling and well-documented cue triggering ecological traps.<ref>Horvath et al., in press as of Jan, 2013</ref> Orientation to polarized sources of light is the most important mechanism that guides at least 300 species of [[dragonflies]], [[mayflies]], [[caddisflies]], [[Tabanidae|tabanid flies]], [[diving beetle]]s, [[Heteroptera#.22Waterbug.22|water bugs]], and other [[aquatic insect]]s in their search for the water bodies they require for suitable feeding/breeding habitat and [[oviposition]] sites (Schwind 1991; Horv\u00e1th and Kriska 2008). Because of their strong linear polarization signature, artificial polarizing surfaces (e.g., asphalt, gravestones, cars, plastic sheeting, oil pools, windows) are commonly mistaken for bodies of water (Horv\u00e1th and Zeil 1996; Kriska et al. 1998, 2006a, 2007, 2008; Horv\u00e1th et al. 2007, 2008). Light reflected by these surfaces is often more highly polarized than that of light reflected by water, and artificial polarizers can be even more attractive to polarotactic aquatic insects than a water body (Horv\u00e1th and Zeil 1996; Horv\u00e1th et al. 1998; Kriska et al. 1998) and appear as exaggerated water surfaces acting as supernormal optical stimuli. Consequently, dragonflies, mayflies, caddisflies, and other water-seeking species actually prefer to mate, settle, swarm, and oviposit upon these surfaces than available water bodies.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Evolutionary mismatch]]\n* [[Source\u2013sink dynamics]]\n* [[Perceptual trap]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{Refbegin|2}}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2540.2000.00746.x | last1 = Crespi | first1 = B.J. | author-link1=Bernard Crespi | year = 2001 | title = The evolution of maladaptation | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 84 | issue = 6| pages = 623\u20139 | pmid = 10886377 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.tree.2007.03.014 | last1 = Gilroy | first1 = J.J. | last2 = Sutherland | first2 = W.J. | year = 2007 | title = Beyond ecological traps: perceptual errors and undervalued resources | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology and Evolution | volume = 22 | issue = 7| pages = 351\u2013356 | pmid = 17416438 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G\u00e1bor | last2 = Kriska | first2 = Gy\u00f6rgy | last3 = Malik | first3 = P\u00e9ter | last4 = Robertson | first4 = Bruce | title = Polarized light pollution: a new kind of ecological photopollution | journal = Frontiers in Ecology and the Environment | volume = 7 | pages = 317\u2013325 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1890/080129 | issue = 6 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1038/379303a0 | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Zeil | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Kuwait oil lakes as insect traps | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 379 | issue = 6563| pages = 303\u2013304 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s001140050503 | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Bern\u00e1th | first2 = B | last3 = Moln\u00e1r | first3 = G. | year = 1998 | title = Dragonflies find crude oil visually more attractive than water: Multiple-choice experiments on dragonfly polarotaxis | url = | journal = Naturwissenschaften | volume = 85 | issue = 6| pages = 292\u2013297 }}\n*{{cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2427.2007.01798.x | last1 = Horv\u00e1th | first1 = G | last2 = Malik | first2 = P | last3 = Kriska | first3 = G | last4 = Wildermuth | first4 = H. | year = 2007 | title = Ecological traps for dragonflies in a cemetery: the attraction of Sympetrum species (Odonata: Libellulidae) by horizontally polarizing black gravestones | url = | journal = Freshwater Biol | volume = 52 | issue = 9| pages = 1700\u20131709 }}\n*{{cite journal | last1 = Kriska | first1 = G | last2 = Horv\u00e1th | first2 = G | last3 = Andrikovics | first3 = S. | year = 1998 | title = Why do mayflies lay their eggs en masse on dry asphalt roads?

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower.

It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower.

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble.

The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand. Similar was the case in Kashmir where imported Iranian saffron is mixed with local saffron and sold as \"Kashmir brand\" at a higher price.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.academia.edu/30720498 |title=Sustainable Saffron (''Crocus sativus'' Kashmirianus) Production: Technological and Policy Interventions for Kashmir |author1=Amjad Masood Husaini |author2=Azra N.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

Varieties (not varieties in the botanical sense) from Spain, including the tradenames \"Spanish Superior\" and \"Creme\", are generally mellower in colour, flavour, and aroma; they are graded by government-imposed standards. Italian varieties are slightly more potent than Spanish.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (''Crocus sativus'' 'Hausknechtii') in [[Derbent]], [[Isfahan]], and [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles,{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=2}} ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=17\u201318}} Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed into hot teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy.

It probably descends from the eastern Mediterranean autumn-flowering ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]'',{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}} which is also known as \"wild saffron\"{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=24}} and originated in [[Crete]] or [[Central Asia]].{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} ''[[Crocus thomasii|C.&nbsp;thomasii]]'' and ''[[Crocus pallasii|C.&nbsp;pallasii]]'' are other possible sources.{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=28}} As a genetically monomorphic clone,{{Sfn|Rubio-Moraga|Castillo-L\u00f3pez|G\u00f3mez-G\u00f3mez|Ahrazem|2009}} it slowly propagated throughout much of [[Eurasia]].\n\nIt is a sterile [[polyploidy|triploid]] form, which means that three homologous sets of [[chromosome]]s make up each specimen's genetic complement; ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' bears eight chromosomal bodies per set, making for 24 in total.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Being sterile, the purple flowers of ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' fail to produce viable seeds; reproduction hinges on human assistance: clusters of [[corm]]s, underground, bulb-like, starch-storing organs, must be dug up, divided, and replanted. A corm survives for one season, producing via this vegetative division up to ten \"cormlets\" that can grow into new plants in the next season.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}} The compact corms are small, brown globules that can measure as large as {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in diameter, have a flat base, and are shrouded in a dense mat of parallel fibres; this coat is referred to as the \"corm tunic\". Corms also bear vertical fibres, thin and net-like, that grow up to {{Convert|5|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} above the plant's neck.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\nThe plant sprouts 5\u201311 white and non-[[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] leaves known as [[cataphyll]]s. These membrane-like structures cover and protect 5 to 11 true leaves as they bud and develop on the crocus flower. The latter are thin, straight, and blade-like green foliage leaves, which are {{Convert|1|\u2013|3|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}, in diameter, which either expand after the flowers have opened (\"hysteranthous\") or do so simultaneously with their blooming (\"synanthous\"). ''C.&nbsp;sativus'' cataphylls are suspected by some to manifest prior to blooming when the plant is irrigated relatively early in the growing season. Its floral axes, or flower-bearing structures, bear [[bract]]eoles, or specialised leaves, that sprout from the flower stems; the latter are known as [[pedicel (botany)|pedicels]].{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} After [[Aestivation (botany)|aestivating]] in spring, the plant sends up its true leaves, each up to {{Convert|40|cm|abbr=on}} in length. Only in October, after most other flowering plants have released their seeds, do its brilliantly hued flowers develop; they range from a light pastel shade of lilac to a darker and more striated mauve.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=3}} The flowers possess a sweet, honey-like fragrance. Upon flowering, the plants are {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in height and bear up to four flowers. A three-pronged [[style (botany)|style]] {{Convert|25|\u2013|30|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} in length, emerges from each flower. Each prong terminates with a vivid crimson [[stigma (botany)|stigma]], which are the distal end of a [[carpel]].{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}}\n\n===Cultivation===\nThe saffron crocus, unknown in the wild, probably descends from ''[[Crocus cartwrightianus]]''. It is a [[polyploid|triploid]] that is \"self-incompatible\" and male sterile; it undergoes aberrant [[meiosis]] and is hence incapable of independent sexual reproduction\u2014all propagation is by [[vegetative reproduction|vegetative multiplication]] via manual \"divide-and-set\" of a starter clone or by interspecific hybridisation.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=30\u201331}}{{Sfn|Grilli Caiola|2003|p=1}}\n\n''Crocus sativus'' thrives in the Mediterranean [[Maquis shrubland|maquis]], an ecotype superficially resembling the North American [[chaparral]], and similar climates where hot and dry summer breezes sweep semi-arid lands. It can nonetheless survive cold winters, tolerating frosts as low as {{Convert|\u221210|C|0}} and short periods of snow cover.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=1}}{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=2\u20133}} Irrigation is required if grown outside of moist environments such as [[Kashmir]], where annual rainfall averages {{Convert|1000|\u2013|1500|mm|in|abbr=on}}; saffron-growing regions in Greece ({{Convert|500|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}} annually) and Spain ({{Convert|400|mm|in|abbr=on|disp=or}}) are far drier than the main cultivating Iranian regions. What makes this possible is the timing of the local wet seasons; generous spring rains and drier summers are optimal. Rain immediately preceding flowering boosts saffron yields; rainy or cold weather during flowering promotes disease and reduces yields. Persistently damp and hot conditions harm the crops,{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=2}} and rabbits, rats, and birds cause damage by digging up corms. [[Nematode]]s, leaf [[rust (fungus)|rusts]], and corm rot pose other threats. Yet ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' inoculation may provide some benefit to growers by speeding corm growth and increasing stigma biomass yield.{{Sfn|Sharaf-Eldin et al.|2008}}\n\nThe plants fare poorly in shady conditions; they grow best in full sunlight. Fields that slope towards the sunlight are optimal (i.e., south-sloping in the Northern Hemisphere). Planting is mostly done in June in the Northern Hemisphere, where corms are lodged {{Convert|7|\u2013|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep; its roots, stems, and leaves can develop between October and February.{{Sfn|Kafi et al.|2006|p=23}} Planting depth and corm spacing, in concert with climate, are critical factors in determining yields. Mother corms planted deeper yield higher-quality saffron, though form fewer flower buds and daughter corms. Italian growers optimise thread yield by planting {{Convert|15|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} deep and in rows {{Convert|2|\u2013|3|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} apart; depths of {{Convert|8|\u2013|10|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} optimise flower and corm production. Greek, Moroccan, and Spanish growers employ distinct depths and spacings that suit their locales.\n\n''C.&nbsp;sativus'' prefers friable, loose, low-density, well-watered, and well-drained clay-[[calcareous]] soils with high organic content. Traditional raised beds promote good drainage. Soil organic content was historically boosted via application of some {{Convert|20|\u2013|30|t|LT ST}} of manure per hectare. Afterwards, and with no further manure application, corms were planted.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} After a period of dormancy through the summer, the corms send up their narrow leaves and begin to bud in early autumn. Only in mid-autumn do they flower. Harvests are by necessity a speedy affair: after blossoming at dawn, flowers quickly wilt as the day passes.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=3\u20134}} All plants bloom within a window of one or two weeks.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|p=4}} Stigmas are dried quickly upon extraction and (preferably) sealed in airtight containers.{{Sfn|Negbi|1999|p=8}}\n\n===Harvesting===\nThe high retail value of saffron is maintained on world markets because of labour-intensive harvesting methods, which require some 200,000 saffron stigmas to be hand-picked from 70,000 crocus flowers for each {{convert|1|lb}} of saffron product.<ref name=hooker/><ref name=cnn/>{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=273}}{{Sfn|Rau|1969|p=35}} Forty hours of labour are needed to pick 150,000 flowers.<ref>{{cite news|last=Lak |first=Daniel |date=11 November 1998 |title=Kashmiris pin hopes on saffron |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/212491.stm |accessdate=11 September 2011}}</ref>\n\nOne freshly picked crocus flower yields an average {{Convert|30|mg|oz|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron or {{Convert|7|mg|oz|abbr=on}} dried; roughly 150 flowers yield {{Convert|1|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dry saffron threads; to produce {{Convert|12|g|oz|abbr=on}} of dried saffron, {{Convert|1|lb|abbr=on}} of flowers are needed; {{Convert|1|lb|kg|abbr=on}} of fresh saffron yields {{Convert|0.2|oz|g|abbr=on}} of dried spice.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=3}} \n\n==Spice==\n\n===Phytochemistry and sensory properties===\n[[File:Picrocrocin.svg|thumb|Structure of picrocrocin:{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}}\n{|\n|-\n|{{Legend|#AEAEFF|[[Anomer|\u03b2]]\u2013[[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]-glucopyranose derivative}}\n|-\n|{{Legend|#F5D76C|safranal moiety}}\n|}\n]]\n[[File:Crocetin safranal esterification.png|thumb|[[Esterification|Esterification reaction]] between [[crocetin]] and [[gentiobiose]].

This means that the crocin underlying saffron's aroma is a digentiobiose ester of the carotenoid crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocins themselves are a series of [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]] carotenoids that are either [[glycosyl|monoglycosyl]] or diglycosyl [[polyene]] esters of crocetin.{{Sfn|Abdullaev|2002|p=1}} Crocetin is a [[conjugated system|conjugated]] polyene [[carboxylic acid|dicarboxylic acid]] that is [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], and thus oil-soluble. When crocetin is [[esterification|esterified]] with two water-soluble gentiobioses, which are [[carbohydrate|sugars]], a product results that is itself water-soluble. The resultant \u03b1-crocin is a carotenoid pigment that may make up more than 10% of dry saffron's mass. The two esterified gentiobioses make \u03b1-crocin ideal for colouring water-based and non-fatty foods such as rice dishes.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=422}}\n\nThe bitter [[glucoside]] [[picrocrocin]] is responsible for saffron's [[pungency|pungent flavour]].<ref name=dhar/> Picrocrocin ([[chemical formula]]: {{Chem|C|16|H|26|O|7}}; systematic name: 4-(\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyloxy)-2,6,6-trimethylcyclohex-1-ene-1-carboxaldehyde) is a union of an [[aldehyde]] sub-molecule known as [[safranal]] (systematic name: 2,6,6-trimethylcyclohexa-1,3-diene-1-carboxaldehyde) and a carbohydrate. It has insecticidal and pesticidal properties, and may comprise up to 4% of dry saffron. Picrocrocin is a truncated version of the carotenoid [[zeaxanthin]] that is produced via [[redox|oxidative]] cleavage, and is the [[glycoside]] of the [[terpene]] [[aldehyde]] safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}}\n\nWhen saffron is dried after its harvest, the heat, combined with enzymatic action, splits picrocrocin to yield [[Monosaccharide#Isomerism|D]]\u2013[[glucose]] and a free safranal molecule.{{Sfn|Deo|2003|p=4}} Safranal, a [[essential oil|volatile]] oil, gives saffron much of its distinctive aroma.{{Sfn|McGee|2004|p=423}}{{Sfn|Dharmananda|2005}} Safranal is less bitter than picrocrocin and may comprise up to 70% of dry saffron's volatile fraction in some samples.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=1}} A second molecule underlying saffron's aroma is 2-hydroxy-4,4,6-trimethyl-2,5-cyclohexadien-1-one, which produces a scent described as saffron, dried hay-like.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Chemists find this is the most powerful contributor to saffron's fragrance, despite its presence in a lesser quantity than safranal.{{Sfn|Leffingwell|2002|p=3}} Dry saffron is highly sensitive to fluctuating [[pH]] levels, and rapidly breaks down chemically in the presence of light and [[redox|oxidising]] agents. It must, therefore, be stored away in air-tight containers to minimise contact with atmospheric oxygen. Saffron is somewhat more resistant to heat.\n\n===Grades and ISO 3632 categories===\n[[File:Iran saffron threads.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Red threads and yellow styles from Iran]]\n[[File:Safran-Weinviertel Niederreiter 2 Gramm 8285.jpg|thumb|left|upright|High quality red threads from Austrian saffron]]\n[[File:Pure Kashmiri saffron pack 08.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Kashmir]]i saffron package]]\n\nSaffron is not all of the same quality and strength. Strength is related to several factors including the amount of style picked along with the red stigma. Age of the saffron is also a factor. More style included means the saffron is less strong gram for gram because the colour and flavour are concentrated in the red stigmas. Saffron from [[Iran]], [[Spain]] and [[Kashmir]] is classified into various grades according to the relative amounts of red stigma and yellow styles it contains. Grades of Iranian saffron are: \"sargol\" (red stigma tips only, strongest grade), \"pushal\" or \"pushali\" (red stigmas plus some yellow style, lower strength), \"bunch\" saffron (red stigmas plus large amount of yellow style, presented in a tiny bundle like a miniature wheatsheaf) and \"konge\" (yellow style only, claimed to have aroma but with very little, if any, colouring potential). Grades of Spanish saffron are \"coup\u00e9\" (the strongest grade, like Iranian sargol), \"mancha\" (like Iranian pushal), and in order of further decreasing strength \"rio\", \"standard\" and \"sierra\" saffron. The word \"mancha\" in the Spanish classification can have two meanings: a general grade of saffron or a very high quality Spanish-grown saffron from a specific geographical origin. Real Spanish-grown La Mancha saffron has [[Geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union#Protected designation of origin (PDO)|PDO]] protected status and this is displayed on the product packaging. Spanish growers fought hard for Protected Status because they felt that imports of Iranian saffron re-packaged in Spain and sold as \"Spanish Mancha saffron\" were undermining the genuine La Mancha brand.

Artisan producers in Europe and New Zealand have offset their higher labour charges for saffron harvesting by targeting quality, only offering extremely high-grade saffron.\n\nIn addition to descriptions based on how the saffron is picked, saffron may be categorised under the international standard ISO 3632 after laboratory measurement of crocin (responsible for saffron's colour), picrocrocin (taste), and safranal (fragrance or aroma) content.{{Sfn|Verma|Middha|2010|p=1\u20132}} However, often there is no clear grading information on the product packaging and little of the saffron readily available in the UK is labelled with ISO category. This lack of information makes it hard for customers to make informed choices when comparing prices and buying saffron.\n\nUnder ISO 3632, determination of non-stigma content (\"floral waste content\") and other extraneous matter such as inorganic material (\"[[Ash (analytical chemistry)|ash]]\") are also key. Grading standards are set by the [[International Organization for Standardization]], a federation of national standards bodies. ISO 3632 deals exclusively with saffron and establishes three categories: III (poorest quality), II, and I (finest quality). Formerly there was also category IV, which was below category III. Samples are assigned categories by gauging the spice's crocin and picrocrocin content, revealed by measurements of specific spectrophotometric [[absorbance]]. Safranal is treated slightly differently and rather than there being threshold levels for each category, samples must give a reading of 20\u201350 for all categories.\n\nThese data are measured through [[spectrophotometry]] reports at certified testing laboratories worldwide. Higher absorbances imply greater levels of crocin, picrocrocin and safranal, and thus a greater colouring potential and therefore strength per gram. The absorbance reading of crocin is known as the \"colouring strength\" of that saffron. Saffron's colouring strength can range from lower than 80 (for all category IV saffron) up to 200 or greater (for category I). The world's finest samples (the selected, most red-maroon, tips of stigmas picked from the finest flowers) receive colouring strengths in excess of 250, making such saffron over three times more powerful than category IV saffron. Market prices for saffron types follow directly from these ISO categories. Sargol and coup\u00e9 saffron would typically fall into ISO 3632 category I. Pushal and Mancha would probably be assigned to category II. On many saffron packaging labels, neither the ISO 3632 category nor the colouring strength (the measurement of crocin content) is displayed.\n\nHowever, many growers, traders, and consumers reject such lab test numbers. Some people prefer a more holistic method of sampling batches of threads for taste, aroma, pliability, and other traits in a fashion similar to that practised by experienced wine tasters.{{Sfn|Hill|2004|p=274}} However, ISO 3632 grade and colouring strength information allow consumers to make instant comparisons between the quality of different saffron brands, without needing to purchase and sample the saffron. In particular, consumers can work out a value for money based on price per unit of colouring strength rather than price per gram, given the wide possible range of colouring strengths that different kinds of saffron can have.\n\n===Adulteration===\n\nDespite attempts at quality control and standardisation, an extensive history of saffron [[adulteration]], particularly among the cheapest grades, continues into modern times. Adulteration was first documented in Europe's Middle Ages, when those found selling adulterated saffron were executed under the ''Safranschou'' code.{{Sfn|Willard|2002|pp=102\u2013104}} Typical methods include mixing in extraneous substances like [[beetroot]], [[pomegranate]] fibres, red-dyed silk fibres, or the saffron crocus's tasteless and odourless yellow stamens. Other methods included dousing saffron fibres with viscid substances like [[honey]] or vegetable oil to increase their weight. Powdered saffron is more prone to adulteration, with [[turmeric]], [[paprika]], and other powders used as diluting fillers. Adulteration can also consist of selling mislabelled mixes of different saffron grades. Thus, high-grade Kashmiri saffron is often sold and mixed with cheaper Iranian imports; these mixes are then marketed as pure Kashmiri saffron, a development that has cost Kashmiri growers much of their income.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.firstpost.com/long-reads/kashmirs-saffron-harvest-sees-sharp-decline-4216123.html|title=Kashmir's saffron harvest sees sharp decline |website=Firstpost|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://freepresskashmir.com/2018/09/22/from-35kgs-earlier-to-1kg-yield-now-successful-saffron-mission-paves-way-for-apples-in-pampore/|title=From 35kgs earlier to 1kg yield now, 'successful' Saffron Mission paves way for apples in Pampore|last=Rashid|first=Afshan|date=2018-09-22|website=Free Press Kashmir|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-01-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2003 |title=Kashmiri Saffron Producers See Red over Iranian Imports |publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corp.]] |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/1504154 |accessdate=29 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hussain |first=A. |date=28 January 2005 |title=Saffron Industry in Deep Distress |work=BBC News |location=London |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4216493.stm |accessdate=15 September 2011}}</ref> [[Safflower]] is a common substitute sometimes sold as saffron.

The \"Aquila\" saffron, or ''zafferano dell'Aquila'', is defined by high safranal and crocin content, distinctive thread shape, unusually pungent aroma, and intense colour; it is grown exclusively on eight hectares in the Navelli Valley of Italy's [[Abruzzo]] region, near [[L'Aquila]]. It was first introduced to Italy by a Dominican friar from inquisition-era Spain.{{when|date=October 2016}} But the biggest saffron cultivation in Italy is in [[San Gavino Monreale]], Sardinia, where it is grown on 40 hectares, representing 60% of Italian production; it too has unusually high crocin, picrocrocin, and safranal content. Another is the \"Mongra\" or \"Lacha\" saffron of Kashmir (''Crocus sativus'' 'Cashmirianus'), which is among the most difficult for consumers to obtain. Repeated droughts, blights, and crop failures in Kashmir combine with an Indian export ban, contribute to its prohibitive overseas prices.

SARS-CoV-2 is [[Contagious disease|contagious]] in humans, and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) has designated [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|the ongoing pandemic]] of COVID-19 a <!--It is both a pandemic and a PHEIC.

The virus is primarily spread between people through close contact and via [[respiratory droplets]] produced from coughs or sneezes.<ref name=\"WHO2020QA\" /><ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /> It mainly [[Viral entry|enters]] human cells by binding to the receptor [[angiotensin converting enzyme 2]] (ACE2).<ref name=\"HoffmanCell\" />\n\n==Virology==\n===Infection===\nHuman-to-human [[Transmission

(medicine)#Droplet infection|respiratory droplets]] from coughs and sneezes within a range of about {{convert|1.8|m|ft|0|adj=ri1}}.<ref name=\"CDCTrans\" /><ref name=\"NBCSpread\" /> Indirect contact via [[Fomite|contaminated surfaces]] is another possible cause of infection.<ref name=\"WHO-Workplace\" /> Preliminary research indicates that the virus may remain viable on plastic and steel for up to three days, but does not survive on cardboard for more than one day or on copper for more than four hours;<ref name=\"NEJM-Stability\" /> the virus is inactivated by soap, which destabilises its [[lipid bilayer]].<ref name=\"AtlanticSuccess\" /><ref name=\"NatGeoSoap\" /> Viral RNA has also been found in [[Stool test|stool sample]]s from infected people.<ref name=\"NEJM-FirstUS\" />\n\nThe degree to which the virus is infectious during the [[incubation period]] is uncertain, but research has indicated that the [[Pharynx|pharynx]] reaches peak [[Viral load|viral load]] approximately four days after infection.<ref name=\"NaturePeakLoad\" /><ref name=\"ScienceFlawed\" /> On 1 February 2020, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) indicated that \"transmission from asymptomatic cases is likely not a major driver of transmission\".<ref name=\"WHO-SR12\" /> However, an epidemiological model of the beginning of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic in mainland China|outbreak in China]] suggested that \"pre-symptomatic shedding may be typical among documented infections\" and that [[subclinical infection]]s may have been the source of a majority of infections.<ref

SARS-CoV-2]]\n\nThe first known infections from the SARS-CoV-2 strain were discovered in [[Wuhan]], China.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /> The original source of viral transmission to humans remains unclear, as does whether the strain became [[pathogen]]ic before or after the [[spillover event]].<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"PopSciJan\" /><ref name=\"Proximal\" /> Because many of the first individuals found to be infected by the virus were workers at the [[Huanan Seafood Market]],<ref name=\"LancetClinical\" /><ref name=\"LancetCharacteristics\" /> it has been suggested that the strain might have originated from the market.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"nature feb2020\" /> However, other research indicates that visitors may have introduced the virus to the market, which then facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS outbreak]] has resulted in the discovery of many [[Bat SARS-like coronavirus WIV1|SARS-like bat coronaviruses]], most originating in the ''Rhinolophus'' genus of [[horseshoe bats]], and two viral [[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated RaTG13, has a 96% resemblance to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NatureZhou\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat3\" /> Bats are considered the most likely natural reservoir of SARS-CoV-2,<ref name=\"WHOChinaJoint\" /><ref name=\"LancetBinding\" /> but differences between the bat coronavirus and SARS-CoV-2 suggest that humans were infected via an intermediate host.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\nA [[metagenomic]] study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching and trading]] for use in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] remains common.<ref name=\"TelegraphPangolins\" /><ref name=\"NYT-Ban\" />\n\nMicrobiologists and geneticists in [[Texas]] have independently found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the intermediate host; in comparison, the SARS virus responsible for the 2002\u20132004 outbreak shared 99.8% of its genome with a known [[civet]] coronavirus.<ref name=\"nature feb2020\" />\n\n===Phylogenetics and taxonomy===\n{{Infobox genome\n| image   = File:SARS-CoV-2 genome.svg\n| caption = [[Genomic]] organisation of isolate Wuhan-Hu-1, the earliest sequenced sample of

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS).

He had been active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], founding and supervising the monastery of [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near [[Warsaw]], operating an [[amateur radio |amateur-radio]] station (SP3RN), and founding or running several other organizations and publications.\n \nOn 10 October 1982 [[Pope John Paul II]] [[canonization |canonized]] Father Kolbe and declared him a [[martyr of charity]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church | Catholic Church]] venerates him as the [[patron saint]] of amateur-radio operators, of drug addicts, of [[political prisoner]]s, of families, of journalists, of prisoners, and of the [[pro-life movement]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> John Paul II declared him \"The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century\".<ref name=\"Holy Mass at the Brzezinka Concentration Camp\"/> His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death.\n\nDue to Kolbe's efforts to promote [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]], he is known as the ''Apostle of Consecration to Mary''.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-51\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nRajmund Kolbe  was born shrek\u00df\u0153 on 8 January 1894 in [[Zdu\u0144ska Wola]], in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the second son of weaver Julius Kolbe and [[Midwifery|midwife]] Maria D\u0105browska.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> His father was an [[ethnic German]]<ref name=\"Strzelecka1984\"/> and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. He had four brothers. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to [[Pabianice]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe's life was strongly influenced in 1906, when he was 12, by a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> He later described this incident:\n\n<blockquote>That night I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-50\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Franciscan friar===\nIn 1907 Kolbe and his elder brother Francis joined the [[Conventual Franciscans]].<ref name=catholic-pages/> They enrolled at the Conventual Franciscan minor seminary in [[Lviv|Lwow]] later that year. In 1910, Kolbe was allowed to enter the [[novitiate]], where he was given the [[religious name]] Maximilian. He professed his [[first vows]] in 1911, and [[final vows]] in 1914,<ref name=\"Patron\"/> adopting the additional name of Maria (Mary).<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe was sent to [[Rome]] in 1912, where he attended the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He earned a [[doctor of philosophy|doctorate in philosophy]] in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the [[Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure]], where he earned a [[doctor of theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1919<ref name=\"psb296\"/> or 1922<ref name=\"Patron\"/> (sources vary). He was active in the [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]]. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against [[Pope Pius X|Popes St. Pius X]] and [[Benedict XV]] in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the [[Freemasons]]. According to Kolbe, \n\n<blockquote>They placed the black standard of the \"[[Giordano Bruno|Giordano Brunisti]]\" under the windows of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. On this standard the archangel, [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]], was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully.<ref name=\"biosummary\"/><ref name=\"anniversary\"/></blockquote> \n\nSoon afterward, on 16 October 1917, Kolbe organized the [[Militia Immaculatae]] (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: \n\n<blockquote>O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. ''And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee''.<ref name=\"Daily Prayers\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1918, Kolbe was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest.<ref name=ewtn/> In July 1919 he returned to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland, which was newly independent]]. He was active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. He was strongly opposed to leftist \u2013 in particular, [[communist]] \u2013 movements.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> \n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 he taught at the [[Krak\u00f3w seminary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> Around that time, as well as earlier in Rome, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]], which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties. TB was generally considered fatal, with rest and good nutrition the best treatment, as antibiotics had not been developed to treat it.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nIn January 1922 Kolbe founded the monthly periodical ''[[Rycerz Niepokalanej]]'' (''Knight of the Immaculata''), a devotional publication based on French ''[[Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus]]'' (''Messenger of the Heart of Jesus''). From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in [[Grodno]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/> As his activities grew in scope, in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near Warsaw. It became a major religious publishing centre.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> A junior seminary was opened there two years later.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> \n\n===Missionary work in Asia===\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Kolbe undertook a series of [[mission (Christian)|missions]] to [[East Asia]]. He arrived first in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], but failed to gather a following there.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> Next he moved to [[Japan]], where by 1931 he had founded a [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual|Franciscan monastery]], ''Mugenzai no Sono'', on the outskirts of [[Nagasaki]].  \n\nKolbe had started publishing a Japanese edition of the ''Knight of the Immaculata'' (''Seibo no Kishi'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Kolbe had the monastery built on a mountainside. According to [[Shinto]] beliefs, this was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. However, when the United States dropped the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Nagasaki]], the Franciscan monastery survived, unlike the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]], because it was on the side of the mountain which took the main force of the blast.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> \n\nIn mid-1932 Kolbe left Japan for [[Malabar region|Malabar]], [[India]], where he founded another monastery.

Once he was smuggled to a prison hospital by friendly inmates.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb297\"/> At the end of July 1941, one prisoner escaped from the camp, prompting [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Karl Fritzsch]], the deputy camp commander, to pick ten men to be starved to death in an underground bunker to deter further escape attempts. When one of the selected men, [[Franciszek Gajowniczek]], cried out, \"My wife!

Each time the guards checked on him, he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. After they had been starved and deprived of water for two weeks, only Kolbe remained alive. The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of [[phenol|carbolic acid]]. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection.<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> He died on 14 August. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the [[calendar of saints|feast day]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/>\n\n==Canonization==\nOn 12 May 1955 Kolbe was recognized by the Vatican as a [[Servant of God]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Kolbe was declared [[venerable]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 January 1969, [[beatification|beatified]] as a [[Confessor of the Faith]] by the same Pope in 1971, and [[canonized]] as a [[saint]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 10 October 1982.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Plunka2012\"/> Upon canonization, the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe as a confessor, and a [[martyr]] of charity.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> The miracles that were used to confirm his beatification were the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela Testoni, and in August 1950, the cure of calcification of the arteries/sclerosis of Francis Ranier; both attributed to Kolbe's intercession by their prayers to him.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n[[File:WestminsterAbbey-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of Kolbe (left) above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey]]\nAfter his canonization, a feast day for St. Maximilian Kolbe was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]]. He is one of ten 20th-century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of [[Anglican]] [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref name=\"westminster\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\nKolbe's recognition as a [[Christian martyrs|Christian martyr]] generated some controversy within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> While his self-sacrifice at Auschwitz was considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed out of ''odium fidei'' (hatred of the faith), but as the result of his act of [[Charity (virtue)|Christian charity]] toward another man. [[Pope Paul VI]] recognized this distinction at Kolbe's beatification, naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title \"martyr of charity\". Pope John Paul II, however, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity). John Paul II wanted to make the point that the Nazis systematic hatred of whole categories of humanity was inherently also a hatred of religious (Christian) faith; he said that Kolbe's death equated to earlier examples of religious martyrdom.<ref name=peterson/>\n\nKolbe has been accused of [[antisemitism]]. In 1926, in the first issue of the monthly Knight of the Immaculate, Father Kolbe said he considered Freemasons ''as an organized clique of fanatical Jews, who want to destroy the church.'' Writing in a calendar that the publishing house of his organization, the Militia of the Immaculate, published in an edition of a million in 1939, Father Kolbe said: \"''Atheistic Communism seems to rage ever more wildly. Its origin can easily be located in that criminal mafia that calls itself Freemasonry, and the hand that is guiding all that toward a clear goal is international Zionism. Which should not be taken to mean that even among Jews one cannot find good people.''\"<ref>New York Times, 19 November 1982 'Saint charged with bigotry' [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/saint-charged-with-bigotry-clerics-say-no.html&usg=AOvVaw0Y7PFO6rmsgqrLHeEtJiFQ]</ref> Newspapers he published printed articles about topics such as a [[Zionism|Zionist]] plot for world domination.<ref name=\"Dershowitz1992\"/><ref name=\"jta\"/><ref name=\"Michael2008\"/> Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] criticized Kolbe's activities as \"writing and organizing mass propaganda for the Catholic Church, with a clear anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic edge.\"<ref name=jta/><ref name=\"Zizek2012\"/> However, a number of writers pointed out that the \"Jewish question played a very minor role in Kolbe's thought and work\".<ref name=jta/><ref name=BeckyReady/> On those grounds allegations of Kolbe's antisemitism have been denounced by [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholars]] Daniel L.

Since his [[beatification]] in 1971, more than 1,000 such relics have been distributed around the world for public veneration.

Franciscans|Conventual Franciscan]] [[friar]] who volunteered to die in place of a stranger in the German [[extermination camp | death camp]] of [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]], located in [[Occupation of Poland (1939\u20131945) | German-occupied Poland]] during [[World War II]]. He had been active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]], founding and supervising the monastery of [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near [[Warsaw]], operating an [[amateur radio |amateur-radio]] station (SP3RN), and founding or running several other organizations and publications.\n \nOn 10 October 1982 [[Pope John Paul II]] [[canonization |canonized]] Father Kolbe and declared him a [[martyr of charity]]. The [[Roman Catholic Church | Catholic Church]] venerates him as the [[patron saint]] of amateur-radio operators, of drug addicts, of [[political prisoner]]s, of families, of journalists, of prisoners, and of the [[pro-life movement]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> John Paul II declared him \"The Patron Saint of Our Difficult Century\".<ref name=\"Holy Mass at the Brzezinka Concentration Camp\"/> His feast day is 14 August, the day of his death.\n\nDue to Kolbe's efforts to promote [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]], he is known as the ''Apostle of Consecration to Mary''.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-51\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n===Childhood===\nRajmund Kolbe  was born on 8 January 1894 in [[Zdu\u0144ska Wola]], in the [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was then part of the [[Russian Empire]]. He was the second son of weaver Julius Kolbe and [[Midwifery|midwife]] Maria D\u0105browska.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> His father was an [[ethnic German]]<ref name=\"Strzelecka1984\"/> and his mother was [[Poles|Polish]]. He had four brothers. Shortly after his birth, his family moved to [[Pabianice]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe's life was strongly influenced in 1906, when he was 12, by a vision of the [[Virgin Mary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/> He later described this incident:\n\n<blockquote>That night I asked the Mother of God what was to become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.<ref name=\"ArmstrongPeterson2010-50\"/></blockquote>\n\n===Franciscan friar===\nIn 1907 Kolbe and his elder brother Francis joined the [[Conventual Franciscans]].<ref name=catholic-pages/> They enrolled at the Conventual Franciscan minor seminary in [[Lviv|Lwow]] later that year. In 1910, Kolbe was allowed to enter the [[novitiate]], where he was given the [[religious name]] Maximilian. He professed his [[first vows]] in 1911, and [[final vows]] in 1914,<ref name=\"Patron\"/> adopting the additional name of Maria (Mary).<ref name=\"psb296\"/>\n\nKolbe was sent to [[Rome]] in 1912, where he attended the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]]. He earned a [[doctor of philosophy|doctorate in philosophy]] in 1915 there. From 1915 he continued his studies at the [[Pontifical University of St. Bonaventure]], where he earned a [[doctor of theology|doctorate in theology]] in 1919<ref name=\"psb296\"/> or 1922<ref name=\"Patron\"/> (sources vary). He was active in the [[consecration and entrustment to Mary]]. During his time as a student, he witnessed vehement demonstrations against [[Pope Pius X|Popes St. Pius X]] and [[Benedict XV]] in Rome during an anniversary celebration by the [[Freemasons]]. According to Kolbe, \n\n<blockquote>They placed the black standard of the \"[[Giordano Bruno|Giordano Brunisti]]\" under the windows of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. On this standard the archangel, [[Michael (archangel)|St. Michael]], was depicted lying under the feet of the triumphant Lucifer. At the same time, countless pamphlets were distributed to the people in which the Holy Father (i.e., the Pope) was attacked shamefully.<ref name=\"biosummary\"/><ref name=\"anniversary\"/></blockquote> \n\nSoon afterward, on 16 October 1917, Kolbe organized the [[Militia Immaculatae]] (Army of the Immaculate One), to work for conversion of sinners and enemies of the Catholic Church, specifically the Freemasons, through the intercession of the Virgin Mary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> So serious was Kolbe about this goal that he added to the Miraculous Medal prayer: \n\n<blockquote>O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. ''And for all those who do not have recourse to thee; especially the Masons and all those recommended to thee''.<ref name=\"Daily Prayers\"/></blockquote>\n\nIn 1918, Kolbe was [[Holy Orders|ordained]] a priest.<ref name=ewtn/> In July 1919 he returned to [[Second Polish Republic|Poland, which was newly independent]]. He was active in promoting the veneration of the [[Immaculate Conception|Immaculate]] [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin Mary]]. He was strongly opposed to leftist \u2013 in particular, [[communist]] \u2013 movements.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> \n\nFrom 1919 to 1922 he taught at the [[Krak\u00f3w seminary]].<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> Around that time, as well as earlier in Rome, he suffered from [[tuberculosis]], which forced him to take a lengthy leave of absence from his teaching duties. TB was generally considered fatal, with rest and good nutrition the best treatment, as antibiotics had not been developed to treat it.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nIn January 1922 Kolbe founded the monthly periodical ''[[Rycerz Niepokalanej]]'' (''Knight of the Immaculata''), a devotional publication based on French ''[[Le Messager du Coeur de Jesus]]'' (''Messenger of the Heart of Jesus''). From 1922 to 1926 he operated a religious publishing press in [[Grodno]].<ref name=\"psb296\"/> As his activities grew in scope, in 1927 he founded a new Conventual Franciscan monastery at [[Niepokalan\u00f3w]] near Warsaw. It became a major religious publishing centre.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> A junior seminary was opened there two years later.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> \n\n===Missionary work in Asia===\nBetween 1930 and 1933, Kolbe undertook a series of [[mission (Christian)|missions]] to [[East Asia]]. He arrived first in [[Shanghai]], [[China]], but failed to gather a following there.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> Next he moved to [[Japan]], where by 1931 he had founded a [[Order of Friars Minor Conventual|Franciscan monastery]], ''Mugenzai no Sono'', on the outskirts of [[Nagasaki]].  \n\nKolbe had started publishing a Japanese edition of the ''Knight of the Immaculata'' (''Seibo no Kishi'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/><ref name=ewtn/> The monastery he founded remains prominent in the Roman Catholic Church in Japan.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Kolbe had the monastery built on a mountainside. According to [[Shinto]] beliefs, this was not the side best suited to be in harmony with nature. However, when the United States dropped the [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bomb on Nagasaki]], the Franciscan monastery survived, unlike the [[Immaculate Conception Cathedral, Nagasaki|Immaculate Conception Cathedral]], because it was on the side of the mountain which took the main force of the blast.<ref name=\"guardian\"/> \n\nIn mid-1932 Kolbe left Japan for [[Malabar region|Malabar]], [[India]], where he founded another monastery. This one closed after a while.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n===Return to Poland===\nMeanwhile, in his absence the monastery at Niepokalan\u00f3w began to publish a daily newspaper, ''Ma\u0142y Dziennik'' (''the Small Diary''), in alliance with a political group, the [[National Radical Camp (1934)|National Radical Camp]] (''Ob\u00f3z Narodowo Radykalny'').<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> This publication reached a circulation of 137,000, and nearly double that, 225,000 on weekends.<ref name=\"Media katolickie w III Rzeczypospolitej (1989\u20132009)\"/> Kolbe returned to Poland in 1933 for a general chapter of the order in Krakow.<ref>{{cite book|author=Elaine Murray Stone|title=Maximilian Kolbe|url=https://archive.org/details/maximiliankolbes00elai|url-access=registration|quote=city mary india kolbe.|publisher=Paulist Press|place=Nueva York|year=1997|page=[https://archive.org/details/maximiliankolbes00elai/page/53 53]|isbn=0-8091-6637-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|author=Francis Mary Kalvelage|title=Kolbe: Saint of the Immaculata|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ZbruAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&lpg=PA62&dq=Mugenzai+no+Sono+1931&source=bl&ots=ha1oqvFxYd&sig=ACfU3U0lYamm28e7oo-TyFvK7B-oyuxNjQ&hl=es&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjCpOfz2-PmAhUSkRQKHRvGBfAQ6AEwAHoECAYQAQ#v=onepage&q=Mugenzai%20no%20Sono%201931&f=false|pages=62-63|year=2001|isbn=9780898708851}}</ref> Poor health forced Kolbe to stay in Poland.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> Two years later, in 1938, he started a radio station at Niepokalan\u00f3w, ''Radio Niepokalan\u00f3w''.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Historia\"/> He held an [[amateur radio]] licence, with the call sign SP3RN.<ref name=\"qrz\"/>\n\n===Death at Auschwitz===\n[[File:Todeszelle Pater Maximilian Kolbes, KZ Auschwitz I, Block 11.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Saint Maximilian Kolbe's prison cell in [[Block 11]], Auschwitz concentration camp]]\nAfter the outbreak of [[World War II]], Kolbe was one of the few friars who remained in the monastery, where he organized a temporary hospital.<ref name=\"psb296\"/> After the town was captured by the Germans, he was arrested by them on 19 September 1939 but released on 8 December.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb296\"/> He refused to sign the [[Volksliste|Deutsche Volksliste]], which would have given him rights similar to those of German citizens, in exchange for recognizing his ethnic German ancestry.<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Upon his release he continued work at his friary, where he and other friars provided shelter to refugees from [[Greater Poland]], including 2,000 Jews whom he hid from German persecution in the Niepokalan\u00f3w friary.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/><ref name=guardian/><ref name=\"psb297\"/><ref name=\"Kolbe, Saint of Auschwitz\"/> Kolbe received permission to continue publishing religious works, though significantly reduced in scope.<ref name=\"psb297\"/> The monastery continued to act as a publishing house, issuing a number of anti-Nazi German publications.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=ewtn/> \n\nOn 17 February 1941, the monastery was shut down by the German authorities.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> That day Kolbe and four others were arrested by the [[Gestapo]] and imprisoned in the [[Pawiak]] prison.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> On 28 May, he was transferred to [[Auschwitz]] as prisoner 16670.<ref name=\"Sixty-ninth Anniversary of the Death of St. Maximilian Kolbe\"/>\n\nContinuing to act as a priest, Kolbe was subjected to violent harassment, including beating and lashings. Once he was smuggled to a prison hospital by friendly inmates.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"psb297\"/> At the end of July 1941, one prisoner escaped from the camp, prompting [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]] [[Karl Fritzsch]], the deputy camp commander, to pick ten men to be starved to death in an underground bunker to deter further escape attempts. When one of the selected men, [[Franciszek Gajowniczek]], cried out, \"My wife! My children!\", Kolbe volunteered to take his place.<ref name=\"catholic-pages\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1973 771 Maximilian Kolbe.jpg|thumb|right|Maximilian Kolbe, on a West German postage stamp, marked [[Auschwitz]]]]<!--why is his death date given as the 15th?-->\nAccording to an eyewitness, who was an assistant janitor at that time, in his prison cell, Kolbe led the prisoners in prayer. Each time the guards checked on him, he was standing or kneeling in the middle of the cell and looking calmly at those who entered. After they had been starved and deprived of water for two weeks, only Kolbe remained alive. The guards wanted the bunker emptied, so they gave Kolbe a lethal injection of [[phenol|carbolic acid]]. Kolbe is said to have raised his left arm and calmly waited for the deadly injection.<ref name=\"ewtn\"/> He died on 14 August. His remains were cremated on 15 August, the [[calendar of saints|feast day]] of the [[Assumption of Mary]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/>\n\n==Canonization==\nOn 12 May 1955 Kolbe was recognized by the Vatican as a [[Servant of God]].<ref name=\"psb297\"/> Kolbe was declared [[venerable]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] on 30 January 1969, [[beatification|beatified]] as a [[Confessor of the Faith]] by the same Pope in 1971, and [[canonized]] as a [[saint]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] on 10 October 1982.<ref name=\"Patron\"/><ref name=\"Plunka2012\"/> Upon canonization, the Pope declared St. Maximilian Kolbe as a confessor, and a [[martyr]] of charity.<ref name=\"Patron\"/> The miracles that were used to confirm his beatification were the July 1948 cure of intestinal tuberculosis in Angela Testoni, and in August 1950, the cure of calcification of the arteries/sclerosis of Francis Ranier; both attributed to Kolbe's intercession by their prayers to him.<ref name=\"Patron\"/>\n\n[[File:WestminsterAbbey-Martyrs.jpg|thumb|right|The statue of Kolbe (left) above the Great West Door of Westminster Abbey]]\nAfter his canonization, a feast day for St. Maximilian Kolbe was added to the [[General Roman Calendar]]. He is one of ten 20th-century martyrs who are depicted in statues above the Great West Door of [[Anglican]] [[Westminster Abbey]], London.<ref name=\"westminster\"/>\n\n===Controversies===\nKolbe's recognition as a [[Christian martyrs|Christian martyr]] generated some controversy within the Catholic Church.<ref name=\"peterson\"/> While his self-sacrifice at Auschwitz was considered saintly and heroic, he was not killed out of ''odium fidei'' (hatred of the faith), but as the result of his act of [[Charity (virtue)|Christian charity]] toward another man. [[Pope Paul VI]] recognized this distinction at Kolbe's beatification, naming him a Confessor and giving him the unofficial title \"martyr of charity\". Pope John Paul II, however, overruled the commission he had established (which agreed with the earlier assessment of heroic charity). John Paul II wanted to make the point that the Nazis systematic hatred of whole categories of humanity was inherently also a hatred of religious (Christian) faith; he said that Kolbe's death equated to earlier examples of religious martyrdom.<ref name=peterson/>\n\nKolbe has been accused of [[antisemitism]]. In 1926, in the first issue of the monthly Knight of the Immaculate, Father Kolbe said he considered Freemasons ''as an organized clique of fanatical Jews, who want to destroy the church.'' Writing in a calendar that the publishing house of his organization, the Militia of the Immaculate, published in an edition of a million in 1939, Father Kolbe said: \"''Atheistic Communism seems to rage ever more wildly. Its origin can easily be located in that criminal mafia that calls itself Freemasonry, and the hand that is guiding all that toward a clear goal is international Zionism. Which should not be taken to mean that even among Jews one cannot find good people.''\"<ref>New York Times, 19 November 1982 'Saint charged with bigotry' [https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/19/world/saint-charged-with-bigotry-clerics-say-no.html&usg=AOvVaw0Y7PFO6rmsgqrLHeEtJiFQ]</ref> Newspapers he published printed articles about topics such as a [[Zionism|Zionist]] plot for world domination.<ref name=\"Dershowitz1992\"/><ref name=\"jta\"/><ref name=\"Michael2008\"/> Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] criticized Kolbe's activities as \"writing and organizing mass propaganda for the Catholic Church, with a clear anti-Semitic and anti-Masonic edge.\"<ref name=jta/><ref name=\"Zizek2012\"/> However, a number of writers pointed out that the \"Jewish question played a very minor role in Kolbe's thought and work\".<ref name=jta/><ref name=BeckyReady/> On those grounds allegations of Kolbe's antisemitism have been denounced by [[Holocaust studies|Holocaust scholars]] Daniel L.

Since his [[beatification]] in 1971, more than 1,000 such relics have been distributed around the world for public veneration.

Drivers and fans alike criticized the aesthetics of the car, and some have cited the Car of Tomorrow for contributing to the decline of NASCAR.]]\nBeginning in the early 2000s, NASCAR researched and worked on a new model to introduce towards the end of the decade. One particular area of scrutiny was driver safety; [[Dale Earnhardt]] [[Death of Dale Earnhardt|fatally crashed]] at the [[2001 Daytona 500]], and the safety of the cars used at the time was questioned.\n\nThe Car of Tomorrow was first tested in December 2005, and was first revealed to the public in 2006, with numerous safety improvements being touted. The Car of Tomorrow made its debut at the [[2007 Food City 500]], and was almost immediately criticized by both fans and drivers alike. Many fans disliked the large and boxy design, its more generic appearance and the use of a detached wing.<ref name=Fox-BrianFrance-CoT-2015/> [[Kyle Busch]], who won the first race using the model, proclaimed that the car \"sucks\" after his victory and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 by noting how the CoT was \"hitting a wall of air\" in the wake of a leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://independenttribune.net/index.php/sports/jnowcomments/so_just_how_might_a_head_to_head_duel_go_between_dale_earnhardt_sr_and_kyle |title=Postrace comments on 2008 Best Buy 400 |access-date=2019-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312102706/http://independenttribune.net/index.php/sports/jnowcomments/so_just_how_might_a_head_to_head_duel_go_between_dale_earnhardt_sr_and_kyle |archive-date=2016-03-12 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Busch was not the only driver to vent his frustrations; [[Jeff Gordon]] was also critical of the car, stating after the [[2007 Lenox Industrial Tools 300|2007 New England 300]], \"I'd like to know who it was who said this car would reduce the [[aerodynamics|aero]] [[understeer|push]] because I could have told you from when I first drove this car that it would be worse.\"<ref>[http://monkeesfan.blogspot.com/2007/07/plenty-of-subplots-at-hew-hampshire.html Plenty Of Subplots At New Hampshire]</ref>\n\nDespite the criticism, NASCAR fully implemented the model in [[2008 in NASCAR|2008]], and overall brought dramatic safety improvements and reduced costs of car maintenance.<ref name=ESPN-CoT-Thanks-for-the-memories>{{cite web|last1=McGee|first1=Ryan|title=Thanks for the memories, CoT|url=http://espn.go.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/8950107/nascar-car-tomorrow-buried-praised|website=[[ESPN|espn.go.com]]|publisher=[[ESPN]], [[ESPN The Magazine]]|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=February 15, 2013}}</ref> Despite the overall safety improvements, one point of contention was that the rear wing increased the severity of on-track accidents by causing cars to be more prone to flipping over or going airborne at higher speeds.

One NIOSH engineer stated that 43 cars during a race was \"equivalent to a jet engine\". The first study focused exclusively on Bristol Motor Speedway, while the second study took other NASCAR race tracks into account, and both studies found that noise levels regularly exceeded 140 decibels when the race cars were accelerating at full throttle, and that the noise levels lasted, on average, about three to four hours, the average duration of a NASCAR race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/26/sports/othersports/26noise.html|title=The Sound and the Fury, and Possibly the Danger|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 26, 2007}}</ref> The article cites 7-time NASCAR Cup Series champion [[Richard Petty]], as well as other drivers such as [[Jeff Burton]], now requiring the use of [[hearing aids]] due to hearing loss caused by engine noise.

However, in recent years, many Cup Series drivers have competed in and dominated the lower tier Xfinity Series races on a regular basis, earning Cup drivers the nickname \"[[Buschwhacker]]s\" (derived from the 1984\u20132007 sponsorship of NASCAR's second-highest series by [[Busch Beer]]). The situation is compounded by the close timing of the races in the two series: a typical NASCAR weekend has a Xfinity race on Saturday followed by a Cup race on Sunday at the same track. Some have wondered why \"major league\" Cup drivers are allowed to compete in the \"minor league\" races with such frequency, and whether Xfinity is an adequate developmental series. Sportswriter Bob Margolis noted that much of this is due to the similarities between the cars used in the two series (they are mostly alike except for the engines and the wheelbase), and the desire for Cup drivers to get as much practice time as possible to learn about the track and car setup before the main race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=bm-buschpreview021706&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Sports.Yahoo.com |publisher=Sports.Yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the aforementioned 2008 meetings between NASCAR and Detroit automakers, the automakers also called for the Xfinity Series to become strictly a developmental series, with Cup drivers prohibited from running in the junior series.<ref name=Autoextremist>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoextremist.com/fumes1/2008/8/4/fumes-457.html |title=Fumes #457 \u2013 The Detroit Three get down to the business of NASCAR |first=Peter M. |last=De Lorenzo |publisher=Autoextremist.com |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>  The request was rejected at that time.

The ''rate'' of fuel consumption tends to be the same regardless of the actual speeds of the cars, as teams change gear ratios for each race to ensure that the engine always operates in its optimum power band; however, the fuel ''mileage'' will vary for each race, depending on the maximum speeds attained.\n\nThe fuel consumption criticism dates to 1974 and the [[1973 oil crisis|energy crisis]]; NASCAR responded by showing data that racing was far less consumptive of fuel than regular air travel, etc.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n===Emissions and pollution===\nThe consumption figures above provide no insight on environmental impact in terms of emissions. NASCAR vehicles are generally unregulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and in particular, they have no mufflers, catalytic converters or other emissions control devices. However, some local short tracks which run under NASCAR sanction require certain emissions control devices. Many short tracks run mufflers in compliance with noise ordinances at some tracks; in the early years of the [[Camping World Truck Series]], some races were held at venues which required mufflers, a requirement still used in NASCAR's K&N Pro Series (East and West) and Whelen (North and South) Modified Tours.\n\nNASCAR continued to use [[Unleaded gasoline#Lead|lead additives]] in its race gasoline until the [[2007 Auto Club 500]] at [[California Speedway]] on February 25,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scenedaily.com/stories/2006/10/16/scene_daily394.html |title=Nextel Cup going to unleaded fuel in 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |author=Bob Passrock |date=October 21, 2006 |work=scenedaily.com}}</ref> which led to concerns about the health of those exposed to the fumes of the cars (fans and residents living near the race tracks). Lead is a well-known environmental risk, but the performance needs of race engines (in particular, the high [[Compression Ratio|compression ratios]] and sustained/repeated operation at high rpm and load) once made it difficult to switch to un[[Tetraethyllead|leaded fuel]].\n\nIn the United States, the commercial use of leaded fuel has been phased out since the early 1970s, when catalytic converters were required to be installed on new cars, making unleaded fuel a requirement (leaded fuel will destroy a [[catalytic converter]]). The sale of leaded fuel has been mostly banned in the US since 1996, but exemptions exist for auto racing, aircraft, farm and marine equipment.\n\nNASCAR eventually took steps to eliminate the need for leaded fuels. In 1998, NASCAR and then-fuel supplier [[Tosco Corporation|Tosco]] (Now [[ConocoPhillips]], the company that produces the [[Union 76]] brand of fuel) conducted an unsuccessful test of unleaded fuel in selected Busch Series races. In July 2006, in the first in a four-week test run of unleaded fuel, the first race since 1998 to run unleaded gasoline, known as [[Sunoco]] 260 GT Plus, a commercially available racing fuel, was held during a Busch race at the [[Gateway International Raceway]] in [[Madison, Illinois]]. The testing in July 2006 was successful with no suspected engine failures or malfunctions from the new fuel. In October 2006, NASCAR stated its intention to transition to unleaded fuel in all three top series (Craftsman, Busch and Cup) in 2007, starting with the [[Auto Club 500]].\n\nDuring the first race in which unleaded fuel was used, there were a number of engine failures during the race, leading many to believe that the unleaded fuel is to be blamed.  The drivers who encountered failures include [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] of [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] and [[Kasey Kahne]] of [[Evernham Motorsports]]. The engine failures of both Earnhardt and Truex were attributed in part to the lack of a lead additive, but also to centrifugal force causing improper distribution of oil between the left and right sides of the engine. Evernham Motorsports has not disclosed the reason behind Kahne's engine failure.\n\nThe 2008 season marked the first season all 36 races used unleaded racing fuel.\n\n2011 marked one of the largest \u201cgreen initiatives\u201d in the fifty plus year history of NASCAR when all fuel sources were to include Ethanol in a blend called E15.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Rodman, NASCAR.COM |url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110122/ethanol-details-thunder/index.html |title=Fill 'er up: Teams off and running with E15 fuel - Jan 22, 2011 |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=2011-01-22 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>  One unintended consequence of the conversion was higher horsepower and therefore slightly lower fuel economy.  It is argued however, that the reduction in fuel economy and the resultant increase in fuel use may offset any environmental impact savings by reduced emissions.  Although not connected to the fuel blend, a new \u201cDry Break\u201d self-venting fuel supply can was also adopted in part for safety (reduced the number of people working on the racecar during a pit stop) but also in part to reduce the amount of fuel spilled during a pit stop, which has both environmental and safety implications.  The reduced fuel spillage is negligible at best when observing a pit stop as fuel spills are common and during competition there is no real method to determine with any certainty the volume of fuel lost.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 2012 a complete technology change and shift in thinking occurred when NASCAR switched the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series to [[Fuel injection in NASCAR|fuel injection]] from the current carburetor. Arguments have been made about increased efficiency; however, race teams will work to ensure they take advantage of the additional horsepower and efficiency to increase speeds so any improvement in efficiency may be lost to competition.\n\n==Participation of non-American manufacturers==\n[[Image:Auto Show 067.jpg|thumb|left|A Gen-5 car body with [[Toyota Camry]] decals.]]\nNASCAR's early history included several foreign manufacturers, such as [[Aston Martin]], [[Austin-Healey]], [[Citro\u00ebn]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[MG Cars|MG]], [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]], [[Porsche]], [[Renault]], and [[Volkswagen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Magrath |first=Mike |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Columns/articleId=119633 |title=NASCAR Fans, Be Careful When You Talk \"Tradition\" |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> At a 1954 road race in [[Linden, New Jersey]], Jaguar cars finished first, fourth, fifth and sixth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=db-statswatkinsglen081006&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Statistically Speaking: Road warriors - NASCAR - Yahoo!

The restriction was relaxed in recognition of the fact that the Tundra, while Japanese in origin, is built in the United States.  Commentators have also noted that the \"American\" cars are often built or assembled in Canada and Mexico. As of the 2019 season and the introduction of the Gen-6 car, all of the cars including, the Chevrolet Camaro, Toyota Camry and Ford Mustang are assembled in the United States. Some fans have complained about the entry of a foreign manufacturer into what is perceived as an American sport, while drivers and owners have expressed concern that Toyota's deep pockets, and stated willingness to spend, may increase costs for other teams as well.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=ap-nascar-toyota&prov=ap&type=lgns A year after disastrous start, Toyota making inroads at Daytona - NASCAR - Yahoo!

The Northeast Region started out with a high percentage of races in the early NASCAR years, but from the 1960s until the mid 1980s contained 10% or less of the schedule. The Midwest Region had 21.1% of the races in 1950, but many years before 1970 had no races. The NASCAR schedule had usually contained a few races in the West Region but never more than 10% until the late 1990s. From the late 1990s, and into the early 2000s, a number of new tracks were built and became part of the NASCAR schedule, in places such as [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]], the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex]], the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeast]], and the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles area]]. This is part of a publicized trend to make NASCAR a more national sport rather than a regional sport. Today, the South makes up only 50% of the NASCAR schedule, while the Northeast has 19.4%, the Midwest has 16.7%, and the West has 13.9% of the schedule. A consequence of NASCAR maintaining its current 36-race schedule is that the inclusion of these new tracks in the schedule results in some of the more traditional tracks in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] no longer hosting races. Examples include [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]], which is no longer a part of the NASCAR schedule, and [[North Carolina Speedway]], which held its last Cup race in 2004 after being in operation for nearly 40 years.\n\nTraditionalist fans argue that this slow attrition away from tracks in those states where stock car racing began causes the sport to move away from its roots, and from uniquely styled tracks to those of a more \"cookie-cutter\" design. 36.1% (13 races) of the Races today are on what fans call \"cookie-cutter\" tracks (which include [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]], [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]] since its re-design in mid 1997, [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]], [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], [[Kansas Speedway|Kansas]] and [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]]), compared to the 12.9% (4 races) in 1996. Before NASCAR cut the number of races down for the 1972 season, tracks under 1 mile made up more than 55% of the races. After the changes for the 1972 season, tracks under 1 mile made up only 29% of the races in 1972 and then had 10 races, around 33% of the races, until the mid 1980s. After losing 2 races at Nashville in 1985 and 2 races at North Wilkesboro after 1996 the NASCAR schedule had only 17.6% of races under 1 mile. Tracks with a length between 0.5 and under 1 mile had the highest percentage of the schedule from NASCAR's first season in 1949 until the mid 1990s when tracks between 1.000\u20131.499 miles equaled them in percentage. Tracks between 1.000\u20131.499 miles had the most races in the late 1990s until 1.5\u20131.999-mile tracks passed them in the early to mid 2000s after the loss of races at Rockingham and Darlington. Today 1.5\u20131.999-mile tracks have over 30% of the races. The counterargument is that these \"traditional\" venues are in markets whose support for racing had long declined \u2013 Darlington failed to sell out races until it was cut to one date in 2005 while North Wilkesboro had no infrastructure and little ability to expand beyond 50,000 seats, and Rockingham failed to sell out its races for over five years.\n\nThe 2008 NASCAR\u2013Detroit meetings also saw two automakers call for the addition of at least two new road races. One of these manufacturers also favored reducing the total number of races by at least four while at the same time increasing the number of road races from its current two to at least four. The most obvious way to achieve these goals would be to reduce the number of tracks that host two events a year.<ref name=Autoextremist/> These demands were rejected.\n\n===Decline of road courses===\n\nSince the seventies, NASCAR has increasingly focused its emphasis on oval courses. Many racing fans consider this a key detriment to NASCAR, deriding drivers and the sport as \"a bunch of hillbillies driving in circles for 3 hours.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/07/15/golden-tate-says-nascar-drivers-arent-athletes-hears-it-from-racing-fans/ |title=Golden Tate says NASCAR drivers aren't athletes, hears it from racing fans &#124; ProFootballTalk |publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Previously, some races were held on road courses, but by 1990 only two road courses were in use: [[Sonoma Raceway]], and [[Watkins Glen International]]. This can be explained by the decrease in handling ability over the course of the vehicles' development. Also notable is the establishment of NASCAR layouts at Sonoma and Watkins Glen. The former omitted the Carousel section of the layout from 1998 to 2018 while the latter omits the Boot, again due to handling issues. Recently, the [[Xfinity Series]] has begun using [[Road America]], initially due to the loss of the [[Milwaukee Mile]] from its schedule. Starting in 2013 the Xfinity Series began racing at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]] due to the loss of [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]].

The general purpose of this event is to reduce risk when track conditions deteriorate (for instance, if there is debris on the track, one or more cars crash and emergency vehicles and tow trucks need to be on track, or a car spins and is given the opportunity to catch up with the field).  Generally, when a caution occurs, race cars must tightly pack before a restart.\n\nThe number of cautions per race in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series increased from 7.4 in 2001 to 9.6 in 2007 (an increase of almost 30%), while the number of actual crashes per race has only increased from 5.6 to 6.7 (an increase of about 20%).<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/graphics/nascardata2007/flash.htm USAToday]\"2007 NASCAR Crash Data\" Retrieved Dec. 22, 2007</ref>  This is likely due to increased caution periods for cleaning debris from the track.

By this time, [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] was in the lead, and holding on to victory would have likely secured a playoff spot. However, a slow pit stop caused Newman to lose momentum, and [[Carl Edwards]] went on to win instead.

However, in recent years, many Cup Series drivers have competed in and dominated the lower tier Xfinity Series races on a regular basis, earning Cup drivers the nickname \"[[Buschwhacker]]s\" (derived from the 1984\u20132007 sponsorship of NASCAR's second-highest series by [[Busch Beer]]). The situation is compounded by the close timing of the races in the two series: a typical NASCAR weekend has a Xfinity race on Saturday followed by a Cup race on Sunday at the same track. Some have wondered why \"major league\" Cup drivers are allowed to compete in the \"minor league\" races with such frequency, and whether Xfinity is an adequate developmental series. Sportswriter Bob Margolis noted that much of this is due to the similarities between the cars used in the two series (they are mostly alike except for the engines and the wheelbase), and the desire for Cup drivers to get as much practice time as possible to learn about the track and car setup before the main race.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=bm-buschpreview021706&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Sports.Yahoo.com |publisher=Sports.Yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>\n\nIn the aforementioned 2008 meetings between NASCAR and Detroit automakers, the automakers also called for the Xfinity Series to become strictly a developmental series, with Cup drivers prohibited from running in the junior series.<ref name=Autoextremist>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoextremist.com/fumes1/2008/8/4/fumes-457.html |title=Fumes #457 \u2013 The Detroit Three get down to the business of NASCAR |first=Peter M. |last=De Lorenzo |publisher=Autoextremist.com |date=2008-08-06 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}</ref>  The request was rejected at that time.

NASCAR vehicles are generally unregulated by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], and in particular, they have no mufflers, catalytic converters or other emissions control devices. However, some local short tracks which run under NASCAR sanction require certain emissions control devices. Many short tracks run mufflers in compliance with noise ordinances at some tracks; in the early years of the [[Camping World Truck Series]], some races were held at venues which required mufflers, a requirement still used in NASCAR's K&N Pro Series (East and West) and Whelen (North and South) Modified Tours.\n\nNASCAR continued to use [[Unleaded gasoline#Lead|lead additives]] in its race gasoline until the [[2007 Auto Club 500]] at [[California Speedway]] on February 25,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.scenedaily.com/stories/2006/10/16/scene_daily394.html |title=Nextel Cup going to unleaded fuel in 2007 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |author=Bob Passrock |date=October 21, 2006 |work=scenedaily.com}}</ref> which led to concerns about the health of those exposed to the fumes of the cars (fans and residents living near the race tracks). Lead is a well-known environmental risk, but the performance needs of race engines (in particular, the high [[Compression Ratio|compression ratios]] and sustained/repeated operation at high rpm and load) once made it difficult to switch to un[[Tetraethyllead|leaded fuel]].\n\nIn the United States, the commercial use of leaded fuel has been phased out since the early 1970s, when catalytic converters were required to be installed on new cars, making unleaded fuel a requirement (leaded fuel will destroy a [[catalytic converter]]). The sale of leaded fuel has been mostly banned in the US since 1996, but exemptions exist for auto racing, aircraft, farm and marine equipment.\n\nNASCAR eventually took steps to eliminate the need for leaded fuels. In 1998, NASCAR and then-fuel supplier [[Tosco Corporation|Tosco]] (Now [[ConocoPhillips]], the company that produces the [[Union 76]] brand of fuel) conducted an unsuccessful test of unleaded fuel in selected Busch Series races. In July 2006, in the first in a four-week test run of unleaded fuel, the first race since 1998 to run unleaded gasoline, known as [[Sunoco]] 260 GT Plus, a commercially available racing fuel, was held during a Busch race at the [[Gateway International Raceway]] in [[Madison, Illinois]]. The testing in July 2006 was successful with no suspected engine failures or malfunctions from the new fuel. In October 2006, NASCAR stated its intention to transition to unleaded fuel in all three top series (Craftsman, Busch and Cup) in 2007, starting with the [[Auto Club 500]].\n\nDuring the first race in which unleaded fuel was used, there were a number of engine failures during the race, leading many to believe that the unleaded fuel is to be blamed.  The drivers who encountered failures include [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] and [[Martin Truex Jr.]] of [[Dale Earnhardt, Inc.]] and [[Kasey Kahne]] of [[Evernham Motorsports]]. The engine failures of both Earnhardt and Truex were attributed in part to the lack of a lead additive, but also to centrifugal force causing improper distribution of oil between the left and right sides of the engine. Evernham Motorsports has not disclosed the reason behind Kahne's engine failure.\n\nThe 2008 season marked the first season all 36 races used unleaded racing fuel.\n\n2011 marked one of the largest \u201cgreen initiatives\u201d in the fifty plus year history of NASCAR when all fuel sources were to include Ethanol in a blend called E15.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Rodman, NASCAR.COM |url=http://www.nascar.com/news/110122/ethanol-details-thunder/index.html |title=Fill 'er up: Teams off and running with E15 fuel - Jan 22, 2011 |publisher=Nascar.Com |date=2011-01-22 |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref>  One unintended consequence of the conversion was higher horsepower and therefore slightly lower fuel economy.  It is argued however, that the reduction in fuel economy and the resultant increase in fuel use may offset any environmental impact savings by reduced emissions.  Although not connected to the fuel blend, a new \u201cDry Break\u201d self-venting fuel supply can was also adopted in part for safety (reduced the number of people working on the racecar during a pit stop) but also in part to reduce the amount of fuel spilled during a pit stop, which has both environmental and safety implications.  The reduced fuel spillage is negligible at best when observing a pit stop as fuel spills are common and during competition there is no real method to determine with any certainty the volume of fuel lost.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn 2012 a complete technology change and shift in thinking occurred when NASCAR switched the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series to [[Fuel injection in NASCAR|fuel injection]] from the current carburetor. Arguments have been made about increased efficiency; however, race teams will work to ensure they take advantage of the additional horsepower and efficiency to increase speeds so any improvement in efficiency may be lost to competition.\n\n==Participation of non-American manufacturers==\n[[Image:Auto Show 067.jpg|thumb|left|A Gen-5 car body with [[Toyota Camry]] decals.]]\nNASCAR's early history included several foreign manufacturers, such as [[Aston Martin]], [[Austin-Healey]], [[Citro\u00ebn]], [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]], [[MG Cars|MG]], [[Morgan Motor Company|Morgan]], [[Porsche]], [[Renault]], and [[Volkswagen]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Magrath |first=Mike |url=http://www.edmunds.com/insideline/do/Columns/articleId=119633 |title=NASCAR Fans, Be Careful When You Talk \"Tradition\" |publisher=Edmunds.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> At a 1954 road race in [[Linden, New Jersey]], Jaguar cars finished first, fourth, fifth and sixth.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nascar/news?slug=db-statswatkinsglen081006&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Statistically Speaking: Road warriors - NASCAR - Yahoo!

Commentators have also noted that the \"American\" cars are often built or assembled in Canada and Mexico. As of the 2019 season and the introduction of the Gen-6 car, all of the cars including, the Chevrolet Camaro, Toyota Camry and Ford Mustang are assembled in the United States.

The Northeast Region started out with a high percentage of races in the early NASCAR years, but from the 1960s until the mid 1980s contained 10% or less of the schedule. The Midwest Region had 21.1% of the races in 1950, but many years before 1970 had no races. The NASCAR schedule had usually contained a few races in the West Region but never more than 10% until the late 1990s. From the late 1990s, and into the early 2000s, a number of new tracks were built and became part of the NASCAR schedule, in places such as [[South Florida metropolitan area|South Florida]], [[Chicago metropolitan area|Chicagoland]], the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth Metroplex]], the [[Northeastern United States (U.S. Census Bureau)|Northeast]], and the [[Greater Los Angeles Area|Los Angeles area]]. This is part of a publicized trend to make NASCAR a more national sport rather than a regional sport. Today, the South makes up only 50% of the NASCAR schedule, while the Northeast has 19.4%, the Midwest has 16.7%, and the West has 13.9% of the schedule. A consequence of NASCAR maintaining its current 36-race schedule is that the inclusion of these new tracks in the schedule results in some of the more traditional tracks in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeast]] no longer hosting races. Examples include [[North Wilkesboro Speedway]], which is no longer a part of the NASCAR schedule, and [[North Carolina Speedway]], which held its last Cup race in 2004 after being in operation for nearly 40 years.\n\nTraditionalist fans argue that this slow attrition away from tracks in those states where stock car racing began causes the sport to move away from its roots, and from uniquely styled tracks to those of a more \"cookie-cutter\" design. 36.1% (13 races) of the Races today are on what fans call \"cookie-cutter\" tracks (which include [[Charlotte Motor Speedway|Charlotte]], [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]], [[Atlanta Motor Speedway|Atlanta]] since its re-design in mid 1997, [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]], [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]], [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], [[Kansas Speedway|Kansas]] and [[Chicagoland Speedway|Chicagoland]]), compared to the 12.9% (4 races) in 1996. Before NASCAR cut the number of races down for the 1972 season, tracks under 1 mile made up more than 55% of the races. After the changes for the 1972 season, tracks under 1 mile made up only 29% of the races in 1972 and then had 10 races, around 33% of the races, until the mid 1980s. After losing 2 races at Nashville in 1985 and 2 races at North Wilkesboro after 1996 the NASCAR schedule had only 17.6% of races under 1 mile. Tracks with a length between 0.5 and under 1 mile had the highest percentage of the schedule from NASCAR's first season in 1949 until the mid 1990s when tracks between 1.000\u20131.499 miles equaled them in percentage. Tracks between 1.000\u20131.499 miles had the most races in the late 1990s until 1.5\u20131.999-mile tracks passed them in the early to mid 2000s after the loss of races at Rockingham and Darlington. Today 1.5\u20131.999-mile tracks have over 30% of the races. The counterargument is that these \"traditional\" venues are in markets whose support for racing had long declined \u2013 Darlington failed to sell out races until it was cut to one date in 2005 while North Wilkesboro had no infrastructure and little ability to expand beyond 50,000 seats, and Rockingham failed to sell out its races for over five years.\n\nThe 2008 NASCAR\u2013Detroit meetings also saw two automakers call for the addition of at least two new road races. One of these manufacturers also favored reducing the total number of races by at least four while at the same time increasing the number of road races from its current two to at least four. The most obvious way to achieve these goals would be to reduce the number of tracks that host two events a year.<ref name=Autoextremist/> These demands were rejected.\n\n===Decline of road courses===\n\nSince the seventies, NASCAR has increasingly focused its emphasis on oval courses. Many racing fans consider this a key detriment to NASCAR, deriding drivers and the sport as \"a bunch of hillbillies driving in circles for 3 hours.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/07/15/golden-tate-says-nascar-drivers-arent-athletes-hears-it-from-racing-fans/ |title=Golden Tate says NASCAR drivers aren't athletes, hears it from racing fans &#124; ProFootballTalk |publisher=Profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-03}}</ref> Previously, some races were held on road courses, but by 1990 only two road courses were in use: [[Sonoma Raceway]], and [[Watkins Glen International]]. This can be explained by the decrease in handling ability over the course of the vehicles' development. Also notable is the establishment of NASCAR layouts at Sonoma and Watkins Glen. The former omitted the Carousel section of the layout from 1998 to 2018 while the latter omits the Boot, again due to handling issues. Recently, the [[Xfinity Series]] has begun using [[Road America]], initially due to the loss of the [[Milwaukee Mile]] from its schedule. Starting in 2013 the Xfinity Series began racing at [[Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course]] due to the loss of [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]]. In 2013, the [[Camping World Truck Series]] began racing at [[Canadian Tire Motorsports Park]], marking the first time in 13 years the Truck Series visited a road course.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Camping-World-Trucks/News/Articles/2012/11/Canada-to-Host-Truck-Race-in-2013.aspx|title=Canada to Host Truck Race in 2013|work=[[Motor Racing Network]]|date=2012-11-16|accessdate=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130129020037/http://www.motorracingnetwork.com/Race-Series/NASCAR-Camping-World-Trucks/News/Articles/2012/11/Canada-to-Host-Truck-Race-in-2013.aspx|archive-date=2013-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nAs of 2017 due to the popularity, <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.motorsport.com/nascar-cup/news/fans-demand-more-road-courses-and-nascar-knows-it-806401/|title=Fans demand more road courses and NASCAR knows it|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref> NASCAR has been adding more road courses to the championship season schedule with races also taking place in rain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/news-media/2017/05/23/2018-nascar-schedule-charlotte-playoff-race-road-course/|title=2018 NASCAR schedule: Charlotte playoff race will be on road course|date=23 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/nascar-finally-adds-a-road-course-to-the-playoffs-1795486329|title=NASCAR Finally Adds A Road Course To The Playoffs|first=Stef|last=Schrader|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://blackflag.jalopnik.com/this-wet-nascar-road-course-battle-will-completely-melt-1795811389|title=This Wet NASCAR Road Course Battle Will Completely Melt Your Brain|first=Stef|last=Schrader|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Manipulating the outcome of races and championships==\n[[Image:RacingFlagsJune2007.jpg|thumb|left|The flagman displaying the checkered flag with a complete set of stock car racing flags]]\n\nNASCAR uses [[Caution flag#Yellow flag|caution flags]], triggered by race administrators, in which drivers are limited to certain maneuvers. The general purpose of this event is to reduce risk when track conditions deteriorate (for instance, if there is debris on the track, one or more cars crash and emergency vehicles and tow trucks need to be on track, or a car spins and is given the opportunity to catch up with the field).  Generally, when a caution occurs, race cars must tightly pack before a restart.\n\nThe number of cautions per race in the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series increased from 7.4 in 2001 to 9.6 in 2007 (an increase of almost 30%), while the number of actual crashes per race has only increased from 5.6 to 6.7 (an increase of about 20%).<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/graphics/nascardata2007/flash.htm USAToday]\"2007 NASCAR Crash Data\" Retrieved Dec. 22, 2007</ref>  This is likely due to increased caution periods for cleaning debris from the track.  In 2015, the number of cautions per race averaged at 8.2, showing a gradual decline since then.<ref>{{cite web |title=NASCAR Cup Series Cautions and Crashes |url=http://promo.espn.com/news/stats/story/_/page/NASCAR-Sprint-Cup-Cautions-and-Crashes |website=Jayski's Silly Season Site |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=29 March 2019}}</ref> Fans and competitors alike speculate whether some of these cautions are used to keep the cars tightly packed in an effort to keep a race close.<ref>{{cite news |title=COLUMN: NASCAR fans are buzzing over debris cautions |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/03/23/column-nascar-fans-are-buzzing-over-debris-cautions/70342502/ |accessdate=29 March 2019 |agency=USA Today (via AP) |date=23 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Weaver |first1=Matt |title=NASCAR drivers concerned about timing of late cautions in playoff races |url=https://autoweek.com/article/nascar/timing-cautions-during-playoff-races-concern-nascar-drivers |accessdate=29 March 2019 |agency=Autoweek |publisher=Crain Communications}}</ref>  An unnecessary caution at a specific time could affect a driver\u2019s strategy and the outcome of the race, while providing a potential opportunity for other drivers to close the gap and prevent a runaway victory.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pruett |first1=Marshall |title=NASCAR's Newest Caution Rule Is Mind Bogglingly Ridiculous |url=https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/news/a27947/nascars-caution-countdown-clock/ |website=Road & Track |publisher=Hearst Communications |accessdate=29 March 2019 |date=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2007, then two time champion [[Tony Stewart]], on his radio show hosted via [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], said: \"It's like playing God. They can almost dictate the race instead of the drivers doing it\u2026 I don't know that they've run a fair race all year.\"  Stewart also made a comparison to the [[WWE]], which is scripted. NASCAR itself was not flattered by these comments, and stated that Stewart's comments were \"very, very disappointing\" but did not punish Tony Stewart, as there were no rules against criticizing the officiating of a race.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Fryer |first1=Jenna |title=Stewart likens NASCAR to wrestling |url=https://journalstar.com/sports/stewart-likens-nascar-to-wrestling/article_7ec56e8a-7e2a-5a54-bb38-2ba8a115bf00.html |accessdate=29 March 2019 |agency=Lincoln Journal-Star (via AP) |date=24 April 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn an unrelated interview, driver [[Matt Kenseth]] said, \"There's for sure entertainment cautions, there's no doubt about that, but we're in the entertainment business and you're going to get some of that and group the field every once in a while.\"  Driver and commentator, [[Kyle Petty]], said, \"We're in the entertainment business, if they want to throw a caution every 40 laps to keep everybody bunched up, so the fans have a better experience, more cautions, the better.\"<ref>[http://www.speedtv.com/commentary/37113/ SpeedTv.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110120648/http://www.speedtv.com/commentary/37113/ |date=2008-01-10 }} \"DESPAIN: My Take on Phantom Cautions\" Retrieved Dec. 22, 2007</ref>\n\nIn September 2013, NASCAR came under fire after the 2013 [[Federated Auto Parts 400]] when it was suggested that the race was manipulated by [[Clint Bowyer]] (having already clinched a playoff berth), who was accused of intentionally spinning out in order to slow down the race which had 7 laps to go. By this time, [[Ryan Newman (racing driver)|Ryan Newman]] was in the lead, and holding on to victory would have likely secured a playoff spot. However, a slow pit stop caused Newman to lose momentum, and [[Carl Edwards]] went on to win instead. This allowed for Bowyer's teammate [[Martin Truex Jr.]] to clinch a spot over Newman.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Bernstein |first1=Viv |title=Nascar Investigating Race for Possible Manipulation |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/sports/autoracing/nascar-investigating-race-for-possible-manipulation.html |accessdate=29 March 2019 |agency=New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |date=8 September 2013}}</ref> Later that week, NASCAR made its decision to penalize Truex Jr. for the incident, which meant that Newman would take his place. In an odd decision, NASCAR also decided to expand the playoff field to 13 instead of the established 12, giving [[Jeff Gordon]] (one of NASCAR's most popular drivers) a spot, with NASCAR stating that Gordon has also been unfairly aggrieved by Bowyer and Truex Jr.'s actions.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ryan |first1=Nate |title=NASCAR adds Jeff Gordon to expand Chase field to 13 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2013/09/13/chase-sprint-cup-penalties-joey-logano-david-gilliland-jeff-gordon/2811601/ |accessdate=29 March 2019 |agency=USA Today |publisher=Gannett |date=13 September 2013}}</ref> Simultaneously, [[Joey Logano]] was accused of receiving illicit help from [[Front Row Motorsports]] in order to secure a playoff spot, and both [[Penske Racing]] and [[Front Row Motorsports]] were placed on probation for the rest of the year as a result, but Logano was allowed to participate in the playoffs that year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Report: Joey Logano had help? |url=http://www.espn.com/racing/nascar/cup/story/_/id/9662535/report-joey-logano-struck-deal-enter-chase |website=ESPN |accessdate=29 March 2019 |date=12 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Sports}}\n* [[NASCAR rules and regulations]]\n* [[Car of Tomorrow]]\n* [[List of NASCAR race tracks]]\n* [[Smokey Yunick]]\n* [[Start and park]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons|NASCAR}}\n*[http://www.nascar.com NASCAR.COM] - The Official Site of NASCAR\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20081007153634/http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/motor_sports/1336277.html NASCAR Technology] - from PopularMechanics.com\n*[http://www.racing-reference.info/index.jsp Results of Every Race in NASCAR History at Racing-Reference.info]\n\n{{NASCAR}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Criticism Of Nascar}}\n[[Category:NASCAR controversies| ]]\n[[Category:Criticisms of companies|NASCAR]]\n[[Category:Criticism of sports]]\n[[Category:Auto racing controversies]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eManipulating the outcome of races and championships:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: two time \u2192 two-time, \u2019s \u2192 's", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criticism_of_NASCAR"}
