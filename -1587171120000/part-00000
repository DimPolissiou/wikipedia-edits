His esport career took start in 2012, and played for ''League of Legends'' teams Playing Ducks, PAH, Team BLACK (as a substitute) and SK Gaming. In November 2012 he joined Fnatic as their starting Marksman. Rekkles' young age has limited him however, when it prevented him from being able to play in the 2013 EU LCS for Fnatic. Because he could not take part in the LCS, a secondary Fnatic squad, Fnatic.Beta, was created around him. However, the team was disbanded after a few months. In May 2013 he started playing together with YoungBuck, Shook v2, cowTard, and Unlimited as PrideFC, and after the team got signed by Copenhagen Wolves, he agreed to continue playing with them as a stand-in. Together Fnatic decided that it will be best for him to rejoin the roster in the 2014 Season due to him not being eligible to play until after the group stage.\n\nOn 22 November in 2013, Rekkles officially retook the starting Marksman position from puszu.\n\n=== 2014 Season ===\nDuring the 4th season, Rekkles and Fnatic participated in the IEM Season VIII - World Championship, and ended up second place after losing to [[KT Rolster Bullets]] during the Grand Finale.\n\nAt the beginning of 2014 season Spring Split, Rekkles played very well and received the MVP prize weekly. Fnatic had won each of their four superweek games, and this was mainly due to the great performance of Rekkles playing Jinx. They ended the Spring split in 2nd place, losing to SK Gaming, but secured themselves a spot in the Spring Playoffs. The whole team raised their game for the playoffs, and they emerged victorious after a win against Alliance in their semifinals matchup, and against SK Gaming in the Grand Final.\n\nDue to Fnatic's great performance during the Spring Playoffs, they had qualified to compete at All-Star Paris 2014, along with other regional winners from around the world. The team made it to the semifinals of the tournament, losing to the world champions at the time, SK Telecom T1 K.\n\nFnatic endured a rocky start during the beginning of the Summer Split. They could not make it into the top 2 until Week 7 of the Split, while their main rivals Alliance were already at considerable distance ahead of them in the race for 1st place. Throughout the games, Rekkles managed to impress with his plays with Lucian and Vayne, picking up the Weekly MVP Award for Week 9. Although in the end, Fnatic could only manage a 2nd place finish. The team aimed to put the Split behind them and focused on the Summer Playoffs. The team beat ROCCAT in the semifinals, and had to battle against Alliance in the finals. The match ended in defeat for Fnatic, but the Playoffs saw the team seal their qualification for the [[2014 Season World Championship]].\n\nFnatic were placed with Group C along with LMQ, OMG and Samsung Blue, and only managed 2 wins in their group, and failing to progress to the knockout stage.\n\n=== 2015 Season ===\nOn 24 November 2014, Rekkles joined Alliance as starting AD carry, after many rumours. His first event with Alliance was IEM San Jose. During the IEM, Fnatic ended up in the semifinals, however team lost their match against Cloud9 and placed third after playing against Team SoloMid. During the event, Rekkles was nominated for the MVP award along with PowerOfEvil, Vizicsacsi, Kikis, and Sneaky; however the final vote went to Sneaky.\n\nIn order to comply with new LCS regulations, Alliance would have to change their name for the upcoming season. On 8 January, it was announced that the team had rebranded as Elements.<ref>http://www.dailydot.com/esports/alliance-rebrands-elements/</ref> The Spring Split was not a success for the team as they finished 7th place after making a number of roster changes. Therefore, the team did not made it to the playoffs, however they did qualify for the Summer Split.\n\nOn 14 May 2015, Rekkles rejoined Fnatic. The team went into the Summer Season with confidence running high after their performance on the international stage at the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational, with Steelback on the roster, before Rekkles rejoined the team. Fnatic managed to finish the regular season with a perfect, unbeaten 18-0 record, and became the first team to achieve this in League Championship Series history. This meant a 1st place regular season finish for the team and a bye to the semifinals of the Summer Playoffs. Fnatic went on to win the playoffs, beating Origen 3-2 in a tight final. This qualified the team for the 2015 World Championship, where they would compete as Europe's #1 seed.\n\nAt the 2015 World Championship, Fnatic were seeded into Group B alongside [[Ahq e-Sports Club]], [[Invictus Gaming]], and [[Cloud9 (eSports)|Cloud9]]. They picked up four wins in the group, going unbeaten in the 2nd week of group stage games, thanks to Rekkles' Kennen pick, meaning that they would advance to the knockout stage of the tournament. In the quarterfinals, Fnatic had beaten EDward Gaming by 3-0, before suffering a 3-0 loss against KOO Tigers in the semifinals, putting an end to their campaign.\n\n=== 2016 Season ===\nAt the start of the season, Fnatic were voted to play at IEM Season X - Cologne. They had undergone some roster changes and added a few new members [[Gamsu]], [[Spirit (video gamer)|Spirit]], and NoXiAK to join Febiven and Rekkles. The team had a bye to the semifinals, but were beaten at this stage by Qiao Gu Reapers. Despite being only in fifth place in the EU LCS split at the time of the tournament, Fnatic were invited to IEM Katowice due to their previous season's success. There, they had a surprisingly strong run, finishing second place against SK Telecom. Despite his only being played one time in premier-region play prior to Katowice (by Sneaky on Cloud9 in North America), Rekkles played Jhin in 5 out of Fnatic's 6 wins, not dropping a single game on the champion. Fnatic then joined the EU LCS Spring Split, and ended up third place. \n-->\n\n== Tournament results ==\n\n=== Fnatic ===\n* 1st \u2014 [[2014 Spring EU LCS]]\n* 9th\u201311th \u2014 [[2014 League of Legends World Championship|2014 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 1st \u2014 [[2015 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 3rd\u20134th \u2014 [[2015 League of Legends World Championship|2015 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 3rd \u2014 [[2016 EU LCS Spring]]\n* 2nd \u2014 [[IEM X World Championship]]\n* 5th \u2014 [[2016 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 5th\u20136th \u2014 [[2016 Summer EU LCS playoffs]]\n* 3rd \u2014 [[2017 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series|2017 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 5th\u20138th \u2013 [[2017 League of Legends World Championship|2017 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 1st \u2014 2018 EU LCS Spring<ref>{{cite news |title=Fnatic unstoppable in EU LCS grand finals match against G2 |url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/23079031/european-league-championship-series-fnatic-takes-g2-win-eu-lcs-title |accessdate=16 August 2019 |work=ESPN |date=8 April 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n* 3rd\u20134th \u2014 [[2018 Mid-Season Invitational]]\n* 1st \u2014 2018 EU LCS Summer\n* 2nd \u2014 [[2018 League of Legends World Championship]]\n* 3rd \u2014 2019 LEC Spring Split\n* 2nd \u2014 2019 LEC Summer Split\n* 5th-8th \u2014 [[2019 League of Legends World Championship]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://lol.gamepedia.com/Rekkles|sourcearticle=Rekkles}}\n\n[[Category:Fnatic players]]\n[[Category:Alliance (esports) players]]\n[[Category:Elements (League of Legends) players]]\n[[Category:League of Legends players]]\n[[Category:Swedish esports players]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:AD Carries]]\n[[Category:People from Berlin]]\n[[Category:People from Gothenburg]]\n[[Category:Swedish expatriates in Germany]]\n[[Category:Twitch streamers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Infobox video game player\n| ID            = Rekkles\n| name          = Martin Larsson\n| name_trans    = \n| image         = \n| caption       = \n| status        = Active\n| birth_date    = {{birth date and age|1996|09|17|df=yes}}\n| hometown      = [[\u00c4lv\u00e4ngen]], [[Sweden]]\n| nationality   = Swedish\n| team          = [[Fnatic]]\n| role          = AD Carry\n| league        = [[League of Legends European Championship|LEC]]\n| coach         = \n| games         = ''[[League of Legends]]''\n| earnings      = \n| nickname      = \n| years1        = 2012\n| team1         = Playing Duck\n| years2        = 2012\n| team2         = [[Fnatic]]\n| years3        = 2012\u20132013\n| team3         = Fnatic.Beta\n| years4        = 2013\n| team4         = PrideFC\n| years5        = 2013\u20132014\n| team5         = Fnatic\n| years6        = 2014\u20132015\n| team6         = [[Alliance (esports)|Alliance]]\n| years7        = 2015\n| team7         = [[Elements (esports)|Elements]]\n| years8        = 2015\u2013present\n| team8         = Fnatic\n| highlights    = \n*4\u00d7 [[EU LCS]] champion\n* [[League of Legends Rift Rivals|Rift Rivals]] champion ([[League of Legends Rift Rivals|2018]],[[2019 League of Legends Rift Rivals|2019]])\n| module = {{Infobox medal templates\n  | medals =\n{{MedalSport|''League of Legends''}}\n{{MedalCompetition|[[League of Legends World Championship|World Championship]]}}\n{{Medal|RU|[[2018 League of Legends World Championship|2018 South korea]]|}}\n  | title = Honors\n  | titlestyle = background:#ddddff\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Carl Martin Erik Larsson''' (born 17 September 1996), better known by his in-game name '''Rekkles''' (pronounced \"reckless\"), is a Swedish professional ''[[League of Legends]]'' player who currently plays AD Carry for [[Fnatic]] of the [[League of Legends European Championship|LEC]] (formerly the EU LCS).

The match ended in defeat for Fnatic, but the Playoffs saw the team seal their qualification for the [[2014 Season World Championship]].\n\nFnatic were placed with Group C along with LMQ, OMG and Samsung Blue, and only managed 2 wins in their group, and failing to progress to the knockout stage.\n\n=== 2015 Season ===\nOn 24 November 2014, Rekkles joined Alliance as starting AD carry, after many rumours. His first event with Alliance was IEM San Jose. During the IEM, Fnatic ended up in the semifinals, however team lost their match against Cloud9 and placed third after playing against Team SoloMid. During the event, Rekkles was nominated for the MVP award along with PowerOfEvil, Vizicsacsi, Kikis, and Sneaky; however the final vote went to Sneaky.\n\nIn order to comply with new LCS regulations, Alliance would have to change their name for the upcoming season. On 8 January, it was announced that the team had rebranded as Elements.<ref>http://www.dailydot.com/esports/alliance-rebrands-elements/</ref> The Spring Split was not a success for the team as they finished 7th place after making a number of roster changes. Therefore, the team did not made it to the playoffs, however they did qualify for the Summer Split.\n\nOn 14 May 2015, Rekkles rejoined Fnatic. The team went into the Summer Season with confidence running high after their performance on the international stage at the 2015 Mid-Season Invitational, with Steelback on the roster, before Rekkles rejoined the team. Fnatic managed to finish the regular season with a perfect, unbeaten 18-0 record, and became the first team to achieve this in League Championship Series history. This meant a 1st place regular season finish for the team and a bye to the semifinals of the Summer Playoffs. Fnatic went on to win the playoffs, beating Origen 3-2 in a tight final. This qualified the team for the 2015 World Championship, where they would compete as Europe's #1 seed.\n\nAt the 2015 World Championship, Fnatic were seeded into Group B alongside [[Ahq e-Sports Club]], [[Invictus Gaming]], and [[Cloud9 (eSports)|Cloud9]]. They picked up four wins in the group, going unbeaten in the 2nd week of group stage games, thanks to Rekkles' Kennen pick, meaning that they would advance to the knockout stage of the tournament. In the quarterfinals, Fnatic had beaten EDward Gaming by 3-0, before suffering a 3-0 loss against KOO Tigers in the semifinals, putting an end to their campaign.\n\n=== 2016 Season ===\nAt the start of the season, Fnatic were voted to play at IEM Season X - Cologne. They had undergone some roster changes and added a few new members [[Gamsu]], [[Spirit (video gamer)|Spirit]], and NoXiAK to join Febiven and Rekkles. The team had a bye to the semifinals, but were beaten at this stage by Qiao Gu Reapers. Despite being only in fifth place in the EU LCS split at the time of the tournament, Fnatic were invited to IEM Katowice due to their previous season's success. There, they had a surprisingly strong run, finishing second place against SK Telecom. Despite his only being played one time in premier-region play prior to Katowice (by Sneaky on Cloud9 in North America), Rekkles played Jhin in 5 out of Fnatic's 6 wins, not dropping a single game on the champion. Fnatic then joined the EU LCS Spring Split, and ended up third place. \n-->\n\n== Tournament results ==\n\n=== Fnatic ===\n* 1st \u2014 [[2014 Spring EU LCS]]\n* 9th\u201311th \u2014 [[2014 League of Legends World Championship|2014 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 1st \u2014 [[2015 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 3rd\u20134th \u2014 [[2015 League of Legends World Championship|2015 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 3rd \u2014 [[2016 EU LCS Spring]]\n* 2nd \u2014 [[IEM X World Championship]]\n* 5th \u2014 [[2016 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 5th\u20136th \u2014 [[2016 Summer EU LCS playoffs]]\n* 3rd \u2014 [[2017 Summer European League of Legends Championship Series|2017 Summer EU LCS]]\n* 5th\u20138th \u2013 [[2017 League of Legends World Championship|2017 ''League of Legends'' World Championship]]\n* 1st \u2014 2018 EU LCS Spring<ref>{{cite news |title=Fnatic unstoppable in EU LCS grand finals match against G2 |url=http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/23079031/european-league-championship-series-fnatic-takes-g2-win-eu-lcs-title |accessdate=16 August 2019 |work=ESPN |date=8 April 2018 |language=en}}</ref>\n* 3rd\u20134th \u2014 [[2018 Mid-Season Invitational]]\n* 1st \u2014 2018 EU LCS Summer\n* 2nd \u2014 [[2018 League of Legends World Championship]]\n* 3rd \u2014 2019 LEC Spring Split\n* 2nd \u2014 2019 LEC Summer Split\n* 5th-8th \u2014 [[2019 League of Legends World Championship]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{CCBYSASource|sourcepath=http://lol.gamepedia.com/Rekkles|sourcearticle=Rekkles}}\n\n[[Category:Fnatic players]]\n[[Category:Alliance (esports) players]]\n[[Category:Elements (League of Legends) players]]\n[[Category:League of Legends players]]\n[[Category:Swedish esports players]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:AD Carries]]\n[[Category:People from Berlin]]\n[[Category:People from Gothenburg]]\n[[Category:Swedish expatriates in Germany]]\n[[Category:Twitch streamers]]\n", "name_user": "185.129.113.217", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I changed birthday date because this date was wrong)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rekkles"}
