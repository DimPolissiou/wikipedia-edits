Rock makes his first appearance as a playable character in the [[fighting game]] ''[[Garou: Mark of the Wolves]]'', the last chapter in the ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' series, as the new lead character from the series. Rock appears in the series as the son of [[Geese Howard]], the main antagonist from the previous ''Fatal Fury'' games, who was killed by [[Terry Bogard]]. However, Terry started to take care of Rock to the point he teaches him to fight. Besides his appearance in ''Mark of the Wolves'', Rock is featured in few games from ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series as well as various crossovers from SNK. He was voiced by [[Eiji Takemoto]] ({{lang|ja|\u7af9\u672c \u82f1\u53f2}}) since debut until ''Maximum Impact Regulation A'', later voiced by [[Yuuma Uchida]] ({{lang|ja|\u5185\u7530\u96c4\u99ac}}). In the English edition of ''[[KOF: Maximum Impact]]'' he is voiced by Jon Thomas, and by Mike Lane in its [[KOF: Maximum Impact 2|sequel]].\n\nRock has also been featured in manwhua adaptations from the games he has appeared as well as the anime ''[[The King of Fighters Another Day]]'' and ''[[The King of Fighters: Destiny]]''. Rock's character has received various responses from video games publications. His debut in ''Mark of the Wolves'' has been highly praised by reviewers although some of them considered his character to be too strong in comparison to the others. However, his development in the ''KOF: Maximum Impact'' series has been criticized due to his English voice actor and his new outfit.\n\n==Conception and design==\nThe character of Rock Howard was created by Nobuyuki Kuroki in 1998. Both he and Yasuyuki Oda wondered what type of hero would succeed [[Terry Bogard]] in ''Fatal Fury''{{'}}s latest game, ''Garou: Mark of the Wolves''.

Every day, Rock fights off his evil side and tries to get out of the shadow of his father. He is the middle term between Geese's excessive evil and Terry's excessive festive personality.

Also, his ''Crack Counter'' is a reversal that can be directed high or low akin to Geese, where upon succeeding, Rock slams an opponent with a kick that resembles Terry's ''Crack Shot''.

Every day, Rock fights off his evil side and tries to get out of the shadow of his father. He is the middle term between Geese's excessive evil and Terry's excessive festive personality. Rock is also a very compassionate man, offering to help those in need such as helping Hotaru Futaba to find her older brother.<ref>{{cite video game|quote='''Rock:''' If it's okay with you, I'll look for your brother.|title=Garou: Mark of the Wolves|developer=SNK |publisher=SNK |date=November 1999|platform=Arcade}}</ref> He also tends to be very uncomfortable and nervous around women, having been raised by men nearly all of his life.<ref>{{cite video game|title=KOF Maximum Impact 2 |developer=SNK Playmore|publisher=SNK Playmore|date=2006-04-27 |platform=PlayStation 2|quote='''Rock:''' Man, this sucks.

Also, his ''Crack Counter'' is a reversal that can be directed high or low akin to Geese, where upon succeeding, Rock slams an opponent with a kick that resembles Terry's ''Crack Shot''.
