Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  . Also, research \"Hotpoint Iron\". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[antitrust legislation]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.<ref name=\"eai\" />\n\nIn the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies.

Brown goods typically require high technical knowledge and skills (which get more complex with time, such as going from a [[soldering iron]] to a hot-air soldering station), while white goods may need more practical skills and force to manipulate the devices and heavy tools required to repair them.\n\n==Definition==\nGiven a broad usage, the domestic application attached to home appliance is tied to the definition of [[Appliance (disambiguation)|appliance]] as \"an instrument or device designed for a particular use or function\".<ref>{{cite dictionary | url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/appliance | title=Appliance | dictionary=Merriam Webster | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> More specifically, [[Collins English Dictionary]] defines \"home appliance\" as: \"devices or machines, usually electrical, that are in your home and which you use to do jobs such as cleaning or cooking\".<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/household-appliances | title=Definition of household appliances | publisher=Collins Dictionary | accessdate=24 July 2013}}</ref> The broad usage, afforded to the definition allows for nearly any device intended for domestic use to be a home appliance, including [[consumer electronics]] as well as [[stove]]s,<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> [[refrigerator]]s, [[toaster]]s<ref name=\"Bulletin 2014\"/> and [[air conditioner]]s.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Toaster, Universal, Model E947, c. 1915, Landers, Frary and Clark, New Britain, Connecticut, Wolfsonian-FIU Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Early 20th century electric [[toaster]]]]\n<!-- The reference structure of this section seems to be \"refs at the end of each paragraph\". Feel free to reference however you like, though-->\nWhile many appliances have existed for centuries, the self-contained electric or gas powered appliances are a uniquely American innovation that emerged in the twentieth century. The development of these appliances is tied to the disappearance of full-time [[domestic servant]]s and the desire to reduce the time-consuming activities in pursuit of more recreational time. In the early 1900s, electric and gas appliances included [[washing machine]]s, [[water heater]]s, [[refrigerator]]s, [[kettle]]s and [[sewing machine]]s. The invention of Earl Richardson's small electric [[clothes iron]] in 1903 gave a small initial boost to the home appliance industry.<!--For this sentence only   <ref name=\"George2003\"/>  . Also, research \"Hotpoint Iron\". Also, linking to [[Earl Richardson]] will give the wrong person --> In the [[Post\u2013World War II economic expansion]], the domestic use of [[dishwasher]]s, and [[clothes dryer]]s were part of a shift for convenience.

Throughout this period companies merged and acquired one another to reduce research and production costs and eliminate competitors, resulting in [[antitrust legislation]].\n\nThe [[United States Department of Energy]] reviews compliance with the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, which required manufacturers to reduce the energy consumption of the appliances by 25% every five years.<ref name=\"eai\" />\n\nIn the 1990s, the appliance industry was very consolidated, with over 90% of the products being sold by just five companies.

Mayrhofen is situated near the [[Hintertux]] glacier, which, at {{convert|3,250|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]], is above the snowline.  Skiing is available all year round here.  Mayrhofen sits between the [[Penken]] and the Ahorn mountains which provide ski runs in the winter and mountain biking, hiking and paragliding in the summer. The Ahorn offers mainly easy and intermediate runs, but also has a long, steep black run (formerly red) which was once on the World Cup Downhill circuit but was removed as it was deemed too dangerous. The Penken mountain offers Austria's steepest piste, named Harakiri, as well as a large range of ski runs at different levels of difficulty. It is connected by lifts with the villages of [[Finkenberg]], Lanersbach and [[Schwendau]].\n\n[[File:Doppelmayr 30-TGD Penkenbahn 2015.webm|thumb|[[3S Cable Car|tricable detachable gondola lift]] ''Penkenbahn'' and its stations]]\n\nThe Penken is reached by a Gondola system which is located on the main street next to the Sport Hotel Strass, in the centre of the village, while the Ahorn Cable car, which {{As of|2008|lc=y}} is the largest cable car in Austria (160 passengers) is situated at the southern end of the town. Mayrhofen is a snowboard-minded village with a funpark sponsored by [[Vans]], and the snowboardhotel Gasthof Zillertal owned by the Dutch organisation 'SAIKO expeditions'. Mountaineer [[Peter Habeler]] and Downhill Racer [[Uli Spiess]] both come from Mayrhofen.\n\nThe Ahornbahn cable car has gondolas which can take up to 160 people - the biggest in Austria. The size of the gondola means that it can also be used as a \"floating caf\u00e9\" when the weather is bad.\n\nThe town also provides an excellent base for walkers - there are hundreds of clearly marked walks suitable for everyone from beginners who can walk along the Ziller valley to experienced walkers who can walk on the mountains. There are also excellent bus and rail services both along the valley and up into the mountains.\n\n== Events ==\nEach spring (usually early April), Mayrhofen hosts the ''[[Snowbombing]]'' music festival. Since the initial event in 2000 (held in [[Risoul]], France), snowbombing has gathered much notoriety and respect in the [[electronic dance music]] world as one of the major festivals.

The event has been hosted by Mayrhofen since 2005.\n{{Wide image|Snowbombing.jpg|800px|Snowbombing piste-side music venue}}\n\n==Climate==\n{{climate chart|Mayrhofen\n|-4|1|55\n|-3|4|46\n|-0|10|63\n|3|14|74\n|8|20|97\n|11|22|131\n|13|24|149\n|12|23|131\n|9|19|97\n|5|14|65\n|0|6|75\n|-3|1|62\n|source=[http://www.zamg.ac.at/fix/klima/oe71-00/klima2000/daten/klimadaten/tir/15000.htm ZAMG]\n}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Mayrhofen (1971\u20132000)\n|single line = Yes\n|metric first = Yes\n|Jan record high C = 16.0\n|Feb record high C = 17.0\n|Mar record high C = 24.0\n|Apr record high C = 27.0\n|May record high C = 31.0\n|Jun record high C = 32.6\n|Jul record high C = 36.0\n|Aug record high C = 35.0\n|Sep record high C = 31.2\n|Oct record high C = 26.0\n|Nov record high C = 21.6\n|Dec record high C = 19.0\n|year record high C = 36.0\n|Jan high C = 1.1\n|Feb high C = 4.3\n|Mar high C = 9.6\n|Apr high C = 14.1\n|May high C = 19.7\n|Jun high C = 21.7\n|Jul high C = 23.8\n|Aug high C = 23.2\n|Sep high C = 19.3\n|Oct high C = 13.9\n|Nov high C = 6.0\n|Dec high C = 1.4\n|year high C = 13.2\n|Jan mean C = -2.1\n|Feb mean C = -0.4\n|Mar mean C = 3.6\n|Apr mean C = 7.6\n|May mean C = 12.7\n|Jun mean C = 15.2\n|Jul mean C = 17.1\n|Aug mean C = 16.5\n|Sep mean C = 12.9\n|Oct mean C = 8.3\n|Nov mean C = 2.3\n|Dec mean C = -1.3\n|year mean C = 7.7\n|Jan low C = -4.4\n|Feb low C = -3.4\n|Mar low C = 0.0\n|Apr low C = 3.3\n|May low C = 7.8\n|Jun low C = 10.6\n|Jul low C = 12.5\n|Aug low C = 12.3\n|Sep low C = 9.2\n|Oct low C = 4.9\n|Nov low C = -0.1\n|Dec low C = -3.4\n|year low C = 4.1\n|Jan record low C = -22.0\n|Feb record low C = -16.4\n|Mar record low C = -16.2\n|Apr record low C = -5.0\n|May record low C = -4.0\n|Jun record low C = 1.8\n|Jul record low C = 1.0\n|Aug record low C = 4.0\n|Sep record low C = 0.0\n|Oct record low C = -5.7\n|Nov record low C = -13.2\n|Dec record low C = -18.0\n|year record low C = -22.0\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 54.7\n|Feb precipitation mm = 46.4\n|Mar precipitation mm = 63.2\n|Apr precipitation mm = 74.0\n|May precipitation mm = 96.9\n|Jun precipitation mm = 130.9\n|Jul precipitation mm = 148.9\n|Aug precipitation mm = 130.7\n|Sep precipitation mm = 97.0\n|Oct precipitation mm = 64.7\n|Nov precipitation mm = 74.6\n|Dec precipitation mm = 61.7\n|year precipitation mm = 1043.7\n|Jan snow cm = 28.0\n|Feb snow cm = 25.3\n|Mar snow cm = 16.4\n|Apr snow cm = 4.5\n|May snow cm = 0.4\n|Jun snow cm = 0.0\n|Jul snow cm = 0.0\n|Aug snow cm = 0.0\n|Sep snow cm = 0.0\n|Oct snow cm = 0.8\n|Nov snow cm = 10.2\n|Dec snow cm = 20.8\n|year snow cm = 106.4\n|unit precipitation days = 1.0 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 8.4\n|Feb precipitation days = 7.9\n|Mar precipitation days = 9.9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10.6\n|May precipitation days = 11.4\n|Jun precipitation days = 15.0\n|Jul precipitation days = 15.4\n|Aug precipitation days = 14.2\n|Sep precipitation days = 10.7\n|Oct precipitation days = 8.3\n|Nov precipitation days = 9.7\n|Dec precipitation days = 9.2\n|year precipitation days = 130.7\n|time day = 14:00\n|Jan humidity = 79.7\n|Feb humidity = 65.6\n|Mar humidity = 55.5\n|Apr humidity = 50.7\n|May humidity = 47.9\n|Jun humidity = 53.4\n|Jul humidity = 54.6\n|Aug humidity = 56.3\n|Sep humidity = 58.6\n|Oct humidity = 63.6\n|Nov humidity = 76.5\n|Dec humidity = 85.9\n|year humidity = 62.4\n|Jan sun = 2.4\n|Feb sun = 69.0\n|Mar sun = 130.3\n|Apr sun = 124.1\n|May sun = 183.5\n|Jun sun = 164.4\n|Jul sun = 183.6\n|Aug sun = 176.9\n|Sep sun = 138.4\n|Oct sun = 87.4\n|Nov sun = 19.5\n|Dec sun = 11.2\n|year sun = 1290.7\n|source 1 = [[Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics]]<ref name = ZAMG>{{cite web\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20191012234750/http://www.zamg.ac.at/fix/klima/oe71-00/klima2000/klimadaten_oesterreich_1971_frame1.htm\n| archivedate = 12 October 2019\n| url = http://www.zamg.ac.at/fix/klima/oe71-00/klima2000/klimadaten_oesterreich_1971_frame1.htm\n| title = Klimadaten von \u00d6sterreich 1971\u20132000 \u2013 Tirol-Mayrhofen\n| language = German\n| publisher = Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynamics\n| accessdate = 31 October 2019}}</ref>\n}}\n\n== Transport ==\n[[File:Zillertalbahn Bahnhof Mayrhofen 2010.jpg|thumb|The railway station at Mayrhofen im Zillertal.]]\nMayrhofen has one railway station, which is located next to the Zillertaler Bundestrasse. The station is a terminus for all Train services operated by the [[Zillertalbahn]], the valley's main public transport operator. The railway runs between Jenbach and Mayrhofen itself, and there are several intermediate stations, which provide access to many of the valley's well known ski areas, namely Zell am Ziller (Zillertal 3000), F\u00fcgen (Spieljoch) and Uderns (for the Hochf\u00fcgen and Kaltenbach ski areas). The railway operates year-round, although in summer there are also a variety of \"special\" services, such as a steam train service.\n\nThe Zillertalbahn also run bus routes in the valley, which are regular and cover an extensive area. There are also many extra services in the winter, particularly during the ski season, to cater for the skiers and snowboarders visiting the valley.\n\n== Statistics ==\n* Elevation: Top: {{convert|2,500|m|abbr=off}} (with ski-lift)\n* Lifts: 48\n* Terrain: {{convert|157|km|0|abbr=off}} of groomed slopes in the region\n\n== Twin towns ==\n*{{flagicon|SUI}} [[Chur]], Switzerland\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Bad T\u00f6lz]], [[Germany]]\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Bad Homburg]], [[Germany]]\n*{{flagicon|ITA}} [[Terracina]], [[Italy]]\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Cabourg]], [[France]]\n*{{flagicon|LUX}} [[Bad Mondorf]], [[Luxembourg]]\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Beilngries]], [[Germany]]\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Hinterzarten]], [[Germany]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Commons and category|Mayrhofen}}\n{{wikivoyage|Mayrhofen}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20151121022631/http://www.mayrhofensecrets.com/ Mayrhofen Secrets]\n* [http://www.mayrhofenonline.com/ Mayrhofen Business Directory]\n* [http://www.mayrhofen.at/?L=1 Official Mayrhofen Tourist Information site]\n* [http://www.mayrhofner-bergbahnen.com/en/homepage.html Mayrhofen cable car company]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120419193840/http://www.zillertaler-flugschule.com/flugschule-zillertal-tandemparagleiten-paragleiten.html Zillertaler Flugschule - Paraglide & Hangglide]\n\n{{Cities and towns in Schwaz (district)}}\n\n[[Category:Cities and towns in Schwaz District]]\n[[Category:Ski areas and resorts in Austria]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayrhofen"}

He arrived back in Hungary in 1946. In April 1947 he was among a group{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that destroyed a Budapest statue of [[Ottok\u00e1r Proh\u00e1szka]], a Hungarian bishop who is respected by many but who is often considered antisemitic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223224506/http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |archivedate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> He only admitted his participation forty years later.\n\nIn 1949 he was condemned with fictitious accusations and was sent to the labor camp of [[Recsk]] for three years. During this time, he lectured other prisoners in literature, history and philosophy. After his release he made his living by translation. In 1956 (after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Revolution]]) he escaped again to the West. He settled in London, and was the editor of a Hungarian literary journal.\n\nIt was during his stay in London that Faludy wrote his memoir, which was soon translated to English, by which he is still best known outside Hungary: ''My Happy Days in Hell''. (It was only published in his native language in 1987, and since then in several further editions.) He moved to [[Toronto]] in 1967 and lived there for twenty years. He gave lectures in Canada and the U.S. and was the editor of Hungarian literary journals. In 1976, he received a Canadian citizenship and two years later was elected as an honorary doctor of the [[University of Toronto]] where he regularly taught. His poems were published by The New York Resident in 1980 (see below with the other collections).\n\nIn 1988 Faludy returned to Hungary. After the fall of communism, his works, which were forbidden, confiscated, destroyed and distributed as [[samizdat]] during the Communist period, were at last published in Hungary. New collections of poems appeared in the 1990s, and several translations as well. In 1994 he received the most prestigious award in Hungary, the [[Kossuth Prize]]. In 2000 he published the sequel of ''My Happy Days in Hell'': \"After My Days in Hell\" in Hungarian (no data available about any English translation), about his life after the labour camp. In the years preceding his death, Faludy was considered not only as a poet, a writer and a translator but as a living legend in Hungary.\n\nRenowned for his anecdotes as well as his writing, he was a celebrated wit whose life story attracted the attentions of many a foreign author. Besides the many European based authors who visited Faludy, there was the Canadian author [[George Jonas]] who penned [[Munich (film)|Munich]] as well as the columnist and poet/playwright [[Turn left at Gilgamesh|Rory Winston]].\n\n=== Relationships ===\nFaludy's first wife was Vali \u00c1cs. His second wife, Zsuzsa Szeg\u0151, died in 1963. They had a son, Andrew, born in 1955.

At this time he began to learn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and finally caught up with Faludy three years later in Malta. He became his secretary, translator, co-author and partner for the next 36 years.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/96723 Poet's name lives on in parkette, Judy Stoffman, The Toronto Star, Oct 04, 2006</ref> In 2002 when Faludy married again, Johnson left for Kathmandu, Nepal, and died there in February 2004. In 1984, while living in Toronto, Faludy married Leonie Kalman (n\u00e9e Erenyi), a long-time family friend from Budapest and Tangier, Morocco, at Toronto City Hall.  George and Leonie kept their separate residences and did not consummate their marriage, but Leonie kept the Faludy name until her death in 2011 (in Fleet, Hants, UK), aged 102. In 2002, Faludy married a 26-year-old poet, Fanny Kov\u00e1cs. Faludy published poems written jointly with his wife.\n\n=== A memorial park in Toronto ===\nIn 2006, a memorial park was built in his honor designed by the landscape architect Scott Torrance, facing his former apartment at 25 St. Mary's Street. It was initiated by the Toronto Legacy Project to commemorate the outstanding cultural figures of the city. A bronze plaque was placed in the park with his portrait, made by the Hungarian-born sculptor [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt]]. His poem ''Michelangelo's Last Prayer'', chosen by the poet, was carved on the plaque in English and in Hungarian.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1127253019174&call_pageid=968867495754&col=969483191630&DPL=IvsNDS%2f7ChAX&tacodalogin=yes</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n\nFaludy's translations of the ballads of [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]], and even more prominent rewritings (as he admitted several times), brought him huge popularity on their initial publication in 1934, and have been since published about forty times. He could have hardly expressed these ideas in any other way in his time. He wrote several volumes of poetry as well, some of which were published in English. His other outstanding success was ''My Happy Days in Hell'' (Pokolb\u00e9li v\u00edg napjaim), a memoir first published in 1962 in English translation, which was translated to French and German as well, but did not appear in the original Hungarian until much later.\n\n== Works published in English ==\n*1962: ''My Happy Days in Hell''; reissued 1985, {{ISBN|0-00-217461-8}}; 2003, {{ISBN|963-206-584-0}}\n*1966: ''City of Splintered Gods''; translated by Flora Papastavrou\n*1970: ''Erasmus of Rotterdam''. {{ISBN|0-413-26990-6}}; 1971, {{ISBN|0-8128-1444-4}}\n*1978: ''East and West: Selected Poems of George Faludy''; edited by John Robert Colombo; with a profile of the poet by Barbara Amiel.

He arrived back in Hungary in 1946. In April 1947 he was among a group{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} that destroyed a Budapest statue of [[Ottok\u00e1r Proh\u00e1szka]], a Hungarian bishop who is respected by many but who is often considered antisemitic.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070223224506/http://www.es.hu/pd/display.asp?channel=PUBLICISZTIKA0619&article=2006-0514-1347-06YOUI |archivedate=2007-02-23 }}</ref> He only admitted his participation forty years later.\n\nIn 1949 he was condemned with fictitious accusations and was sent to the labor camp of [[Recsk]] for three years. During this time, he lectured other prisoners in literature, history and philosophy. After his release he made his living by translation. In 1956 (after the [[1956 Hungarian Revolution|Revolution]]) he escaped again to the West. He settled in London, and was the editor of a Hungarian literary journal.\n\nIt was during his stay in London that Faludy wrote his memoir, which was soon translated to English, by which he is still best known outside Hungary: ''My Happy Days in Hell''. (It was only published in his native language in 1987, and since then in several further editions.) He moved to [[Toronto]] in 1967 and lived there for twenty years. He gave lectures in Canada and the U.S. and was the editor of Hungarian literary journals. In 1976, he received a Canadian citizenship and two years later was elected as an honorary doctor of the [[University of Toronto]] where he regularly taught. His poems were published by The New York Resident in 1980 (see below with the other collections).\n\nIn 1988 Faludy returned to Hungary. After the fall of communism, his works, which were forbidden, confiscated, destroyed and distributed as [[samizdat]] during the Communist period, were at last published in Hungary. New collections of poems appeared in the 1990s, and several translations as well. In 1994 he received the most prestigious award in Hungary, the [[Kossuth Prize]]. In 2000 he published the sequel of ''My Happy Days in Hell'': \"After My Days in Hell\" in Hungarian (no data available about any English translation), about his life after the labour camp. In the years preceding his death, Faludy was considered not only as a poet, a writer and a translator but as a living legend in Hungary.\n\nRenowned for his anecdotes as well as his writing, he was a celebrated wit whose life story attracted the attentions of many a foreign author. Besides the many European based authors who visited Faludy, there was the Canadian author [[George Jonas]] who penned [[Munich (film)|Munich]] as well as the columnist and poet/playwright [[Turn left at Gilgamesh|Rory Winston]].\n\n=== Relationships ===\nFaludy's first wife was Vali \u00c1cs. His second wife, Zsuzsa Szeg\u0151, died in 1963. They had a son, Andrew, born in 1955.

At this time he began to learn [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and finally caught up with Faludy three years later in Malta. He became his secretary, translator, co-author and partner for the next 36 years.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/comment/columnists/article/96723 Poet's name lives on in parkette, Judy Stoffman, The Toronto Star, Oct 04, 2006</ref> In 2002 when Faludy married again, Johnson left for Kathmandu, Nepal, and died there in February 2004. In 1984, while living in Toronto, Faludy married Leonie Kalman (n\u00e9e Erenyi), a long-time family friend from Budapest and Tangier, Morocco, at Toronto City Hall.  George and Leonie kept their separate residences and did not consummate their marriage, but Leonie kept the Faludy name until her death in 2011 (in Fleet, Hants, UK), aged 102. In 2002, Faludy married a 26-year-old poet, Fanny Kov\u00e1cs. Faludy published poems written jointly with his wife.\n\n=== A memorial park in Toronto ===\nIn 2006, a memorial park was built in his honor designed by the landscape architect Scott Torrance, facing his former apartment at 25 St. Mary's Street. It was initiated by the Toronto Legacy Project to commemorate the outstanding cultural figures of the city. A bronze plaque was placed in the park with his portrait, made by the Hungarian-born sculptor [[Dora de Pedery-Hunt]]. His poem ''Michelangelo's Last Prayer'', chosen by the poet, was carved on the plaque in English and in Hungarian.<ref>https://www.thestar.com/NASApp/cs/ContentServer?pagename=thestar/Layout/Article_Type1&c=Article&cid=1127253019174&call_pageid=968867495754&col=969483191630&DPL=IvsNDS%2f7ChAX&tacodalogin=yes</ref>\n\n== Work ==\n\nFaludy's translations of the ballads of [[Fran\u00e7ois Villon]], and even more prominent rewritings (as he admitted several times), brought him huge popularity on their initial publication in 1934, and have been since published about forty times. He could have hardly expressed these ideas in any other way in his time. He wrote several volumes of poetry as well, some of which were published in English. His other outstanding success was ''My Happy Days in Hell'' (Pokolb\u00e9li v\u00edg napjaim), a memoir first published in 1962 in English translation, which was translated to French and German as well, but did not appear in the original Hungarian until much later.\n\n== Works published in English ==\n*1962: ''My Happy Days in Hell''; reissued 1985, {{ISBN|0-00-217461-8}}; 2003, {{ISBN|963-206-584-0}}\n*1966: ''City of Splintered Gods''; translated by Flora Papastavrou\n*1970: ''Erasmus of Rotterdam''. {{ISBN|0-413-26990-6}}; 1971, {{ISBN|0-8128-1444-4}}\n*1978: ''East and West: Selected Poems of George Faludy''; edited by John Robert Colombo; with a profile of the poet by Barbara Amiel.

In Japan, the game was released as {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Gestalt'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30b2\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30eb\u30c8|N\u012ba Geshutaruto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} for the Xbox 360, while an alternate version entitled {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Replicant'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8|N\u012ba Repurikanto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released exclusively in Japan for PlayStation 3 with a younger main character. A high-definition remaster of ''Replicant'', titled {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139...'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8ver.1.22474487139...|N\u012ba Repurikanto ver.1.22474487139...|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, is in development for a worldwide release on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].\n\nThe game is a spin-off from the [[Drakengard|''Drakengard'' series]], and follows the fifth ending of the [[Drakengard (video game)|first game]], the events of which have left the planet Earth in a state of decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular [[protagonist]] Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kain\u00e9 and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various [[video game genres]], occasionally switching between them and the main [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]]-based gameplay.\n\nThe game was developed to appeal both to older players and to players outside Japan, where the developer was based. The music was composed by [[Keiichi Okabe]], head of Monaca, a music composition studio, and has sparked the release of several albums. ''Nier'' was released to mixed reception; reviewers praised the story, characters and soundtrack and were mixed in their opinions of how well the disparate gameplay elements were connected.  The execution of some gameplay elements was criticized, notably the side quests, and especially the graphics (which were regarded as substandard). Despite this, the game acquired acclaim among players over time, becoming a cult classic. A more successful sequel developed by [[PlatinumGames]], titled ''[[Nier: Automata]],'' was released in 2017.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Nier Screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A screenshot from the game, showing Nier in combat with a boss monster.

The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings to the side and Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a top-down [[shoot 'em up]] or other video game genres.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/>\n\nWhile traveling the player is frequently attacked by monsters, which include shadowy figures called Shades, large animals, and robots.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/> Defeating these enemies gives the player experience points that can increase Nier's power, and money that can be used to purchase items.<ref name=\"EGreview\"/> Nier can attack these creatures with either a one- or two-handed sword, or a spear. These weapons can be customized to have greater damage and abilities using materials that can be purchased, dropped from monsters, or scavenged around the world. Multiple different varieties of each weapon type can be acquired. The player can also use magic spells, which require enough energy from a constantly regenerating amount to cast. These spells include projectiles and large shadowy fists, among others; new spells are acquired in the first half of the game by completing specific battles.<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> In addition to the main plotline, ''Nier'' includes numerous side-quests, which give the player experience points and money, as well as fishing and farming segments.<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe game opens with a prologue during the summer of 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from ethereal monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough badly.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Nier''': You alright, Yonah? / '''Yonah''': Sorry, Dad. ...I'm sorry.

The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of [[train tracks]] and [[industrial machinery]]. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.\n\nAs Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is [[Terminal illness|terminal]], Nier sets out to look for a cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, [[Grimoire]] Weiss, which suggests that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Grimoire Weiss''': Bah!

It is revealed that the Shadowlord's true identity is the Gestalt form of the Nier from the prologue; the Nier the player has been controlling for the majority of the game is his Replicant. Driven to protect his Yonah, he was the first Gestalt and has combined her with the Replicant Yonah. The original Yonah, however, tells the Gestalt Nier that she can hear the new Yonah inside her, and that she loves the Replicant Nier and deserves the body just as much. She vacates the body, and Nier and Yonah are reunited.<ref name=\":14\">{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Yonah''': [while possessed: to the Shadowlord] Wait!

The player gains the ability to understand what the shades are saying, including the one possessing Kain\u00e9, though in-game Nier, Weiss, and Emil are still unable to.

The events of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'' take place after this ending.\n\n==Development==\nThe concept that would become ''Nier'' was first proposed following the release of ''[[Drakengard 2]]'' and the reveal of [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] consoles. The original concept was for a third entry in the [[Drakengard (series)|''Drakengard'' series]]. It was intended to be for the [[PlayStation 3]] due to the lessening importance of the [[PlayStation 2]], which ''Drakengard 2'' had been made for. However, as the project evolved, the original ideas were reworked and the game eventually became a spin-off from the main series. Despite this, the game's director [[Yoko Taro]] continues to think of it as the third ''Drakengard'' game.<ref name=\"NierOrigins\"/> Including concept planning, the total development time lasted three years, with two years spent actually developing the game. It was initially a small-scale project, but during planning it grew into a full-fledged role-playing game. Development was handled by [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]] with help from [[Square Enix]], who had previously provided development support for the ''Drakengard'' games.<ref name=\"GetInterview1\"/> Square Enix had minimal input on Yoko's vision for the game's atmosphere and story, allowing him high creative control.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/>\n\n''Nier'' is intended to be set over 1000 years after the events of ''[[Drakengard (video game)|Drakengard]]'''s fifth ending. In this scenario, the game's protagonists Caim and Angelus travel across a dimensional boundary to fight a monstrous beast. After winning the battle and killing the monster, they are shot down by a fighter jet and killed; their introduction of magic to the world leads to magical research that results in the Black Scrawl.<ref name=\"NierDOD\"/> According to Yoko, after the dark story of ''Drakengard'', Yoko focused on more positive themes of friendship and combined effort.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/> Much of the game was inspired by the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[War on Terror]]. Yoko took from it the idea of a terrible event where both sides believed they were doing the right thing, and wanted to show the player multiple perspectives of the same events.<ref name=\"GDC911\"/> The term \"Replicant\" was borrowed by Yoko from the 1982 science fiction movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', although Yoko did not cite a particular source for Nier's name, passing it off as a codename that persisted through development.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/><ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/>\n\nThe characters were designed by an artist under the moniker D.K.<ref name=\"GWInier\"/> Two character designs for the protagonist were created for ''Nier''. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character.<ref name=\"IGint\"/> Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier being a father rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions;<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/> while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design,<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/> an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision.<ref name= \"NierAdult\"/> Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kain\u00e9 was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature.<ref name=\"NIERnovela\"/> Yonah's original Japanese name was derived from the Biblical name [[Jonah]]: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with a man, so the name was changed to \"Yonah\".<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/><ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/> Yoko was initially shocked at Kain\u00e9's design, but warmed to it and successfully had it kept.<ref name=\"GWInier\"/> Kain\u00e9's character was made [[intersex]], since the team felt it fit in with many other aspects of her gritty backstory. Kain\u00e9's status as intersex caused some commotion in western territories, which is something the team did not actively intend.<ref name=\"SilNierInterview\"/> Yoko attributed the original suggestion to female staff members working on the game.<ref name=\"GetInterview1\"/>\n\nThe combat and action elements of ''Nier'' were inspired by the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series of games, which both Taro and Saito enjoyed. While the games had not been as popular in Japan as in North America, the two felt that the idea of having boss fights with different combat styles than the regular battles was an idea that would appeal to players in both regions. The changing styles, as well as the occasional changes in camera angle and movement, were meant to \"accentuate [the] gap between real, modern scenery and the fantasy world\" as a tie-in to the game's story. The game was meant to appeal to older players; it was intended as an action-RPG for an older market than Square Enix's action-RPG series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. This influenced the decision to have a main character in his 30s, as well as more blood and swearing than typical in a Square Enix RPG.<ref name=\"VGint\"/> The fusion of different gameplay styles was included as a homage to earlier gameplay styles and genres.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/>\n\n''Nier'' was originally intended to be exclusive to the Xbox 360, but after deciding to also develop the game for PlayStation 3, the developers decided to further divide the Japanese release of the game. ''Nier Gestalt'' would be released for the Xbox 360, featuring the adult Nier (as in the international release for both platforms), while ''Nier Replicant'', for the PlayStation 3, would feature the young Nier.<ref name=\"IGint\"/> The localizations for the game\u2014in English, French, and German\u2014were produced during development so that all of the versions could be released at the same time, and so that Cavia and Square Enix could solicit feedback from North America and Europe on the game so that it would appeal to players outside Japan.<ref name=\"IGint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> ''Nier'' was officially unveiled in June 2009 at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] for both the PlayStation 3 and [[Xbox 360]],<ref name=\"IGNannounce\"/> to be developed by Cavia and published by Square Enix.<ref name=\"ESCAPISTannounce\"/> Due to its high violence, the game was given a CERO D rating in Japan.<ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/>\n\nA high-definition remaster titled ''NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...'' is in production for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The remaster, developed by Toylogic, is using the ''Replicant'' release as its base. It will feature new Japanese voicework, and both new and rearranged music from the original composer. It was announced in March 2020 as part of the 10th anniversary celebrations for the series, and is slated for release worldwide.<ref name=\"NierRemaster\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Nier}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' was composed by a collaboration of the studio MoNACA, directed by Keiichi Okabe and including Kakeru Ishihama and Keigo Hoashi, and Takafumi Nishimura from [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]. Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole. Okabe was brought onto the project when the concept for the game was first being devised, and worked intermittently on the soundtrack for the next three years until its release. The music for the game was generally composed entirely separately from the development of the game. The music was designed for different motifs to appear in various arrangements throughout the soundtrack, and also to convey a sense of sadness even during the \"thrilling\" tracks. Okabe was allowed a great deal of freedom regarding what the music was to sound like; game director Yoko Taro's main request was that he use a lot of vocal works.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' is largely composed of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as ''[[Etrian Odyssey]]''. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried to imagine what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nSquare Enix released a soundtrack album of music from the game, titled ''Nier Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack'', on April 21, 2010.<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> The soundtrack album reached number 24 on the Japanese Oricon music charts, and remained on the charts for 11 weeks.<ref name=\"ORIost\"/> As preorder bonuses for ''Nier Gestalt'' and ''Nier Replicant'', two mini-albums, ''Nier Gestalt Mini Album'' and ''Nier Replicant Mini Album'', were included.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> An album of arranged music, ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant 15 Nightmares & Arrange Tracks'', was published by Square Enix on December 8, 2010.<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> The arranged album reached number 59 on the Oricon music charts, a position it held for a week.<ref name=\"ORIarrange\"/> Another album, ''NieR Tribute Album -echo-'', was released on September 14, 2011,<ref name=\"SEecho\"/> and an album of piano arrangements, ''Piano Collections Nier Gestalt & Replicant'', was published on March 21, 2012.<ref name=\"OSVpiano\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PS3: 68 / 100<ref name=\"MCPS3\"/><br />X360: 67 / 100<ref name=\"MC360\"/>\n| 1UP = C-<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/>\n| EuroG = 6 / 10<ref name=\"EGreview\"/>\n| Fam = 34 / 40<ref name=\"FAMreview\"/>\n| GSpot = 5 / 10<ref name=\"GSreview\"/>\n| IGN = 7 / 10<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n| RPG = 4.5 / 5<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/>\n| rev1 = [[IGN|IGN Australia]]\n| rev1Score = 7.3 / 10<ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/>\n}}\n\nIn Japan, ''Nier Gestalt'' sold over 12,500 copies in Japan the week of its release,<ref name=\"FAMsales1\"/> while ''Replicant'' sold over 60,000 and was the top-selling video game in Japan that week.<ref name=\"GAMArepsales\"/> ''Replicant'' sold over 121,000 copies in Japan by the end of May 2010, and ended the year with over 134,000 copies sold.<ref name=\"FAMsales2\"/><ref name=\"TMB2010\"/> In 2019, Yoko estimated that ''Nier'' had sold around 500,000 copies worldwide. According to Yoko, \"we weren't really in the red, but it wasn't exactly a success either\".<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/>\n\n''Nier'' received mixed reviews. Reviewers criticized the graphics, with Ryan Clements of IGN saying that \"one of Nier's greatest flaws is its visuals,\" while [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd bemoaned the \"flavorless visuals\" and \"lifeless environments\".<ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> Dustin Quillen of [[1UP.com]] said that the game \"looks downright primitive\", while Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer, who awarded the game a higher score than most, said that \"the environments are bland and poorly rendered\".<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> The music and voice acting, however, were praised; Clements said that \"both are quite excellent\", den Ouden called the soundtrack \"absolutely fantastic\", Chris Schilling of [[Eurogamer]] said that the music was full of \"memorable themes\", and one of the four reviewers for the Japanese ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' termed it \"a cut above\".<ref name=\"EGreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"FAMreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nReviewers were divided in their opinion on the effectiveness of the multiple styles of gameplay presented. Seth Schiesel of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that while \"there are plenty of games that surpass it in each area,\" that ''Nier'' pulled all of the styles together into a \"coherent, compelling whole\" instead of feeling \"disjointed\"; he especially praised a section of the game that is presented entirely through text.<ref name=\"NYTreview\"/> Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia, however, said that while the different styles were \"interesting\" and one of the game's biggest strengths, they suffered from poor execution and cohesion and left the game \"with split-personality disorder\".<ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/> Clements said that \"the developers' ideas sometimes outshine the actual implementation\", while highlighting the gameplay elements as part of what made the game fun.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> Adriaan den Ouden called out the variety as the best part of the game, likening it to a buffet table, while also acknowledging that none of the sections were \"amazing\" on their own and could easily be looked upon poorly.<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/>\n\nThe regular combat was reviewed as solid, if not exceptional, and the sidequests were seen as repetitive, with Quillen saying that \"the side quests in ''Nier'' are about as numerous as they are totally mindless,\" VanOrd calling them \"a series of monotonous events, often connected only by long stretches of nothing,\" and a ''Famitsu'' reviewer saying that they \"didn't see much purpose\" to them.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"FAMreview\"/> Clements said that the combat had \"a fair amount of satisfaction\", though players should \"not expect anything too extraordinary\", and Kolan termed the combat as \"moderately deep\".<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/> Critics gave a generally positive review to the plot and characters; VanOrd liked most of the characters but thought Nier was bland and the story \"soggy\", while Schiesel called the story \"provocative\" and \"profound\", saying that it \"succeeds at fostering an emotional investment in its characters and in its world\".<ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"NYTreview\"/> Quillen said that the plot \"takes some fascinating and truly original turns\" and that ''Nier'' has \"a supporting cast of genuinely interesting folks,\" and Schilling said that the story made the game \"difficult to dislike\".<ref name=\"EGreview\"/><ref name=\"1UPreview\"/> The ''Famitsu'' reviewer that viewed the game the most favorably said that he was \"blown away\" by the multiple endings, and that \"nothing like it's been done in gaming\".<ref name=\"FAMreview\"/>\n\nIn 2015, Jeffrey Matulef of Eurogamer characterized ''Nier'' as \"the rare game that gets better with age\". Despite \"poor sales and tepid reviews\", he wrote, the game had acquired a cult following, which he attributed to its \"sense of wonder\" due to its cryptic storytelling, mashup assortment of game mechanics and melancholy mood.<ref name=\"EGlegacy\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nOn May 11, 2010, Square Enix released a piece of [[downloadable content]] for the game, titled \"The World of Recycled Vessel\". The small expansion features a series of fifteen battles with the incarnation of Nier other than the one in the specific version of the game. Nier enters the battles in a dream world accessed through a diary in his house. The expansion offers new costumes and weapons for the game.<ref name=\"GRdlc\"/> Square Enix executive producer Yosuke Saito later commented that \"a number of things\" related to ''Nier'' were in progress, and that an announcement could be due in 2011.<ref name=\"4Gsequel\"/> The only announcement ended up not being for a new ''Nier'' video game, but instead for a live evening concert for Nier's music titled \"Nier Night ~ Evening of Madness\" which took place on October 28, 2011.<ref name=\"NierConcert\"/>\n\n''Nier'' was the last game that Cavia made; the company was absorbed into its parent company, [[AQ Interactive]], in July 2010.<ref name=\"1UPcavia\"/> In March 2011, there were plans made between Yoko and Takuya Iwasaki, one of the original producers for ''[[Drakengard (video game)|Drakengard]]'', to develop a port of ''Nier'' for the [[PlayStation Vita]] at Iwasaki's company Orca. The port would have incorporated material from both versions of the game. When Orca was chosen to help develop ''[[Dragon Quest X]]'', the project was shelved.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> A number of key staff from ''Nier''{{'}}s development, including director Yoko and Okabe, would later reunite to work on a new entry (''[[Drakengard 3]]'') in the ''Drakengard'' series from which ''Nier'' was spun off.<ref name=\"DR3unveiled\"/>\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', developed by Square Enix and [[PlatinumGames]] for the [[PlayStation 4]], was released in Japan on February 23, in North America on March 7 and worldwide on March 10, 2017. The PC version of ''Nier: Automata'' was released on March 17, 2017. Yoko, Saito and Okabe returned to their previous roles.

by [[Square Enix]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. In Japan, the game was released as {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Gestalt'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30b2\u30b7\u30e5\u30bf\u30eb\u30c8|N\u012ba Geshutaruto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} for the Xbox 360, while an alternate version entitled {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Replicant'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8|N\u012ba Repurikanto|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} was released exclusively in Japan for PlayStation 3 with a younger main character. A high-definition remaster of ''Replicant'', titled {{nihongo foot|'''''Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139...'''''|\u30cb\u30fc\u30a2 \u30ec\u30d7\u30ea\u30ab\u30f3\u30c8ver.1.22474487139...|N\u012ba Repurikanto ver.1.22474487139...|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}, is in development for a worldwide release on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]].\n\nThe game is a spin-off from the [[Drakengard|''Drakengard'' series]], and follows the fifth ending of the [[Drakengard (video game)|first game]], the events of which have left the planet Earth in a state of decay. Set over one thousand years after this, the game puts the player in control of the titular [[protagonist]] Nier, as he attempts to find a cure for an illness, known as the Black Scrawl, to which his daughter Yonah has succumbed. Partnering with a talking book known as Grimoire Weiss, he journeys with two other characters, Kain\u00e9 and Emil, as he attempts to find a remedy and understand the nature of the creatures known as Shades that stalk the world. The gameplay borrows elements from various [[video game genres]], occasionally switching between them and the main [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]]-based gameplay.\n\nThe game was developed to appeal both to older players and to players outside Japan, where the developer was based. The music was composed by [[Keiichi Okabe]], head of Monaca, a music composition studio, and has sparked the release of several albums. ''Nier'' was released to mixed reception; reviewers praised the story, characters and soundtrack and were mixed in their opinions of how well the disparate gameplay elements were connected.  The execution of some gameplay elements was criticized, notably the side quests, and especially the graphics (which were regarded as substandard). Despite this, the game acquired acclaim among players over time, becoming a cult classic. A more successful sequel developed by [[PlatinumGames]], titled ''[[Nier: Automata]],'' was released in 2017.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Nier Screenshot.jpg|left|thumb|300px|A screenshot from the game, showing Nier in combat with a boss monster.

The three-dimensional world is divided into areas separated by loading screens, and the player can move freely throughout these areas by walking, running, jumping, and climbing ladders.<ref name=\"GSreview\"/> In some rooms and buildings, the camera swings to the side and Nier is restricted to moving as in a two-dimensional platforming environment, while during certain battles the camera pulls up to simulate a top-down [[shoot 'em up]] or other video game genres.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/>\n\nWhile traveling the player is frequently attacked by monsters, which include shadowy figures called Shades, large animals, and robots.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/> Defeating these enemies gives the player experience points that can increase Nier's power, and money that can be used to purchase items.<ref name=\"EGreview\"/> Nier can attack these creatures with either a one- or two-handed sword, or a spear. These weapons can be customized to have greater damage and abilities using materials that can be purchased, dropped from monsters, or scavenged around the world. Multiple different varieties of each weapon type can be acquired. The player can also use magic spells, which require enough energy from a constantly regenerating amount to cast. These spells include projectiles and large shadowy fists, among others; new spells are acquired in the first half of the game by completing specific battles.<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> In addition to the main plotline, ''Nier'' includes numerous side-quests, which give the player experience points and money, as well as fishing and farming segments.<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/>\n{{-}}\n\n==Plot==\nThe game opens with a prologue during the summer of 2049 in a snowstorm. In a modern, broken-down grocery store, Nier fends off attacks from ethereal monsters to protect his sick young daughter, Yonah. After defeating the monsters, he checks on Yonah, who has begun to cough badly.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Nier''': You alright, Yonah? / '''Yonah''': Sorry, Dad. ...I'm sorry.

The low-technology village is one of several, and is surrounded by more modern ruins such as the remnants of [[train tracks]] and [[industrial machinery]]. The areas between towns are filled with monsters known as Shades that attack travelers.\n\nAs Yonah's illness, the Black Scrawl, is [[Terminal illness|terminal]], Nier sets out to look for a cure. As he does, Nier finds a talking book, [[Grimoire]] Weiss, which suggests that the two team up to use Weiss' magic and to find a cure for Yonah's disease.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Grimoire Weiss''': Bah!

After defeating five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them.

They learn about Kain\u00e9's past, including that she is [[intersex]], which along with the death of her parents resulted in her ostracism as a child, and that she is partially possessed by a Shade. The player gains the ability to understand what the shades are saying, including the one possessing Kain\u00e9, though in-game Nier, Weiss, and Emil are still unable to. Additional cutscenes are also shown, giving the motivations and backstory behind the Shade bosses that are fought and showing them as sentient people trying to defend their friends against Nier. The ending to the [[New Game Plus|second playthrough]] shows that Emil survives his sacrifice, and that Gestalt Nier and Yonah are reunited in the [[afterlife]].<ref>{{cite video game|title=Nier|developer=[[Cavia]]|publisher=[[Square Enix]]|date=April 27, 2010|platform=[[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox 360]]|scene=|level=|quote='''Emil''': Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

The events of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'' take place after this ending.\n\n==Development==\nThe concept that would become ''Nier'' was first proposed following the release of ''[[Drakengard 2]]'' and the reveal of [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] consoles. The original concept was for a third entry in the [[Drakengard (series)|''Drakengard'' series]]. It was intended to be for the [[PlayStation 3]] due to the lessening importance of the [[PlayStation 2]], which ''Drakengard 2'' had been made for. However, as the project evolved, the original ideas were reworked and the game eventually became a spin-off from the main series. Despite this, the game's director [[Yoko Taro]] continues to think of it as the third ''Drakengard'' game.<ref name=\"NierOrigins\"/> Including concept planning, the total development time lasted three years, with two years spent actually developing the game. It was initially a small-scale project, but during planning it grew into a full-fledged role-playing game. Development was handled by [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]] with help from [[Square Enix]], who had previously provided development support for the ''Drakengard'' games.<ref name=\"GetInterview1\"/> Square Enix had minimal input on Yoko's vision for the game's atmosphere and story, allowing him high creative control.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/>\n\n''Nier'' is intended to be set over 1000 years after the events of ''[[Drakengard (video game)|Drakengard]]'''s fifth ending. In this scenario, the game's protagonists Caim and Angelus travel across a dimensional boundary to fight a monstrous beast. After winning the battle and killing the monster, they are shot down by a fighter jet and killed; their introduction of magic to the world leads to magical research that results in the Black Scrawl.<ref name=\"NierDOD\"/> According to Yoko, after the dark story of ''Drakengard'', Yoko focused on more positive themes of friendship and combined effort.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/> Much of the game was inspired by the [[September 11 attacks]] and the [[War on Terror]]. Yoko took from it the idea of a terrible event where both sides believed they were doing the right thing, and wanted to show the player multiple perspectives of the same events.<ref name=\"GDC911\"/> The term \"Replicant\" was borrowed by Yoko from the 1982 science fiction movie ''[[Blade Runner]]'', although Yoko did not cite a particular source for Nier's name, passing it off as a codename that persisted through development.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/><ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/>\n\nThe characters were designed by an artist under the moniker D.K.<ref name=\"GWInier\"/> Two character designs for the protagonist were created for ''Nier''. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character.<ref name=\"IGint\"/> Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier being a father rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions;<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/> while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design,<ref name=\"WIREDint\"/> an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision.<ref name= \"NierAdult\"/> Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kain\u00e9 was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature.<ref name=\"NIERnovela\"/> Yonah's original Japanese name was derived from the Biblical name [[Jonah]]: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with a man, so the name was changed to \"Yonah\".<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/><ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/> Yoko was initially shocked at Kain\u00e9's design, but warmed to it and successfully had it kept.<ref name=\"GWInier\"/> Kain\u00e9's character was made [[intersex]], since the team felt it fit in with many other aspects of her gritty backstory. Kain\u00e9's status as intersex caused some commotion in western territories, which is something the team did not actively intend.<ref name=\"SilNierInterview\"/> Yoko attributed the original suggestion to female staff members working on the game.<ref name=\"GetInterview1\"/>\n\nThe combat and action elements of ''Nier'' were inspired by the ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'' series of games, which both Taro and Saito enjoyed. While the games had not been as popular in Japan as in North America, the two felt that the idea of having boss fights with different combat styles than the regular battles was an idea that would appeal to players in both regions. The changing styles, as well as the occasional changes in camera angle and movement, were meant to \"accentuate [the] gap between real, modern scenery and the fantasy world\" as a tie-in to the game's story. The game was meant to appeal to older players; it was intended as an action-RPG for an older market than Square Enix's action-RPG series ''[[Kingdom Hearts]]''. This influenced the decision to have a main character in his 30s, as well as more blood and swearing than typical in a Square Enix RPG.<ref name=\"VGint\"/> The fusion of different gameplay styles was included as a homage to earlier gameplay styles and genres.<ref name=\"NierINSIDE\"/>\n\n''Nier'' was originally intended to be exclusive to the Xbox 360, but after deciding to also develop the game for PlayStation 3, the developers decided to further divide the Japanese release of the game. ''Nier Gestalt'' would be released for the Xbox 360, featuring the adult Nier (as in the international release for both platforms), while ''Nier Replicant'', for the PlayStation 3, would feature the young Nier.<ref name=\"IGint\"/> The localizations for the game\u2014in English, French, and German\u2014were produced during development so that all of the versions could be released at the same time, and so that Cavia and Square Enix could solicit feedback from North America and Europe on the game so that it would appeal to players outside Japan.<ref name=\"IGint\"/><ref name=\"GSint\"/> ''Nier'' was officially unveiled in June 2009 at the [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2009]] for both the PlayStation 3 and [[Xbox 360]],<ref name=\"IGNannounce\"/> to be developed by Cavia and published by Square Enix.<ref name=\"ESCAPISTannounce\"/> Due to its high violence, the game was given a CERO D rating in Japan.<ref name=\"GetInterview2\"/>\n\nA high-definition remaster titled ''NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139...'' is in production for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]], and [[Xbox One]]. The remaster, developed by ToyLogic, is using the ''Replicant'' release as its base. It will feature new Japanese voicework, and both new and rearranged music from the original composer. It was announced in March 2020 as part of the 10th anniversary celebrations for the series, and is slated for release worldwide.<ref name=\"NierRemaster\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Music of Nier}}\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' was composed by a collaboration of the studio MoNACA, directed by Keiichi Okabe and including Kakeru Ishihama and Keigo Hoashi, and Takafumi Nishimura from [[Cavia (company)|Cavia]]. Okabe served as the lead composer and as the director for the project as a whole. Okabe was brought onto the project when the concept for the game was first being devised, and worked intermittently on the soundtrack for the next three years until its release. The music for the game was generally composed entirely separately from the development of the game. The music was designed for different motifs to appear in various arrangements throughout the soundtrack, and also to convey a sense of sadness even during the \"thrilling\" tracks. Okabe was allowed a great deal of freedom regarding what the music was to sound like; game director Yoko Taro's main request was that he use a lot of vocal works.<ref name=\"OKABEint\"/>\n\nThe soundtrack to ''Nier'' is largely composed of melancholy acoustic pieces which heavily feature vocals by vocalist Emi Evans (Emiko Rebecca Evans), a singer from England living in Tokyo. She is the singer for the band freesscape, and had previously worked on video games such as ''[[Etrian Odyssey]]''. In addition to singing, Evans was asked to write her own lyrics in futuristic languages. The composers gave her preliminary version of songs and the style they wished the language to be in, such as Gaelic or French, and she invented the words. Evans wrote songs in versions of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], Portuguese, Spanish, Italian, French, English and Japanese, where she tried to imagine what they would sound like after 1000 years of drifting.<ref name=\"OSVint\"/>\n\nSquare Enix released a soundtrack album of music from the game, titled ''Nier Gestalt & Replicant Original Soundtrack'', on April 21, 2010.<ref name=\"RPGFost\"/> The soundtrack album reached number 24 on the Japanese Oricon music charts, and remained on the charts for 11 weeks.<ref name=\"ORIost\"/> As preorder bonuses for ''Nier Gestalt'' and ''Nier Replicant'', two mini-albums, ''Nier Gestalt Mini Album'' and ''Nier Replicant Mini Album'', were included.<ref name=\"SEMOges\"/><ref name=\"SEMOrep\"/> An album of arranged music, ''NieR Gestalt & Replicant 15 Nightmares & Arrange Tracks'', was published by Square Enix on December 8, 2010.<ref name=\"RPGFarrange\"/> The arranged album reached number 59 on the Oricon music charts, a position it held for a week.<ref name=\"ORIarrange\"/> Another album, ''NieR Tribute Album -echo-'', was released on September 14, 2011,<ref name=\"SEecho\"/> and an album of piano arrangements, ''Piano Collections Nier Gestalt & Replicant'', was published on March 21, 2012.<ref name=\"OSVpiano\"/>\n\n==Reception==\n{{Video game reviews\n| MC = PS3: 68 / 100<ref name=\"MCPS3\"/><br />X360: 67 / 100<ref name=\"MC360\"/>\n| 1UP = C-<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/>\n| EuroG = 6 / 10<ref name=\"EGreview\"/>\n| Fam = 34 / 40<ref name=\"FAMreview\"/>\n| GSpot = 5 / 10<ref name=\"GSreview\"/>\n| IGN = 7 / 10<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n| RPG = 4.5 / 5<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/>\n| rev1 = [[IGN|IGN Australia]]\n| rev1Score = 7.3 / 10<ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/>\n}}\n\nIn Japan, ''Nier Gestalt'' sold over 12,500 copies in Japan the week of its release,<ref name=\"FAMsales1\"/> while ''Replicant'' sold over 60,000 and was the top-selling video game in Japan that week.<ref name=\"GAMArepsales\"/> ''Replicant'' sold over 121,000 copies in Japan by the end of May 2010, and ended the year with over 134,000 copies sold.<ref name=\"FAMsales2\"/><ref name=\"TMB2010\"/> In 2019, Yoko estimated that ''Nier'' had sold around 500,000 copies worldwide. According to Yoko, \"we weren't really in the red, but it wasn't exactly a success either\".<ref name=\"GIinterview\"/>\n\n''Nier'' received mixed reviews. Reviewers criticized the graphics, with Ryan Clements of IGN saying that \"one of Nier's greatest flaws is its visuals,\" while [[GameSpot]]'s Kevin VanOrd bemoaned the \"flavorless visuals\" and \"lifeless environments\".<ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> Dustin Quillen of [[1UP.com]] said that the game \"looks downright primitive\", while Adriaan den Ouden of RPGamer, who awarded the game a higher score than most, said that \"the environments are bland and poorly rendered\".<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/> The music and voice acting, however, were praised; Clements said that \"both are quite excellent\", den Ouden called the soundtrack \"absolutely fantastic\", Chris Schilling of [[Eurogamer]] said that the music was full of \"memorable themes\", and one of the four reviewers for the Japanese ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' termed it \"a cut above\".<ref name=\"EGreview\"/><ref name=\"RPGreview\"/><ref name=\"FAMreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNreview\"/>\n\nReviewers were divided in their opinion on the effectiveness of the multiple styles of gameplay presented. Seth Schiesel of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that while \"there are plenty of games that surpass it in each area,\" that ''Nier'' pulled all of the styles together into a \"coherent, compelling whole\" instead of feeling \"disjointed\"; he especially praised a section of the game that is presented entirely through text.<ref name=\"NYTreview\"/> Patrick Kolan of IGN Australia, however, said that while the different styles were \"interesting\" and one of the game's biggest strengths, they suffered from poor execution and cohesion and left the game \"with split-personality disorder\".<ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/> Clements said that \"the developers' ideas sometimes outshine the actual implementation\", while highlighting the gameplay elements as part of what made the game fun.<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/> Adriaan den Ouden called out the variety as the best part of the game, likening it to a buffet table, while also acknowledging that none of the sections were \"amazing\" on their own and could easily be looked upon poorly.<ref name=\"RPGreview\"/>\n\nThe regular combat was reviewed as solid, if not exceptional, and the sidequests were seen as repetitive, with Quillen saying that \"the side quests in ''Nier'' are about as numerous as they are totally mindless,\" VanOrd calling them \"a series of monotonous events, often connected only by long stretches of nothing,\" and a ''Famitsu'' reviewer saying that they \"didn't see much purpose\" to them.<ref name=\"1UPreview\"/><ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"FAMreview\"/> Clements said that the combat had \"a fair amount of satisfaction\", though players should \"not expect anything too extraordinary\", and Kolan termed the combat as \"moderately deep\".<ref name=\"IGNreview\"/><ref name=\"IGNAUreview\"/> Critics gave a generally positive review to the plot and characters; VanOrd liked most of the characters but thought Nier was bland and the story \"soggy\", while Schiesel called the story \"provocative\" and \"profound\", saying that it \"succeeds at fostering an emotional investment in its characters and in its world\".<ref name=\"GSreview\"/><ref name=\"NYTreview\"/> Quillen said that the plot \"takes some fascinating and truly original turns\" and that ''Nier'' has \"a supporting cast of genuinely interesting folks,\" and Schilling said that the story made the game \"difficult to dislike\".<ref name=\"EGreview\"/><ref name=\"1UPreview\"/> The ''Famitsu'' reviewer that viewed the game the most favorably said that he was \"blown away\" by the multiple endings, and that \"nothing like it's been done in gaming\".<ref name=\"FAMreview\"/>\n\nIn 2015, Jeffrey Matulef of Eurogamer characterized ''Nier'' as \"the rare game that gets better with age\". Despite \"poor sales and tepid reviews\", he wrote, the game had acquired a cult following, which he attributed to its \"sense of wonder\" due to its cryptic storytelling, mashup assortment of game mechanics and melancholy mood.<ref name=\"EGlegacy\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nOn May 11, 2010, Square Enix released a piece of [[downloadable content]] for the game, titled \"The World of Recycled Vessel\". The small expansion features a series of fifteen battles with the incarnation of Nier other than the one in the specific version of the game. Nier enters the battles in a dream world accessed through a diary in his house. The expansion offers new costumes and weapons for the game.<ref name=\"GRdlc\"/> Square Enix executive producer Yosuke Saito later commented that \"a number of things\" related to ''Nier'' were in progress, and that an announcement could be due in 2011.<ref name=\"4Gsequel\"/> The only announcement ended up not being for a new ''Nier'' video game, but instead for a live evening concert for Nier's music titled \"Nier Night ~ Evening of Madness\" which took place on October 28, 2011.<ref name=\"NierConcert\"/>\n\n''Nier'' was the last game that Cavia made; the company was absorbed into its parent company, [[AQ Interactive]], in July 2010.<ref name=\"1UPcavia\"/> In March 2011, there were plans made between Yoko and Takuya Iwasaki, one of the original producers for ''[[Drakengard (video game)|Drakengard]]'', to develop a port of ''Nier'' for the [[PlayStation Vita]] at Iwasaki's company Orca. The port would have incorporated material from both versions of the game. When Orca was chosen to help develop ''[[Dragon Quest X]]'', the project was shelved.<ref name= \"FamInterview\"/> A number of key staff from ''Nier''{{'}}s development, including director Yoko and Okabe, would later reunite to work on a new entry (''[[Drakengard 3]]'') in the ''Drakengard'' series from which ''Nier'' was spun off.<ref name=\"DR3unveiled\"/>\n\nA sequel titled ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', developed by Square Enix and [[PlatinumGames]] for the [[PlayStation 4]], was released in Japan on February 23, in North America on March 7 and worldwide on March 10, 2017. The PC version of ''Nier: Automata'' was released on March 17, 2017. Yoko, Saito and Okabe returned to their previous roles. Other staff members include producer [[Atsushi Inaba]] and artist [[Akihiko Yoshida]].<ref name=\"NiewNew\"/><ref name=\"Nier2Release\"/> A mobile game, ''Nier Re[in]carnation'', is in production from
