It is an [[Irritation|irritant]] for mammals, including humans, and produces a sensation of burning in any tissue with which it comes into contact. Capsaicin and several related compounds are called '''capsaicinoids''' and are produced as [[secondary metabolite]]s by chili peppers, probably as deterrents against certain mammals and fungi.<ref name=\"totn\">[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=93636630 What Made Chili Peppers So Spicy?] Talk of the Nation, 15 August 2008.</ref> Pure capsaicin is a [[hydrophobic]], colorless, highly [[pungent]],<ref name=PubChem/> crystalline to waxy solid compound.\n\n==Natural function==\nCapsaicin is present in large quantities in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes and, to a lesser extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in the genus ''[[Capsicum]]''.  The seeds themselves do not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin can be found in the white pith of the inner wall, where the seeds are attached.<ref>{{cite web|author=New Mexico State University \u2013 College of Agriculture and Home Economics |title=Chile Information \u2013 Frequently Asked Questions |year=2005 |url=http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub |accessdate=17 May 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504035555/http://spectre.nmsu.edu/dept/academic.html?i=1274&s=sub <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 4 May 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of ''Capsicum'' plants are dispersed predominantly by birds: in birds, the [[TRPV1]] channel does not respond to capsaicin or related chemicals (avian vs. mammalian TRPV1 show functional diversity and selective sensitivity).  This is advantageous to the plant, as chili pepper seeds consumed by birds pass through the digestive tract and can germinate later, whereas mammals have [[molar (tooth)|molar teeth]] which destroy such seeds and prevent them from germinating.<!-- Tewksbury & Nabhan 2001, Nature 412 -->  Thus, natural selection may have led to increasing capsaicin production because it makes the plant less likely to be eaten by animals that do not help it disperse.<ref>{{Cite journal | last1 = Tewksbury | first1 = J.

The resulting [[depolarization]] of the neuron stimulates it to [[action potential|signal]] the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.\n\nEarly research showed capsaicin to evoke a long-onset current in comparison to other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor.<ref>Geppetti, Pierangelo & Holzer, Peter (1996). Neurogenic Inflammation. CRC Press, 1996.</ref> Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel has been shown to be a member of the superfamily of [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] [[ion channels]], and as such is now referred to as {{Gene|TRPV1}}. There are a number of different [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a [[chemical burn]], or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure.  The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of [[C fibers]]<ref>Fuller, R. W., Dixon, C. M. S. & Barnes, P. J. (1985). Bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled capsaicin in humans\" ''J. Appl. Physiol'' 58, 1080\u20131084. PubMed, CAS, Web of Science\u00ae Times Cited: 174</ref>  culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.\n\n==History==\nThe compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by {{ill|Christian Friedrich Bucholz|de}} (1770\u20131818).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=C.

The resulting [[depolarization]] of the neuron stimulates it to [[action potential|signal]] the brain. By binding to the TRPV1 receptor, the capsaicin molecule produces similar sensations to those of excessive heat or abrasive damage, explaining why the spiciness of capsaicin is described as a burning sensation.\n\nEarly research showed capsaicin to evoke a long-onset current in comparison to other chemical agonists, suggesting the involvement of a significant rate-limiting factor.<ref>Geppetti, Pierangelo & Holzer, Peter (1996). Neurogenic Inflammation. CRC Press, 1996.</ref> Subsequent to this, the TRPV1 ion channel has been shown to be a member of the superfamily of [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] [[ion channels]], and as such is now referred to as {{Gene|TRPV1}}. There are a number of different [[transient receptor potential|TRP]] ion channels that have been shown to be sensitive to different ranges of temperature and probably are responsible for our range of temperature sensation. Thus, capsaicin does not actually cause a [[chemical burn]], or indeed any direct tissue damage at all, when chili peppers are the source of exposure.  The inflammation resulting from exposure to capsaicin is believed to be the result of the body's reaction to nerve excitement. For example, the mode of action of capsaicin in inducing bronchoconstriction is thought to involve stimulation of [[C fibers]]<ref>Fuller, R. W., Dixon, C. M. S. & Barnes, P. J. (1985). Bronchoconstrictor response to inhaled capsaicin in humans\" ''J. Appl. Physiol'' 58, 1080\u20131084. PubMed, CAS, Web of Science\u00ae Times Cited: 174</ref>  culminating in the release of neuropeptides. In essence, the body inflames tissues as if it has undergone a burn or abrasion and the resulting inflammation can cause tissue damage in cases of extreme exposure, as is the case for many substances that cause the body to trigger an inflammatory response.\n\n==History==\nThe compound was first extracted in impure form in 1816 by {{ill|Christian Friedrich Bucholz|de}} (1770\u20131818).<ref>\n{{cite book|first=C.

From the ''Chicago Tribune'' on December 26, 1967, the article stated that a doctor had to beg a woman to have a home birth due to overcrowding at the hospital, \"Please stay at home, we have no rooms\". The column also stated how \"pregnant women were having to share hospitals beds and sickly babies were being put into oxygen tents in groups\". The baby boom in Romania caused problems that began affecting the health of its residents. Abortion before being banned in 1966 was the only form of birth control, leaving people without access to that form of family planning. Another set of policies from Romania's Leader at the time, [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu|Nicolae Ceausescu]], contributed to the baby boom based upon [[ethno-nationalism]]. To encourage people to have more children from dominant ethnic groups, the Romanian Government created financial incentives to have children, specifically a tax for anyone over 25 without a child. This motivated a lot of people to have children at a younger age, and with ethnic Romanian partners. Which lead to an initial surge of babies being born but then began to decrease in the birth rate to 14.3 births per 1000 individuals by the 80's. In an effort to ramp up birth rates Ceausescu made new policies. Changing the legal age to marry to 15, social media campaigns and mandating monthly gynecological exams to all women of children bearing age. This caused a near 5x increase in spending for incentives, yet managed to decrease the birth rate by 40%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Leslie|date=2002|title=Demographic trends, pronatalism, and nationalist ideologies in the late twentieth century|doi=10.1080/01419870020036701d|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=25:3|issue=3|pages=367\u2013389|via=}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe term \"baby boom\" most often refers to the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom]] (1941\u20131964) when the number of annual births exceeded 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouvier|first=L.

These countries include Germany and Poland. In the United States the baby boom was attributed to the number of veterans returning home after the war ended in 1945. It also was due to the strong post-war American economy. The U.S. Congress passed the G.I. Bill of Rights to encourage home ownership and higher levels of education by charging very low or no interest at all on loans for veterans. Getting settled in with a more comfortable economic position allowed families to have a place to live, be educated, and start having babies. \"Now thriving on the American Dream, life was simple, jobs were plentiful, and a record number of babies were born.\"\n\nThe U.S. birthrate exploded after World War II. From 1941 to 1961, more than 65 million children were born in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.countriesquest.com/north_america/usa/people/growth_of_u_s_population/growth_through_natural_increase_births/birthrates_since_world_war_ii/baby_boom.htm|title=Baby Boom \u2013 Birthrates Since World War II \u2013 Growth through Natural Increase: Births \u2013 Growth of U.S. Population \u2013 People \u2013 USA \u2013 North America: tubal ligation, adult baby, birth control, security system, million baby|website=www.countriesquest.com|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref> At the height of this baby boom, a child was born every seven seconds on average. Factors that contributed to the baby boom consisted of young couples who started families after putting off marriage during the War, government encouragement of growth of families through the aid of GI benefits, and popular culture that celebrated pregnancy, parenthood, and large families.\n\nThe baby boom was the result of couples holding off on having children due to the Great Depression and World War II. Once the baby boom began, the average woman started getting married around the age of 20 instead of 22. Couples were eager to have babies after the war ended because they knew that the world would be a safer place to start a family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-us-history/period-8/apush-postwar-era/a/the-baby-boom|title=The baby boom|website=Khan Academy|language=en|access-date=2017-06-14}}</ref>\n\nAnother leading cause that led to the baby boom was that people were able to afford moving out to the suburbs to raise a family instead of living in the city. Additionally, the cost of living in the suburbs was very low, especially for those returning from the military. This was also the time period where women were encouraged to take on their \"[[Nuclear family|roles]]\", meaning that they were encouraged to stay home as a [[housewife]] along with being a mother while the husband worked.\n\nThe market became a seller's market. Many families were adapting to popular culture changes that included purchasing TVs, opening credit card accounts, and buying mouse ears to wear while watching ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Once economists realized how many children were being born, concern arose about enough resources being available, especially when those born in the baby boom time period started having kids of their own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.com/topics/baby-boomers|title=Baby Boomers - Facts & Summary|website=HISTORY.com|access-date=2017-03-21}}</ref>\n\nThe issues of the baby boom time period are that it could hugely impact the population change and cause social and economic impacts. One economic impact of the baby boom is the concern that when baby boomers get older and retire, the [[dependency ratio]] will increase. The Census Bureau estimates that the dependency ratio in the United States will be 65 by 2020 and reach a record-breaking high of 75, the highest it has been since the 1960s and 1970s when those baby boomers were children.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-baby-boomers-retirement-means-for-the-u-s-economy/ |title=What Baby Boomers' Retirement Means For the U.S. Economy |date=7 May 2014 |publisher=FiveThirtyEight |last=Casselman |first=Ben}}</ref> The economics of an area or country could benefit from the baby boom: It could increase the demand of housing, transportation, facilities and more for the increasing population. With an increase in population, the demand for food also increased. If a country cannot keep up with a rapidly increasing population, it could cause a food shortage and insufficient health care facilities. Without the sufficient supplies needed for the population, it could cause poor health that could lead to deaths in the population.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps125026/ERR79.pdf|title=Baby Boom Migration and Its Impact on Rural America|last=Cromartie|first=John|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==Africa==\n\"According to the new UNICEF report, almost 2 billion babies will be born in Africa between 2015 and 2050 and the 2 main driving forces behind this surge in births and children are continued high fertility rates and rising numbers of women able to have children of their own.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/uploads/Africa_Baby_Boom.htm|title=Africa's Baby boom|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[HIV/AIDS]] crisis in [[Africa]] has contributed locally to a population boom.

From the ''Chicago Tribune'' on December 26, 1967, the article stated that a doctor had to beg a woman to have a home birth due to overcrowding at the hospital, \"Please stay at home, we have no rooms\". The column also stated how \"pregnant women were having to share hospitals beds and sickly babies were being put into oxygen tents in groups\". The baby boom in Romania caused problems that began affecting the health of its residents. Abortion before being banned in 1966 was the only form of birth control, leaving people without access to that form of family planning. Another set of policies from Romania's Leader at the time, [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu|Nicolae Ceausescu]], contributed to the baby boom based upon [[ethno-nationalism]]. To encourage people to have more children from dominant ethnic groups, the Romanian Government created financial incentives to have children, specifically a tax for anyone over 25 without a child. This motivated a lot of people to have children at a younger age, and with ethnic Romanian partners. Which lead to an initial surge of babies being born but then began to decrease in the birth rate to 14.3 births per 1000 individuals by the 80's. In an effort to ramp up birth rates Ceausescu made new policies. Changing the legal age to marry to 15, social media campaigns and mandating monthly gynecological exams to all women of children bearing age. This caused a near 5x increase in spending for incentives, yet managed to decrease the birth rate by 40%.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=King|first=Leslie|date=2002|title=Demographic trends, pronatalism, and nationalist ideologies in the late twentieth century|doi=10.1080/01419870020036701d|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|volume=25:3|issue=3|pages=367\u2013389|via=}}</ref>\n\n==United States==\nThe term \"baby boom\" most often refers to the [[post\u2013World War II baby boom]] (1941\u20131964) when the number of annual births exceeded 2 per 100 women (or approximately 1% of the total population size).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bouvier|first=L.

{"title_page": "When the Saints Go Marching In", "text_new": "\"'''When the Saints Go Marching In''',\" often referred to as simply \"'''The Saints''',\" is a [[black spiritual]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}} Though it originated as a Christian [[hymn]], it is often played by [[jazz]] bands. This song was famously recorded on May 13, 1938, by [[Louis Armstrong]] and his orchestra.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.on-this-day.com/onthisday/thedays/music/may13.htm|title=Music History for May 13 from On-This-Day.com|publisher=}}</ref> \n\nThe song is sometimes confused with a similarly titled composition \"When the Saints Are Marching In\" from 1896 by [[Katharine Purvis]] (lyrics) and [[James Milton Black]] (music).<ref name=\"hymntime.com\">CyberHymnal: http://hymntime.com/tch/htm/w/s/a/wsamarch.htm</ref>\n\n==Origins and usage==\n[[Image:All-Saints.jpg|thumb|350px|right|The Forerunners of Christ with Saints and Martyrs, a painting by [[Fra Angelico]], 15th century]]\n\nThe origins of this song are unclear.<ref name=\"hymntime.com\"/> It apparently evolved in the early 1900s from a number of similarly titled gospel songs, including \"When the Saints Are Marching In\" (1896) and \"When the Saints March In for Crowning\" (1908).<ref>James J. Fuld, ''The Book of World-Famous Music, Classical, Popular and Folk'', Fourth Edition, 1995.</ref> The first known recorded version was in [[1923]] by the Paramount Jubilee Singers on [[Paramount Records|Paramount]] 12073. Although the title given on the label is \"When All the Saints Come Marching In\", the group sings the modern lyrics beginning with \"When the saints go marching in\". No author is shown on the label.

Presley & Virgil O. Stamps, ''Starlit Crown'' (Pangburn, AR: Stamps-Baxter Music Company, 1937).</ref> [[R. E. Winsett]].<ref>Ruth Winsett Shelton, editor. ''Best Loved Songs and Hymns'' (Dayton, TN: R. E. Winsett Music Company, 1961), Item 158.</ref> The tune is particularly associated with the city of New Orleans. A [[jazz standard]], it has been recorded by many jazz and pop artists.\n\n==Lyrics==\nAs with many numbers with long traditional folk use, there is no one \"official\" version of the song or its lyrics. This extends so far as confusion as to its name, with it often being mistakenly called \"When the Saints Come Marching In.\" As for the lyrics themselves, their very simplicity makes it easy to generate new verses. Since the first and second lines of a verse are exactly the same, and the third and fourth are standard throughout, the creation of one suitable line in [[iambic tetrameter]] generates an entire verse.\n\nIt is impossible to list every version of the song, but a common standard version runs:\n\n\n\n\nWHEN THE SAINTS GO MARCHING IN\n\nOh when the saints go marching in,\nOh when the saints go marching in,\nOh Lord I want to be in that number,\nWhen the saints go marching in.\n\nOh when the drums begin to bang,\nOh when the drums begin to bang,\nOh Lord I want to be in that number,\nWhen the saints go marching in.\n\nOh when the stars fall from the sky,\nOh when the stars fall from the sky,\nOh Lord I want to be in that number,\nWhen the saints go marching in.\n\nOh when the Powers you are my friend,\nOh brother Powers you are my friend,\nYea you gonna be in that number,\nWhen the saints go marching in.\n\nOh when the saints go marching in,\nOh when the saints go marching in,\nOh Lord I want to be in that number,\nWhen the saints go marching in.\n\n\n\nOften the first two words of the common third verse line (\"Lord, how I want...\") are sung as either \"Oh how,\" \"Oh, Lord\" or even \"Lord, Lord\" as [[cue notes]] to the simple melody at each third line.\n\nArrangements vary considerably. The simplest is just an endless repetition of the chorus. Verses may be alternated with choruses, or put in the third of four repetitions to create an AABA form with the verse as the bridge.\n\nSome traditional arrangements often have ensemble rather than individual vocals. It is also common as an audience sing-along number. Versions using [[call and response]] are often heard, e.g.:\n\n* '''Call:''' Oh when the Saints\n* '''Response:''' Oh when the Saints!\nThe response verses can echo the same melody or form a [[counterpoint]] melody, often [[syncopated]] opposite the rhythm of the main verses, and a solo singer might sing another counterpoint melody (solo [[soprano]] or [[tenor]]) as a 3rd part in more complex arrangements.\n\n==Analysis of the traditional lyrics==\nThe song is [[apocalypticism|apocalyptic]], taking much of its imagery from the [[Book of Revelation]], but excluding its more horrific depictions of the [[Last Judgment]]. The verses about the Sun and Moon refer to Solar and Lunar eclipses; the trumpet (of the [[Archangel Gabriel]]) is the way in which the Last Judgment is announced. As the hymn expresses the wish to go to Heaven, picturing the saints going in (through the [[Pearly gates|Pearly Gates]]), it is entirely appropriate for funerals.\n\n==Other versions==\n===As gospel hymn===\n* First recorded by the Paramount Jubilee Singers on Paramount 12073, mid-November 1923.

During his lifetime he was often referred to as Broke of the Shannon, a reference to his notable command of {{HMS|Shannon|1806|6}} in the [[War of 1812]]. His most famous military achievement was [[Capture of USS Chesapeake|defeating and capturing the American frigate, USS Chesapeake]].\n\n== Early life ==\nBroke was born at [[Broke Hall]], [[Nacton]], near [[Ipswich]], the eldest son of Philip Bowes Broke, grandson of [[Philip Broke (Ipswich MP)|Philip Broke]] and descendant of Sir [[Richard Broke]], who served as [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]]. He was educated at [[Ipswich School]], where a house was later named in his honour.\n\n==Naval career==\nBroke joined the [[Royal Naval Academy]] at [[Portsmouth Dockyard]] in 1788, and began active service as a midshipman in 1792.  It was rather unusual for him to receive formal naval education &mdash; most of his contemporaries had only \"on the job\" training.  He served as third lieutenant on the frigate {{HMS|Southampton|1757|6}} during the [[Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797)|battle of Cape St. Vincent]] in February 1797. He was promoted to commander in 1799 and captain on 14 February 1801.<ref>''The Navy List'', 1831</ref>\n\nOn 25 November 1802, Broke married Sarah Louisa Middleton, daughter of Sir [[William Fowle Middleton]] 1st Baronet of [[Crowfield, Suffolk]]. They had 11 children, including Philip Broke, 2nd Baronet, [[George Broke-Middleton]], and Charles Acton Broke.<ref>Walford Dakin Selby, ed., ''The Genealogist'', vol. 23 (1907), p. 143</ref>\n\n===Capture of USS ''Chesapeake''===\n{{main|Capture of USS Chesapeake}}\nHis most notable accomplishment was his victory while commanding {{HMS|Shannon|1806|6}}, over the {{USS|Chesapeake|1799|6}} on 1 June 1813, during the [[War of 1812]].  Broke took command of the ''Shannon'', a 38-gun frigate, on 31 August 1806. Broke was ordered to [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in 1811 as the diplomatic position between America and Britain deteriorated. The [[United States Congress]] declared war on 18 June 1812.\n\nThere were half a dozen naval battles between Royal Navy and [[United States Navy]] frigates in 1812 and the early months 1813. The Americans won every one of those six encounters, which came as a surprise to the Royal Navy. The British and American ships were of the same rate, yet they were not of the same size or power. In each case the American ships were larger than the British vessels, had larger crews and had a heavier broadside, and fought better. The Americans had a main battery of 24-pounder long guns compared with the smaller 18-pounders mounted on the British ships; the weight refers to the size of the cannonballs.<ref>Lambert, Andrew (2012) ''The Challenge: Britain Against America in the Naval War of 1812'', Faber and Faber. p. 1</ref>\n\nMatters changed when ''Shannon'' met ''Chesapeake'' off  [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. The captain of the Chesapeake responded to a challenge to a single ship action made by Broke. Although ''Chesapeake'' was a slightly larger craft and had a substantially larger crew, the armament of the two ships was evenly matched. However, gunnery was Broke's area of expertise, and the crew of ''Shannon'' were exceptionally well drilled for the era.\n\nAt the time the official rating of a ship did not accurately reflect the number of cannon mounted. Thus HMS ''Shannon'' (1065 tons burthen) was classed as a 38 gun ship but mounted 48 guns in total. USS ''Chesapeake'' (1135 tons burthen) was variously rated a 36 or 38 gun ship but mounted 49 guns in total. Broke mounted a number of very small carronades in order that ships' boys and younger midshipmen could have cannon light enough for them to practise on. The force of a ship was usually calculated as \"weight of metal.\" This was the aggregate of the weight of all the cannonballs capable of being fired in one broadside (i.e., when half of the cannon, all the guns on the same side, were fired). The British weight of metal was 547 pounds, the American weight of metal was 581 pounds. The two ships were very well matched with no preponderance of force on either side.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gardiner |first=R |year=2006 |title=Frigates of the Napoleonic Wars |publisher=Chatham Publishing |pages=25, 32 |isbn=1-86176-135-X}}</ref><ref>\n{{cite book |last=Padfield |first=P |year=1968 |title=Broke and the Shannon |page=140\n|location=London |publisher= Hodder and Stoughton}}</ref>\n\n''Chesapeake'' was disabled by gunfire, boarded and captured within 15 minutes of opening fire. Fifty-six sailors on ''Chesapeake'' were killed and eighty-five wounded including her captain [[James Lawrence]], who died of his wounds on 4 June. Lawrence's last command was reported to be, \"Don't give up the ship\".  On the ''Shannon'', 24 were killed and 59 wounded, including Broke who sustained a serious head wound while leading the boarding party. The head wound from a cutlass blow, which had exposed the brain, had been very severe accompanied by great blood loss. Therapeutic bleeding, routinely employed at the time, was not performed by ''Shannon''{{'}}s surgeon Mr Alexander Jack, which was to Broke's advantage.

LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) maintained close ties to [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.\n\nAfter the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedei\u0107. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] began to distance itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and started supporting and financing the Church, which received support from both the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]]; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned. By this time, LSCG had distanced itself from MOC almost completely.\n\nOn January 17, 2001, MOC was officially registered as a non-governmental organization at the local department of the Montenegrin Ministry of the Interior.<ref name=\"moc\">{{cite web|url = http://tmp.cpc.org.me/mne/saopstenja.php?id=1 |title = O registraciji crnogorske pravoslavne crkve |date = 22 March 2001 |publisher = MOC Official Website |language = Montenegrin |trans-title = About Montenegrin Orthodox Church Registration |accessdate = 7 July 2010}}</ref> In the absence of any other relevant and more current piece of legislation, this registration was done by calling on the ''Law on the Legal Position of Religious Communities'' from 1977 when Montenegro was a [[SR Montenegro|socialist republic]] within [[SFR Yugoslavia]].\n\nIn 2007, MOC attempted to expand its activities beyond the borders of Montenegro.

At a General Montenegrin People's Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, he was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in [[Sofia]], on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by [[Bulgarian Alternative Synod]]'s head Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and [[Episcop]]s of his [[synod]]. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in [[Cetinje]] on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church.\n\n[[Metropolitan Mihailo]] had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Italy]], where he uncanonically created a Serbian Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including [[adultery]] and accusations of [[embezzlement]], to his permanent suspension from the Church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully [[excommunicated]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. During his pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, current [[Pope Francis]].\n\nOn January 11, 2007, MOC restored its own [[Holy Synod]] and proclaimed its first decree in which it confirms its [[autocephalous]] status. The Holy Synod is constituted by archpriests of MOC, led by [[Metropolitan Mihailo]]. The Holy Synod divided Montenegro in five [[eparchies]] &ndash; Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostro\u0161ka and Beranska.\n\nOne of the prominent members of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was Jelisej Lalatovi\u0107, a former Serb monk from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], defrocked for stealing of church property and falsification of church seals. In early 2010 he joined with the Croatian Orthodox Union for the formation of the Croatian Orthodox Church and became its chief in [[Zadar]]. Lalatovi\u0107 was immediately expelled from the MOC on the grounds of spreading unrest and immorality in the church, the MOC officially dismissing its connections with the formation of the COC.<ref>Vesti Online, [http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Ex-YU/36667/Crnogorski-raspop-vraca-delo-Pavelica Crnogorski raspop vra\u0107a delo Paveli\u0107a], 14. 03. 2010.</ref><ref>Vesti Online, [http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Ex-YU/36940/Jelisej-iskljucen-iz-CPC-zbog-nemorala- Jelisej isklju\u010den iz CPC zbog nemorala], 15. 03. 2010.</ref>\n\n==Service==\n===In Montenegro===\nThe Montenegrin Orthodox Church currently holds its regular services in several Chapels in the area of Montenegro's royal capital, [[Cetinje]], as well as in its newly built Temple in Kotor.

LSCG, a party with a pro-independence agenda, is claimed to having used MOC as a tool in their quest for Montenegrin sovereignty. At that time, the ruling [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] (DPS) maintained close ties to [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]'s administration in Serbia, and therefore the initial activities of the MOC were very sporadic.\n\nAfter the death of Metropolitan Antonije, he was replaced by Metropolitan Dedei\u0107. Most liberals did not approve of this change, and their support for the church soon started to fade. By 1997, the DPS administration in Montenegro led by [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] began to distance itself from Milo\u0161evi\u0107, and started supporting and financing the Church, which received support from both the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Montenegro]]; however, after 2001 this support seemingly waned.

At a General Montenegrin People's Assembly formed by the MOC in Cetinje on January 6, 1997, he was chosen by traditional public acclamation the Head of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church. In the Church of St. Paraskeva in [[Sofia]], on March 15, 1998, he was ordained as bishop by [[Bulgarian Alternative Synod]]'s head Patriarch Pimen and seven Metropolitans and [[Episcop]]s of his [[synod]]. He was enthroned to Metropolitan of Montenegrin Orthodox Church in [[Cetinje]] on October 31, 1998, in the presence of several hundred believers and supporters of Montenegrin Orthodox Church.\n\n[[Metropolitan Mihailo]] had worked as a professor for the Serbian Orthodox Church and then as a priest of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]] in [[Italy]], where he uncanonically created a Serbian Orthodox Municipality out of the Greek Church, leading after a number of scandals, including [[adultery]] and accusations of [[embezzlement]], to his permanent suspension from the Church in 1995. After becoming Metropolitan of the MOC in 1997, he was fully [[excommunicated]] by the [[Holy Synod]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] from the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. During his pastoral visit in Argentina in 2007, the Metropolitan Mihailo met Cardinal Bergoglio, current [[Pope Francis]].\n\nOn January 11, 2007, MOC restored its own [[Holy Synod]] and proclaimed its first decree in which it confirms its [[autocephalous]] status. The Holy Synod is constituted by archpriests of MOC, led by [[Metropolitan Mihailo]]. The Holy Synod divided Montenegro in five [[eparchies]] &ndash; Cetinjska, Dukljanska, Primorska, Ostro\u0161ka and Beranska.\n\nOne of the prominent members of the Montenegrin Orthodox Church was Jelisej Lalatovi\u0107, a former Serb monk from [[Nik\u0161i\u0107]], defrocked for stealing of church property and falsification of church seals.
