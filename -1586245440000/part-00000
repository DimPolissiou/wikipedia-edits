For the south western [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] people (Il\u00e9 Yor\u00f9b\u00e1) one of the most common breakfasts is ''[[\u00d2g\u00ec]]''\u2014 a porridge made from corn, usually served with [[evaporated milk]]. \u00d2g\u00ec is eaten with ''[[Acaraj\u00e9]]'' (akara) or ''[[Moin Moin|Moi moi]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-02-25/food/fo-44786_1_nigerian-bean-cakes|title=Nigerian Bean Cakes Make a Hearty Breakfast|last=Dosti|first=Rose|date=25 February 1988|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=15 January 2012}}</ref> Both are made from ground bean paste; akara is fried in oil, and moi moi is wrapped in leaves or foil and then steamed. \u00d2g\u00ec can also be steamed in leaves to harden it and eaten with akara or moi moi for breakfast.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

''Fette biscottate'' (a cookie-like hard bread often eaten with hazelnut chocolate spread or butter and jam) and [[biscuit|biscotti]] (cookies) are commonly eaten. Hot coffee may be sometimes replaced by hot tea, depending on personal taste. Children often drink hot chocolate, plain milk, hot milk with [[barley]] coffee, or hot milk with very little coffee. Cereals, yogurt, and fruit juices are also common. If breakfast is eaten in a ''bar'' (coffee shop), it is composed of ''cappuccino'' and ''cornetto'' (frothed hot milk with coffee and a pastry).<ref>The Silver Spoon {{ISBN|88-7212-223-6}}, 1997 ed.</ref>\n\n===Latvia===\nTypical Latvian breakfast usually consists of open sandwiches with toppings made of vegetables, fish, eggs, or cheese.

Very often light oat porridge is eaten too.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">And the New Scandinavian Cuisine Marcus Samuelsson {{ISBN|0618109412}}</ref> In general light, sour, and salty tasting food is common for morning meal. Latvians usually drink coffee for breakfast.\n\n===Malta===\nOn the island of [[Malta]], breakfast integrates both [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine|continental]] elements. Usually the [[Maltese people|Maltese]] start their day with a bowl of cereal mixed with milk, sometimes with a cup of coffee or tea. Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast. Prayers are often said before breakfast in order to bless the meal.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Guide To Maltese Cooking|last=Darmanin|first=Francis|isbn=99909-79-00-6|publisher=Jumbo Productions|location=Malta|page=14|date=September 1997}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands and Belgium===\nFor breakfast, the Dutch and Belgians typically eat sliced bread with butter or margarine and various choices of toppings: [[dairy product]]s (numerous variations of cheese), a variety of cured and sliced meats, or sweet or semi-sweet products such as jam, [[syrup]] (from sugar beets or fruit), [[honey]], Kokosbrood (a coconut product that is served thinly sliced like sliced cheese) or [[peanut butter]].

A perfect \"weekend breakfast\" for the Dutch contained coffee or tea, fresh-baked bread rolls (and croissants), and a boiled egg.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast.

Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead.

With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between. In the \"gar\u00edfuna\" culture, coffee is accompanied by \"m\u00ednimo\" bread (banana bread) or coconut bread.\n\n===Jamaica===\nA Jamaican breakfast includes [[ackee and saltfish]], seasoned [[callaloo]], boiled [[green banana]]s, and [[jonnycake|fried dumplings]].<ref name=\"breakfast\">Deborah S.

It always includes black coffee (tinto) or with milk (called pintado) with any of these sides: corn tortillas, traditional white cheese (or queso del pais), another type of tortillas or \"torrejas\" made of wheat flour known as \"[[hojaldres]].\" Another traditional breakfast side is \"[[bollo]]\" made out of either corn, white corn, or coconut that is wrapped in corn leaves and \"pre\u00f1a'o\" (meaning with child) that means it's filled with some type of meat.\n\nAs protein, a large serving of beef liver with onion, scrambled or fried eggs, beef stew or \"tasajo\" (a type of beef jerky), pork rinds and different kinds of sausages like chorizo or ''[[morcilla]]'' are the most popular. These are also accompanied by: slices of green plantain or [[cooking plantain]], \"[[patacones]]\" (double fried plantain), [[carima\u00f1ola]]s (yuca filled with meat), as well as different bread pastries both savory and sweet. These large breakfasts are normally reserved for special occasions while everyday breakfasts consist of more traditional food from the west like toast, ham, cheese, jam etc.\n\nIt is important to mention that the prolonged US presence has also influenced urban areas of Panama by introducing meals like cereal with milk as well as pancakes with syrup as traditional breakfast meals.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Panam\u00e1]]</ref>\n\n===United States===\n{{See also|List of American breakfast foods}}\n[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Overeasy-Eggs.jpg|thumb|right|An example of an American diner breakfast, with overeasy eggs, home fries, bacon, and buttered toast]]\nThe average starting time for breakfasts in the United States has been found to be 8:12&nbsp;a.m, and varies from 8:08&nbsp;a.m. in the South to 8:17&nbsp;a.m. in the West.<ref>{{Citation|last=Larson|first=Robert B.|title=When is Dinner?|date=2002|volume=33|issue=3|pages=38\u201345|periodical=Journal of Food Distribution Research|doi=10.22004/ag.econ.26834|issn=2643-3354}}</ref> Breakfast often consists of a combination of hot or cold cereals, eggs, breakfast meats, and breakfast quick breads such as [[pancake]]s, [[waffle]]s, or [[biscuit]]s.

Several kinds of cheeses are popular, including ''{{Transl|arz|gebna b\u0113\u1e0da}}'' or [[Domyati]] cheese, ''{{transl|arz|gebna r\u016bmi}}'' (Roman cheese) which is similar to ''[[Pecorino Romano]]'' or ''[[Manchego]]'', and Istanbuli cheese (a brined white cheese with peppers added to the brine which makes it spicy). Fried eggs with [[pastirma]] is also a common breakfast food in Egypt.\n\n=== Malawi ===\nFor breakfast, some children in Malawi eat porridge, [[cornbread]], savory [[Fritter|fritters]], boiled starchy vegetables, such as white potatoes, [[Sweet potato|sweet potatoes]], or [[pumpkin]], and drink [[Sweet tea|sweet black tea]].<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2014/10/08/magazine/eaters-all-over.html|title=What Kids Around the World Eat for Breakfast|last=Whitaker|first=Hannah|date=2014-10-08|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-01-08|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n===Morocco===\n[[File:Rghaif (detalle).jpg|thumb|right|[[Msemen]], a common breakfast in [[Moroccan cuisine]]]]\nFor breakfast, many Moroccans eat bread, harsha (semolina griddle cakes), or [[msemen]] (oiled pancakes) with olive oil, tea, and different kinds of Moroccan crepes.<ref name=\"fescooking.com\">{{cite web|url=http://fescooking.com/come-cook-with-us/the-art-of-moroccan-cuisine|title=The Art of Moroccan Cuisine \u2013 Cooking Classes in Morocco &#124; Fes Cooking and Cultural Tours|author=Special Events|date=18 July 2013|publisher=Fescooking.com|accessdate=23 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Nigeria===\n[[Nigeria]] has over 250 different ethnic groups,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html|title=Africa :: Nigeria|publisher=cia.gov}}</ref> with a corresponding variety of cuisines.

(464786586).jpg|thumb|right|Chinese homemade congee]]\nAs [[mainland China]] is made up of many distinct provinces, each with their own unique cuisine, breakfast in China can vary significantly from province to province. In general, basic choices include sweet or salty pancakes, soup, deep-fried bread sticks or doughnuts ([[youtiao]]), buns ([[mantou]]), porridge ([[congee]]), and fried or soup-based noodles.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chinese Cuisine|url=http://www.saturdaymarket.com/chinabreakfast/intro.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> These options are often accompanied by tea or sweetened soybean milk. However, condiments for porridge and the soup base tend to vary between provinces and regions. The types of teas that are served and spices that are used can also differ significantly between the provinces.\n\n====Hong Kong====\nDue to its near two centuries' history as a British colony and proximity to China's Canton region, both English and traditional Cantonese style breakfasts are of somewhat equal popularity in [[Hong Kong]], as well as the hybrid form of breakfast commonly offered in [[Cha chaan teng]].

''[[Tieguanyin]]'' is the most common accompaniment, but other teas such as ''[[pu'er tea|pu'er]]'' and ''[[oolong]]'' are also common.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taste of Chinese Breakfast|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/Life/35510.htm|accessdate=28 June 2012}}</ref> Fried and rice-based noodles and cakes are also popular.

The breakfast varies according to location and the eater's income. In villages and rural areas, rice with curry (potato mash, dal ) is mostly preferred by day labourers. In the city, sliced bread with jam or jelly is chosen due to time efficiency. In Bangladesh tea is preferred to coffee, and is an essential part of most breakfasts.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Having toasted biscuits, bread or puffed rice with tea is also very popular.\n\n===India===\nIn all, there are at least 25 types of Indian breakfasts, each consisting of a choice of over 100 different food items.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jaffrey|first1=Madhur|title=Vegetarian India|year= 2015|publisher=Penguin Random House|location=New Delhi|url=http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/247938/vegetarian-india-by-madhur-jaffrey/9781101874868|accessdate=28 April 2017}}</ref> Each state in India has different specialties and items for breakfast.

Other popular south Indian breakfast items are [[Pongal (dish)|pongal]], [[bisibelebath]] (sambar rice), [[upma]], and [[poori]].

The term originated in Britain in the mid-19th century, first used in 1896 public hygiene book ''The Sanitarian'', in which \"continent\" refers to the countries of mainland [[Europe]], though the idea had been around for a few decades as American hotels endeavored to appeal to the changing tastes of the emerging middle class and European travelers visiting America. The term refers to the type of breakfast found in places such as France and the Mediterranean, which is lighter and more delicate than the typical full English breakfast, which tends to consist of a large plate of eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, beans, and roasted mushrooms and tomatoes, and American breakfasts featuring eggs, breakfast meats, pancakes, potatoes, and toast. Continental breakfasts are also more cost-effective for the establishments serving them, because they require fewer staff to prepare them.<ref>Goldfarb, Anna (January 18, 2018).

The sandwich is buttered (with margarine), with toppings such as [[prosciutto]] and yellow [[cheese]].\n\n===Albania===\nIn [[Albania]] the breakfast often consists of a scone, milk, tea, eggs, jam or cheese. Meat is not preferred during the breakfast and it is usually substituted for seafood such as canned sardines or tuna which is typically served with condiments such as mustard or mayonnaise. Whole grain cereals and pastries are mostly consumed by children. A shot of [[Rakia|raki]] may be added to coffee as in the Italian ''[[Caff\u00e8 corretto]]''.\n\n===Croatia===\nIn [[Croatia]] the base is a continental breakfast with a variety of pastries with or without fillings ([[marmalade]], chocolate, cheese, ham, nuts, [[poppy]]) and [[fermented milk products]] (yogurt, soured milk, soured cream).

The main food consists of sweet products such as ''tartines'' (slices of [[baguette]] or other breads spread with butter, jam, or chocolate paste), sometimes dunked in the hot drink.

Marmalade/jams or even chocolate spreads are also common on bread or toast. Today cereal bars are also becoming a common type of breakfast on the island. The traditional English breakfast of eggs, sausages, and fried bacon was also popular among the Maltese, especially on Sundays, due to the strong British influence on the island, but this has diminished almost completely, as locals have rediscovered a more Mediterranean and continental diet over the recent years. Hotels usually serve both a continental as well as a full English breakfast.

Sides include various cold cuts, meat spreads, the Polish sausage [[kielbasa]], tomatoes, [[Swiss cheese]], and sliced pickles. ''[[Quark (cheese)|Twar\u00f3g]],'' a Polish cheese, is the breakfast classic and comes in many forms. ''Twar\u00f3g'' can be eaten plain, with salt, sugar, or honey, or it can be mixed with [[chives]] into a [[cream cheese]]-like spread. Eggs are served often as the main breakfast item, mostly soft-boiled or scrambled. For a quick winter breakfast, hot oatmeal, to which cocoa is sometimes added, is often served. Jam spreads are popular for a quick breakfast, including plum, raspberry, and black or red [[Ribes|currant]] spreads. Breakfast drinks include coffee, milk, hot cocoa, or tea. Traditionally, the Poles avoid heavy-cooked foods for breakfast.<ref>Polish Cooking Marianna Olszewska Heberle Penguin 2005 {{ISBN|9781440624759}}</ref> For the most part, one will not see fried meats or potatoes in a classic Polish breakfast. Emphasis is placed on a large variety of foods to satisfy everyone at the breakfast table.\n\n===Romania===\nThe traditional Romanian breakfast is milk, tea or coffee alongside (toasted) bread with butter or margarine and on top of it, honey or fruit jams or preserves. Sometimes the buttered bread is served savory instead of sweet, in which case the Romanians add cured meats, salami, or cheese. Another option is to spread on a slice of bread some liver p\u00e2t\u00e9.

Freshly squeezed orange juice is widely available in most places as an alternative for coffee. The breakfast is not often larger than these two items, because usually in late morning there is a break known as ''[[almuerzo]]'' when there is a snack. Sometimes, toast is replaced with ''galletas'' (a type of cookie made with flour, sugar, oil, and vanilla flavour), ''magdalenas'' (a Spanish version of the French [[Madeleine (cake)|madeleine]] made with oil instead of butter) or buns.\n\n===Sweden===\nBreakfast in [[Sweden]] is usually an [[open sandwich]] of soft bread or [[crisp bread]], cold cuts, [[sm\u00f6rg\u00e5skaviar]], cheese, cottage cheese, cream cheese, eggs, scrambled or boiled, p\u00e2t\u00e9 ([[leverpastej]]) with [[pickled cucumber]], tomatoes or cucumber, or a toast with marmalade or maybe honey, juices, coffee, [[hot chocolate]]. or tea.

Tea and coffee remain equally popular accompaniments. Marmalade, originally a Portuguese confection, had been a popular British spread to consume in the evening, before the Scots moved it to the breakfast table in the 18th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/08/19/1061261128384.html|title=Spread over centuries|date=10 June 2015|agency=The Age|issue=19 August 2003}}</ref> It is however becoming very common to 'skip breakfast' entirely or take coffee or pastries on the morning commute. Portable quick snacks such as [[granola bars]], ready-cut fruit and warm takeaway foods are becoming increasingly commonly consumed away from home and are sold at commuting points and [[newsagents]] and local shops in all urban areas.\n\nThe traditional breakfast most associated with Britain and Ireland remains, however, the [[full breakfast]] of eggs (fried, scrambled, or [[poaching (cooking)|poached]]) with [[bacon]] and [[sausages]], usually with mushrooms, tomatoes, [[baked beans]], fried bread, [[black pudding]] or [[white pudding]], and toast. Dating from a time when hard labour was more common, calorie intakes were necessarily higher, and servant labour was more available, it is nowadays regarded as a meal for the weekend or holidays when time is available for preparation, prepared by parents to welcome children, or as a special occasion such as a birthday or anniversary, or following a night of drinking. A healthy and nutritious version consists of grilling the protein and using poached, rather than fried, eggs, and variations based on one egg, one protein, and toast abound. It remains by far the most common choice on [[brunch]] menus and breakfast cafes across the region. The \"full Scottish breakfast\" tends to omit pork sausages and have beef sausages or lamb [[haggis]] instead. At its most extensive it consists of eggs, [[Lorne sausage|square sausage]], fried dumpling, [[potato scone]], tomato, mushrooms, bacon beef links, and [[fried bread]]. Originating in the British isles during the [[Victorian era]], the full breakfast is among the most internationally recognised [[British cuisine|British dishes]].<ref>{{cite book|title=British Food: An Extraordinary Thousand Years of History|last=Spencer|first=Colin|publisher=[[Columbia University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-231-13110-0}}</ref>\n\nAnother traditional British breakfast consists of [[porridge]], although now associated with Scotland, it has been consumed across Britain as a staple food since at least the [[Middle Ages]].

Traditional breakfast bread is a water-based bread.<ref>[[:es:Desayuno#Rep\u00fablica Dominicana]]</ref>\n\n===Guatemala===\nIn [[Guatemala]], breakfast consists of one or two eggs either fried, scrambled, or boiled accompanied by baked/fried beans with coffee. With this comes fresh cream, fresh cheese, and fried plantains (or [[cooking plantain]]). It is common to add hot sauce made out of \"[[chiltepe]]s\" (a type of pepper). They are prepared raw or boiled, then they are ground with some vinegar, chopped onions, and chopped cilantro to make the hot sauce. A traditional egg dish prepared with both green and red sauces is called \"huevos divorciados.\"\nIn the eastern part of the country, specifically in [[Zacapa]], you can find \"huevos a caballo\" or (eggs on a horse) which is basically two fried eggs over roasted steak.\n\nOther types of breakfast include milk cereals. The most common drinks are orange juice or other fruits, milk, atol (a milk pudding with chocolate), and corn starch. The coffee is normally served with sweet bread also called \"pan de manteca\" (or butter bread).\n\n===Honduras===\nIn [[Honduras]] it is typical to start the day with homemade bread, with coffee or a glass of milk. Then, a plate of food with beans, alongside eggs that can be scrambled or sunny side up, slivers of fried plantain (or [[cooking plantain]]), corn, tortillas, cheese, and butter. Versions of egg preparation vary: \"estrellados\" which consists of just cracking the shell, in \"torta\" or omelette (beaten with some salt), scrambled or boiled. Another typical breakfast are the [[baleadas]] and tortillas with cheese; sometimes they are fried together with cheese in between.

Eating breakfast at a restaurant was unheard of until the 1990s; however cafes which serve breakfast until midday or all day are now common.<ref>{{cite book|title=New Zealand|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2002|isbn=1-74059-196-8|page=79}}</ref> The Big Breakfast is the main item at cafes, which is similar to the British cooked breakfast, except that it seldom includes black pudding. Other common menu items are: eggs done how you like, [[eggs benedict]], [[Baked beans|beans]] on toast, pancakes, cereal and yogurt, and [[smoothie]]s. Breakfast nearly always includes coffee, tea, or both, with children drinking milk either on their cereal, in a glass, or hot [[Milo (drink)|milo]].

The song was released on October 5, 2018 as part of their fifth studio album, ''[[Trench (album)|Trench]]'', by [[Fueled by Ramen]] and on January 22, 2019 as the fifth single from this album plus a music video. The song was sent to Alternative radio on January 29, 2019 then sent to Top 40 radio on March 19, 2019. It peaked at number 7 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart, and reached number one in Latvia and Mexico. The track was written and produced by lead singer [[Tyler Joseph]] and [[Paul Meany]] of rock band [[Mutemath]]. It is a [[Pop music|pop]], [[electropop]], and [[trip hop]] song which discusses \"how creativity can cleanse dark impulses but cause its own pain.\"\n\n\"Chlorine\" was well received by music critics, who highlighted its catchiness and musical restraint compared to the band's previous work.

''Confiance'' served as Captain [[George Downie]]'s [[flagship]] at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], on 11 September 1814.  Surrendered to the American Squadron following a nearly 2\u00bd hour battle, she was eventually taken to Whitehall, New York where she was taken into the U.S. Navy and placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]].  The vessel was formally abandoned by the Navy in 1820 and after being partially salvaged, was allowed to sink at her moorings.  As a danger to navigation, the sunken hulk was destroyed with dynamite charges during dredging operations on the channel in 1873.\n\n==Background==\nThe frigate was constructed at the [[Ile aux Noix]] Naval Shipyards and launched on 25 August 1814. To this day ''Confiance'' remains the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain.  The British built ''Confiance'' in answer to the American commander [[Thomas Macdonough]]'s ambitious shipbuilding program, itself designed to thwart British advances into Vermont and New York State via the lake.  The formidable vessel was described as having \"the gun-deck of a heavy frigate, with thirty long twenty-fours upon it. She also had a spacious top gallant forecastle, and a poop that came no further forward than the mizzen mast. On the first were a long twenty-four on a [[pivot gun|circle]], and four heavy [[carronade]]s; two heavy carronades were mounted on the poop.\"<ref>History of Lake Champlain by Peter Sailly Palmer, pub. 1866, p. 226</ref>\n\nCaptain [[George Downie]] was appointed to command soon after the vessel was launched, replacing Captain Peter Fisher, who in turn had superseded Commander Daniel Pring.<ref>J. Mackay Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.252</ref>  As a fifth-rate ship, ''Confiance'' required a post rank captain in command, and only the distant [[Admiralty]] could promote Pring to Post Captain. Like Macdonough, Downie had difficulty obtaining men and materials from Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] on Lake Ontario, and Macdonough had intercepted several spars and other materials sold to Britain by unpatriotic Vermonters.<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.188</ref> Downie  could promise to complete ''Confiance'' only on 15 September; and even then, her crew would not have been exercised.\n\nSir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], Governor in Chief of [[British North America]] and overall commander of the invasion forces, was anxious to begin his campaign as early as possible, to avoid the bad weather of late autumn and winter, and continually pressed Downie to prepare ''Confiance'' for battle more quickly.  Although the British sloops and gunboats were already on the Lake, it took two days to tow the frigate ''Confiance'' up the [[Richelieu River]] from Ile aux Noix, against both wind and current. Downie finally joined the squadron with his flagship on 9 September.\n\n==The Battle of Plattsburgh==\n[[File:Macdonough\u2019s victory on Lake Champlain and defeat of the British Army at Plattsburg by Genl. Macomb, Sept. 11 1814 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View from [[Cumberland Head]], on Lake Champlain at the Battle of Plattsburg 11 September 1814]]\nFor all intents and purposes, the vessel was still unfinished at the time of the battle, with some workmen, including riggers and carpenters, still laboring on her completion right up to the days before.  According to one source, at the time of the battle, the ''Confiance'' mounted 37 guns but actually carried 39, with two additional cannon aboard but having not yet been mounted.<ref>History of the Navy by James Fenimore Cooper, pub. 1839</ref> Admiralty records show that in reality, she mounted only 16 12-pounders when she went into battle.<ref>Winfield (2008), 135.</ref>\n\nHer crew was made up of a large number of untrained provincials. A company of the [[39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot|39th Foot]] augmented the incomplete crew.<ref>Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.257</ref>\n\nShortly before 8 am, as the British squadron approached the northern tip of [[Cumberland Head]], Downie ordered the guns of his ship scaled.  This was a pre-arranged signal to the British land forces announcing his presence and his intent to engage the American fleet, basically informing them they could begin their offensive operations.  At about 9 am, the British squadron rounded Cumberland Head close-hauled in line abreast with the large ships to the north initially in the order [[USS Growler (1812-2)|''Chubb'']], [[USS Linnet (1814)|''Linnet'']], ''Confiance'' (flying a 23-foot British Naval [[White Ensign]]), [[USS Eagle (1812)|''Finch'']], and the gunboats to the south.\n\nMacdonough had cleverly anchored his vessels in a line, each bow to stern, across the entrance of Plattsburgh Bay from Cumberland Head at the north, to [[Crab Island (Lake Champlain)|Crab Island]] at the south.  This forced Downie either to engage his vessels in the confusing winds of the Bay, or try to sail south around Crab Island, risking being caught between the guns of the American fleet and the guns of U.S.-held Fort Scott on the shore.  The wind was light, and Downie was unable to maneuver ''Confiance'' across the head of Macdonough's line.  As ''Confiance'' suffered increasing damage from the American ships, he was forced to drop anchor between 300<ref name=\"Elting\">Elting, ''Amateurs to Arms'', p.260</ref> and 500<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.192</ref> yards from Macdonough's flagship, the [[corvette]] {{USS|Saratoga|1814|6}}. Downie then proceeded deliberately, securing everything before firing a broadside that killed or wounded one fifth of ''Saratoga's'' crew.<ref name=\"Hitsman260\">Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.260</ref>  It was at this point, within a mere fifteen minutes after the opening of the engagement, that Commodore Downie was killed. He had been standing behind one of his vessel's 24-pounders, sighting it, when a round shot fired from the ''Saratoga'' struck the muzzle. This in turn had dismounted the 2,000-pound cannon from its carriage and sent it tipping up on end before sprawling on top of the commanding officer, crushing him to the deck and killing him instantly. One eyewitness later recorded how Downie appeared when the heavy gun was removed from his body:\n\n<blockquote>His skin was not broken, a black mark about the size of a small plate was the only visible injury. His watch was found flattened, with its hands pointing to the very second at which he received the fatal blow.<ref>\"The Battle of Plattsburgh - What Historians Say About It.\" p. 1914</ref></blockquote>\n\nBoth flagships fought each other to a standstill.  It has been surmised that the ''Confiance'' had also been equipped with a \"[[shot furnace]]\", a stove where solid iron round shot could be heated red hot before being quickly fired at an enemy vessel with the intention of setting it alight.  The British apparently attempted this tactic several times during the engagement as the men on ''Saratoga'' had to extinguish on board fires at least three times.  After Downie and several of the other officers had also been killed or injured, ''Confiance's'' fire became steadily less effective.  Still, aboard ''Saratoga'', almost all the starboard-side guns had been dismounted or put out of action.<ref>Roosevelt, ''The Naval War of 1812'', p.217</ref>\n\nAt this critical moment, Macdonough ordered the bow anchor cut, and he hauled in the kedge anchors he had laid out earlier to spin ''Saratoga'' around. This allowed ''Saratoga'' to bring its undamaged port battery into action. The British flagship withered in the face of the renewed American fire, with one shot smashing a gaping 7-foot hole in her hull below the waterline.  The ''Confiance'' began to list badly to starboard.  Below decks, crewman scrambled to move weight to the port side in hopes of keeping the damaged planking above water.  Likewise, men scurried to move her already amassing wounded to prevent them from being drowned by the rising water.  Mr. Cox, the ship's carpenter, was later praised for having \"drove in sixteen large shot plugs under the water line\" during the action.  The vessel's surviving Lieutenant, James Robertson, tried to haul in on the springs to his only remaining anchor that hadn't been shot away to make a similar maneuver, but succeeded only in presenting the vulnerable stern to the American fire. Helpless, and now being raked by fresh broadsides from the American ship, ''Confiance'' could only surrender. She was forced to strike after a fierce two-hour-and-five-minute gun duel, during most of which she had been engaged with Macdonough's flagship.  The last vestige of the British Squadron, HMS ''Linnet'', itself barely a floating hulk, continued to fire defiantly for an additional fifteen minutes following the flagship's surrender. Macdonough simply hauled in further on his kedge anchors to bring his broadside to bear on the ''Linnet'', which also could only surrender, after being pummeled almost to the point of sinking.<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.193</ref>\n\nIn his after action report to Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]], Commodore Macdonough estimated that during the battle the ''Confiance'' had sustained at least 105 hits from round shot.  Daniel Records, assigned by Macdonough as the ''Confiance's'' prize master, later reported the extent of the damage to be \"250 to 300 cannon shot in the hull and grape without number.\"  Forty-one of her crew were killed, including Downie, and another eighty-three wounded. The loss of their commanding officer so early in the battle, arguably the most experienced officer in the  British Squadron, had no doubt greatly improved the odds of an American victory.  A local area judge, Julius Caesar Hubbell, was allowed to visit the ships of the American and British squadrons immediately following the action and later recounted the grisly scene he witnessed aboard ''Confiance'':\n\n<blockquote>... here was an absolutely horrible sight.  The vessel was absolutely torn to pieces; the decks were strewed with mutilated bodies lying in all directions, and everything was covered with blood.</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the battle, the battered American ships and their equally battered prizes, many of which were in danger of sinking, including ''Confiance,'' were hastily repaired and the following month taken to the southernmost port on Lake Champlain, [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall, New York]], where they were to be placed [[Reserve fleet|in Ordinary]].  On the trip down the lake, the passing vessels fired a salute to the battery at [[Burlington, Vermont]].  It would be the last time the guns of the fleet, and ''Confiance'' would ever fire.\n\nUpon the vessel's arrival at Whitehall, she was taken into the U.S. Navy. After being laid up, the vessel served as Commodore Macdonough's headquarters during the winter of 1814-15.  When the war ended, the ships of the ragtag fleet were stripped of their guns, rigging, and equipment, their decks were housed over to protect them from the elements, and the ships were anchored in a line along the main channel below town.\n\nUnderstandably rot quickly spread through the green-timbered ships, and in 1820 they were towed into the nearby mouth of the Poultney River, known as East Bay, and formally abandoned.  At their new moorings, the vessels were allowed to sink; the ''Confiance'' was the first of the five larger ships to settle into the river.  This was in no small way aided by the fact that, in their haste to finish her, the British had used substandard materials in her construction.  The Commander of the Whitehall Navy Yard at the time even commented that her scantlings were \"of the very worst timber for building ships.\"  Four years after her initial sinking, spring flooding washed the hull out of the river and into the main lake channel. The Navy Department ordered the hull moved and broken up, and dockyard records indicate that the hull was at least partially dismantled. The destruction must not have been complete, however, for a derelict hull marked \"wreck of the Confiance\" appears on an 1839 map of Whitehall prepared by the U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers.  The following year in 1825, the Navy decided to close the Whitehall station and sold all the remaining hulks to salvagers.\n\nThis was not to be the last \"[[huzzah]]\" of the ''Confiance'', however. In 1873, after dredging work was being done on the river, the submerged hull of the ''Confiance'', defiant to the last, slid into the deepened channel and blocked it. In view of this problem, Mr. J.J. Holden, a local contractor better known as \"Nitroglycerine Jack,\" was called in to remove the obstacle.  After a huge explosion, the only remains of the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain were turned into a limited supply of walking canes, which were sold for a dollar apiece.\n\n==Relics==\nToday there is nothing that remains of the wreck of the ''Confiance'' herself.  However, several major relics from the vessel still exist and fortunately have been preserved:\n\n* The White Ensign from the ''Confiance'', taken as an American prize, survived long enough to be photographed in the late 19th century.  Her ensign was on display at Mahan Hall at the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], but was removed on 27 February 2018 for preservation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/usnamuseum/photos/a.766528580031105.1073741847.137100856307217/2004261622924455/?type=3&theater|title=U.S. Naval Academy Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n* A 24-pounder cannon from the captured ''Confiance'', actually the same gun responsible for the death of her commanding officer, Commodore George Downie, can be found today on display in front of Macdonough Hall at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis Maryland]].  The indentation on the muzzle of this gun left by the ball from the USS ''Saratoga'' is still present.\n* In 1996, sport divers located a massive main anchor from the ''Confiance'' which had been lost in Plattsburgh Bay during the 1814 Naval battle.  Weighing almost 1 ton, the anchor underwent conservation work at the [[Lake Champlain Maritime Museum]].

''Confiance'' served as Captain [[George Downie]]'s [[flagship]] at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], on 11 September 1814.  Surrendered to the American Squadron following a nearly 2\u00bd hour battle, she was eventually taken to Whitehall, New York where she was taken into the U.S. Navy and placed [[Reserve fleet|in ordinary]].  The vessel was formally abandoned by the Navy in 1820 and after being partially salvaged, was allowed to sink at her moorings.  As a danger to navigation, the sunken hulk was destroyed with dynamite charges during dredging operations on the channel in 1873.\n\n==Background==\nThe frigate was constructed at the [[Ile aux Noix]] Naval Shipyards and launched on 25 August 1814. To this day ''Confiance'' remains the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain.  The British built ''Confiance'' in answer to the American commander [[Thomas Macdonough]]'s ambitious shipbuilding program, itself designed to thwart British advances into Vermont and New York State via the lake.  The formidable vessel was described as having \"the gun-deck of a heavy frigate, with thirty long twenty-fours upon it. She also had a spacious top gallant forecastle, and a poop that came no further forward than the mizzen mast. On the first were a long twenty-four on a [[pivot gun|circle]], and four heavy [[carronade]]s; two heavy carronades were mounted on the poop.\"<ref>History of Lake Champlain by Peter Sailly Palmer, pub. 1866, p. 226</ref>\n\nCaptain [[George Downie]] was appointed to command soon after the vessel was launched, replacing Captain Peter Fisher, who in turn had superseded Commander Daniel Pring.<ref>J. Mackay Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.252</ref>  As a fifth-rate ship, ''Confiance'' required a post rank captain in command, and only the distant [[Admiralty]] could promote Pring to Post Captain. Like Macdonough, Downie had difficulty obtaining men and materials from Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] on Lake Ontario, and Macdonough had intercepted several spars and other materials sold to Britain by unpatriotic Vermonters.<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.188</ref> Downie  could promise to complete ''Confiance'' only on 15 September; and even then, her crew would not have been exercised.\n\nSir [[George Pr\u00e9vost]], Governor in Chief of [[British North America]] and overall commander of the invasion forces, was anxious to begin his campaign as early as possible, to avoid the bad weather of late autumn and winter, and continually pressed Downie to prepare ''Confiance'' for battle more quickly.  Although the British sloops and gunboats were already on the Lake, it took two days to tow the frigate ''Confiance'' up the [[Richelieu River]] from Ile aux Noix, against both wind and current. Downie finally joined the squadron with his flagship on 9 September.\n\n==The Battle of Plattsburgh==\n[[File:Macdonough\u2019s victory on Lake Champlain and defeat of the British Army at Plattsburg by Genl. Macomb, Sept. 11 1814 (cropped).jpg|thumb|View from [[Cumberland Head]], on Lake Champlain at the Battle of Plattsburg 11 September 1814]]\nFor all intents and purposes, the vessel was still unfinished at the time of the battle, with some workmen, including riggers and carpenters, still laboring on her completion right up to the days before.  According to one source, at the time of the battle, the ''Confiance'' mounted 37 guns but actually carried 39, with two additional cannon aboard but having not yet been mounted.<ref>History of the Navy by James Fenimore Cooper, pub. 1839</ref> Admiralty records show that in reality, she mounted only 16 12-pounders when she went into battle.<ref>Winfield (2008), 135.</ref>\n\nHer crew was made up of a large number of untrained provincials. A company of the [[39th (Dorsetshire) Regiment of Foot|39th Foot]] augmented the incomplete crew.<ref>Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.257</ref>\n\nShortly before 8 am, as the British squadron approached the northern tip of [[Cumberland Head]], Downie ordered the guns of his ship scaled.  This was a pre-arranged signal to the British land forces announcing his presence and his intent to engage the American fleet, basically informing them they could begin their offensive operations.  At about 9 am, the British squadron rounded Cumberland Head close-hauled in line abreast with the large ships to the north initially in the order [[USS Growler (1812-2)|''Chubb'']], [[USS Linnet (1814)|''Linnet'']], ''Confiance'' (flying a 23-foot British Naval [[White Ensign]]), [[USS Eagle (1812)|''Finch'']], and the gunboats to the south.\n\nMacdonough had cleverly anchored his vessels in a line, each bow to stern, across the entrance of Plattsburgh Bay from Cumberland Head at the north, to [[Crab Island (Lake Champlain)|Crab Island]] at the south.  This forced Downie either to engage his vessels in the confusing winds of the Bay, or try to sail south around Crab Island, risking being caught between the guns of the American fleet and the guns of U.S.-held Fort Scott on the shore.  The wind was light, and Downie was unable to maneuver ''Confiance'' across the head of Macdonough's line.  As ''Confiance'' suffered increasing damage from the American ships, he was forced to drop anchor between 300<ref name=\"Elting\">Elting, ''Amateurs to Arms'', p.260</ref> and 500<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.192</ref> yards from Macdonough's flagship, the [[corvette]] {{USS|Saratoga|1814|6}}. Downie then proceeded deliberately, securing everything before firing a broadside that killed or wounded one fifth of ''Saratoga's'' crew.<ref name=\"Hitsman260\">Hitsman, ''The Incredible War of 1812'', p.260</ref>  It was at this point, within a mere fifteen minutes after the opening of the engagement, that Commodore Downie was killed. He had been standing behind one of his vessel's 24-pounders, sighting it, when a round shot fired from the ''Saratoga'' struck the muzzle. This in turn had dismounted the 2,000-pound cannon from its carriage and sent it tipping up on end before sprawling on top of the commanding officer, crushing him to the deck and killing him instantly. One eyewitness later recorded how Downie appeared when the heavy gun was removed from his body:\n\n<blockquote>His skin was not broken, a black mark about the size of a small plate was the only visible injury. His watch was found flattened, with its hands pointing to the very second at which he received the fatal blow.<ref>\"The Battle of Plattsburgh - What Historians Say About It.\" p. 1914</ref></blockquote>\n\nBoth flagships fought each other to a standstill.  It has been surmised that the ''Confiance'' had also been equipped with a \"[[shot furnace]]\", a stove where solid iron round shot could be heated red hot before being quickly fired at an enemy vessel with the intention of setting it alight.  The British apparently attempted this tactic several times during the engagement as the men on ''Saratoga'' had to extinguish on board fires at least three times.  After Downie and several of the other officers had also been killed or injured, ''Confiance's'' fire became steadily less effective.  Still, aboard ''Saratoga'', almost all the starboard-side guns had been dismounted or put out of action.<ref>Roosevelt, ''The Naval War of 1812'', p.217</ref>\n\nAt this critical moment, Macdonough ordered the bow anchor cut, and he hauled in the kedge anchors he had laid out earlier to spin ''Saratoga'' around. This allowed ''Saratoga'' to bring its undamaged port battery into action. The British flagship withered in the face of the renewed American fire, with one shot smashing a gaping 7-foot hole in her hull below the waterline.  The ''Confiance'' began to list badly to starboard.  Below decks, crewman scrambled to move weight to the port side in hopes of keeping the damaged planking above water.  Likewise, men scurried to move her already amassing wounded to prevent them from being drowned by the rising water.  Mr. Cox, the ship's carpenter, was later praised for having \"drove in sixteen large shot plugs under the water line\" during the action.  The vessel's surviving Lieutenant, James Robertson, tried to haul in on the springs to his only remaining anchor that hadn't been shot away to make a similar maneuver, but succeeded only in presenting the vulnerable stern to the American fire. Helpless, and now being raked by fresh broadsides from the American ship, ''Confiance'' could only surrender. She was forced to strike after a fierce two-hour-and-five-minute gun duel, during most of which she had been engaged with Macdonough's flagship.  The last vestige of the British Squadron, HMS ''Linnet'', itself barely a floating hulk, continued to fire defiantly for an additional fifteen minutes following the flagship's surrender. Macdonough simply hauled in further on his kedge anchors to bring his broadside to bear on the ''Linnet'', which also could only surrender, after being pummeled almost to the point of sinking.<ref>Forester, ''The Age of Fighting Sail'', p.193</ref>\n\nIn his after action report to Secretary of the Navy [[William Jones (statesman)|William Jones]], Commodore Macdonough estimated that during the battle the ''Confiance'' had sustained at least 105 hits from round shot.  Daniel Records, assigned by Macdonough as the ''Confiance's'' prize master, later reported the extent of the damage to be \"250 to 300 cannon shot in the hull and grape without number.\"  Forty-one of her crew were killed, including Downie, and another eighty-three wounded. The loss of their commanding officer so early in the battle, arguably the most experienced officer in the  British Squadron, had no doubt greatly improved the odds of an American victory.  A local area judge, Julius Caesar Hubbell, was allowed to visit the ships of the American and British squadrons immediately following the action and later recounted the grisly scene he witnessed aboard ''Confiance'':\n\n<blockquote>... here was an absolutely horrible sight.  The vessel was absolutely torn to pieces; the decks were strewed with mutilated bodies lying in all directions, and everything was covered with blood.</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nFollowing the battle, the battered American ships and their equally battered prizes, many of which were in danger of sinking, including ''Confiance,'' were hastily repaired and the following month taken to the southernmost port on Lake Champlain, [[Whitehall (village), New York|Whitehall, New York]], where they were to be placed [[Reserve fleet|in Ordinary]].  On the trip down the lake, the passing vessels fired a salute to the battery at [[Burlington, Vermont]].  It would be the last time the guns of the fleet, and ''Confiance'' would ever fire.\n\nUpon the vessel's arrival at Whitehall, she was taken into the U.S. Navy. After being laid up, the vessel served as Commodore Macdonough's headquarters during the winter of 1814-15.  When the war ended, the ships of the ragtag fleet were stripped of their guns, rigging, and equipment, their decks were housed over to protect them from the elements, and the ships were anchored in a line along the main channel below town.\n\nUnderstandably rot quickly spread through the green-timbered ships, and in 1820 they were towed into the nearby mouth of the Poultney River, known as East Bay, and formally abandoned.  At their new moorings, the vessels were allowed to sink; the ''Confiance'' was the first of the five larger ships to settle into the river.  This was in no small way aided by the fact that, in their haste to finish her, the British had used substandard materials in her construction.  The Commander of the Whitehall Navy Yard at the time even commented that her scantlings were \"of the very worst timber for building ships.\"  Four years after her initial sinking, spring flooding washed the hull out of the river and into the main lake channel. The Navy Department ordered the hull moved and broken up, and dockyard records indicate that the hull was at least partially dismantled. The destruction must not have been complete, however, for a derelict hull marked \"wreck of the Confiance\" appears on an 1839 map of Whitehall prepared by the U.S. Corps of Topographical Engineers.  The following year in 1825, the Navy decided to close the Whitehall station and sold all the remaining hulks to salvagers.\n\nThis was not to be the last \"[[huzzah]]\" of the ''Confiance'', however. In 1873, after dredging work was being done on the river, the submerged hull of the ''Confiance'', defiant to the last, slid into the deepened channel and blocked it. In view of this problem, Mr. J.J. Holden, a local contractor better known as \"Nitroglycerine Jack,\" was called in to remove the obstacle.  After a huge explosion, the only remains of the largest warship ever to sail on Lake Champlain were turned into a limited supply of walking canes, which were sold for a dollar apiece.\n\n==Relics==\nToday there is nothing that remains of the wreck of the ''Confiance'' herself.  However, several major relics from the vessel still exist and fortunately have been preserved:\n\n* The White Ensign from the ''Confiance'', taken as an American prize, survived long enough to be photographed in the late 19th century.  Her ensign was on display at Mahan Hall at the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]], but was removed on 27 February 2018 for preservation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/usnamuseum/photos/a.766528580031105.1073741847.137100856307217/2004261622924455/?type=3&theater|title=U.S. Naval Academy Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-28}}</ref>\n* A 24-pounder cannon from the captured ''Confiance'', actually the same gun responsible for the death of her commanding officer, Commodore George Downie, can be found today on display in front of Macdonough Hall at the [[United States Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis Maryland]].  The indentation on the muzzle of this gun left by the ball from the USS ''Saratoga'' is still present.\n* In 1996, sport divers located a massive main anchor from the ''Confiance'' which had been lost in Plattsburgh Bay during the 1814 Naval battle.  Weighing almost 1 ton, the anchor underwent conservation work at the [[Lake Champlain Maritime Museum]].  It was given a round of mechanical cleaning (scraping the rust off) and then treated with [[tannic acid]] to seal the metal.  After its cleaning and treatment, the anchor revealed a large dent in one of its flukes made by a cannonball hit.  A maker's mark could also be clearly seen, from Hawks, Crawshay, & Co. in [[Gateshead, England]].  This anchor is currently on display in the lobby of City Hall in [[Plattsburgh, New York]].\n\n==The debris field==\nAccording to local sport divers, a debris field made up of wreckage from the ''Confiance,'' as well as the other vessels involved in the 1814 battle, still lies strewn across the floor of Lake Champlain beneath the site.

{"title_page": "Bond (finance)", "text_new": "{{About|the financial instrument||Bond (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Securities}}\n\nIn [[finance]], a '''bond''' is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. The most common types of bonds include [[municipal bond]]s and [[corporate bond]]s.\n\nThe bond is a debt [[security (finance)|security]], under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them [[interest]] (the [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date.<ref>{{Cite book\n | last = O'Sullivan\n | first = Arthur\n | author2=Sheffrin, Steven M.\n | title = Economics: Principles in action\n | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n | year = 2004\n | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n | pages = 197, 507\n | url = http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&PMDbSiteId=2781&PMDbSolutionId=6724&PMDbCategoryId=&PMDbProgramId=12881&level=4\n | doi =\n | id =\n | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.<ref>[http://www.moneycontrol.com/pehlakadam/bonds.php Bonds], accessed: 2012-06-08</ref>\n\nThus a bond is a form of [[loan]] or [[IOU]]: the ''holder'' of the bond is the lender (creditor), the ''issuer'' of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the ''coupon'' is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term [[investment]]s, or, in the case of [[government bond]]s, to finance current expenditure. [[certificate of deposit|Certificates of deposit]] (CDs) or short-term [[commercial paper]] are considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be [[money market]] instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nBonds and [[stock]]s are both [[security (finance)|securities]], but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a company (that is, they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (that is, they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind [[secured creditor]]s, in the event of bankruptcy.<ref>\n[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutepriority.asp Absolute Priority], accessed: 2013-10-8\n</ref>\nAnother difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, such as a [[Consol (bond)|consol]], which is a [[perpetuity]], that is, a bond with no maturity.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn [[English language|English]], the word \"{{linktext|bond}}\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". In the sense \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\", use of the word \"bond\" dates from at least the 1590s.<ref>\n{{OEtymD|bond|accessdate=2017-07-23}}\n</ref>\n\n==Issuance==\nBonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and [[Supranational union|supranational]] institutions in the [[primary market]]s. The most common process for issuing bonds is through [[underwriting]]. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a [[syndicate]], buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by ''[[bookrunner]]s'' who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the [[tombstone (advertising)|tombstone ads]] commonly used to announce bonds to the public. The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\n\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The [[Yield to maturity|overall rate of return]] on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Operations |title=UK Debt Management Office |publisher=Dmo.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404181639/http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts%2FOperations |archive-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\n\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the [[bond market]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housingfinance.com/ahf/articles/2005/march/bond1.html |title=Affordable Housing Finance |publisher=Housingfinance.com |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Tap}}Historically an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a ''tap issue'' or ''bond tap''.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tap_issue.asp Tap issue] at ''[[Investopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Features==\n===Principal===\n[[File:1978 $1000 8 3-8% Treasury Bond (reverse).jpg|thumb|upright=1|1978 $1,000 U.S. Treasury Bond]]\nNominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\n\n===Maturity===\nThe issuer has to repay the nominal amount on the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are three categories of bond maturities:\n* short term (bills): maturities between zero and one year;\n* medium term (notes): maturities between one and ten years;\n* long term (bonds): maturities between ten and thirty years;\n* Perpetual: which has no maturity Period.\n\n===Coupon===\nThe [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout the life of the bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as [[LIBOR]], or it can be even more exotic. The name \"coupon\" arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest payment. On the due dates the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.\n[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|Bond issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1623]]\n\n===Yield===\nThe yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers either to\n* The [[current yield]], or running yield, which is simply the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the [[clean price]]).\n* The [[yield to maturity]], or redemption yield, which is a more useful measure of the return of the bond. This takes into account the current market price, and the amount and timing of all remaining coupon payments and of the repayment due on maturity. It is equivalent to the [[internal rate of return]] of a bond.\n\n===Credit quality===\nThe quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.\n[[High-yield bond]]s are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called ''junk bonds''.\n\n===Market price===\nThe market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, amongst other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\n\nThe price can be quoted as [[clean price|clean]] or [[dirty price|dirty]]. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dirtyprice.asp|title=Dirty Price|work=Investopedia|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high [[probability of default]] on the bond).\n\n===Others===\n* Indentures and Covenants\u2014An [[indenture]] is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders. The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a [[majority]] (or [[Supermajority|super-majority]]) vote of the bondholders.\n* Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an [[embedded option]]; that is, it grants [[option (finance)|option-like]] features to the holder or the issuer:\n** Callability\u2014Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see [[call option]]. These bonds are referred to as [[callable bond]]s. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at [[Par value|par]]. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.\n** Puttability\u2014Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see [[put option]]. These are referred to as retractable or [[putable bond]]s.\n** Call dates and put dates\u2014the [[option style|dates]] on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:\n*** A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.\n*** A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.\n*** An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.\n*** A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a \"survivor's option\".\n** [[Sinking fund]] provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in open market, then return them to trustees.\n*** Bonds are often identified by its international securities identification number, or [[International Securities Identification Number|ISIN]], which is a 12 digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:South Carolina consolidation bond.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bond certificate for the state of South Carolina issued in 1873 under the state's Consolidation Act.]]\n[[File:Obligatie-Moskau-Kiev-Woronesch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Railroad obligation of the Moscow-Kiev-Voronezh railroad company, printed in Russian, Dutch and German.]]\n\nThe following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\n* [[Fixed rate bond]]s have a coupon that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. A variation are stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.\n* [[Floating rate note]]s (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a [[reference rate]] of interest, such as [[Libor]] or [[Euribor]]. For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.\n* [[Zero-coupon bond]]s (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to [[par value]], so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government<!-- are these traded securities?--->. [[Zero-coupon bond]]s may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (\"stripping off\") the coupons from the principal. In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately. See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).\n* [[High-yield bond]]s (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield.\n* [[Convertible bond]]s let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer's common stock. These are known as [[Hybrid security|hybrid securities]], because they combine [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] features.\n* [[Exchangeable bond]]s allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.\n* [[Inflation-indexed bond]]s (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The [[United Kingdom]] was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]] in the 1980s. [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]] (TIPS) and [[Treasury security#Series I|I-bonds]] are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.\n[[File:Receipt for temporary bonds.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Receipt for temporary bonds for the state of Kansas issued in 1922]]\n* Other indexed bonds, for example [[equity-linked note]]s and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country's [[GDP]].\n* [[Asset-backed security|Asset-backed securities]] are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).\n* [[Subordinated debt|Subordinated bonds]] are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of [[liquidation]]. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in [[tranche]]s. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.\n* [[Covered bond]]s are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Contrary to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] the assets for such bonds remain on the issuers balance sheet.\n* [[Perpetual bond]]s are also often called [[Perpetuity|perpetuities]] or 'Perps'. They have no maturity date. The most famous of these are the UK Consols, which are also known as Treasury Annuities or Undated Treasuries. Some of these were issued back in 1888 and still trade today, although the amounts are now insignificant. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.\n* The ''Methuselah'' is a type of bond with a maturity of 50-years or longer.<ref>https://www.ledevoir.com/economie/561203/obligations-quand-les-etats-sont-tentes-par-la-dette-mathusalem , talking about 100-year maturity bonds.</ref> The term is a reference to [[Methuselah]], the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The issuance in Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from [[pension]] plans, particularly in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Issuance of Methuselahs in the [[United States]] has been limited, however, as the [[U.S. Treasury]] does not currently issue [[Treasury security|Treasuries]] with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any [[corporate debt|corporate]] issuance.\n* [[Bearer bond]] is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. Especially after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets.<ref>Eason, Yla (June 6, 1983). \"Final Surge in Bearer Bonds\" ''New York Times''.</ref> U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.<ref>Quint, Michael (August 14, 1984). \"Elements in Bearer Bond Issue\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* Registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent. It is the alternative to a [[Bearer bond]]. Interest payments, and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner.\n* A [[government bond]], also called Treasury bond, is issued by a national government and is not exposed to default risk. It is characterized as the safest bond, with the lowest interest rate. A treasury bond is backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the relevant government. For that reason, for the major OECD countries this type of bond is often referred to as risk-free.\n* A [[supranational bond]] also known as a \"supra\" is issued by a [[Supranational union|supranational organisation]] like the [[World Bank]]. They are have very good credit rating like government bonds.\n* [[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|right|'''Pacific Railroad Bond''' issued by City and County of San Francisco, CA. May 1, 1865]] [[Municipal bond]] is a bond issued by a state, U.S. Territory, city, local government, or their agencies. Interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is [[tax advantage|exempt]] from the federal [[income tax]] and sometimes from the income tax of the state in which they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may not be tax exempt. Municipal bonds issued in U.S. territories are exempted from all federal, state, and local taxes, making them triple-exempted. \n* Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of [[municipal bond]] authorized by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields (over 7 percent) than standard municipal bonds.<ref>{{cite web | author=Benjamin Shepherd | title=A Slice of the Pie | url=http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | publisher=InvestingDaily.com | accessdate=2010-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052252/http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | archive-date=2011-07-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate. As physically processing paper bonds and interest coupons became more expensive, issuers (and banks that used to collect coupon interest for depositors) have tried to discourage their use. Some book-entry bond issues do not offer the option of a paper certificate, even to investors who prefer them.<ref>no byline (July 18, 1984). \"Book Entry Bonds Popular\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* [[Lottery Bond|Lottery bonds]] are issued by European and other states. Interest is paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond, but the issuer will redeem randomly selected individual bonds within the issue according to a schedule. Some of these redemptions will be for a higher value than the face value of the bond.\n* [[War bond]] is a bond issued by a government to fund military operations during wartime. This type of bond has low return rate.\n* [[Serial bond]] is a bond that matures in installments over a period of time. In effect, a $100,000, 5-year serial bond would mature in a $20,000 annuity over a 5-year interval.\n* [[Revenue bond]] is a special type of municipal bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds. Revenue bonds are typically \"non-recourse\", meaning that in the event of default, the bond holder has no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues.\n* [[Climate bond]] is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes.\n* Dual currency bonds <ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dual-currency-bond.asp Dual currency bond], accessed 2012-06-08.</ref>\n* Retail bonds are a type of corporate bond mostly designed for ordinary investors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209161432/http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |archivedate=February 9, 2013 }}</ref> They have become particularly attractive since the [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE) launched an [[order book for retail bonds]].<ref>http://www.hedgefundonline.com/</ref>\n* [[Social impact bond]]s are an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors after meeting verified improved social outcome goals that result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects.\n\n===Foreign currencies===\nSome companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as it may appear to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency.\nIssuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets.

That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be [[arbitrage]] opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see [[Bond valuation]].\n\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100; prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount. The [[market price]] of a bond may be quoted including the [[accrued interest]] since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"[[dirty price]]\". (''See also'' [[Accrual bond]].) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"[[clean price]]\".\n\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the [[United States]], or in units of \u00a3100 in the [[United Kingdom]]. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.) Some short-term bonds, such as the [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|U.S. Treasury bill]], are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\n\nBonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"[[pull to par]]\". At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued.\n\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the [[current yield]] (this is the [[nominal yield]] multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the [[yield curve]], a graph plotting this relationship.\n\nIf the bond includes [[embedded option]]s, the valuation is more difficult and combines [[option pricing]] with discounting. Depending on the type of option, the [[option premium|option price]] as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under [[Bond option#Embedded options]]. This total is then the value of the bond. More sophisticated [[Lattice model (finance)#Hybrid securities|lattice-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based techniques]] may (also) be employed.\n\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed [[bond market]]s such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets. In such a market, [[market liquidity]] is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the [[counterparty]] to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\n\nBond markets can also differ from stock markets in that, in some markets, investors sometimes do not pay brokerage commissions to dealers with whom they buy or sell bonds. Rather, the dealers earn revenue by means of the spread, or difference, between the price at which the dealer buys a bond from one investor\u2014the \"bid\" price\u2014and the price at which he or she sells the same bond to another investor\u2014the \"ask\" or \"offer\" price. The [[Bid\u2013ask spread|bid/offer spread]] represents the total [[transaction cost]] associated with transferring a bond from one investor to another.\n\n==Investing in bonds==\nBonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like [[central bank]]s, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[hedge fund]]s, and [[bank]]s. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through [[bond fund]]s. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\n\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than [[stock]]s, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of [[dividend]] payments. Bonds are often liquid \u2013 it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities \u2013 and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive. Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], its bondholders will often receive some money back (the [[recovery amount]]), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\n* Fixed rate bonds are subject to ''[[interest rate risk]]'', meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the [[market price]] of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere\u2014perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.\n\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk, [[credit risk]], [[reinvestment risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[event risk]], [[foreign exchange risk|exchange rate risk]], [[volatility risk]], [[inflation risk]], [[Credit risk#Sovereign risk|sovereign risk]] and [[Interest rate risk#Banks and interest rate risk|yield curve risk]]. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\n\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect [[mutual fund]]s that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"[[Mark-to-market accounting|marked to market]]\" or not).\nIf there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", [[interest rate risk]] could become a real problem, conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its [[Macaulay Duration|duration]]. Efforts to control this risk are called [[immunization (finance)|immunization]] or [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].\n* Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer \u2013 for instance if the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] like [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.\n* A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes [[bankrupt]]. Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/06/16/daily13.html|title=More worthless WorldCom stock\n|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\n* Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates [[reinvestment risk]], meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.\n\n===Bond indices===\n{{See also|Bond market index}}\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the [[S&P 500]] or [[Russell Indexes]] for [[stock]]s. The most common American benchmarks are the [[Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index|Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate]] (ex Lehman Aggregate), [[Citigroup BIG]] and [[Merrill Lynch Domestic Master]]. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bond credit rating]]\n* [[Collective action clause]]\n* [[Debenture]]\n* [[Deferred financing costs]]\n* [[GDP-linked bond]]\n* [[Government bond]]/[[Sovereign bonds]]\n* [[Immunization (finance)]]\n* [[Promissory note]]\n* [[Short-rate model]]\n* [[Penal bond]]\n* [[Structured note]]\n\n'''Market specific'''\n* [[Brady Bonds]]\n* [[Build America Bonds]]\n* [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]\n\n'''General'''\n* [[Fixed income]]\n* [[List of accounting topics]]\n* [[List of economics topics]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonds}}\n* {{curlie|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Bonds/|Bonds links}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133558/https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/november/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill Estate planner victimized terminally ill], [[FBI]]\n\n{{Prone to spam|date=March 2012}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should it be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be deleted.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] & [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there  using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n\n{{Bond market}}\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking |state=collapsed}}\n{{Debt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bond (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Bonds (finance)| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the financial instrument||Bond (disambiguation)}}\n\n{{Securities}}\n\nIn [[finance]], a '''bond''' is an instrument of indebtedness of the bond issuer to the holders. The most common types of bonds include [[municipal bond]]s and [[corporate bond]]s.\n\nThe bond is a debt [[security (finance)|security]], under which the issuer owes the holders a debt and (depending on the terms of the bond) is obliged to pay them [[interest]] (the [[coupon (bond)|coupon]]) or to repay the principal at a later date, termed the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date.<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = O'Sullivan\n  | first = Arthur\n  |author2=Sheffrin, Steven M.\n  | title = Economics: Principles in action\n  | publisher = Pearson Prentice Hall\n  | year = 2004\n  | location = Upper Saddle River, New Jersey 07458\n  | pages = 197, 507\n  | url = http://www.pearsonschool.com/index.cfm?locator=PSZ3R9&PMDbSiteId=2781&PMDbSolutionId=6724&PMDbCategoryId=&PMDbProgramId=12881&level=4\n  | doi =\n  | id =\n  | isbn = 0-13-063085-3}}</ref> Interest is usually payable at fixed intervals (semiannual, annual, sometimes monthly). Very often the bond is negotiable, that is, the ownership of the instrument can be transferred in the secondary market. This means that once the transfer agents at the bank medallion stamp the bond, it is highly liquid on the secondary market.<ref>[http://www.moneycontrol.com/pehlakadam/bonds.php Bonds], accessed: 2012-06-08</ref>\n\nThus a bond is a form of [[loan]] or [[IOU]]: the ''holder'' of the bond is the lender (creditor), the ''issuer'' of the bond is the borrower (debtor), and the ''coupon'' is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term [[investment]]s, or, in the case of [[government bond]]s, to finance current expenditure. [[certificate of deposit|Certificates of deposit]] (CDs) or short-term [[commercial paper]] are considered{{by whom|date=July 2017}} to be [[money market]] instruments and not bonds: the main difference is the length of the term of the instrument.\n\nBonds and [[stock]]s are both [[security (finance)|securities]], but the major difference between the two is that (capital) stockholders have an [[Equity (finance)|equity]] stake in a company (that is, they are owners), whereas bondholders have a creditor stake in the company (that is, they are lenders). Being a creditor, bondholders have priority over stockholders. This means they will be repaid in advance of stockholders, but will rank behind [[secured creditor|secured creditors]], in the event of bankruptcy.<ref>\n[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/absolutepriority.asp Absolute Priority], accessed: 2013-10-8\n</ref>\nAnother difference is that bonds usually have a defined term, or maturity, after which the bond is redeemed, whereas stocks typically remain outstanding indefinitely. An exception is an irredeemable bond, such as a [[Consol (bond)|consol]], which is a [[perpetuity]], that is, a bond with no maturity.\n\n==Etymology==\nIn  [[English language|English]], the word \"{{linktext|bond}}\" relates to the etymology of \"bind\". In the sense \"instrument binding one to pay a sum to another\", use of the word \"bond\" dates from at least the 1590s.<ref>\n{{OEtymD|bond|accessdate=2017-07-23}}\n</ref>\n\n==Issuance==\nBonds are issued by public authorities, credit institutions, companies and [[Supranational union|supranational]] institutions in the [[primary market]]s. The most common process for issuing bonds is through [[underwriting]]. When a bond issue is underwritten, one or more securities firms or banks, forming a [[syndicate]], buy the entire issue of bonds from the issuer and re-sell them to investors. The security firm takes the risk of being unable to sell on the issue to end investors. Primary issuance is arranged by ''[[bookrunner]]s'' who arrange the bond issue, have direct contact with investors and act as advisers to the bond issuer in terms of timing and price of the bond issue. The bookrunner is listed first among all underwriters participating in the issuance in the [[tombstone (advertising)|tombstone ads]] commonly used to announce bonds to the public.  The bookrunners' willingness to underwrite must be discussed prior to any decision on the terms of the bond issue as there may be limited demand for the bonds.\n\nIn contrast, government bonds are usually issued in an auction. In some cases, both members of the public and banks may bid for bonds. In other cases, only market makers may bid for bonds. The [[Yield to maturity|overall rate of return]] on the bond depends on both the terms of the bond and the price paid.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts/Operations |title=UK Debt Management Office |publisher=Dmo.gov.uk |accessdate=2012-03-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404181639/http://www.dmo.gov.uk/index.aspx?page=Gilts%2FOperations |archive-date=2012-04-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The terms of the bond, such as the coupon, are fixed in advance and the price is determined by the market.\n\nIn the case of an underwritten bond, the underwriters will charge a fee for underwriting. An alternative process for bond issuance, which is commonly used for smaller issues and avoids this cost, is the private placement bond. Bonds sold directly to buyers may not be tradeable in the [[bond market]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.housingfinance.com/ahf/articles/2005/march/bond1.html |title=Affordable Housing Finance |publisher=Housingfinance.com |accessdate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Tap}}Historically an alternative practice of issuance was for the borrowing government authority to issue bonds over a period of time, usually at a fixed price, with volumes sold on a particular day dependent on market conditions. This was called a ''tap issue'' or ''bond tap''.<ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tap_issue.asp Tap issue] at ''[[Investopedia]]''</ref>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Principal===\n[[File:1978 $1000 8 3-8% Treasury Bond (reverse).jpg|thumb|upright=1|1978 $1,000 U.S. Treasury Bond]]\nNominal, principal, par, or face amount is the amount on which the issuer pays interest, and which, most commonly, has to be repaid at the end of the term. Some structured bonds can have a redemption amount which is different from the face amount and can be linked to the performance of particular assets.\n\n===Maturity===\nThe issuer has to repay the nominal amount on the [[Maturity (finance)|maturity]] date. As long as all due payments have been made, the issuer has no further obligations to the bond holders after the maturity date. The length of time until the maturity date is often referred to as the term or tenor or maturity of a bond. The maturity can be any length of time, although debt securities with a term of less than one year are generally designated money market instruments rather than bonds. Most bonds have a term of up to 30 years. Some bonds have been issued with terms of 50 years or more, and historically there have been some issues with no maturity date (irredeemable). In the market for United States Treasury securities, there are three categories of bond maturities:\n* short term (bills): maturities between zero to one year;\n* medium term (notes): maturities between one to ten years;\n* long term (bonds): maturities between ten to thirty years;\n* Perpetual: which has no maturity Period.\n\n===Coupon===\nThe [[Coupon (bond)|coupon]] is the interest rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout the life of the bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as [[LIBOR]], or it can be even more exotic. The name \"coupon\" arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest payment. On the due dates the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for the interest payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.\n[[File:Vereinigte Ostindische Compagnie bond - Middelburg - Amsterdam - 1622.jpg|thumb|right|Bond issued by the [[Dutch East India Company]] in 1623]]\n\n===Yield===\nThe yield is the rate of return received from investing in the bond. It usually refers either to\n* The [[current yield]], or running yield, which is simply the annual interest payment divided by the current market price of the bond (often the [[clean price]]).\n* The [[yield to maturity]], or redemption yield, which is a more useful measure of the return of the bond. This takes into account the current market price, and the amount and timing of all remaining coupon payments and of the repayment due on maturity. It is equivalent to the [[internal rate of return]] of a bond.\n\n===Credit quality===\nThe quality of the issue refers to the probability that the bondholders will receive the amounts promised at the due dates. In other words, credit quality tells investors how likely the borrower is going to default. This will depend on a wide range of factors.\n[[High-yield bond]]s are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield. These bonds are also called ''junk bonds''.\n\n===Market price===\nThe market price of a tradable bond will be influenced, amongst other factors, by the amounts, currency and timing of the interest payments and capital repayment due, the quality of the bond, and the available redemption yield of other comparable bonds which can be traded in the markets.\n\nThe price can be quoted as [[clean price|clean]] or [[dirty price|dirty]]. \"Dirty\" includes the present value of all future cash flows, including accrued interest, and is most often used in Europe. \"Clean\" does not include accrued interest, and is most often used in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dirtyprice.asp|title=Dirty Price|work=Investopedia|accessdate=8 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe issue price at which investors buy the bonds when they are first issued will typically be approximately equal to the nominal amount. The net proceeds that the issuer receives are thus the issue price, less issuance fees. The market price of the bond will vary over its life: it may trade at a premium (above par, usually because market interest rates have fallen since issue), or at a discount (price below par, if market rates have risen or there is a high [[probability of default]] on the bond).\n\n===Others===\n* Indentures and Covenants \u2014 An [[indenture]] is a formal debt agreement that establishes the terms of a bond issue, while covenants are the clauses of such an agreement. Covenants specify the rights of bondholders and the duties of issuers, such as actions that the issuer is obligated to perform or is prohibited from performing. In the U.S., federal and state securities and commercial laws apply to the enforcement of these agreements, which are construed by courts as contracts between issuers and bondholders.  The terms may be changed only with great difficulty while the bonds are outstanding, with amendments to the governing document generally requiring approval by a [[majority]] (or [[Supermajority|super-majority]]) vote of the bondholders.\n* Optionality: Occasionally a bond may contain an [[embedded option]]; that is, it grants [[option (finance)|option-like]] features to the holder or the issuer:\n** Callability \u2014 Some bonds give the issuer the right to repay the bond before the maturity date on the call dates; see [[call option]]. These bonds are referred to as [[callable bond]]s. Most callable bonds allow the issuer to repay the bond at [[Par value|par]]. With some bonds, the issuer has to pay a premium, the so-called call premium. This is mainly the case for high-yield bonds. These have very strict covenants, restricting the issuer in its operations. To be free from these covenants, the issuer can repay the bonds early, but only at a high cost.\n** Puttability \u2014 Some bonds give the holder the right to force the issuer to repay the bond before the maturity date on the put dates; see [[put option]]. These are referred to as retractable or [[putable bond]]s.\n** Call dates and put dates\u2014the [[option style|dates]] on which callable and putable bonds can be redeemed early. There are four main categories:\n*** A Bermudan callable has several call dates, usually coinciding with coupon dates.\n*** A European callable has only one call date. This is a special case of a Bermudan callable.\n*** An American callable can be called at any time until the maturity date.\n*** A death put is an optional redemption feature on a debt instrument allowing the beneficiary of the estate of a deceased bondholder to put (sell) the bond back to the issuer at face value in the event of the bondholder's death or legal incapacitation. This is also known as a \"survivor's option\".\n** [[Sinking fund]] provision of the corporate bond indenture requires a certain portion of the issue to be retired periodically. The entire bond issue can be liquidated by the maturity date; if not, the remainder is called balloon maturity. Issuers may either pay to trustees, which in turn call randomly selected bonds in the issue, or, alternatively, purchase bonds in open market, then return them to trustees.\n*** Bonds are often identified by its international securities identification number, or [[International Securities Identification Number|ISIN]], which is a 12 digit alphanumeric code that uniquely identifies debt securities.\n\n==Types==\n[[File:South Carolina consolidation bond.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Bond certificate for the state of South Carolina issued in 1873 under the state's Consolidation Act.]]\n[[File:Obligatie-Moskau-Kiev-Woronesch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Railroad obligation of the Moscow-Kiev-Voronezh railroad company, printed in Russian, Dutch and German.]]\n\nThe following descriptions are not mutually exclusive, and more than one of them may apply to a particular bond:\n\n* [[Fixed rate bond]]s have a coupon that remains constant throughout the life of the bond. A variation are stepped-coupon bonds, whose coupon increases during the life of the bond.\n* [[Floating rate note]]s (FRNs, floaters) have a variable coupon that is linked to a [[reference rate]] of interest, such as [[Libor]] or [[Euribor]].  For example, the coupon may be defined as three-month USD LIBOR + 0.20%. The coupon rate is recalculated periodically, typically every one or three months.\n* [[Zero-coupon bond]]s (zeros) pay no regular interest. They are issued at a substantial discount to [[par value]], so that the interest is effectively rolled up to maturity (and usually taxed as such). The bondholder receives the full principal amount on the redemption date. An example of zero coupon bonds is Series E savings bonds issued by the U.S. government<!-- are these traded securities?--->. [[Zero-coupon bond]]s may be created from fixed rate bonds by a financial institution separating (\"stripping off\") the coupons from the principal. In other words, the separated coupons and the final principal payment of the bond may be traded separately.  See IO (Interest Only) and PO (Principal Only).\n* [[High-yield bond]]s (junk bonds) are bonds that are rated below investment grade by the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]]. As these bonds are riskier than investment grade bonds, investors expect to earn a higher yield.\n* [[Convertible bond]]s let a bondholder exchange a bond to a number of shares of the issuer's common stock. These are known as [[Hybrid security|hybrid securities]], because they combine [[Equity (finance)|equity]] and [[debt]] features.\n* [[Exchangeable bond]]s allows for exchange to shares of a corporation other than the issuer.\n* [[Inflation-indexed bond]]s (linkers) (US) or Index-linked bond (UK), in which the principal amount and the interest payments are indexed to inflation. The interest rate is normally lower than for fixed rate bonds with a comparable maturity (this position briefly reversed itself for short-term UK bonds in December 2008). However, as the principal amount grows, the payments increase with inflation. The [[United Kingdom]] was the first sovereign issuer to issue inflation linked [[Gilt-edged securities|gilts]] in the 1980s. [[Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities]] (TIPS) and [[Treasury security#Series I|I-bonds]] are examples of inflation linked bonds issued by the U.S. government.\n[[File:Receipt for temporary bonds.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Receipt for temporary bonds for the state of Kansas issued in 1922]]\n* Other indexed bonds, for example [[equity-linked note]]s and bonds indexed on a business indicator (income, added value) or on a country's [[GDP]].\n* [[Asset-backed security|Asset-backed securities]] are bonds whose interest and principal payments are backed by underlying cash flows from other assets. Examples of asset-backed securities are [[mortgage-backed security|mortgage-backed securities]] (MBSs), [[collateralized mortgage obligation]]s (CMOs) and [[collateralized debt obligation]]s (CDOs).\n* [[Subordinated debt|Subordinated bonds]] are those that have a lower priority than other bonds of the issuer in case of [[liquidation]]. In case of bankruptcy, there is a hierarchy of creditors. First the [[liquidator (law)|liquidator]] is paid, then government taxes, etc. The first bond holders in line to be paid are those holding what is called senior bonds. After they have been paid, the subordinated bond holders are paid. As a result, the risk is higher. Therefore, subordinated bonds usually have a lower credit rating than senior bonds. The main examples of subordinated bonds can be found in bonds issued by banks, and asset-backed securities. The latter are often issued in [[tranche]]s. The senior tranches get paid back first, the subordinated tranches later.\n* [[Covered bond]]s are backed by cash flows from mortgages or public sector assets. Contrary to [[Asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]] the assets for such bonds remain on the issuers balance sheet.\n* [[Perpetual bond]]s are also often called [[Perpetuity|perpetuities]] or 'Perps'. They have no maturity date. The most famous of these are the UK Consols, which are also known as Treasury Annuities or Undated Treasuries. Some of these were issued back in 1888 and still trade today, although the amounts are now insignificant. Some ultra-long-term bonds (sometimes a bond can last centuries: West Shore Railroad issued a bond which matures in 2361 (i.e. 24th century)) are virtually perpetuities from a financial point of view, with the current value of principal near zero.\n* The ''Methuselah'' is a type of bond with a maturity of 50-years or longer.<ref>https://www.ledevoir.com/economie/561203/obligations-quand-les-etats-sont-tentes-par-la-dette-mathusalem , talking about 100-year maturity bonds.</ref> The term is a reference to [[Methuselah]], the oldest person whose age is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The issuance in Methuselahs has been increasing in recent years due to demand for longer-dated assets from [[pension]] plans, particularly in [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Issuance of Methuselahs in the [[United States]] has been limited, however, as the [[U.S. Treasury]] does not currently issue [[Treasury security|Treasuries]] with maturities beyond 30 years, which would serve as a reference level for any [[corporate debt|corporate]] issuance.\n* [[Bearer bond]] is an official certificate issued without a named holder. In other words, the person who has the paper certificate can claim the value of the bond. Often they are registered by a number to prevent counterfeiting, but may be traded like cash. Bearer bonds are very risky because they can be lost or stolen. Especially after federal income tax began in the United States, bearer bonds were seen as an opportunity to conceal income or assets.<ref>Eason, Yla (June 6, 1983). \"Final Surge in Bearer Bonds\" ''New York Times''.</ref>  U.S. corporations stopped issuing bearer bonds in the 1960s, the U.S. Treasury stopped in 1982, and state and local tax-exempt bearer bonds were prohibited in 1983.<ref>Quint, Michael (August 14, 1984). \"Elements in Bearer Bond Issue\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* Registered bond is a bond whose ownership (and any subsequent purchaser) is recorded by the issuer, or by a transfer agent.  It is the alternative to a [[Bearer bond]].  Interest payments, and the principal upon maturity are sent to the registered owner.\n* A [[government bond]], also called Treasury bond, is issued by a national government and is not exposed to default risk. It is characterized as the safest bond, with the lowest interest rate. A treasury bond is backed by the \u201cfull faith and credit\u201d of the relevant government. For that reason, for the major OECD countries this type of bond is often referred to as risk-free.\n* A [[supranational bond]] also known as a \"supra\" is issued by a [[Supranational union|supranational organisation]] like the [[World Bank]]. They are have very good credit rating like government bonds.\n* [[File:San Francisco Pacific Railroad Bond WPRR 1865.jpg|thumb|right|'''Pacific Railroad Bond''' issued by City and County of San Francisco, CA. May 1, 1865]] [[Municipal bond]] is a bond issued by a state, U.S. Territory, city, local government, or their agencies. Interest income received by holders of municipal bonds is [[tax advantage|exempt]] from the federal [[income tax]] and sometimes from the income tax of the state in which they are issued, although municipal bonds issued for certain purposes may not be tax exempt. Municipal bonds issued in U.S. territories are exempted from all federal, state, and local taxes, making them triple-exempted. \n* Build America Bonds (BABs) are a form of [[municipal bond]] authorized by the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]]. Unlike traditional US municipal bonds, which are usually tax exempt, interest received on BABs is subject to federal taxation. However, as with municipal bonds, the bond is tax-exempt within the US state where it is issued. Generally, BABs offer significantly higher yields (over 7 percent) than standard municipal bonds.<ref>{{cite web | author=Benjamin Shepherd | title=A Slice of the Pie | url=http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | publisher=InvestingDaily.com | accessdate=2010-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713052252/http://www.investingdaily.com/ruk/18220/a-slice-of-the-pie.html | archive-date=2011-07-13 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* Book-entry bond is a bond that does not have a paper certificate.  As physically processing paper bonds and interest coupons became more expensive, issuers (and banks that used to collect coupon interest for depositors) have tried to discourage their use.  Some book-entry bond issues do not offer the option of a paper certificate, even to investors who prefer them.<ref>no byline (July 18, 1984). \"Book Entry Bonds Popular\". ''New York Times''.</ref>\n* [[Lottery Bond|Lottery bonds]] are issued by European and other states. Interest is paid as on a traditional fixed rate bond, but the issuer will redeem randomly selected individual bonds within the issue according to a schedule. Some of these redemptions will be for a higher value than the face value of the bond.\n* [[War bond]] is a bond issued by a government to fund military operations during wartime. This type of bond has low return rate.\n* [[Serial bond]] is a bond that matures in installments over a period of time. In effect, a $100,000, 5-year serial bond would mature in a $20,000 annuity over a 5-year interval.\n* [[Revenue bond]] is a special type of municipal bond distinguished by its guarantee of repayment solely from revenues generated by a specified revenue-generating entity associated with the purpose of the bonds. Revenue bonds are typically \"non-recourse\", meaning that in the event of default, the bond holder has no recourse to other governmental assets or revenues.\n* [[Climate bond]] is a bond issued by a government or corporate entity in order to raise finance for climate change mitigation- or adaptation-related projects or programmes.\n* Dual currency bonds <ref>[http://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dual-currency-bond.asp Dual currency bond], accessed 2012-06-08.</ref>\n* Retail bonds are a type of corporate bond mostly designed for ordinary investors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |accessdate=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209161432/http://www.cfo-insight.com/financing-liquidity/loans-and-bonds/enquest-cfo-swinney-on-issuing-first-industrial-retail-bond/ |archivedate=February 9, 2013 }}</ref> They have become particularly attractive since the [[London Stock Exchange]] (LSE) launched an [[order book for retail bonds]].<ref>http://www.hedgefundonline.com/</ref>\n* [[Social impact bond]]s are an agreement for public sector entities to pay back private investors after meeting verified improved social outcome goals that result in public sector savings from innovative social program pilot projects.\n\n===Foreign currencies===\nSome companies, banks, governments, and other sovereign entities may decide to issue bonds in foreign currencies as it may appear to be more stable and predictable than their domestic currency.\nIssuing bonds denominated in foreign currencies also gives issuers the ability to access investment capital available in foreign markets. The proceeds from the issuance of these bonds can be used by companies to break into foreign markets, or can be converted into the issuing company's local currency to be used on existing operations through the use of foreign exchange swap hedges. Foreign issuer bonds can also be used to hedge foreign exchange rate risk. Some foreign issuer bonds are called by their nicknames, such as the \"samurai bond\". These can be issued by foreign issuers looking to diversify their investor base away from domestic markets. These bond issues are generally governed by the law of the market of issuance, e.g., a samurai bond, issued by an investor based in Europe, will be governed by Japanese law. Not all of the following bonds are restricted for purchase by investors in the market of issuance.\n* [[Eurodollar]] bond, a U.S. dollar-denominated bond issued by a non-[[United States entity|U.S. entity]] outside the U.S<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.riskglossary.com/link/eurodollar_deposit.htm|title=Eurodollar deposit|accessdate=2009-01-05|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081226012306/http://www.riskglossary.com/link/eurodollar_deposit.htm|archivedate=2008-12-26}}</ref>\n* [[Baklava bond]], a bond denominated in Turkish Lira and issued by a domestic or foreign entity in the Turkish market<ref>{{cite book|last=Memili|first=\u00dcmit|title=Baklava Bonds: Sweet Margins in Turkey.

That relationship is the definition of the redemption yield on the bond, which is likely to be close to the current market interest rate for other bonds with similar characteristics, as otherwise there would be [[arbitrage]] opportunities. The yield and price of a bond are inversely related so that when market interest rates rise, bond prices fall and vice versa. For a discussion of the mathematics see [[Bond valuation]].\n\nThe bond's market price is usually expressed as a percentage of nominal value: 100% of face value, \"at par\", corresponds to a price of 100;  prices can be above par (bond is priced at greater than 100), which is called trading at a premium, or below par (bond is priced at less than 100), which is called trading at a discount.  The [[market price]] of a bond may be quoted including the [[accrued interest]] since the last coupon date. (Some bond markets include accrued interest in the trading price and others add it on separately when settlement is made.) The price including accrued interest is known as the \"full\" or \"[[dirty price]]\". (''See also'' [[Accrual bond]].) The price excluding accrued interest is known as the \"flat\" or \"[[clean price]]\".\n\nMost government bonds are denominated in units of $1000 in the [[United States]], or in units of \u00a3100 in the [[United Kingdom]]. Hence, a deep discount US bond, selling at a price of 75.26, indicates a selling price of $752.60 per bond sold. (Often, in the US, bond prices are quoted in points and thirty-seconds of a point, rather than in decimal form.)  Some short-term bonds, such as the [[United States Treasury security#Treasury bill|U.S. Treasury bill]], are always issued at a discount, and pay par amount at maturity rather than paying coupons. This is called a discount bond.\n\nBonds are not necessarily issued at par (100% of face value, corresponding to a price of 100), but bond prices will move towards par as they approach maturity (if the market expects the maturity payment to be made in full and on time) as this is the price the issuer will pay to redeem the bond. This is referred to as \"[[pull to par]]\".  At the time of issue of the bond, the coupon paid, and other conditions of the bond, will have been influenced by a variety of factors, such as current market interest rates, the length of the term and the creditworthiness of the issuer. These factors are likely to change over time, so the market price of a bond will vary after it is issued.\n\nThe interest payment (\"coupon payment\") divided by the current price of the bond is called the [[current yield]] (this is the [[nominal yield]] multiplied by the par value and divided by the price). There are other yield measures that exist such as the yield to first call, yield to worst, yield to first par call, yield to put, cash flow yield and yield to maturity. The relationship between yield and term to maturity (or alternatively between yield and the weighted mean term allowing for both interest and capital repayment) for otherwise identical bonds derives the [[yield curve]], a graph plotting this relationship.\n\nIf the bond includes [[embedded option]]s, the valuation is more difficult and combines [[option pricing]] with discounting.  Depending on the type of option, the [[option premium|option price]] as calculated is either added to or subtracted from the price of the \"straight\" portion. See further under [[Bond option #Embedded options]]. This total is then the value of the bond.  More sophisticated [[Lattice_model_(finance)#Hybrid_securities|lattice-]] or [[Monte Carlo methods for option pricing|simulation-based techniques]] may (also) be employed. \n\nBond markets, unlike stock or share markets, sometimes do not have a centralized exchange or trading system. Rather, in most developed [[bond market]]s such as the U.S., Japan and western Europe, bonds trade in decentralized, dealer-based [[over-the-counter (finance)|over-the-counter]] markets. In such a market, [[market liquidity]] is provided by dealers and other market participants committing risk capital to trading activity. In the bond market, when an investor buys or sells a bond, the [[counterparty]] to the trade is almost always a bank or securities firm acting as a dealer. In some cases, when a dealer buys a bond from an investor, the dealer carries the bond \"in inventory\", i.e. holds it for their own account. The dealer is then subject to risks of price fluctuation. In other cases, the dealer immediately resells the bond to another investor.\n\nBond markets can also differ from stock markets in that, in some markets, investors sometimes do not pay brokerage commissions to dealers with whom they buy or sell bonds. Rather, the dealers earn revenue by means of the spread, or difference, between the price at which the dealer buys a bond from one investor\u2014the \"bid\" price\u2014and the price at which he or she sells the same bond to another investor\u2014the \"ask\" or \"offer\" price. The [[Bid\u2013ask spread|bid/offer spread]] represents the total [[transaction cost]] associated with transferring a bond from one investor to another.\n\n==Investing in bonds==\nBonds are bought and traded mostly by institutions like [[central bank]]s, [[sovereign wealth fund]]s, [[pension fund]]s, [[insurance companies]], [[hedge fund]]s, and [[bank]]s. Insurance companies and pension funds have liabilities which essentially include fixed amounts payable on predetermined dates. They buy the bonds to match their liabilities, and may be compelled by law to do this. Most individuals who want to own bonds do so through [[bond fund]]s. Still, in the U.S., nearly 10% of all bonds outstanding are held directly by households.\n\nThe volatility of bonds (especially short and medium dated bonds) is lower than that of equities (stocks). Thus, bonds are generally viewed as safer investments than [[stock]]s, but this perception is only partially correct. Bonds do suffer from less day-to-day volatility than stocks, and bonds' interest payments are sometimes higher than the general level of [[dividend]] payments. Bonds are often liquid \u2013 it is often fairly easy for an institution to sell a large quantity of bonds without affecting the price much, which may be more difficult for equities \u2013 and the comparative certainty of a fixed interest payment twice a year and a fixed lump sum at maturity is attractive.  Bondholders also enjoy a measure of legal protection: under the law of most countries, if a company goes [[bankruptcy|bankrupt]], its bondholders will often receive some money back (the [[recovery amount]]), whereas the company's equity stock often ends up valueless. However, bonds can also be risky but less risky than stocks:\n* Fixed rate bonds are subject to ''[[interest rate risk]]'', meaning that their market prices will decrease in value when the generally prevailing interest rates rise. Since the payments are fixed, a decrease in the market price of the bond means an increase in its yield. When the market interest rate rises, the [[market price]] of bonds will fall, reflecting investors' ability to get a higher interest rate on their money elsewhere \u2014 perhaps by purchasing a newly issued bond that already features the newly higher interest rate. This does not affect the interest payments to the bondholder, so long-term investors who want a specific amount at the maturity date do not need to worry about price swings in their bonds and do not suffer from interest rate risk.\n\nBonds are also subject to various other risks such as call and [[Prepayment of loan|prepayment]] risk, [[credit risk]], [[reinvestment risk]], [[liquidity risk]], [[event risk]], [[foreign exchange risk|exchange rate risk]], [[volatility risk]], [[inflation risk]], [[Credit risk#Sovereign risk|sovereign risk]] and [[Interest rate risk#Banks and interest rate risk|yield curve risk]]. Again, some of these will only affect certain classes of investors.\n\nPrice changes in a bond will immediately affect [[mutual fund]]s that hold these bonds. If the value of the bonds in their trading [[portfolio (finance)|portfolio]] falls, the value of the portfolio also falls. This can be damaging for professional investors such as banks, insurance companies, pension funds and asset managers (irrespective of whether the value is immediately \"[[Mark-to-market accounting|marked to market]]\" or not).\nIf there is any chance a holder of individual bonds may need to sell their bonds and \"cash out\", [[interest rate risk]] could become a real problem (conversely, bonds' market prices would increase if the prevailing interest rate were to drop, as it did from 2001 through 2003. One way to quantify the interest rate risk on a bond is in terms of its [[Macaulay Duration|duration]]. Efforts to control this risk are called [[immunization (finance)|immunization]] or [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]].\n* Bond prices can become volatile depending on the credit rating of the issuer \u2013 for instance if the [[credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] like [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] upgrade or downgrade the credit rating of the issuer. An unanticipated downgrade will cause the market price of the bond to fall. As with interest rate risk, this risk does not affect the bond's interest payments (provided the issuer does not actually default), but puts at risk the market price, which affects mutual funds holding these bonds, and holders of individual bonds who may have to sell them.\n* A company's bondholders may lose much or all their money if the company goes [[bankrupt]].  Under the laws of many countries (including the United States and Canada), bondholders are in line to receive the proceeds of the sale of the assets of a liquidated company ahead of some other creditors. Bank lenders, deposit holders (in the case of a deposit taking institution such as a bank) and trade creditors may take precedence.\nThere is no guarantee of how much money will remain to repay bondholders. As an example, after an accounting scandal and a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy at the giant telecommunications company [[MCI Inc.|Worldcom]], in 2004 its bondholders ended up being paid 35.7 cents on the dollar.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/washington/stories/2003/06/16/daily13.html|title=More worthless WorldCom stock\n|website=bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-02-09}}</ref> In a bankruptcy involving reorganization or recapitalization, as opposed to liquidation, bondholders may end up having the value of their bonds reduced, often through an exchange for a smaller number of newly issued bonds.\n* Some bonds are callable, meaning that even though the company has agreed to make payments plus interest towards the debt for a certain period of time, the company can choose to pay off the bond early. This creates [[reinvestment risk]], meaning the investor is forced to find a new place for their money, and the investor might not be able to find as good a deal, especially because this usually happens when interest rates are falling.\n\n===Bond indices===\n{{See also|Bond market index}}\nA number of bond indices exist for the purposes of managing portfolios and measuring performance, similar to the [[S&P 500]] or [[Russell Indexes]] for [[stock]]s. The most common American benchmarks are the [[Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index|Bloomberg Barclays US Aggregate]] (ex Lehman Aggregate), [[Citigroup BIG]] and [[Merrill Lynch Domestic Master]]. Most indices are parts of families of broader indices that can be used to measure global bond portfolios, or may be further subdivided by maturity or sector for managing specialized portfolios.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Bond credit rating]]\n* [[Collective action clause]]\n* [[Debenture]]\n* [[Deferred financing costs]]\n* [[GDP-linked bond]]\n* [[Government bond]]/[[Sovereign bonds]]\n* [[Immunization (finance)]]\n* [[Promissory note]]\n* [[Short-rate model]]\n* [[Penal bond]]\n* [[Structured note]]\n\n'''Market specific'''\n* [[Brady Bonds]]\n* [[Build America Bonds]]\n* [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]\n\n'''General'''\n* [[Fixed income]]\n* [[List of accounting topics]]\n* [[List of economics topics]]\n* [[List of finance topics]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Bonds}}\n* {{dmoz|Business/Investing/Stocks_and_Bonds/Bonds/|Bonds links}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20160305133558/https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2012/november/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill/estate-planner-victimized-terminally-ill Estate planner victimized terminally ill], [[FBI]]\n\n{{Prone to spam|date=March 2012}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should it be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be deleted.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] & [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there  using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n\n{{Bond market}}\n{{Corporate finance and investment banking |state=collapsed}}\n{{Debt}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bond (Finance)}}\n[[Category:Bonds (finance)| ]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: between zero to \u2192 between zero and (3)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bond_(finance)"}

Filmed in [[Northwest China]] and [[Inner Mongolia]], the show was produced by [[Nippon TV]] and [[International Television Films]] in association with [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), and broadcast from 1978 to 1980 on Nippon TV.\n\n== Release ==\nTwo 26-episode seasons ran in Japan: the first season ran from October 1978 to April 1979, and the second one from November 1979 to May 1980, with screenwriters including [[Mamoru Sasaki]], [[Isao Okishima]], [[Tetsur\u014d Abe]], [[Kei Tasaka]], [[James Miki]], [[Motomu Furuta]], [[Hiroichi Fuse]], [[Y\u016b Tagami]], and [[Fumio Ishimori]].\n\n''Saiy\u016bki'' was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into English from 1979, with dialogue written by [[David Weir (writer)|David Weir]]. The dubbed version was broadcast under the name ''Monkey'' and broadcast in the United Kingdom by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]], in New Zealand by [[Television New Zealand]] and in Australia by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Only 39 of the original 52 episodes were originally dubbed and broadcast by the BBC: all 26 of series 1 and 13 of series 2. In 2004, the remaining 13 episodes were dubbed by [[Fabulous Films Ltd]] using the original [[voice acting]] cast, following a successful release of the English-dubbed series on VHS and DVD; later, these newly dubbed episodes were broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in the UK.\n\nA Spanish-dubbed version of ''Monkey'' aired in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic in the early 1980s. While the BBC-dubbed ''Monkey'' never received a broadcast in the United States, the original Japanese-language version, ''Saiy\u016bki'', was shown on local Japanese-language television stations in California and Hawaii in the early 1980s.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{nihongo|'''[[Sun Wukong|Monkey]]'''|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a|Son Gok\u016b}}, the title character, is described in the theme song as being \"born from an egg on a mountain top\"; a stone egg and thus he is a stone monkey, a skilled fighter who becomes a brash king of a monkey tribe, who, the song goes on to claim, was \"the punkiest monkey that ever popped\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeyheaven.com/music_mmlyrics.html|title=Monkey Music -  Lyrics of \"Magic Monkey\" CD by Godiego|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> He achieved a little [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and proclaimed himself \"Great Sage, Equal of Heaven\".<ref>Episode 1, \"Monkey Gets Wild About Heaven.\"</ref> After demanding the \"gift\" of [[Ru Yi Bang|a magical staff]] from a powerful [[Dragon King of the East Sea|Dragon king]], and to quiet the din of his rough antics on Earth, Monkey is approached by [[Heaven]] to join their host, first in the lowly position of Master of the Stable (manure disposal), and then&mdash;after his riotous complaints&mdash;as \"Keeper of the Peach Garden of Immortality\". Monkey eats many of the peaches, which have taken millennia to ripen, becomes immortal and runs amok. Having earned the ire of Heaven and being beaten in a challenge by an omniscient, mighty, but benevolent, cloud-dwelling {{nihongo|'''[[Tath\u0101gata|Buddha]]'''|\u91c8\u8fe6\u5982\u6765|Shakanyorai}}, Monkey is imprisoned for 500 years under a mountain in order to learn patience.\n\nEventually, Monkey is released by the monk {{nihongo|'''[[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]]'''|\u4e09\u8535\u6cd5\u5e2b|Sanz\u014dh\u014dshi}}, who has been tasked by the {{nihongo|'''[[Boddhisatva]] [[Guanyin]]'''|\u89b3\u4e16\u97f3\u83e9\u85a9|Kanzeon Bosatsu}} to undertake a pilgrimage from China to India to fetch holy scriptures. The pair soon recruit two former members of the Heavenly Host who were cast out and turned from angels to \"monsters\" as a result of Monkey's transgressions: {{nihongo|'''[[Sha Wujing|Sandy]]'''|\u6c99\u609f\u6d44|Sa Goj\u014d}}, the water monster and ex-cannibal, expelled from Heaven after his interference caused Heaven's {{nihongo|[[Jade Emperor]]'s|\u5929\u5e1d|Tentei|[[Shangdi]]}} precious jade cup to be broken, and {{nihongo|'''[[Zhu Bajie|Pigsy]]'''|\u732a\u516b\u6212|Cho Hakkai}}, a pig monster consumed with lust and gluttony, who was expelled from Heaven after harassing the Star Princess [[Chang'e|Vega]]&mdash;the [[Jade Emperor]]'s mistress&mdash;for a kiss. A dragon, {{nihongo|'''Yu Lung'''|\u7389\u9f8d|Gyokury\u016b}}, who was set free by Guanyin after being sentenced to death, eats Tripitaka's horse. On discovering that the horse was tasked with carrying Tripitaka, it assumes the horse's shape to carry the monk on his journey. Later in the story he occasionally assumes human form to assist his new master, although he is still always referred to as \"Horse\". Monkey can also change form, for instance into a [[hornet]]. In Episode 3, ''The Great Journey Begins'', Monkey transforms into a girl to trick Pigsy. Monkey's other magic powers include: summoning a cloud upon which he can fly; his use of the magic wishing staff which he can shrink and grow at will and from time to time, when shrunk, store in his ear, and which he uses as a weapon; and the ability to conjure monkey warriors by blowing on hairs plucked from his chest.\n\nThe pilgrims face many perils and antagonists both human, such as {{nihongo|[[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]|\u592a\u5b97\u7687\u5e1d|Tais\u014dk\u014dtei}} and supernatural. Monkey, Sandy, and Pigsy are often called upon to battle demons, monsters, and bandits, despite Tripitaka's constant call for peace. Many episodes also feature some moral lesson, usually based upon [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and/or [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophies, which are elucidated by the narrator at the end of various scenes.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe songs in the series were performed by the five-piece Japanese band [[Godiego]]. In Japan, the first series' ending theme {{nihongo|\"[[Gandhara (song)|Gandhara]]\"|\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30e9|Gand\u0101ra}}, which was named after the ancient kingdom of [[Gandhara]], was released by [[Columbia Music Entertainment]] on 1 October 1978, backed with \"Celebration\". This was followed by the release of the opening theme \"[[Monkey Magic (song)|Monkey Magic]]\" on 25 December 1978, with \"A Fool\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Godiego also released the soundtrack album ''[[Magic Monkey]]'' on 25 October 1978, comprising all of the songs that the band had composed for the first series. The album became one of the group's highest charting releases, staying at #1 on the [[Oricon]] chart for a total of eight weeks from January through March 1979 (it was unseated for most of January by the Japanese release of ''[[Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture]]''), and it was ultimately the #1 LP for 1979. For the second series, the ending theme of \"Gandhara\" was replaced with \"[[Holy and Bright]]\", which was released on 1 October 1979 (the two sides of the single featured a Japanese-language version on one side and an English-language version on the other).\n\nIn the UK, BBC Records released \"Gandhara\" as a single in 1979 (RESL 66), with \"The Birth of the Odyssey\" and \"Monkey Magic\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Godiego - Gandhara single|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Godiego-Gandhara/release/594248|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>  The single reached #56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], eventually spending a total of seven weeks on the chart.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brown, Tony.|page=357|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8}}</ref>  A second BBC single was released in 1980 (RESL 81), this time featuring an edited version of \"Monkey Magic\", along with \"Gandhara\" and \"Thank You Baby\", but this single failed to chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Godiego - Monkey Magic single|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Godiego-Monkey-Magic/release/212046|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>  The BBC releases of \"Gandhara\" have one verse sung in Japanese and the other in English. BBC Records also released the ''Magic Monkey'' album under the simplified title of ''Monkey'' (REB 384) in 1980 but it failed to chart.\n\n[[Masaaki Sakai]], who plays Monkey in the series, also performed several of the songs for the series: \"SONGOKU\", {{nihongo|\"Ima de wa Oso Sugiru\"|\u4eca\u3067\u306f\u9045\u3059\u304e\u308b||\"It's Too Late\"}}, {{nihongo|\"Kono Michi no Hatemademo\"|\u3053\u306e\u9053\u306e\u679c\u3066\u307e\u3067\u3082||\"To the End of the Road\"}}, a Japanese version of Godiego's \"Thank You Baby\", and {{nihongo|\"20 Oku Nen no Kurayami\"|20\u5104\u5e74\u306e\u6697\u95c7||\"Two Billion Years of Darkness\"}}.\n\n==Cult appeal==\n''Monkey'' is considered a [[cult television|cult classic]] in countries where it has been shown, reaching as far as South America. Among the features that have contributed to its cult appeal are the theme song, the dubbed dialogue spoken in a variety of over-the-top \"oriental\" accents, the reasonably good synchronization of dubbing to the actors' original dialogue, the memorable battles which were for many Western youngsters their first exposure to Asian-style fantasy action sequences, and the fact that the young priest [[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]] was played by a woman, despite being male.\n\nIn 1981, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation debuted the BBC-dubbed ''Monkey'' at 6pm on week-nights. Since then, the show has been frequently repeated on the ABC, notably during the contemporary youth TV show ''[[Recovery (TV series)|Recovery]]'' which aired episodes of ''Monkey'' weekly from 1996-2000. When ''Recovery'' was put on hiatus, it was replaced with three hours of ''Monkey''. The radio station ''[[Triple J]]'' often made references to ''Monkey'' and interviewed the original BBC voice actors on several occasions.\n\nThe British folk pop band [[Monkey Swallows the Universe]] took their name from an episode of ''Monkey''.\n\nIn an episode of the cult Channel 4 sitcom [[Spaced]], main character Tim Bisley mentions that as a child he wanted to be Monkey when he grew up.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border\n|-\n!Character\n!Actor\n!Dub actor\n!Original Chinese name\n!Japanese name\n|-\n!Tripitaka\n|[[Masako Natsume]]\n|[[Maria Warburg]]\n|[[Tang Sanzang]]\n|Sanz\u014d h\u014dshi (Genj\u014d Sanz\u014d)\n|-\n!Monkey\n|[[Masaaki Sakai]]\n|[[David Collings]]\n|[[Sun Wukong]]\n|Son Gok\u016b\n|-\n!Pigsy\n|s1: [[Toshiyuki Nishida]]<br>s2: [[Tonpei Hidari]]\n|[[Peter Woodthorpe]]\n|[[Zhu Bajie]]\n|Cho Hakkai\n|-\n!Sandy\n|[[Shiro Kishibe]]\n|[[Gareth Armstrong]]\n|[[Sha Wujing]]\n|Sa Goj\u014d\n|-\n!\"Horse\"\n|[[Shunji Fujimura]]\n|[[Andrew Sachs]]\n|[[Bai Long Ma]]\n|Gyokury\u016b\n|}\n\n== Episode list ==\n=== Series 1: 1978-79===\n\n* 01.

Filmed in [[Northwest China]] and [[Inner Mongolia]], the show was produced by [[Nippon TV]] and [[International Television Films]] in association with [[NHK]] (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), and broadcast from 1978 to 1980 on Nippon TV.\n\n== Release ==\nTwo 26-episode seasons ran in Japan: the first season ran from October 1978 to April 1979, and the second one from November 1979 to May 1980, with screenwriters including [[Mamoru Sasaki]], [[Isao Okishima]], [[Tetsur\u014d Abe]], [[Kei Tasaka]], [[James Miki]], [[Motomu Furuta]], [[Hiroichi Fuse]], [[Y\u016b Tagami]], and [[Fumio Ishimori]].\n\n''Saiy\u016bki'' was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] into English from 1979, with dialogue written by [[David Weir (writer)|David Weir]]. The dubbed version was broadcast under the name ''Monkey'' and broadcast in the United Kingdom by the [[BBC|British Broadcasting Corporation]], in New Zealand by [[Television New Zealand]] and in Australia by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]. Only 39 of the original 52 episodes were originally dubbed and broadcast by the BBC: all 26 of series 1 and 13 of series 2. In 2004, the remaining 13 episodes were dubbed by [[Fabulous Films Ltd]] using the original [[voice acting]] cast, following a successful release of the English-dubbed series on VHS and DVD; later, these newly dubbed episodes were broadcast by [[Channel 4]] in the UK.\n\nA Spanish-dubbed version of ''Monkey'' aired in Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, Argentina, Uruguay and the Dominican Republic in the early 1980s. While the BBC-dubbed ''Monkey'' never received a broadcast in the United States, the original Japanese-language version, ''Saiy\u016bki'', was shown on local Japanese-language television stations in California and Hawaii in the early 1980s.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{nihongo|'''[[Sun Wukong|Monkey]]'''|\u5b6b\u609f\u7a7a|Son Gok\u016b}}, the title character, is described in the theme song as being \"born from an egg on a mountain top\"; a stone egg and thus he is a stone monkey, a skilled fighter who becomes a brash king of a monkey tribe, who, the song goes on to claim, was \"the punkiest monkey that ever popped\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.monkeyheaven.com/music_mmlyrics.html|title=Monkey Music -  Lyrics of \"Magic Monkey\" CD by Godiego|accessdate=4 October 2015}}</ref> He achieved a little [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and proclaimed himself \"Great Sage, Equal of Heaven\".<ref>Episode 1, \"Monkey Gets Wild About Heaven.\"</ref> After demanding the \"gift\" of [[Ru Yi Bang|a magical staff]] from a powerful [[Dragon King of the East Sea|Dragon king]], and to quiet the din of his rough antics on Earth, Monkey is approached by [[Heaven]] to join their host, first in the lowly position of Master of the Stable (manure disposal), and then&mdash;after his riotous complaints&mdash;as \"Keeper of the Peach Garden of Immortality\". Monkey eats many of the peaches, which have taken millennia to ripen, becomes immortal and runs amok. Having earned the ire of Heaven and being beaten in a challenge by an omniscient, mighty, but benevolent, cloud-dwelling {{nihongo|'''[[Tath\u0101gata|Buddha]]'''|\u91c8\u8fe6\u5982\u6765|Shakanyorai}}, Monkey is imprisoned for 500 years under a mountain in order to learn patience.\n\nEventually, Monkey is released by the monk {{nihongo|'''[[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]]'''|\u4e09\u8535\u6cd5\u5e2b|Sanz\u014dh\u014dshi}}, who has been tasked by the {{nihongo|'''[[Boddhisatva]] [[Guanyin]]'''|\u89b3\u4e16\u97f3\u83e9\u85a9|Kanzeon Bosatsu}} to undertake a pilgrimage from China to India to fetch holy scriptures. The pair soon recruit two former members of the Heavenly Host who were cast out and turned from angels to \"monsters\" as a result of Monkey's transgressions: {{nihongo|'''[[Sha Wujing|Sandy]]'''|\u6c99\u609f\u6d44|Sa Goj\u014d}}, the water monster and ex-cannibal, expelled from Heaven after his interference caused Heaven's {{nihongo|[[Jade Emperor]]'s|\u5929\u5e1d|Tentei|[[Shangdi]]}} precious jade cup to be broken, and {{nihongo|'''[[Zhu Bajie|Pigsy]]'''|\u732a\u516b\u6212|Cho Hakkai}}, a pig monster consumed with lust and gluttony, who was expelled from Heaven after harassing the Star Princess [[Chang'e|Vega]]&mdash;the [[Jade Emperor]]'s mistress&mdash;for a kiss. A dragon, {{nihongo|'''Yu Lung'''|\u7389\u9f8d|Gyokury\u016b}}, who was set free by Guanyin after being sentenced to death, eats Tripitaka's horse. On discovering that the horse was tasked with carrying Tripitaka, it assumes the horse's shape to carry the monk on his journey. Later in the story he occasionally assumes human form to assist his new master, although he is still always referred to as \"Horse\". Monkey can also change form, for instance into a [[hornet]]. In Episode 3, ''The Great Journey Begins'', Monkey transforms into a girl to trick Pigsy. Monkey's other magic powers include: summoning a cloud upon which he can fly; his use of the magic wishing staff which he can shrink and grow at will and from time to time, when shrunk, store in his ear, and which he uses as a weapon; and the ability to conjure monkey warriors by blowing on hairs plucked from his chest.\n\nThe pilgrims face many perils and antagonists both human, such as {{nihongo|[[Emperor Taizong of Tang]]|\u592a\u5b97\u7687\u5e1d|Tais\u014dk\u014dtei}} and supernatural. Monkey, Sandy, and Pigsy are often called upon to battle demons, monsters, and bandits, despite Tripitaka's constant call for peace. Many episodes also feature some moral lesson, usually based upon [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and/or [[Taoism|Taoist]] philosophies, which are elucidated by the narrator at the end of various scenes.\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe songs in the series were performed by the five-piece Japanese band [[Godiego]]. In Japan, the first series' ending theme {{nihongo|\"[[Gandhara (song)|Gandhara]]\"|\u30ac\u30f3\u30c0\u30fc\u30e9|Gand\u0101ra}}, which was named after the ancient kingdom of [[Gandhara]], was released by [[Columbia Music Entertainment]] on 1 October 1978, backed with \"Celebration\". This was followed by the release of the opening theme \"[[Monkey Magic (song)|Monkey Magic]]\" on 25 December 1978, with \"A Fool\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]]. Godiego also released the soundtrack album ''[[Magic Monkey]]'' on 25 October 1978, comprising all of the songs that the band had composed for the first series. The album became one of the group's highest charting releases, staying at #1 on the [[Oricon]] chart for a total of eight weeks from January through March 1979 (it was unseated for most of January by the Japanese release of ''[[Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture]]''), and it was ultimately the #1 LP for 1979. For the second series, the ending theme of \"Gandhara\" was replaced with \"[[Holy and Bright]]\", which was released on 1 October 1979 (the two sides of the single featured a Japanese-language version on one side and an English-language version on the other).\n\nIn the UK, BBC Records released \"Gandhara\" as a single in 1979 (RESL 66), with \"The Birth of the Odyssey\" and \"Monkey Magic\" on the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Godiego - Gandhara single|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Godiego-Gandhara/release/594248|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>  The single reached #56 on the [[UK Singles Chart]], eventually spending a total of seven weeks on the chart.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brown, Tony.|page=357|year=2000|title=The Complete Book of the British Charts|publisher=Omnibus Press|isbn=0-7119-7670-8}}</ref>  A second BBC single was released in 1980 (RESL 81), this time featuring an edited version of \"Monkey Magic\", along with \"Gandhara\" and \"Thank You Baby\", but this single failed to chart.<ref>{{cite web|title=Godiego - Monkey Magic single|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Godiego-Monkey-Magic/release/212046|accessdate=26 June 2010}}</ref>  The BBC releases of \"Gandhara\" have one verse sung in Japanese and the other in English. BBC Records also released the ''Magic Monkey'' album under the simplified title of ''Monkey'' (REB 384) in 1980 but it failed to chart.\n\n[[Masaaki Sakai]], who plays Monkey in the series, also performed several of the songs for the series: \"SONGOKU\", {{nihongo|\"Ima de wa Oso Sugiru\"|\u4eca\u3067\u306f\u9045\u3059\u304e\u308b||\"It's Too Late\"}}, {{nihongo|\"Kono Michi no Hatemademo\"|\u3053\u306e\u9053\u306e\u679c\u3066\u307e\u3067\u3082||\"To the End of the Road\"}}, a Japanese version of Godiego's \"Thank You Baby\", and {{nihongo|\"20 Oku Nen no Kurayami\"|20\u5104\u5e74\u306e\u6697\u95c7||\"Two Billion Years of Darkness\"}}.\n\n==Cult appeal==\n''Monkey'' is considered a [[cult television|cult classic]] in countries where it has been shown, reaching as far as South America. Among the features that have contributed to its cult appeal are the theme song, the dubbed dialogue spoken in a variety of over-the-top \"oriental\" accents, the reasonably good synchronization of dubbing to the actors' original dialogue, the memorable battles which were for many Western youngsters their first exposure to Asian-style fantasy action sequences, and the fact that the young priest [[Tang Sanzang|Tripitaka]] was played by a woman, despite being male.\n\nIn 1981, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation debuted the BBC-dubbed ''Monkey'' at 6pm on week-nights. Since then, the show has been frequently repeated on the ABC, notably during the contemporary youth TV show ''[[Recovery (TV series)|Recovery]]'' which aired episodes of ''Monkey'' weekly from 1996-2000. When ''Recovery'' was put on hiatus, it was replaced with three hours of ''Monkey''. The radio station ''[[Triple J]]'' often made references to ''Monkey'' and interviewed the original BBC voice actors on several occasions.\n\nThe British folk pop band [[Monkey Swallows the Universe]] took their name from an episode of ''Monkey''.\n\nIn an episode of the cult Channel 4 sitcom [[Spaced]], main character Tim Bisley mentions that as a child he wanted to be Monkey when he grew up.\n\n==Characters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border\n|-\n!Character\n!Actor\n!Dub actor\n!Original Chinese name\n!Japanese name\n|-\n!Tripitaka\n|[[Masako Natsume]]\n|[[Maria Warburg]]\n|[[Tang Sanzang]]\n|Sanz\u014d h\u014dshi (Genj\u014d Sanz\u014d)\n|-\n!Monkey\n|[[Masaaki Sakai]]\n|[[David Collings]]\n|[[Sun Wukong]]\n|Son Gok\u016b\n|-\n!Pigsy\n|s1: [[Toshiyuki Nishida]]<br>s2: [[Tonpei Hidari]]\n|[[Peter Woodthorpe]]\n|[[Zhu Bajie]]\n|Cho Hakkai\n|-\n!Sandy\n|[[Shiro Kishibe]]\n|[[Gareth Armstrong]]\n|[[Sha Wujing]]\n|Sa Goj\u014d\n|-\n!\"Horse\"\n|[[Shunji Fujimura]]\n|[[Andrew Sachs]]\n|[[Bai Long Ma]]\n|Gyokury\u016b\n|}\n\n== Episode list ==\n=== Series 1: 1978-79===\n\n* 01.

The height of the knee versus the foot and the angle of the knee flexion will vary depending on the techniques. The working leg can be held behind (''derri\u00e8re''), in front (''devant''), or to the side (''\u00e0 la seconde'') of the body. The alignment of the thigh compared to the midline in Attitude derri\u00e8re will vary depending on the techniques. The foot of the supporting leg may be flat on the floor, en [[#Demi-pointe|demi-pointe]] (ball of the foot), or [[#Pointe, en|en pointe]] (tips of the toes).

To execute a bris\u00e9 en avant, the dancer demi-pli\u00e9s in fifth position and  brushes the back leg (through first position) to the front, then springs into the air and brings the second foot to meet it in the back before switching to the front to land, creating a beating action with the legs. In a bris\u00e9 en arri\u00e8re, the process is reversed, with the front leg brushing to the back and beating to land in front.\n\n===Bras crois\u00e9===\n\n({{IPA-fr|b\u0281a k\u0281waze}}; literally 'crossed arms') Arm placement in which one arm is extended in second position away from the audience while the other is curved in first position (Cecchetti fourth position ''en avant'' or RAD/French third position).\n\n===Bravura===\n({{IPA-it|bra\u02c8vu\u02d0ra}}) A flashy, showy and elaborate style of dance that involves a lot of elaborate steps and style to similar music.

Coup\u00e9 is both a step and action. It is commonly executed from ''cou-de-pied'' front to ''cou-de-pied'' back or vice versa. It may also be done from an extended leg position into ''fondu'' or directly through fifth position (as in concluding a ''jet\u00e9''). Coup\u00e9 can only be performed through a closed leg position.\n\nThe Vaganova School rarely uses the term ''coup\u00e9'' except as the preparation for specific allegros.  Rather, \"tomb\u00e9 through fifth position\" is more commonly used.<ref name=Vaganova/>\n\nIn the United States, \"coup\u00e9\" may be used to denote the position ''cou-de-pied,'' not unlike \"pass\u00e9\" is used to denote the position ''retir\u00e9'' in addition to the action of passing through retir\u00e9.\n\n===Couru===\n({{IPA-fr|ku\u0281y}}; 'run,' past participle, as in 'making small quick steps.')

One of the positions of the body or ''\u00e9paulement''.  Facing one of the corners of the stage, the body presents at an oblique angle to the audience, such that the audience can see still both shoulders and hips.  The working leg may be crossed to the front (devant) or to the back (derri\u00e8re).\n\n''Crois\u00e9'' is used in the third, fourth, and fifth positions of the legs. A dancer is in ''crois\u00e9 devant'' if at a 45 angle to the audience, the downstage leg (closest to the audience) is working to the front and the arms are open in third or fourth with the downstage arm being the one in second.  A dancer is in ''crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' if at a 45 degree angle to the audience, the upstage leg (farthest from the audience) is working to the back and the arms are open in third, fourth, or [[#Allong\u00e9|allong\u00e9]] in [[#Arabesque|arabesque]] with the upstage arm being the one out towards second, e.g. ''arabesque crois\u00e9e'' or Russian fourth arabesque.  ''Crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' in the Russian school alternatively has the upstage leg working to the back, but the downstage arm out to second.\n\nExamples of ''crois\u00e9'': the front leg is the right leg and the dancer is facing the front-left corner of the stage; or the front leg is the left, and the dancer is facing his/her front-right corner.\n\n===Croix, en===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 k\u0281w\u0251}}; meaning 'in the shape of a cross.')

Saint-L\u00e9on wrote, \"Fondu is on one leg what a pli\u00e9 is on two.\"  ''Fondu'' at the barre often refers to '''battement fondu d\u00e9velopp\u00e9''', where the supporting leg begins fondu with the foot of the working leg at cou-de-pied; the working leg extends out through a petit d\u00e9velopp\u00e9 as the supporting leg straightens.\n# A term used to modify any one-legged position in order to indicate a bent supporting leg (e.g. arabesque fondu).\n\n===[[Fouett\u00e9]]===\n[[Image:CF46618267 109996904033.gif|frame|right|250px|Dancer performing ''Fouett\u00e9 en tournant en dehors'']]\n({{IPA-fr|fw\u025bte}}; literally 'whipped.')  ''Fouett\u00e9'' itself refers to a move where a quick pivot on the supporting leg changes the orientation of the body and the working leg.  E.g. A 180-degree or 90-degree fouett\u00e9 could involve a working leg beginning extended elevated in front; the supporting leg rising onto demi-pointe or pointe quickly executing a \"half\" turn inside/en dedans, leading to the working leg ending in arabesque and the body now facing the opposite direction or stage direction.  (This brand of action can be seen in both [[#Jet\u00e9|tour jet\u00e9s]] and walt turns (''pas de valse en tournant'').)  A fouett\u00e9 could also change the leg/body orientation from, for example, en face \u00e0 la seconde to \u00e9paul\u00e9 (second) arabesque/crois\u00e9 first arabesque or effac\u00e9 devant, if outside/en dehors, via a 45-degree turn.\n\n''Fouett\u00e9'' is also common shorthand for '''fouett\u00e9 rond de jambe en tournant''' (pictured here ''en dehors'').  A '''fouett\u00e9 turn''' is a [[dance turn|turn]] that begins with the supporting leg in [[pli\u00e9]]. As the supporting foot transitions to ''demi-pointe'' or ''pointe'', in an en dehors turn, the working leg extends forward and then whips around to the side as the working foot is retracted to the supporting knee in retir\u00e9, creating the impetus to rotate one turn.  The working leg returns out of retir\u00e9 nearing the end of a single rotation to restart the entire leg motion for successive rotations.\n\n===Fouett\u00e9 jet\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|fw\u025bte \u0292\u0259te}}) A leap that begins with a ''fouett\u00e9''.\n\n===Frapp\u00e9===\n[[File:Santavuori-balettia-kaikille-frappe.png|thumb|Frapp\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|f\u0281ape}}; 'struck.')  Abbreviation of ''battement frapp\u00e9.''  Action of extending the working foot out from cou-de-pied.  In Cecchetti, RAD, and American ballet, on flat, this action involves brushing a flexed (or non-pointed relaxed) foot from cou-de-pied through the floor, the ball of the foot (lightly) striking as extending out pointed through d\u00e9gag\u00e9.  In the Russian school, a pointed foot at cou-de-pied extends directly out to d\u00e9gag\u00e9 height without brushing through the floor.  On demi-pointe, Cecchetti employs the Russian style of non-brushed pointed foot directly out.  Other schools may use a flexed foot without the strike or a non-brushed pointed foot on demi-pointe.\n\nFrapp\u00e9s are commonly done in singles, doubles, or triples.  Double and triple frapp\u00e9s involve tapping the foot (flexed or pointed) at both cou-de-pied devant (or wrapped) and derri\u00e8re before extending out. (E.g. Double frapp\u00e9 front would be cou-de-pied back, cou-de-pied front, d\u00e9gag\u00e9 front.  Double frapp\u00e9 back would be front, back, [d\u00e9gag\u00e9] back.  Triple frapp\u00e9 front would be front, back, front, [d\u00e9gag\u00e9] front.)\n\n===Fifth position===\n\nA posture in which the feet are turned outward. With one foot in the front and one in the back, you\u2019ll make fifth position. The front foot is usually facing horizontal while the back foot is diagonal. It does not matter which foot is in the front or back, as long as they are turned out. You can do [[pirouette]]s, [[changement]]s, [[#Frapp\u00e9|frapp\u00e9]]s, [[Glossary of ballet#Pli\u00e9|plies]], and much more with fifth position.\n\n==G==\n\n===Glissade===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0261lisad}}; literally 'glide.') A traveling step starting in fifth position from ''demi-pli\u00e9''.  The leading foot brushes out to [[#D\u00e9gag\u00e9|d\u00e9gag\u00e9]] as weight bears on the trailing leg, weight is shifted to the leading leg via a jump and the trailing foot extends out of pli\u00e9 into degag\u00e9.  The leading foot lands [[#Tomb\u00e9|tomb\u00e9]] and the trailing foot slides in to meet the leading foot in fifth position demi-pli\u00e9.  A ''glissade'' can be done ''en avant'', ''en arri\u00e8re'', ''dessous'' (leading front foot ends back), ''dessus'' (leading back foot ends front), or without a [[#Changement|changement]] of feet.\n\n===Glissade pr\u00e9cipit\u00e9e===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0261lisad p\u0281esipite}}; \"precipitated glide\".)

Throughout the movement, the pelvis should be kept neutral, the back straight and aligned with the heels, the legs turned out, and the knees over the feet.  From standing to bent this should be fluid.  A purpose of the grand pli\u00e9 is to warm up the ankles and stretch the calves.\n\n===Grand jet\u00e9===\n<!--[[Grand jet\u00e9]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Chenxin Liu - Don Quichotte, Kitri - Prix de Lausanne 2010-7 edit.jpg|200px|right|thumb|A ''grand jet\u00e9'']]\n({{IPA-fr|\u0261\u0281\u0251\u0303 \u0292\u0259te}}) A long horizontal jump, starting from one leg and landing on the other. Known as a split in the air. It is most often done forward and usually involves doing full leg splits in mid-air. It consists basically of a ''grand \u00e9cart'' with a moving jump. The front leg brushes straight into the air in a ''grand battement'', as opposed to from ''d\u00e9velopp\u00e9'' (or an unfolding motion). The back leg follows making the splits in the air. It can be performed ''en avant'' (forward), ''\u00e0 la seconde'' (to the side), ''en arri\u00e8re'' (backward), and ''en tournant'' (turning en dedans).  The dancer must remember to hit the fullest split at the height of the jump, with weight pushed slightly forward, giving the dancer a gliding appearance.\n\n===[[Grand pas]]===\nA suite of individual dances that serves as a showpiece for lead dancers, [[demi-soloists]], and in some cases the ''[[#Corps de ballet|corps de ballet]]''.  Often regarded as the [[pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance]] of a ballet. It usually consists of an ''[[#Entre\u00e9|entre\u00e9]]'', a ''[[#Adagio|grand adage]]'', and a ''[[#Coda|coda]]'', which brings the suite to a conclusion. After the adage, it may include a dance for the ''corps de ballet'' (often referred to as the ''ballabile''), variations for demi-soloists, variations for lead ballerina and danseur, or some combinations of these.\n\nVarious types of \"grand pas\" are found in ballet, including:\n* A ''grand pas d'action'' is one that contributes to a ballet's story. \n* In a ''grand pas classique'', classical ballet technique prevails and no character dances are included.\n* A ''[[grand pas de deux]]'' serves as the ''pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance'' for the principal male and female characters of a full-length ballet.\n* A grand pas danced by three or four dancers is a ''grand pas de trois'' or ''grand pas de quatre'', respectively.\n\n==H==\n\n===Hortensia===\n\n\"A male dancer's step in which the dancer jumps into the air with the legs drawn up, one in front of the other, then reverses their position [...] several times before landing with the feet apart again.\"<ref>Grant, Gail.

A leap in which one leg appears to be thrown in the direction of the movement (en avant, en arri\u00e8re, or sideways). There are several kinds of ''jet\u00e9s'', including ''jet\u00e9 / jet\u00e9 ordinaire'' (RAD) / ''pas jet\u00e9'' (Rus.), ''[[#Grand jet\u00e9|grand jet\u00e9]]'', and ''tour jet\u00e9'' (ABT) / ''grand jet\u00e9 en tournant'' (Fr./Cecc.) / ''jet\u00e9 entrelac\u00e9'' (Rus.), or the common compound step ''coup\u00e9 jet\u00e9 (en tournant)''.\n\n* '''Jet\u00e9''' (''jet\u00e9 ordinaire/pas jet\u00e9'') refers to a jump initiated en pli\u00e9, with the pointed working foot brushing out in d\u00e9gag\u00e9 from cou-de-pied (derri\u00e8re) to seconde (action similar to a non-Russian-style flat [[#Frapp\u00e9|frapp\u00e9]]), weight being transferred via a jump propelled by pushing off the standing leg from pli\u00e9, the leading leg landing tomb\u00e9 and the foot of the other/former standing leg ending cou-de-pied (derri\u00e8re).  Some schools (including ABT at one point) may still refer to this as a ''petit jet\u00e9''.\n* '''Grand jet\u00e9''': [[File:Antonio_Grand_jet\u00e9_GIF.gif|thumb|Grand jet\u00e9.]] see ''[[#Grand jet\u00e9|grand jet\u00e9]]'', a jump initiated with a grand battement en avant of the leading leg while pushing off the trailing leg from pli\u00e9 (usually led into by some moving step such as chass\u00e9, glissade en avant, or pas couru), the trailing leg brushing to grand battement derri\u00e8re while in the air, the jump ultimately landing on the leading leg.  Resembles the splits (en l'air).\n* '''Tour jet\u00e9''' / '''jet\u00e9 entrelac\u00e9''' ('turn'/'interlaced') is a grand jet\u00e9 done turning:  a jump initiated with a grand battement en avant of the leading leg, followed by a fouett\u00e9 turning the direction of the body 180 degrees and the trailing leg brushing through to a grand battement derri\u00e8re, the jump landing arabesque with the leading leg now the standing (landing) leg.\n* '''Coup\u00e9 jet\u00e9 en tournant''' is a compound step, usually done in multiples ''en man\u00e8ge'' ('in a circle'), of a coup\u00e9 (changing the supporting foot) initiating the first quarter of a turn leading into a grand jet\u00e9 completing the 360-degree rotation of the turn.\n* '''Petit jet\u00e9''' in RAD and the French school<ref name=Grant/> refers to a one-footed changement passing through cou-de-pied and is what other schools refer to as a '''changement [[#Embo\u00eet\u00e9|embo\u00eet\u00e9]]'''.\n\n==M==\n\n===Man\u00e8ges===\nMan\u00e8ges is a classical ballet term meaning \u201ccircular.\u201d  It describes when a dancer does steps in a circular pattern around the stage.\n\nUsually, man\u00e8ges will be a repetition of one or two steps, but can also be a combination of several.  For example, a coup\u00e9 jet\u00e9 man\u00e8ges is typically done by a male dancer in a coda of a classical pas de deux.  Ballerinas will often do piqu\u00e9 man\u00e8ges in a variation or also in a coda.\n\n==O==\n\n===Ouvert, ouverte===\n({{IPA-fr|uv\u025b\u0281(t)}}; 'open, opened.') Converse of ''ferm\u00e9(e)'' ('closed').  ''Ouvert'' may refer to positions (the second and fourth positions of the feet are positions ouvertes), limbs, directions, or certain exercises or steps.

Halfway between a step and a leap, taken on the floor (''gliss\u00e9'') or with a jump (''saut\u00e9''); it can be done moving toward the front or toward the back. This step can also be found in [[Scottish highland dance]].\n\nStarting in fifth position ''crois\u00e9'', a dancer executes a ''pli\u00e9'' while brushing the downstage leg out to ''tendu'' front. The downstage leg does a ''demi rond de jambe'' to the opposite corner while the body turns to face that corner.  Weight is quickly transferred to that brushed leg, now upstage, allowing the dancer to pass the newly downstage leg through [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]] via a ''chass\u00e9 pass\u00e9'' to fourth devant, ending ''crois\u00e9'' the new corner, and finishing by bringing the upstage leg in to close fifth.\n\n===Pas de bourr\u00e9e===\n[[File:Pas de bourr\u00e9e, jazz dance technique.webm|thumb|[[Jazz dance]] pas de bourr\u00e9e, which differs slightly from ballet {{Clarify|date=March 2016}}]]\n({{IPA-fr|p\u0251 d(\u0259) bu\u0281e}}; 'step of [[bourr\u00e9e]].')

A movement in which the raised, pointed foot of the working leg is lowered so that it pricks the floor and then either rebounds upward (as in ''battement piqu\u00e9'') or becomes a supporting foot.  In the latter case, it may be used to transfer a stance from one leg to the other by stepping out directly onto an ''en pointe'' or ''demi-pointe'' foot and often immediately precedes a movement that entails elevating the new working leg, such as a ''piqu\u00e9 [[#Arabesque|arabesque]]''.\n\nIn Cecchetti and RAD, the term [[#Pos\u00e9|pos\u00e9]] is used instead of ''piqu\u00e9'' outside of the battement: ''piqu\u00e9 arabesque'' and ABT ''piqu\u00e9 turn/tour piqu\u00e9'' (''en dedans'') / Rus.

The non-supporting leg is generally held in ''[[#Retir\u00e9|retir\u00e9]] devant'' ('front')&mdash;when initiated from fourth, this would be a retir\u00e9 [[#Pass\u00e9|pass\u00e9]]&mdash;but could also be held in other positions such as ''seconde''.  Pirouettes are most often executed ''[[#Dehors, en|en dehors]]'', turning outwards in the direction of the working leg, but can also be done ''[[#Dedans, en|en dedans]]'', turning inwards in the direction of the supporting leg.  (e.g. ''En dehors'' turns clockwise (to the right) if the right leg is working and the left leg supporting/standing.)  [[Spotting (dance technique)|Spotting]] is employed to help maintain balance.  A pirouette may return to its starting position or finish in ''arabesque'' or ''attitude''.\n\nIn other genres of dance, such as jazz or modern, it is common to see pirouettes performed with legs ''parallel'' (i.e. sixth position) instead of turned out as in ballet.\n\n===Pli\u00e9===\n<!--[[Demi-pli\u00e9]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Demi plie.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|Demi-pli\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|plije}}; literally 'bent.')

While in a demi-plie position one must remember to have proper alignment. Head over shoulders, shoulders over hips over knees and knees over feet. When initiating a demi-plie one must pull up and resist against going down. Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Creating proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward. at the same time engaging your core,(stomach) by pressing your naval towards your spine.

Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Heels come off the ground past demi-pli\u00e9 with the feet ending in a demi-pointe at the bottom of the bend. Making sure to create proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward, and at the same time engaging your core,(stomach) by pressing your navel towards your spine. As soon as the bottom of the bend is reached, the bend is reversed and the legs are straightened. *Note: Heels do not come up off the floor in a second position.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pointe, en===\n[[File:EnPointeFoot.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|An ''en pointe'' foot in a [[pointe shoe]]]]\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 pw\u025b\u0303t}}) Supporting one's body weight on the tips of the toes, usually while wearing structurally reinforced [[pointe shoe]]s.\n\n===[[Pointe technique]]===\nThe part of classical [[ballet technique]] that concerns pointe work (dancing on the tips of the toes).\n\n===Pointe work===\nPerforming steps while on the tips of the toes, with feet fully extended and wearing [[pointe shoe]]s, a structurally reinforced type of shoe designed specifically for this purpose. Most often performed by women.\n\n=== Poisson ===\n({{IPA-fr|pwas\u0254\u0303}}; literally 'fish.') A body position in which the back is arched and legs are crossed in fifth position or the working leg is held retir\u00e9.

An exercise for the movement of the arms (and in some schools, the upper body) to different positions.  For example, a basic ''port de bras'' exercise could move from fifth ''en bas'' ('low') (i.e. ''bras bas'' or ''preparatory position'') to first arm position, to second arm position, back down to fifth en bas. A full ''port de bras'' could move from ''en bas'' to ''en haut'' ('high', i.e. overhead) and back down.  Port de bras movements vary by school and by action.\n\nThe phrase ''port de bras'' is used in some schools and parts of the world to indicate a bending forward, backward, or circularly of the body at the waist, generally to be followed by bringing the upper body back to center/upright again, e.g. \"port de bras forward,\" \"port de bras back,\" \"circular port de bras/grand port de bras.\"  Bending at the waist is otherwise known as [[#Cambr\u00e9|cambr\u00e9]].\n\n===Pos\u00e9===\n{{IPA-fr|poze}}; A term of the [[Cecchetti method|Cecchetti school]] and RAD.  From a ''fondu'', a dancer steps with a straight leg onto an ''en pointe'' or ''demi-pointe'' foot, then brings the working leg to ''cou-de-pied'', so that if the step is repeated, the working leg will execute a ''petit d\u00e9velopp\u00e9''. This can be done in any direction or turning (the later also known as [[#Piqu\u00e9|tour piqu\u00e9]]).\n\n===[[Position of the arms in ballet|Positions of the arms]]===\n[[Image:Ballet grace.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Arms held in Cecchetti's \"Spanish fourth\" position]]\n\nThere are two basic positions of the arms. In one, the dancer keeps the fingers of both arms almost touching to form an oval/round shape, either near the hips, at navel level, or raised above the dancer's head. In the other, the arms are extended to the sides with the elbows slightly bent. These positions may be combined to give other positions.\n\nDifferent schools, such as Vaganova, French, and Cecchetti, Russian often use different names for similar arm positions.  The Russian school names three arm positions while the other schools name five.\n* Bras bas ('arms low') (RAD)/bras au repos ('at rest') (French), preparatory position (Rus.), or fifth en bas (Cecc.) holds the arms low and slightly rounded near the hip.\n* First position holds the arms round or oval in front of the body somewhere between the naval and breastbone (depending on the school and movement), the fingertips of the hands approaching each other.  In Cecchetti, the hands stay a little lower at tutu height.\n* Second position in all schools holds the arms extended out to the side, the inner part of the upper arm parallel to the ground with the forearms and palms facing the audience.  The roundness and shoulder height of the arms varies by school.\n* Third position in the French/RAD schools holds one arm in second with the other arm in first.  The Russian equivalent of this may be ''petit bras''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n** Third position in Cecchetti holds one arm in a Cecchetti first and the other arm in ''demi-seconde''.\n** Third position in the Russian school holds both arms slightly rounded overhead.  This is equivalent to fifth position (en haut) in other schools.\n* Fourth position or fourth ''ouvert'' ('open') consists of one arm ''en haut'' ('high,' i.e. raised overhead) and the other open to second position.  This is called ''fourth en haut'' in Cecchetti.  The Russian school does not designate a fourth position; the Russian equivalent may be ''grand bras''.\n** Fourth position ''crois\u00e9'' ('crossed') or ''Spanish fourth'' in Cecchetti consists of one arm ''en haut'' and the other held in first position/Cecchetti ''fifth en avant''.\n* Fifth position in the French/RAD schools and ''fifth en haut'' in Cecchetti holds the arms ''en haut'' slightly rounded, fingertips approaching each other.  This is called third position in the Russian school, which does not designate a fifth (or fourth) position.  Cecchetti also recognizes a ''fifth en bas'', the preparatory/bras bas position in other schools, and a ''fifth en avant'', arms rounded between naval/chest height, known as first position in other schools.\n\nAdditionally:\n* Demi-bras ('half arms') holds the arms between first and second position, outstretched with palms presented towards the audience.\n* Demi-seconde ('half second') holds the arms low out to the side as if grazing the tutu, palms generally down.\n\n===Positions of the body===\nThere are eight to eleven positions of the body in ballet, eight in Cecchetti and RAD and ten or eleven in the Russian and French schools.  The general positions are [[#Crois\u00e9, crois\u00e9e|crois\u00e9]], [[#\u00c0 la quatri\u00e8me|\u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me]], [[#Effac\u00e9, effac\u00e9e|effac\u00e9]], [[#\u00c0 la seconde|\u00e0 la seconde]], [[#\u00c9cart\u00e9|\u00e9cart\u00e9]], and [[#\u00c9paul\u00e9|\u00e9paul\u00e9]]. Cecchetti and RAD's eight include ''crois\u00e9 devant, \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me devant, effac\u00e9 (devant), \u00e0 la seconde, crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re, \u00e9cart\u00e9, \u00e9paul\u00e9,'' and ''\u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me derri\u00e8re''.  The Russian school further divides ''effac\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9paul\u00e9'' into ''effac\u00e9 devant, effac\u00e9 derri\u00e8re, \u00e9paul\u00e9 devant'', and ''\u00e9paul\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'', and the Russian arm positions on ''crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' are the converse of Cecchetti/RAD's.  In addition, the French school further divides ''\u00e9cart\u00e9'' into ''\u00e9cart\u00e9 devant'' and ''\u00e9cart\u00e9 derri\u00e8re''.\n\n===[[Positions of the feet in ballet|Positions of the feet]]===\nThe standard, basic placements of feet on the floor. Modern-day classical ballet employs five positions, known as the [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Second position|second position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Third position|third position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Fourth position|fourth position]], and [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Fifth position|fifth position]].\n\n===Pulling Up===\nPulling up is critical to the simple act of rising up on balance and involves the use of the entire body. The feeling of being simultaneously grounded and \"pulled up\" is necessary for many steps in ballet. To pull up, a dancer must lift the ribcage and sternum but keep the shoulders down, relaxed and centered over the hips, which requires use of the abdominal muscles. In addition, the dancer must stabilize the pelvis, maintaining a neutral position, and keep the back straight to avoid arching and going off balance.\n\n===Petite Battement===\n\nPetite [[battement]] is when a ballet dancer swiftly moves his/her leg in front then behind their calf. This motion is normally done at the [[Barre (ballet)|barre]] during warm-up. A more advanced dancer would only move their knee, to complete this action.\n\n==Q==\n\n===Quatre===\n({{IPA-fr|kat\u0281}}) Four of something, as in ''pas de quatre'' (a dance by four dancers).\n\n===Quatri\u00e8me===\n({{IPA-fr|kat\u0281ij\u025b\u02d0m}}) Meaning 'fourth'.\n\n==R==\n\n===Renvers\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0281\u0251\u0303v\u025b\u0281se}}) An attitude presented on a turn.<ref name=Jennings>{{cite news\n | last =Jennings\n | first =Luke\n | coauthors =\n | title =MoveTube: Anthony Dowell dances the Prince's solo from Swan Lake Act I\n | newspaper =Guardian\n | location =London, UK\n | pages =\n | publisher =\n | date =10 November 2011\n | url =https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/nov/10/movetube-anthony-dowell-swan-lake\n | accessdate = 12 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Relev\u00e9===\n[[File:Santavuori-balettia-kaikille-eleve.png|thumb|Relev\u00e9 exercise at a [[barre (ballet)|barre]]]]\n({{IPA-fr|\u0281\u0259lve}}; 'raised, lifted.')

This is called a ''grande j\u00e9t\u00e9 d\u00e9velopp\u00e9'' in other schools.\n\nIn the French and Cecchetti schools, ''saut de chat'' refers to what RAD/ABT call a ''[[#Pas de chat|pas de chat]]''.\n\n=== Sc\u00e1furi ===\nA rise, from flat to demi-pointe (from the balls to the tips of both feet), usually done multiple times in quick succession where the legs are turned out in a grand pas position.\n\n===[[Positions of the feet in ballet#Second position|Second position (feet)]]===\nLegs turned out with feet pointing in opposite directions and heels at least shoulder-width apart.\n\n===Sickle===\nA term that refers to the reverse of a winging, indicating a foot where the heel is too far back so the toes are in front of the ankle and heel, breaking the line of the leg at the ankle.  If a dancer sickles an ''en pointe'' or ''demi-pointe'' foot, the ankle could collapse to the outside, resulting in a sprain.  A working foot should be straight to the side and mildly winged to the front or back.\n\n===Sissonne===\n[[File:Sissonne.ogg|thumb|Sissones]]\n({{IPA-fr|sis\u0254n}}) A jump done from two feet to one foot. Named after the originator of the step. In a ''sissonne over'' (''dessus'') the back foot closes in front, and in a ''sissonne under'' (''dessous'') the front foot closes behind.

Similar to ''tours cha\u00een\u00e9s (d\u00e9boul\u00e9s)'', a ''soutenu'' turn is a turn usually done in multiples in quick succession. The dancer first executes a ''demi-pli\u00e9'' while extending the leading leg in ''tendu'', stepping onto that leg en pointe/demi-pointe (making it the standing leg), then bringing the other leg to 5th position in front of the standing leg and finally turning (effectively, an unwinding motion).  At the end of the rotation, the originally crossed-over foot in front should now be in 5th position behind.\n\nCommon abbreviation of ''assembl\u00e9 soutenu en tournant'' (Cecc.).  This is known as a ''glissade en tourant'' in the Russian school.\n\nWhen done at the barre en demi-pointe to switch sides, only half a turn is done instead of a full turn, and the foot does not extend out into tendu.  Differs from a ''d\u00e9tourn\u00e9'' in that there is a repositioning of the feet on finishing (and a crossing action, if not initiated in 5th) vs. just a pivot to half turn.\n\n===[[Split (gymnastics)|Split]]===\nA configuration of the legs in which the legs are extended in opposite directions, either to the side (''straddle'' split) or with one leg forward and the other back (''front'' split).

The arched working foot is placed wrapped at the part of the leg between the base of the calf and the beginning of the ankle. On the accent devant (front), the heel of the working foot is placed in front of the leg, while the toes point to the back, allowing the instep (''cou-de-pied'' in French) of the working foot to hug the lower leg. On the accent derri\u00e8re (back), the heel of the working leg is placed behind the leg with the toes pointing to the back.

A term from the Cecchetti school indicating a hop on one foot while the other is raised in any position. The instep is fully arched when leaving the ground and the spring must come from the pointing of the toe and the extension of the leg after the ''demi-pli\u00e9''.\n\nIn the Cecchetti method, the specifically indicates a spring from fifth position while raising one foot to ''sur le cou-de-pied''. In the Russian and French schools, this is known as ''sissonne simple''.\n\n===Temps lev\u00e9 saut\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303 l(\u0259)ve sote}}; literally 'time raised jumped.')  A term from the Russian school.  This can be executed with both feet from first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position starting with a ''demi-pli\u00e9'', leading to a jump in the air that lands with the feet in the same position as they started. (Otherwise known as simply a ''saut'' or ''saut\u00e9''.)  This can also be performed from one foot, while the other maintains the same position it had before starting the jump (i.e. the same as ''temps lev\u00e9'').\n\n===Temps li\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303 lje}}; 'time linked.')

A jump, typically done by males, with a full rotation in the air. The landing can be on both feet, on one leg with the other extended in ''attitude'' or ''arabesque'', or down on one knee as at the end of a [[Variation (ballet)|variation]]. A single ''tour'' is a 360\u00b0 rotation, a double is 720\u00b0. [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] was known to perform triple ''tours en l'air''.\n\n===Tomb\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0254\u0303be}}; literally 'fallen.') The action of falling, typically used as a lead-in movement to a traveling step, e.g. ''pas de bourr\u00e9e''.  A ''tomb\u00e9 en avant'' begins with a ''coup\u00e9'' to the front moving to a [[#D\u00e9gag\u00e9|d\u00e9gag\u00e9]] to fourth position devant, the extended foot coming down to the floor with the leg en pli\u00e9, shifting the weight of the body onto the front leg and lifting the back leg off the floor in d\u00e9gag\u00e9 (to fourth derri\u00e8re).  A ''tomb\u00e9'' through second starts with a d\u00e9gag\u00e9 of the leading leg to second position, the leading foot coming to the floor with the leg in pli\u00e9, and the trailing leg lifting off the floor in d\u00e9gag\u00e9 to (the opposite-side) second position.

A jump that takes off from one foot and lands on two feet.  When initiated with two feet on the ground (e.g. from 5th position) the working leg performs a ''battement gliss\u00e9''/''d\u00e9gag\u00e9'', brushing out. The dancer launches into a jump, with the second foot then meeting the first foot before landing. A petit assembl\u00e9 is when a dancer is standing on one foot with the other extended. The dancer then does a small jump to meet the first foot. {{clear}}\n\n===Attitude===\n[[File:Yamamoto Mashiko - Le Corsaire - Prix de Lausanne 2010-4.jpg|thumb|160px|Attitude derri\u00e8re]]\n({{IPA-fr|atityd}}) A position in which a dancer stands on one leg (the ''supporting'' leg) while the other leg (''working'' leg) is raised and turned out with knee bent to form an angle of approximately 90\u00b0 between the thigh and the lower leg.  The height of the knee versus the foot and the angle of the knee flexion will vary depending on the techniques. The working leg can be held behind (''derri\u00e8re''), in front (''devant''), or to the side (''\u00e0 la seconde'') of the body. The alignment of the thigh compared to the midline in Attitude derri\u00e8re will vary depending on the techniques. The foot of the supporting leg may be flat on the floor, en [[#Demi-pointe|demi-pointe]] (ball of the foot), or [[#Pointe, en|en pointe]] (tips of the toes).

A dancer exhibiting ''ballon'' will appear to spring effortlessly, float in mid-air, and land softly like a balloon.\n\n===Ballonn\u00e9===\nIn classical ballet, the term ballonn\u00e9 is a step where the leg is extended (can be front, side, or back) at 45 degrees. The knee is then bent and the foot brought to a sur le cou-de-pied position. This can also be done as a relev\u00e9 or jump.\n\n===Ballott\u00e9===\nA ballott\u00e9 is a jumping step in classical ballet that consists of coup\u00e9 dessous and small developp\u00e9s performed with a rocking and swinging movement. The step can be performed with the leg extensions at 45 or 90 degrees.\n\n===[[Barre (ballet)|Barre]]===\n[[Image:Ballet barre.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Exercising at a portable barre. A fixed barre can be seen in the background.]]\nA sturdy horizontal bar, approximately waist height, used during ballet warm-up exercises and training. Fixed barres are typically mounted on mirror-covered walls; portable barres can be relocated as needed. Used for balance, not support.\n\n===[[Battement]]===\nAn alternating side-to-side movement of the working (non-supporting) leg. Typically performed in multiples, quickly and in rapid succession so that the working foot appears to be fluttering or vibrating.\n\n===Batterie===\n({{IPA-fr|bat\u0281i}}) A general term for jumps in which the legs open slightly sideways and close (crossed in fifth position) multiple times, alternating feet. (See \"Battu.)\n\n===Battu===\n({{IPA-fr|baty}}; meaning 'beaten') A movement with an extra beating of the feet included, as in ''jet\u00e9 battu''.\n\n===Bris\u00e9===\n[[File:Brise.jpg|thumb|Bris\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|b\u0281ize}}; literally 'broken') A jump consisting of an ''assembl\u00e9'' traveling either forward (en avant) or backward (en arri\u00e8re), with an extra beat that \"breaks\" the jump in its travel. To execute a bris\u00e9 en avant, the dancer demi-pli\u00e9s in fifth position and  brushes the back leg (through first position) to the front, then springs into the air and brings the second foot to meet it in the back before switching to the front to land, creating a beating action with the legs. In a bris\u00e9 en arri\u00e8re, the process is reversed, with the front leg brushing to the back and beating to land in front.\n\n===Bras crois\u00e9===\n\n({{IPA-fr|b\u0281a k\u0281waze}}; literally 'crossed arms') Arm placement in which one arm is extended in second position away from the audience while the other is curved in first position (Cecchetti fourth position ''en avant'' or RAD/French third position).\n\n===Bravura===\n({{IPA-it|bra\u02c8vu\u02d0ra}}) A flashy, showy and elaborate style of dance that involves a lot of elaborate steps and style to similar music. Usually during a key solo.\n\n==C==\n\n===Cabriole===\n[[File:Antonio_cabriole.gif|thumb|Double cabriole derri\u00e8re.]]\n({{IPA-fr|kab\u0281ij\u0254l}}; meaning 'caper.') An allegro step in which the extended legs are beaten in the air. Cabrioles are divided into two categories: petite, which are executed at 45 degrees, and grande, which are executed at 90 degrees. The working leg is thrust into the air, the underneath leg follows and beats against the first leg, sending it higher. The landing is then made on the underneath leg. Cabriole may be done devant, derri\u00e8re and \u00e0 la seconde in any given position of the body such as crois\u00e9, effac\u00e9, \u00e9cart\u00e9, and so on.\n\n===Cambr\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|k\u0251\u0303b\u0281e}}; literally 'arched.')

Also known as \"cha\u00een\u00e9s turns,\" a common abbreviation for ''tours cha\u00een\u00e9s d\u00e9boul\u00e9s'', a series of quick, 360 degree turns that alternate the feet while traveling along a straight line or in a circular path. Each foot performs a half turn, with feet held in a tight [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]] [[#Pointe, en|en pointe]] or [[#Demi-pointe|demi-pointe]].\n\n===Changement===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0283\u0251\u0303\u0292m\u0251\u0303}}; literally 'change, changing.') Common abbreviated name for ''changement de pieds.'' A jump in which the feet change positions in the air. For example, beginning in fifth position with the right foot front, ''pli\u00e9'', jump switching the right leg to the back, and land in fifth position with the left foot front. In the Vaganova vocabulary, ''petit changement de pieds'' indicates a ''changement'' where the feet barely leave the floor.\n\n===[[Chass\u00e9]]===\n[[File:Chass\u00e9, ballet technique tutorial.webm|thumb|Chass\u00e9]]\n(Literally 'chased.') \n# A sliding movement forward, backward, or sideways with both legs bent, then springing into the air with legs straight and together. It can be done either in a gallop or by pushing the leading foot along the floor in a ''pli\u00e9'' to cause an upward spring. It is typically performed in a series or as part of a combination of other movements.\n# A sliding movement as described above, but without the jump aspect. Instead, the leading foot is pushed along the floor in pli\u00e9 as described above, as a transition into another movement or position.\n\n===Cloche, en===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 kl\u0254\u0283}}; meaning 'like a bell.') Refers to brushing through first position from fourth devant or fourth derri\u00e8re to the opposite fourth with the upper body held upright. Can be done continuously, as is often done with [[#Battement|grands battements]] and [[#Attitude|attitudes]].  Similar to [[#Balan\u00e7oire|Balan\u00e7oire]], which additionally allows seesaw like upper-body shifting in counterpoint to the legs.\n\nThe Vaganova system may refer to ''en cloche'' as \"pass\u00e9 la jambe\" or \"battement pass\u00e9 la jambe\".<ref>Barker/Kostrovitskaya: 101 Lessons in Classical Ballet - 1977</ref>\n\n===Coda===\n({{IPA-it|\u02c8ko\u02d0da}}); literally 'tail.') The concluding segment of a performance or suite of dances comprising a ''[[grand pas]]'' (e.g., [[grand pas de deux]]). A particularly large or complex coda may be called a ''grand coda''. If a large group of dancers participate, the terms ''coda g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' or ''grand coda g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'' may be used.\n\n===[[Corps de ballet]]===\nThe ensemble of a ballet company, especially the ensemble apart from the featured dancers. Being a part of the corps means one is neither a soloist nor a principal dancer.\n\n===Coryph\u00e9e===\n({{IPA-fr|k\u0254\u0281ife}}) In some systems, a dancer of higher rank than a member of the corps de ballet, performing in small ensembles and small solo roles but not ranked as a soloist.\n\n===C\u00f4t\u00e9, de===\n({{IPA-fr|d\u0259 kote}}; 'sideways.') A movement traveling to the side.\n\n===Cou-de-pied===\n({{IPA-fr|ku d\u0259 pje}}; 'neck of the foot.') Position of the arched working foot raised to, and resting on, the ankle.  This could be in front ([\"conditional\"] ''devant''), behind (''derri\u00e8re''), or wrapped (''sur le cou-de-pied'':  arch of the foot wrapped around the ankle with the heel in front of the ankle and the toes behind, often interchangeable with the devant/conditional position), depending on the activity and the school/method of ballet.\n\n===Coup\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|kupe}}; meaning 'cut.') Coup\u00e9 is both a step and action. It is commonly executed from ''cou-de-pied'' front to ''cou-de-pied'' back or vice versa. It may also be done from an extended leg position into ''fondu'' or directly through fifth position (as in concluding a ''jet\u00e9''). Coup\u00e9 can only be performed through a closed leg position.\n\nThe Vaganova School rarely uses the term ''coup\u00e9'' except as the preparation for specific allegros.  Rather, \"tomb\u00e9 through fifth position\" is more commonly used.<ref name=Vaganova/>\n\nIn the United States, \"coup\u00e9\" may be used to denote the position ''cou-de-pied,'' not unlike \"pass\u00e9\" is used to denote the position ''retir\u00e9'' in addition to the action of passing through retir\u00e9.\n\n===Couru===\n({{IPA-fr|ku\u0281y}}; 'run,' past participle, as in 'making small quick steps.') In most cases, this holds the calves together and the feet in a tight fifth position en [[#Pointe, en|pointe]] or [[#Demi-pointe|demi-pointe]] and travels forward, backward, or to either side. E.g. ''[[#Pas de bourr\u00e9e|pas de bourr\u00e9e]] couru'' (also called [[#Bourr\u00e9e|bourr\u00e9e]] for short).\n\n==={{va|Crois\u00e9}}, {{va|crois\u00e9e}}===\n({{IPA-fr|k\u0281w\u0251ze}}; meaning 'crossed.') One of the positions of the body or ''\u00e9paulement''.  Facing one of the corners of the stage, the body presents at an oblique angle to the audience, such that the audience can see still both shoulders and hips.  The working leg may be crossed to the front (devant) or to the back (derri\u00e8re).\n\n''Crois\u00e9'' is used in the third, fourth, and fifth positions of the legs. A dancer is in ''crois\u00e9 devant'' if at a 45 angle to the audience, the downstage leg (closest to the audience) is working to the front and the arms are open in third or fourth with the downstage arm being the one in second.  A dancer is in ''crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' if at a 45 degree angle to the audience, the upstage leg (farthest from the audience) is working to the back and the arms are open in third, fourth, or [[#Allong\u00e9|allong\u00e9]] in [[#Arabesque|arabesque]] with the upstage arm being the one out towards second, e.g. ''arabesque crois\u00e9e'' or Russian fourth arabesque.  ''Crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' in the Russian school alternatively has the upstage leg working to the back, but the downstage arm out to second.\n\nExamples of ''crois\u00e9'': the front leg is the right leg and the dancer is facing the front-left corner of the stage; or the front leg is the left, and the dancer is facing his/her front-right corner.\n\n===Croix, en===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 k\u0281w\u0251}}; meaning 'in the shape of a cross.') Term often used during barre exercises to indicate that a step is done to the front, to the side, to the back, and then again to the side (as in the shape of a cross), finishing closed in either first or fifth position.\n\n==D==\n\n===Danseur===\n({{IPA-fr|d\u0251\u0303s\u0153\u0281}}) A male [[ballet dancer]].\n\n===Danseur noble===\n({{IPA-fr|d\u0251\u0303s\u0153\u0281 n\u0254bl}}) A male ballet dancer who excels in refined classical roles, often playing the prince or other royalty in a classical ballet.\n\n===Danseuse===\n({{IPA-fr|d\u0251\u0303s\u00f8z}}) A female ballet dancer.\n\n===D\u00e9boul\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|debule}}); literally 'hurtled,' as in 'with great speed.') Another name denoting the same move as a [[#Cha\u00een\u00e9s|cha\u00een\u00e9]] (i.e. ''les tours cha\u00een\u00e9s d\u00e9boul\u00e9s''). A fast sequence of half turns performed by stepping onto one leg, and completing the turn by stepping onto the other, performed on the balls of the feet or high on the toes, with the legs held very close together.\n\n===Dedans, en===\n[[File:En dehors En dedans.jpg|thumb|En dehors; en dedans]]\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 d\u0259d\u0251\u0303}}; 'inwards.') Inside movement.  \n# Circular movement where a leg that starts at the back or the side moves towards the front. For the right leg, this is a counter-clockwise circle. For the left leg, this is a clockwise circle. For example, in a ''rond de jambe en dedans'', starting from [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]], the foot first extends to ''tendu'' back, then moves to ''tendu'' to the side, and then ''tendu'' front, and back in again to first position.  \n# Turning motion in the direction of the supporting leg. In a ''pirouette en dedans'', the dancer would turn to their right if their left leg was lifted, or vice versa.  Opposite of ''[[#Dehors, en|en dehors]]''.\n\n===D\u00e9gag\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|de\u0261a\u0292e}}; 'disengaged.') Common abbreviation for ''battement d\u00e9gag\u00e9,'' the foot of the working leg sharply brushes through the floor through [[#Tendu|tendu]] pointed in the air 45 degrees or lower.  D\u00e9gag\u00e9 is part of the (initiating) execution of jumps such as jet\u00e9, assembl\u00e9, bris\u00e9, and glissade.\n\nPrimarily a Cecchetti/RAD term, this is known as ''battement tendu jet\u00e9'' in the Russian School or ''battement gliss\u00e9'' in the French School.\n\n===Dehors, en===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 d\u0259\u0254\u0281}}; 'outwards.')  Circular movement where a leg that starts at the front or the side moves towards the back. For a right working leg, this is a clockwise circle. For example, in a ''rond de jambe en dehors'', starting from [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]], the foot (either left or right) would first extend ''tendu'' front, move to ''tendu'' to the side, and then ''tendu'' back, and back in again to first position.

''Fouett\u00e9'' itself refers to a move where a quick pivot on the supporting leg changes the orientation of the body and the working leg.  E.g. A 180-degree or 90-degree fouett\u00e9 could involve a working leg beginning extended elevated in front; the supporting leg rising onto demi-pointe or pointe quickly executing a \"half\" turn inside/en dedans, leading to the working leg ending in arabesque and the body now facing the opposite direction or stage direction.  (This brand of action can be seen in both [[#Jet\u00e9|tour jet\u00e9s]] and walt turns (''pas de valse en tournant'').)  A fouett\u00e9 could also change the leg/body orientation from, for example, en face \u00e0 la seconde to \u00e9paul\u00e9 (second) arabesque/crois\u00e9 first arabesque or effac\u00e9 devant, if outside/en dehors, via a 45-degree turn.\n\n''Fouett\u00e9'' is also common shorthand for '''fouett\u00e9 rond de jambe en tournant''' (pictured here ''en dehors'').  A '''fouett\u00e9 turn''' is a [[dance turn|turn]] that begins with the supporting leg in [[pli\u00e9]]. As the supporting foot transitions to ''demi-pointe'' or ''pointe'', in an en dehors turn, the working leg extends forward and then whips around to the side as the working foot is retracted to the supporting knee in retir\u00e9, creating the impetus to rotate one turn.  The working leg returns out of retir\u00e9 nearing the end of a single rotation to restart the entire leg motion for successive rotations.\n\n===Fouett\u00e9 jet\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|fw\u025bte \u0292\u0259te}}) A leap that begins with a ''fouett\u00e9''.\n\n===Frapp\u00e9===\n[[File:Santavuori-balettia-kaikille-frappe.png|thumb|Frapp\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|f\u0281ape}}; 'struck.')  Abbreviation of ''battement frapp\u00e9.''  Action of extending the working foot out from cou-de-pied.  In Cecchetti, RAD, and American ballet, on flat, this action involves brushing a flexed (or non-pointed relaxed) foot from cou-de-pied through the floor, the ball of the foot (lightly) striking as extending out pointed through d\u00e9gag\u00e9.  In the Russian school, a pointed foot at cou-de-pied extends directly out to d\u00e9gag\u00e9 height without brushing through the floor.  On demi-pointe, Cecchetti employs the Russian style of non-brushed pointed foot directly out.  Other schools may use a flexed foot without the strike or a non-brushed pointed foot on demi-pointe.\n\nFrapp\u00e9s are commonly done in singles, doubles, or triples.  Double and triple frapp\u00e9s involve tapping the foot (flexed or pointed) at both cou-de-pied devant (or wrapped) and derri\u00e8re before extending out. (E.g. Double frapp\u00e9 front would be cou-de-pied back, cou-de-pied front, d\u00e9gag\u00e9 front.  Double frapp\u00e9 back would be front, back, [d\u00e9gag\u00e9] back.  Triple frapp\u00e9 front would be front, back, front, [d\u00e9gag\u00e9] front.)\n\n===Fifth position===\n\nA posture in which the feet are turned outward. With one foot in the front and one in the back, you\u2019ll make fifth position. The front foot is usually facing horizontal while the back foot is diagonal. It does not matter which foot is in the front or back, as long as they are turned out. You can do [[pirouette]]s, [[changement]]s, [[#Frapp\u00e9|frapp\u00e9]]s, [[Glossary of ballet#Pli\u00e9|plies]], and much more with fifth position.\n\n==G==\n\n===Glissade===\n({{IPA-fr|\u0261lisad}}; literally 'glide.')

The front leg brushes straight into the air in a ''grand battement'', as opposed to from ''d\u00e9velopp\u00e9'' (or an unfolding motion). The back leg follows making the splits in the air. It can be performed ''en avant'' (forward), ''\u00e0 la seconde'' (to the side), ''en arri\u00e8re'' (backward), and ''en tournant'' (turning en dedans).

A dance, or a suite of dances as in ''[[grand pas]]''.\n\n===Pas de basque===\n({{IPA-fr|p\u0251 d(\u0259) bask}}; 'step of the [[Basque people|Basques]].') Halfway between a step and a leap, taken on the floor (''gliss\u00e9'') or with a jump (''saut\u00e9''); it can be done moving toward the front or toward the back. This step can also be found in [[Scottish highland dance]].\n\nStarting in fifth position ''crois\u00e9'', a dancer executes a ''pli\u00e9'' while brushing the downstage leg out to ''tendu'' front. The downstage leg does a ''demi rond de jambe'' to the opposite corner while the body turns to face that corner.  Weight is quickly transferred to that brushed leg, now upstage, allowing the dancer to pass the newly downstage leg through [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]] via a ''chass\u00e9 pass\u00e9'' to fourth devant, ending ''crois\u00e9'' the new corner, and finishing by bringing the upstage leg in to close fifth.\n\n===Pas de bourr\u00e9e===\n[[File:Pas de bourr\u00e9e, jazz dance technique.webm|thumb|[[Jazz dance]] pas de bourr\u00e9e, which differs slightly from ballet {{Clarify|date=March 2016}}]]\n({{IPA-fr|p\u0251 d(\u0259) bu\u0281e}}; 'step of [[bourr\u00e9e]].')

Generally used to refer to ''retir\u00e9 pass\u00e9'', indicating passing the foot of the working leg past the knee of the supporting leg (on, below, or above) from back to front or front to back. ''Retir\u00e9 pass\u00e9'' may initiate or complete by sliding the working foot up or down the supporting leg from or to the floor, may be executed directly from an open position such as in ''pirouette'' from fourth, or may transition from knee to another position such as ''arabesque'' or ''attitude'' (as in ''d\u00e9velopp\u00e9'').  A [[#Chass\u00e9|chass\u00e9]] can also pass through from back to front as in (''sissonne'') [[#Failli|failli]]: ''chass\u00e9 pass\u00e9.''\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pench\u00e9===\n[[File:Ballet Teresa Carre\u00f1o.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.6|Arabesque pench\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|p\u0251\u0303\u0283e}}; 'tilted'.)

A small jump, in which the feet do not change positions in mid-air; also called ''temps lev\u00e9 saut\u00e9'' in the Vaganova vocabulary.\n\n===Piqu\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|pike}}; meaning 'pricked.') A movement in which the raised, pointed foot of the working leg is lowered so that it pricks the floor and then either rebounds upward (as in ''battement piqu\u00e9'') or becomes a supporting foot.  In the latter case, it may be used to transfer a stance from one leg to the other by stepping out directly onto an ''en pointe'' or ''demi-pointe'' foot and often immediately precedes a movement that entails elevating the new working leg, such as a ''piqu\u00e9 [[#Arabesque|arabesque]]''.\n\nIn Cecchetti and RAD, the term [[#Pos\u00e9|pos\u00e9]] is used instead of ''piqu\u00e9'' outside of the battement: ''piqu\u00e9 arabesque'' and ABT ''piqu\u00e9 turn/tour piqu\u00e9'' (''en dedans'') / Rus. ''tour d\u00e9gag\u00e9'' = RAD/Cecc. ''pos\u00e9 arabesque'' and ''pos\u00e9 turn/pos\u00e9 en tournant''.\n\n===Piqu\u00e9 turn===\nA ''tour piqu\u00e9'' or piqu\u00e9 turn is a traveling turn executed by the leg stepping out onto an en pointe or demi-pointe foot becoming the supporting leg while the working leg moves from pli\u00e9 to retir\u00e9 derri\u00e8re, if an en dedans turn, or retir\u00e9 devant, if an en dehors turn.  In fast piqu\u00e9 turns, petit retir\u00e9 may be executed instead (i.e. working foot at cou-de-pied).  Most commonly done en dedans, piqu\u00e9 turns en dehors are also referred to as ''lame ducks''.\n\n===[[Pirouette]]===\n[[File:Antonio pirouette.gif|thumb|Pirouette]]\n({{IPA-fr|pi\u0281w\u025bt}}) A non-traveling turn on one leg, of one or more rotations, often starting with one or both legs in ''pli\u00e9'' and rising onto ''demi-pointe'' or ''pointe''. The non-supporting leg is generally held in ''[[#Retir\u00e9|retir\u00e9]] devant'' ('front')&mdash;when initiated from fourth, this would be a retir\u00e9 [[#Pass\u00e9|pass\u00e9]]&mdash;but could also be held in other positions such as ''seconde''.  Pirouettes are most often executed ''[[#Dehors, en|en dehors]]'', turning outwards in the direction of the working leg, but can also be done ''[[#Dedans, en|en dedans]]'', turning inwards in the direction of the supporting leg.  (e.g. ''En dehors'' turns clockwise (to the right) if the right leg is working and the left leg supporting/standing.)  [[Spotting (dance technique)|Spotting]] is employed to help maintain balance.  A pirouette may return to its starting position or finish in ''arabesque'' or ''attitude''.\n\nIn other genres of dance, such as jazz or modern, it is common to see pirouettes performed with legs ''parallel'' (i.e. sixth position) instead of turned out as in ballet.\n\n===Pli\u00e9===\n<!--[[Demi-pli\u00e9]] redirects directly here.-->\n[[File:Demi plie.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|Demi-pli\u00e9]]\n({{IPA-fr|plije}}; literally 'bent.') A smooth and continuous bending of the knees outward with the upper body held upright.\n \nIn '''demi-pli\u00e9''', (in a first, second, fourth, and fifth position) a dancer bends the knees while maintaining turnout. While in a demi-plie position one must remember to have proper alignment. Head over shoulders, shoulders over hips over knees and knees over feet. When initiating a demi-plie one must pull up and resist against going down. Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Creating proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward. at the same time engaging your core,(stomach) by pressing your naval towards your spine. The knees bending directly above the line of the toes without releasing the heels from the floor.  As soon as the bottom of the bend is reached, the bend is reversed and the legs are straightened.\n\nIn '''grand pli\u00e9''', (in first, second, fourth, and fifth position) While doing a grand-plie position one must remember to have proper alignment. Head over shoulders, shoulders over hips over knees and knees over feet. When initiating a grand-plie one must pull up and resist against going down. Lengthening from the center and back of the head and pressing down through the floor through the balls of the feet. As you are bending your knees you have to maintain the proper alignment and make sure that the knees are going over the big toe. Heels come off the ground past demi-pli\u00e9 with the feet ending in a demi-pointe at the bottom of the bend. Making sure to create proper turn out by rotating the inner thighs forward and you go down. Making sure to keep the pelvis in line as you go down and up so that you do not release your seat and stick your chest forward, and at the same time engaging your core,(stomach) by pressing your navel towards your spine. As soon as the bottom of the bend is reached, the bend is reversed and the legs are straightened. *Note: Heels do not come up off the floor in a second position.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Pointe, en===\n[[File:EnPointeFoot.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|An ''en pointe'' foot in a [[pointe shoe]]]]\n({{IPA-fr|\u0251\u0303 pw\u025b\u0303t}}) Supporting one's body weight on the tips of the toes, usually while wearing structurally reinforced [[pointe shoe]]s.\n\n===[[Pointe technique]]===\nThe part of classical [[ballet technique]] that concerns pointe work (dancing on the tips of the toes).\n\n===Pointe work===\nPerforming steps while on the tips of the toes, with feet fully extended and wearing [[pointe shoe]]s, a structurally reinforced type of shoe designed specifically for this purpose.

An exercise for the movement of the arms (and in some schools, the upper body) to different positions.  For example, a basic ''port de bras'' exercise could move from fifth ''en bas'' ('low') (i.e. ''bras bas'' or ''preparatory position'') to first arm position, to second arm position, back down to fifth en bas. A full ''port de bras'' could move from ''en bas'' to ''en haut'' ('high', i.e. overhead) and back down.  Port de bras movements vary by school and by action.\n\nThe phrase ''port de bras'' is used in some schools and parts of the world to indicate a bending forward, backward, or circularly of the body at the waist, generally to be followed by bringing the upper body back to center/upright again, e.g. \"port de bras forward,\" \"port de bras back,\" \"circular port de bras/grand port de bras.\"  Bending at the waist is otherwise known as [[#Cambr\u00e9|cambr\u00e9]].\n\n===Pos\u00e9===\n{{IPA-fr|poze}}; A term of the [[Cecchetti method|Cecchetti school]] and RAD.  From a ''fondu'', a dancer steps with a straight leg onto an ''en pointe'' or ''demi-pointe'' foot, then brings the working leg to ''cou-de-pied'', so that if the step is repeated, the working leg will execute a ''petit d\u00e9velopp\u00e9''. This can be done in any direction or turning (the later also known as [[#Piqu\u00e9|tour piqu\u00e9]]).\n\n===[[Position of the arms in ballet|Positions of the arms]]===\n[[Image:Ballet grace.jpg|180px|right|thumb|Arms held in Cecchetti's \"Spanish fourth\" position]]\n\nThere are two basic positions of the arms. In one, the dancer keeps the fingers of both arms almost touching to form an oval/round shape, either near the hips, at navel level, or raised above the dancer's head. In the other, the arms are extended to the sides with the elbows slightly bent. These positions may be combined to give other positions.\n\nDifferent schools, such as Vaganova, French, and Cecchetti, Russian often use different names for similar arm positions.  The Russian school names three arm positions while the other schools name five.\n* Bras bas ('arms low') (RAD)/bras au repos ('at rest') (French), preparatory position (Rus.), or fifth en bas (Cecc.) holds the arms low and slightly rounded near the hip.\n* First position holds the arms round or oval in front of the body somewhere between the naval and breastbone (depending on the school and movement), the fingertips of the hands approaching each other.  In Cecchetti, the hands stay a little lower at tutu height.\n* Second position in all schools holds the arms extended out to the side, the inner part of the upper arm parallel to the ground with the forearms and palms facing the audience.  The roundness and shoulder height of the arms varies by school.\n* Third position in the French/RAD schools holds one arm in second with the other arm in first.  The Russian equivalent of this may be ''petit bras''.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n** Third position in Cecchetti holds one arm in a Cecchetti first and the other arm in ''demi-seconde''.\n** Third position in the Russian school holds both arms slightly rounded overhead.  This is equivalent to fifth position (en haut) in other schools.\n* Fourth position or fourth ''ouvert'' ('open') consists of one arm ''en haut'' ('high,' i.e. raised overhead) and the other open to second position.  This is called ''fourth en haut'' in Cecchetti.  The Russian school does not designate a fourth position; the Russian equivalent may be ''grand bras''.\n** Fourth position ''crois\u00e9'' ('crossed') or ''Spanish fourth'' in Cecchetti consists of one arm ''en haut'' and the other held in first position/Cecchetti ''fifth en avant''.\n* Fifth position in the French/RAD schools and ''fifth en haut'' in Cecchetti holds the arms ''en haut'' slightly rounded, fingertips approaching each other.  This is called third position in the Russian school, which does not designate a fifth (or fourth) position.  Cecchetti also recognizes a ''fifth en bas'', the preparatory/bras bas position in other schools, and a ''fifth en avant'', arms rounded between naval/chest height, known as first position in other schools.\n\nAdditionally:\n* Demi-bras ('half arms') holds the arms between first and second position, outstretched with palms presented towards the audience.\n* Demi-seconde ('half second') holds the arms low out to the side as if grazing the tutu, palms generally down.\n\n===Positions of the body===\nThere are eight to eleven positions of the body in ballet, eight in Cecchetti and RAD and ten or eleven in the Russian and French schools.  The general positions are [[#Crois\u00e9, crois\u00e9e|crois\u00e9]], [[#\u00c0 la quatri\u00e8me|\u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me]], [[#Effac\u00e9, effac\u00e9e|effac\u00e9]], [[#\u00c0 la seconde|\u00e0 la seconde]], [[#\u00c9cart\u00e9|\u00e9cart\u00e9]], and [[#\u00c9paul\u00e9|\u00e9paul\u00e9]]. Cecchetti and RAD's eight include ''crois\u00e9 devant, \u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me devant, effac\u00e9 (devant), \u00e0 la seconde, crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re, \u00e9cart\u00e9, \u00e9paul\u00e9,'' and ''\u00e0 la quatri\u00e8me derri\u00e8re''.  The Russian school further divides ''effac\u00e9'' and ''\u00e9paul\u00e9'' into ''effac\u00e9 devant, effac\u00e9 derri\u00e8re, \u00e9paul\u00e9 devant'', and ''\u00e9paul\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'', and the Russian arm positions on ''crois\u00e9 derri\u00e8re'' are the converse of Cecchetti/RAD's.  In addition, the French school further divides ''\u00e9cart\u00e9'' into ''\u00e9cart\u00e9 devant'' and ''\u00e9cart\u00e9 derri\u00e8re''.\n\n===[[Positions of the feet in ballet|Positions of the feet]]===\nThe standard, basic placements of feet on the floor. Modern-day classical ballet employs five positions, known as the [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Second position|second position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Third position|third position]], [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Fourth position|fourth position]], and [[Positions of the feet in ballet#Fifth position|fifth position]].\n\n===Pulling Up===\nPulling up is critical to the simple act of rising up on balance and involves the use of the entire body. The feeling of being simultaneously grounded and \"pulled up\" is necessary for many steps in ballet. To pull up, a dancer must lift the ribcage and sternum but keep the shoulders down, relaxed and centered over the hips, which requires use of the abdominal muscles. In addition, the dancer must stabilize the pelvis, maintaining a neutral position, and keep the back straight to avoid arching and going off balance.\n\n===Petite Battement===\n\nPetite [[battement]] is when a ballet dancer swiftly moves his/her leg in front then behind their calf. This motion is normally done at the [[Barre (ballet)|barre]] during warm-up.

A working foot should be straight to the side and mildly winged to the front or back.\n\n===Sissonne===\n[[File:Sissonne.ogg|thumb|Sissones]]\n({{IPA-fr|sis\u0254n}}) A jump done from two feet to one foot. Named after the originator of the step. In a ''sissonne over'' (''dessus'') the back foot closes in front, and in a ''sissonne under'' (''dessous'') the front foot closes behind. Sissonnes finishing on two feet include the sissonne ferm\u00e9e, sissonne tomb\u00e9e, and sissonne fondue.\n\n===Soubresaut===\n({{IPA-fr|sub\u0281\u0259so}}) A sudden spring or small jump from both feet, traveling forward in either first, third, or fifth position and landing on both feet in the same position as they started.\n\n===Sous-sous===\n({{IPA-fr|su su}}; literally 'under-under.')  A [[#Relev\u00e9|relev\u00e9]], or rise, into a tight fifth position, feet touching and ankles crossed, giving the appearance of one foot with two heels.  A term from the Cecchetti school, '''sus-sous''' ('over-under') is the equivalent term in the French and Russian schools.<ref>Grant, Gail. ''Technical Manual and Dictionary of Classical Ballet,'' Third Revised Edition, Dover Publications, Inc., 1982, p. 113.</ref>\n\n===Soutenu en tournant===\n({{IPA-fr|sutny \u0251\u0303 tu\u0281n\u0251\u0303}}; 'sustained.') Similar to ''tours cha\u00een\u00e9s (d\u00e9boul\u00e9s)'', a ''soutenu'' turn is a turn usually done in multiples in quick succession. The dancer first executes a ''demi-pli\u00e9'' while extending the leading leg in ''tendu'', stepping onto that leg en pointe/demi-pointe (making it the standing leg), then bringing the other leg to 5th position in front of the standing leg and finally turning (effectively, an unwinding motion).  At the end of the rotation, the originally crossed-over foot in front should now be in 5th position behind.\n\nCommon abbreviation of ''assembl\u00e9 soutenu en tournant'' (Cecc.).  This is known as a ''glissade en tourant'' in the Russian school.\n\nWhen done at the barre en demi-pointe to switch sides, only half a turn is done instead of a full turn, and the foot does not extend out into tendu.  Differs from a ''d\u00e9tourn\u00e9'' in that there is a repositioning of the feet on finishing (and a crossing action, if not initiated in 5th) vs. just a pivot to half turn.\n\n===[[Split (gymnastics)|Split]]===\nA configuration of the legs in which the legs are extended in opposite directions, either to the side (''straddle'' split) or with one leg forward and the other back (''front'' split).  This is employed in various movements, including [[#grand jet\u00e9|grand jet\u00e9]] and [[#arabesque|arabesque pench\u00e9e]].\n\n===Sur le cou-de-pied===\n({{IPA-fr|sy\u0281 l\u0259 ku d\u0259 pje}}; literally 'on the neck of the foot.') The arched working foot is placed wrapped at the part of the leg between the base of the calf and the beginning of the ankle. On the accent devant (front), the heel of the working foot is placed in front of the leg, while the toes point to the back, allowing the instep (''cou-de-pied'' in French) of the working foot to hug the lower leg. On the accent derri\u00e8re (back), the heel of the working leg is placed behind the leg with the toes pointing to the back. The action of alternating between devant and derri\u00e8re is seen in a [[Glossary of ballet#Battement|petit battement]].\n\n==T==\n\n===Tendu===\n[[File:Santavuori-balettia-kaikille-tendu.png|thumb|Tendu exercise at a [[Barre (ballet)|barre]]]]\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303dy}}; literally 'stretched.') Gradually extending the working leg to the front (''tendu [[#Devant|devant]]''), side, or back, passing from flat to demi-pointe to point where only the toes are touching the floor (''tendu [[#\u00c0 terre|\u00e0 terre]]''), or only the pointed toes are elevated (''en l'air''). A common abbreviation for [[#Battement|''battement tendu'']].\n\n===Tights===\nMost ballet dancers wear tights in practices and performances unless in some contemporary and character dances or variations.\n\n===Temps lev\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303 l(\u0259)ve}}; literally 'time raised.') A term from the Cecchetti school indicating a hop on one foot while the other is raised in any position. The instep is fully arched when leaving the ground and the spring must come from the pointing of the toe and the extension of the leg after the ''demi-pli\u00e9''.\n\nIn the Cecchetti method, the specifically indicates a spring from fifth position while raising one foot to ''sur le cou-de-pied''. In the Russian and French schools, this is known as ''sissonne simple''.\n\n===Temps lev\u00e9 saut\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303 l(\u0259)ve sote}}; literally 'time raised jumped.')  A term from the Russian school.  This can be executed with both feet from first, second, third, fourth, or fifth position starting with a ''demi-pli\u00e9'', leading to a jump in the air that lands with the feet in the same position as they started. (Otherwise known as simply a ''saut'' or ''saut\u00e9''.)  This can also be performed from one foot, while the other maintains the same position it had before starting the jump (i.e. the same as ''temps lev\u00e9'').\n\n===Temps li\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0251\u0303 lje}}; 'time linked.')  A term indicating the transfer of weight from one leg to another by shifting through to the position without any sort of gliding or sliding movement.\n\n===Tours en l'air===\n[[File:Antonio tours.gif|thumb|Tours en l'air.]]\n({{IPA-fr|tu\u0281z \u0251\u0303 l \u025b\u02d0\u0281}}; literally 'turn in the air.') A jump, typically done by males, with a full rotation in the air. The landing can be on both feet, on one leg with the other extended in ''attitude'' or ''arabesque'', or down on one knee as at the end of a [[Variation (ballet)|variation]]. A single ''tour'' is a 360\u00b0 rotation, a double is 720\u00b0. [[Vaslav Nijinsky]] was known to perform triple ''tours en l'air''.\n\n===Tomb\u00e9===\n({{IPA-fr|t\u0254\u0303be}}; literally 'fallen.') The action of falling, typically used as a lead-in movement to a traveling step, e.g. ''pas de bourr\u00e9e''.  A ''tomb\u00e9 en avant'' begins with a ''coup\u00e9'' to the front moving to a [[#D\u00e9gag\u00e9|d\u00e9gag\u00e9]] to fourth position devant, the extended foot coming down to the floor with the leg en pli\u00e9, shifting the weight of the body onto the front leg and lifting the back leg off the floor in d\u00e9gag\u00e9 (to fourth derri\u00e8re).  A ''tomb\u00e9'' through second starts with a d\u00e9gag\u00e9 of the leading leg to second position, the leading foot coming to the floor with the leg in pli\u00e9, and the trailing leg lifting off the floor in d\u00e9gag\u00e9 to (the opposite-side) second position.  A ''tomb\u00e9 en avant'' can also be initiated with a small sliding hop instead of a coup\u00e9.\n\nIn the Vaganova school, the full term is ''sissonne ouverte tomb\u00e9e''.\n\n===Triple Runs===\nOne big step, followed by two little steps, that can be done in a circle.\n\n===[[Turnout (ballet)|Turnout]]===\n[[File:First position turned out.jpg|thumb|Turnout in [[Positions of the feet in ballet#First position|first position]] of the feet]]\nRotation of the legs at the hips, resulting in knees and feet facing away from each other.\n\n===[[Ballet tutu|Tutu]]===\nA classic ballet skirt, typically flat at the waist or hip level, made of several layers of tulle or tarlatan.\n\nTendu Passe\n\n==U==\n\n==V==\n\n===[[Variation (ballet)|Variation]] ===\nA solo dance.\n\n===[[Virtuoso (ballet)|Virtuoso]] ===\nA dancer with great technical ability and skill.\n\n==W==\n\n===Waltz===\nA sequence of steps performed in sync with [[waltz music]], as in ''pas de waltz en tournant''.\n\n{{compact ToC|top=yes|seealso=yes|refs=yes|extlinks=yes}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dance basic topics]]\n* [[Glossary of dance moves]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Grant>{{cite book\n| first=Gail\n| last=Grant\n| year=1982\n| title=Technical Manual and Dictionary of Classical Ballet\n| edition=3rd revised\n| publisher=Dover Publications\n| location=New York\n| isbn=0-486-21843-0\n| oclc=8756882\n| url=https://archive.org/details/technicalmanuald00gail\n}}</ref>\n<ref name=Vaganova>{{cite book\n| first=Agrippina\n| last=Vaganova\n| year=1969\n| title=Basic Principles of Classical Ballet: Russian Ballet Technique\n| others=Trans.
