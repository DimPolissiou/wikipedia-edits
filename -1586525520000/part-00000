This is due to the smaller screen size, the new [[system on a chip|SoC]] hardware being used, and the removal of certain power-consuming features such as HD Rumble and the [[Infrared|IR]] camera that are included on regular Joy-Con controllers.<ref name=\"theverge fcc lite\">{{cite web | url = https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/5/20755253/nintendo-switch-lite-smaller-battery-new-processor-fcc-filings | title = Nintendo Switch Lite FCC filings confirm a smaller battery, new processor, and Odin fixation | first = Cameron | last = Faulkner | date = August 5, 2019 | accessdate = August 5, 2019 | work = [[The Verge]] }}</ref>\n\n===Limitations===\nThe Switch Lite natively supports only games that can be played in handheld mode, retaining features like the Switch's [[Accelerometer#Consumer electronics|gyroscopic sensors]] and Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and [[Near-field communication|NFC]] compatibility.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

The [[noisy miner]] (''Manorina melanocephala'') is a winner of these human-altered landscapes, and is quite aggressive towards other small [[insectivores]], such as the jacky winter. The jacky winter suffers quite negatively from the presence of the noisy miner, as it cannot outcompete it for food resources. The noisy miner has quite a negative impact on tree health, which also limits the availability of suitable nesting material for the jacky winter.<ref>Debus, S. J. S. 2008.

The jacky winter is instead a [[sexually monomorphic]] bird, which means that both the male and female are almost identical in appearance.<ref name=\"wood\" /> Rather than plumage playing a significant role in attracting the opposite sex, the jacky winter male uses song to attract a female during courtship.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In the eastern states of Australia, the jacky winter breeds mostly to the west of the Great Dividing Range, where a suitable habitat of eucalyptus woodland is present. They build a small, open cup-shaped [[nest]], which is often made from grass and bark strips held together by spider webs. The nest is built in an exposed position, usually on a fork of a branch.<ref name=\"wood\" />\n\nThe breeding season of jacky winters occurs from September to November. Leading up to September, singing from the males is at its highest peak, then as the [[nestlings]] are born around late September, the singing becomes quite minimal.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> In late October, the singing increases again, lasting until early November, when the females lay a second [[brooding|brood]] of the season. By late November with the hatching of the young, the males stop singing, making vocalisations almost non-existent from then on. It stays like this until the birds have left the area.<ref name=\"Kea\" /> The nesting period lasts for 15 to 20 days, while the [[Egg incubation|incubation]] is between 16 and 18 days. Only the female will [[Egg incubation|incubate]] the eggs, while the male will help feed the young once they have hatched. 92 per cent of the time, the female will lay only two eggs per clutch.<ref name=\"wood\" />  It is uncommon for this number to vary, since many different [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors determine the number of eggs per clutch in order to maximize the survival rate of fledglings from the nest.<ref>Winkler, D.

The jacky winter seems to favour habitats for breeding that contain a [[eucalyptus]] box woodland or open box woodland, which have patches of box trees and isolated live trees. Fallen logs and stumps are also favoured in habitat selection.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter holds these territories by perching on top of these eucalyptus trees and keeping a regular sustained call. The breeding density of jacky winters is about 17.2&nbsp;ha for one pair.<ref name=\"wood\" /> The jacky winter is known to defend their territory all year around.<ref name=\"reid\" />\n\n== Status ==\n\nThe jacky winter is a common species of bird found throughout [[Australia]], and is described as a bird of [[least concern]] by the [[IUCN]] (International Union for Conservation of Nature).

The jacky winter suffers quite negatively from the presence of the noisy miner, as it cannot outcompete it for food resources.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers.

Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once.

Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]]. Rimmer's father also stretched his sons on a [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]] machine to make them taller, causing Frank to be 6'5\" by the time he was eleven.

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''Blue Midget'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

After receiving a distress signal, Rimmer refuses to respond, deciding their too old to be embarking on new adventures, ordering Kryten to erase the memory of receiving it from his memory. After being banished off ''Red Dwarf'' by the newly-rebooted Holly (void of his old memories and personality), the crew eventually come across a ship possessing new and powerful technology, specifically related to holograms. Against Kryten's initial warnings, Rimmer is upgraded to 'Dimaond Light', which grants his superpowers; however, Rimmer is quickly depleted of power and returns to his old form, now forced to be \"plugged-in\" to several power leads to stay online. After encountering three cat clerics, fleeing from their fellow felis sapiens under the command of warlord Rodon, who board the station. Rimmer alongside the crew are taken hostage briefly until Rodon, now at a distance, fires on the ship and allows the crew to escape.\n\nCrashing on a desert moon, Rimmer is forced to power down further as he's considered a nonessential resource, going into a [[black-and-white]] state. Whilst the crew are chased by Rodon's battlecruiser, Cat angrily insists Rimmer is a simple machine. Rimmer rejects this initially, quoting \"[[cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore, I am]]\", however quickly loses confidence in this and enters an existential crisis. After the crew successfully escape into a sandstorm, Rimmer is comforted by Lister, who compares their dynamic to the sun and moon, producing moonlight even though the moon cannot initially generate it itself. By morning, the crew discover their buried under the sand, however Rimmer formulates a plan to contact the rebooted Holly, which Kryten manages using an antenna extension from his hand. Rimmer tricks the rebooted Holly into downloading his former incarnation's memories, with the rebooted Holly believing he'll inherit his \"wisdom\" from all the years he was alive. After doing so, the restored Holly rescues the crew and they manage to return to ''Red Dwarf''. However, the felis sapiens under Rodon are waiting for them, and Rodon orders their deaths by planting a bomb on ''Red Dwarf''. Using the acquired Anubis Stone attained from the cat clerics, they once again transform Rimmer into his former \"Diamond Light\" incarnation, who uses his powers to dispose of the bomb off ''Red Dwarf'', and subsequently helps bring down Rodon's main battlecruiser in the following confrontation.\n\nKryten, in a state of disrepair since the beginning of the story, is now on his last legs. After some convincing of a very hesitant \"Diamond Light\" Rimmer, he decides to use his Anubis Stone on Kryten to save his life, though stripping him of his superpowers.

Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires.

However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment.

Portrayed as a snobbish and self-centered character, Rimmer is unpopular with his crewmates, and is often the target of insults and general ridicule.\n\nAfter he is killed by a radiation leak during an [[ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipsis]] in the series' first episode \"[[The End (Red Dwarf)|The End]]\" (1988) Rimmer is present for most of the series as a computer-generated [[Holography|hologram]], indicated by the \u2018H\u2019 symbol on his forehead. From series I-V, Rimmer is intangible as a hologram and unable to interact with his environment, referred to in-universe as 'soft-light'; come the series VI episode \"[[Legion (Red Dwarf)|Legion]]\" (1993), Rimmer is upgraded as a 'hard-light' hologram where he is now able to interact with his surroundings as well as being essentially indestructible, yet still able to feel pain. Following the character's departure in the series VII episode \"[[Stoke Me a Clipper]]\" (1997), Rimmer is absent from the show until series VIII, where a flesh and blood version of Rimmer is shown having been resurrected by [[nanobot]]s with no memory of the hologrammatic Rimmer's experiences and only those of Rimmer prior to the radiation leak in the first episode. However, following a ten-year hiatus after series VIII, the character reappeared as a hologram in the miniseries ''[[Red Dwarf: Back to Earth|Back to Earth]]'' (2009) onward.\n\nIt remains unclear whether this incarnation of Rimmer seen in ''Back to Earth'' and later series is the original hologram from series I-VII or a hologram of the Rimmer introduced in series VIII that was resurrected through [[nanotechnology]]. The fictional world of ''Red Dwarf'' would also allow for the possibility of Rimmer's latest incarnation being an amalgamation of the memories of both.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=M-Corp |episode-link=M-Corp (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 November 2017 |season= |series-no=XII |number=5 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Grant Naylor|creators]] of the series acknowledge that Rimmer's [[surname]] comes from a snobby [[Prefect#Academic|prefect]] with whom they attended school.

As a technician, Rimmer does maintenance work on [[vending machine]]s that not even the robots are assigned to. Rimmer is shown having difficulty revising for his \"engineer's exam\" which he hopes to pass and become an officer after having failed before prior to the episode, and reveals that he wasn't academy educated unlike others who had become officers. After Lister is awakened from [[Stasis (fiction)|stasis]], where he was put as punishment for bringing an unquarantined cat on board, the ship's computer [[Holly (Red Dwarf)|Holly]] ([[Norman Lovett]]) tells Lister that the ship's crew died in a radiation leak from a drive plate Rimmer had improperly repaired and Lister was kept in stasis until the radiation levels returned to normal three million years later. Rimmer is depicted as having been brought back to life as a [[hologram]], having the same drives, feelings and emotions as the living Rimmer, but being unable to touch anything.

Lister later asks Rimmer where the disc which contains Navigation Officer [[Kristine Kochanski]]'s ([[Clare Grogan|C P Grogan]]) hologram has been hidden so that Lister could go on a date with her, but Rimmer refuses to switch his own disc off to bring back Kochanski for an evening due to the risk that Lister might not turn Rimmer's hologram on again.<ref name=\"balance\">{{Cite episode |title=Balance of Power |episode-link=Balance of Power (Red Dwarf) |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |author-link2=Doug Naylor |last2=Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=29 February 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=3 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Holly has the ability to override Rimmer and switch his disc off but cannot do so because Rimmer outranks Lister and he is programmed to prioritise the former's orders over the latter's.<ref name=\"balance\" />\n\nIn \"[[Confidence and Paranoia]]\" (1988), Lister believes that the only reason that Rimmer became a part of the love celibacy society was because he couldn't get a date, and he could never get a date because Rimmer's mum bought all of Rimmer's casual clothes. Rimmer denies this, pointing out he went to bed with Yvonne McGruder, but Lister says she thought Rimmer was someone else due to her wonky vision from a [[concussion]]. Lister, with the help of a solid manifestation of Lister's confidence (played by [[Craig Ferguson]]), deduces where Kochanski's personality disc is hidden as well as a means of how the ship can power two holograms at once.

Rimmer's double reveals that all of Rimmer's brothers, but not Rimmer, were academy educated. Rimmer claims that this was because his father couldn't afford it. Rimmer also mentions taking a film course at [[night school]], although he confuses a cartoon showing at the cinema in the episode with ''[[Citizen Kane]]''. Lister watches a video of Rimmer's death, where his last words are \"[[gazpacho soup]]\". Demonstrating intense, literal [[self-hatred]], the second cruelly insults and berates the first. Believing that Lister is going to wipe his hologram anyway because of the two Rimmers' constant arguing, Rimmer explained his dying remark as referring to  a dinner at the captain's table with six officers, during which he made a ''faux pas'' where he had his gazpacho soup taken away to be brought back hot, not realising that gazpacho soup is meant to be served cold. This caused the officers at the table to laugh at him, and he was never invited back. The incident haunted Rimmer for the rest of his life (and beyond). Gradually, his obsession over the incident caused him to remember it as the most disastrous, imbecilic action of his life, and it undermined his self-esteem out of all proportion. Lister, displaying deep empathy, tried to comfort Rimmer, assuring him that \"anybody could make a mistake like that.\" His confession complete, Rimmer prepares to be wiped, but Lister wipes the second Rimmer instead; Lister had allowed Rimmer to believe his \"death\" was imminent because Lister wanted to know what the \"gazpacho soup\" remark meant, and he knew that Rimmer would never tell him any other circumstances.<ref name=\"me squared\">{{Cite episode |title=Me\u00b2 |episode-link=Me\u00b2 |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Rob |last=Grant |author-link=Rob Grant |first2=Doug (writers) |last2=Naylor |author-link2=Doug Naylor |first3=Ed (director) |last3=Bye |author-link3=Ed Bye |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC2]] |city= |date=21 March 1988 |season= |series-no=I |number=6 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\nDespite \"Future Echoes\" having previously suggested that Rimmer's father killed himself, according to a letter received from Rimmer's mother in \"[[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf)|Better Than Life]]\" (1988), Rimmer's father (played by [[John Abineri]]) had died peacefully in his sleep and Rimmer appeared unaware about how his father had died before Lister read out to Rimmer what his letter said. Rimmer's backstory in this episode revealed that Rimmer had hated his father, who had fixated on Rimmer and his three brothers to join the Space Corps and become officers when Rimmer's father had been rejected for being an inch below regulation height. To this end, he refused to allow them to eat unless they could answer complicated astronavigation questions. This led to Rimmer almost dying of [[malnutrition]].

After Rimmer is late for a lecture, Lecturer Rimmer uses Rimmer as a test subject in a social experiment regarding [[peer pressure]]. Three million years later, the hologrammatic Rimmer is seen on board ''Blue Midget'' being given the task of planning out a defensive strategy against a Simulant attack fleet; after failing to come up with one, Rimmer plays a recorded message from Lecturer Rimmer in an attempt to escape his feeling of being weighed down by his father's expectations. In the message Lecturer Rimmer, thinking that by now Arnold has achieved enough, reveals that Arnold is not his son, but that his real father was the family gardener Dungo. This revelation liberates Rimmer from the spectre of his lineage on the grounds that he has accomplished a great deal by the standards set by his biological father, and he is able to formulate a successful plan of attack that destroys the Simulant vessels before returning to ''Red Dwarf''.\n\nIt is strongly implied in this episode that this version of Rimmer remembers dying from the radiation leak but also remembers saving the ship from the corrosive micro-organism that was devouring it in the episode \"Only the Good...\".

Rimmer accidentally creates a monstrous amalgamation of Rimmers (also played by Barrie) that absorbs all the other Rimmers apart from the original.

After multiple attempts at finding a suitable universe, Rimmer arrives in a universe where he is alive, married and a navigation officer.

After receiving a distress signal, Rimmer refuses to respond, deciding their too old to be embarking on new adventures, ordering Kryten to erase the memory of receiving it from his memory. After being banished off ''Red Dwarf'' by the newly-rebooted Holly (void of his old memories and personality), the crew eventually come across a ship possessing new and powerful technology, specifically related to holograms. Against Kryten's initial warnings, Rimmer is upgraded to 'Dimaond Light', which grants his superpowers; however, Rimmer is quickly depleted of power and returns to his old form, now forced to be \"plugged-in\" to several power leads to stay online. After encountering three cat clerics, fleeing from their fellow felis sapiens under the command of warlord Rodon, who board the station. Rimmer alongside the crew are taken hostage briefly until Rodon, now at a distance, fires on the ship and allows the crew to escape.\n\nCrashing on a desert moon, Rimmer is forced to power down further as he's considered a nonessential resource, going into a [[black-and-white]] state. Whilst the crew are chased by Rodon's battlecruiser, Cat angrily insists Rimmer is a simple machine. Rimmer rejects this initially, quoting \"[[cogito, ergo sum|I think, therefore, I am]]\", however quickly loses confidence in this and enters an existential crisis. After the crew successfully escape into a sandstorm, Rimmer is comforted by Lister, who compares their dynamic to the sun and moon, producing moonlight even though the moon cannot initially generate it itself. By morning, the crew discover their buried under the sand, however Rimmer formulates a plan to contact the rebooted Holly, which Kryten manages using an antenna extension from his hand. Rimmer tricks the rebooted Holly into downloading his former incarnation's memories, with the rebooted Holly believing he'll inherit his \"wisdom\" from all the years he was alive. After doing so, the restored Holly rescues the crew and they manage to return to ''Red Dwarf''. However, the felis sapiens under Rodon are waiting for them, and Rodon orders their deaths by planting a bomb on ''Red Dwarf''. Using the acquired Anubis Stone attained from the cat clerics, they once again transform Rimmer into his former \"Diamond Light\" incarnation, who uses his powers to dispose of the bomb off ''Red Dwarf'', and subsequently helps bring down Rodon's main battlecruiser in the following confrontation.\n\nKryten, in a state of disrepair since the beginning of the story, is now on his last legs. After some convincing of a very hesitant \"Diamond Light\" Rimmer, he decides to use his Anubis Stone on Kryten to save his life, though stripping him of his superpowers. However, Rimmer is given a final boost when the felis sapiens, freed of Rodon's rule, decide to worship him, having their armada manifest into a large 'H'.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=The Promised Land |episode-link=Red Dwarf: The Promised Land |url= |access-date= |series=Red Dwarf |series-link=Red Dwarf |first=Doug (writer/director) |last=Naylor |author-link=Doug Naylor |network=[[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] |station= |date=9 April 2020 |season= |series-no=XIII |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref>\n\n=== Novels ===\nIn ''[[Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers]]'' (1989), Rimmer is a First Technician.

Instead the radiation leak is an entirely unrelated event caused by the negligence of a navigation officer.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=2 November 1989 |title=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |title-link=Red Dwarf: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page=46 |isbn=0-14-012437-3  |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Better Than Life]]'' (1990), similar to the [[Better Than Life (Red Dwarf episode)|episode of the same name]], the crew play Better Than Life, an extremely addictive [[virtual reality]] video game that slowly kills the user through tantalizing their yearnings by utilizing the user's [[subconscious]] desires. The crew slowly become engrossed in their individual fantasies, with Rimmer imagining himself as gaining enormous fame and adoration upon the crew's return to Earth and earning billions from memoirs and other deals. However, Rimmer's subconscious, unable to cope with good things happening to him, corrupts the game to make Rimmer's fantasy and later the other crew's fantasies go terribly wrong and make them want to leave the game. After Lister is trapped on another planet for over thirty years while the rest of the crew are trapped in the time dilation of a black hole, the now-sixty-year-old Lister has a heart attack while confronting a Polymorph, but Holly gives Rimmer instructions on how they can bring Lister back to life by taking him to a universe where time flows backwards.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Grant |author-link=Grant Naylor |date=25 October 1990 |title=Better Than Life |title-link=Better Than Life |url= |location=[[London]] |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nThe two novels follow divergent paths after the crew retrieve Lister from the backwards reality. \n\nIn ''[[Last Human]]'' (1995), Rimmer's one-night stand with Yvonne McGruder led to the birth of a son. Unbeknownst to either, there truly was mutual attraction, but both decided to wait for the other to make the first move after that one night- Rimmer to prove a point and McGruder because she was delusional due to her concussion- leading to their going separate ways. Yvonne transferred off ''Red Dwarf'' where she had Michael McGruder, who was born prior to the radiation leak that killed Rimmer and most of the crew onboard ''Red Dwarf''. She would tell him false stories of his father's courageous acts of valour and through these fictitious tales McGruder was inspired to become a Space Corps Marine and sign-up for a dangerous mission on board the ''Mayflower'', a large spaceship with [[terraformation]] capabilities, with the potential prospect of meeting his father, who via the [[black box]] of ''Red Dwarf'' he learned was resurrected as a hologram to keep the sole survivor, Lister, sane.\n\nFollowing a series of events, Lister had spent a period of time alongside McGruder and a handful of survivors from the ''Mayflower'', separate from the main crew of Rimmer, Kochanski, Cat, and Kryten. Upon their reunion with Lister, Rimmer was introduced to McGruder by Lister, who fainted at first glimpse of Rimmer, who also fainted when told who McGruder was. Later, encouraged by Lister, Rimmer confessed he was not the hero McGruder was told he was by his mother and that he should look up to her instead. However, McGruder was distraught by this and left, later being held hostage by Lister's Other Self, an evil doppelganger of the real Lister. Rimmer would choke when given the opportunity to incapacitate Lister's Other Self and was also taken hostage, further disappointing McGruder.\n\nImprisoned, Rimmer, with the help of Kryten, escapes and equips himself with a weapon he uses to defend the crew from Lister's Other Self, gaining the respect of Lister, Kochanski, and McGruder, but is shot through the light-bee and critically injured in the process. The crew manage to dispatch of Lister's Other Self but are quickly confronted by the Rage, a [[holism|gestalt]] manifestation of pure anger, which threatens to destroy everything in its path, including the crew. Rimmer, via his light-bee, volunteers to deliver the Oblivion Virus, the antidote able to eliminate the Rage. Kryten uploads in onto Rimmer's light-bee and as the crew take refuge in nearby caves Rimmer flings himself into the gestalt, killing it. Following this, the crew set up a search-party, headed by McGruder, to retrieve Rimmer's light-bee and hopefully bring him back.<ref>{{cite book |last=Naylor |first=Doug |author-link=Doug Naylor |date=1995 |title=Last Human |title-link=Last Human |url= |location= |publisher=[[Viking Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Backwards (novel)|Backwards]]'' (1996), after the crew spend a decade trapped on the backwards Earth, they return to their universe to find that ''Red Dwarf'' has been stolen and Holly basically destroyed by the [[List of Red Dwarf concepts#Simulants|Agonoids]], a race of [[misanthropic]] robots. The crew gain a brief ally in the form of Ace Rimmer, an alternate and dynamic version of Rimmer who arrived in their world in a dimension-hopping prototype ship, but Ace subsequently sacrifices himself to save Lister from an Agonoid. When one Agonoid kills the rest of his race so that he can be the one to torture Lister, the crew are able to expel him into deep space, but the agonoid is able to infect ''Starbug'' with the Armageddon Virus before they can return to ''Red Dwarf''. In an attempt to fight it, Kryten purposely contracts it himself and, in a simulation of the [[American frontier|American wild west]], is the sheriff of a small town in a battle against the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse|Apocalypse Boys]], the simulated manifestation of the Armageddon Virus. Rimmer, alongside Lister and Cat, enter the simulation to help Kryten. However, the Apocalypse Boys prove stronger than anticipated and end up melting Rimmer's light-bee and destroying Kryten, as well as rending ''Starbug'' inoperable. With nothing left to keep them in this reality, Lister and the Cat use Ace's ship to travel to another reality where their counterparts died while playing ''Better Than Life'' but Rimmer and Kryten are still alive. \n\nIn the abridged audiobook, as read by author [[Rob Grant]], the wild west simulation section is cut and instead Rimmer's light-bee is sucked into deep space following a hostage crisis with the Agonoid, Djuhn'Keep, onboard ''Starbug''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Grant |first=Rob |author-link=Rob Grant |date=1996 |title=Backwards |title-link=Backwards (Red Dwarf) |url= |location= |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}</ref>\n\n==Personality==\nRimmer's primary character traits include [[anal retentive|anal-retentiveness]], over-adherence to protocol, [[cowardice]], bitterness and a severely inflated ego which is likely a coping mechanism for his deep-seated sense of [[self-loathing]], which he tries but sometimes fails to hide from others.

Kryten further argues that Rimmer only felt guilty for causing the accident because of his delusions about his importance to the mission, comparing him to a front-gate security guard who considers himself corporate head. Kryten then went on to state that Rimmer's only crime is that of being Arnold J. Rimmer, which should also serve as a punishment.

In \"[[Tikka to Ride]]\" (1997), Rimmer protests against abusing the Time Drive and chastises Lister for doing so.\n\n==Appearance==\nRimmer's status as a hologram in most episodes of ''Red Dwarf'' is shown by the 'H' on the centre of his forehead, leading to nicknames from the [[Cat (Red Dwarf)|Cat]], such as \"alphabet head\" and \"[[Goal (sport)#Rugby football|goalpost]] head\". Rimmer keeps his unmanageable hair<ref name=\"the inquisitor\"/> relatively short, deciding that it makes him feel like more of a man.<ref name=\"future echoes\"/> When Lister and the Cat respond to a drill too slowly, Rimmer argues for increased discipline and sensible haircuts, believing that \"every major battle in history has been won by the side with the shortest haircuts\" (resulting in the Cat insulting his hair-do by saying that he has hair like his, just not on his head).<ref name=\"emohawk\"/>\n\nRimmer's Space Corps uniform changes several times during the course of the show. In the first two series it is a grey-and-beige shirt-and-tie ensemble; in Series III and IV this becomes a green suit with a shiny high-collared jacket, which is changed to red in Series V; in Series VI and VII, Rimmer's jacket becomes quilted and is red when he is in soft-light form and blue for hard-light; the alive Rimmer in Series VIII wears an all-beige uniform similar in design to the original.

It is one of the most venerated icons in the [[Upper Volga region]]. Her feast days are March 14 (27) and August 29.\n\n== Church lore ==\nSince the Feodorovskaya follows the same Byzantine ''[[Eleusa]]'' (Tender Mercy) type as the [[Theotokos of Vladimir]], pious legends declared it a copy of that famous image, purportedly created by [[Saint Luke]].  In Greek, ''Theotokos'' means \"God-bearer\".  It is believed that, before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]], the icon was kept in a monastery near the town of [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]]-on-the-[[Volga]]. After the Mongols sacked and burnt the town, the icon disappeared and was given up for lost.<ref name=htc>[http://www.holy-transfiguration.org/library_en/moth_kostroma.html \"Feodorovskaya-Kostroma icon of the Mother of God\", Transfiguration of Our Lord Russian Orthodox Church, Baltimore, Maryland]</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, on 16 August 1239, Prince Vasily of [[Kostroma]] wandered while hunting in a forest.  While trying to find his way out of a thicket, he saw an icon concealed among fir branches.  When he reached out to touch it, the icon mysteriously rose up in the air. The awestruck prince informed the citizens of Kostroma about the miracle he had witnessed and returned with a crowd of people to the forest. They fell prostrate before the icon and prayed to the ''[[Theotokos]]''.  They carried the icon to the city and placed it in the Assumption Cathedral.  A conflagration destroyed the cathedral and most of its icons soon thereafter, but the Feodorovskaya was found intact on the third day after the fire.<ref>For a complete list of the icon's purported miracles, see \u0421\u044b\u0440\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0412.\u0410.

Kostroma, 1908.</ref>\n\nThe people of Gorodets, at a distance to the east from Kostroma, learned about the miracle of the survival of the icon in the fire. They recognized the newly found icon as the one that used to be in their church. Church legends differ as to why the icon was named after Saint [[Theodore Stratelates]] ({{lang-ru|\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442}}, Feodor Stratilat), not to be confused with [[Theodore Tyro]]).

Moscow, 1993.</ref> On the reverse side of the Feodorovskaya is an image representing [[Parascheva of the Balkans|Saint Paraskeva]], a saint whose veneration started in the [[Novgorod Republic]] at the turn of the 13th century. \n\nScholars believe that the image of Saint Paraskeva is contemporaneous with the image of the Theotokos on the other side.  This dating seems to confirm the Novgorodian origin of the icon, as it was only in the 15th century that the veneration of Saint Paraskeva spread to other parts of the country.  The saint's noble dress may indicate that the icon was intended as a wedding gift to a princess whose patron saint was Saint Paraskeva. According to [[Vasily Tatishchev]], the only such princess known in the [[Rurikid]] family was Alexandra of Polotsk, the wife of Saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] of [[Novgorod]].\n\nThe feast day of St. Alexandra coincides with that of Saint Paraskeva (20 March). In the Rurikid family, it was customary for a groom to present his bride an icon representing her patron saint.<ref>For instance, Boris of Volokolamsk ([[Ivan III]]'s brother) presented to his bride, Princess Uliana Kholmskaya, an icon of St. Barbara, who was a likely patron-saint of the princess.

It is said that Nicholas II could not have had a copy from the original image because the icon in Kostroma had blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty.  Indeed, the Romanovs were dethroned four years later during the Russian Revolution.  \n\nUnlike the other great icons of Russia, the ''Feodorovskaya'' was not transferred to a museum, because the image was impossible to discern.  The Black Virgin was given to the sect of ''[[obnovlentsy]]'', which had it restored in Moscow in 1928.  After the sect was dissolved in 1944, the icon reverted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  It deposited the icon in the famous [[Resurrection Church, Kostroma|Resurrection Church]] on the Lowlands in Kostroma.  In 1991 the icon was moved from there to the revived [[Theophany Monastery, Kostroma|Epiphany Cathedral]] in the same city.

It is believed that, before the [[Mongol invasion of Rus]], the icon was kept in a monastery near the town of [[Gorodets, Nizhny Novgorod Oblast|Gorodets]]-on-the-[[Volga]]. After the Mongols sacked and burnt the town, the icon disappeared and was given up for lost.<ref name=htc>[http://www.holy-transfiguration.org/library_en/moth_kostroma.html \"Feodorovskaya-Kostroma icon of the Mother of God\", Transfiguration of Our Lord Russian Orthodox Church, Baltimore, Maryland]</ref>\n\nSeveral months later, on 16 August 1239, Prince Vasily of [[Kostroma]] wandered while hunting in a forest.  While trying to find his way out of a thicket, he saw an icon concealed among fir branches.  When he reached out to touch it, the icon mysteriously rose up in the air. The awestruck prince informed the citizens of Kostroma about the miracle he had witnessed and returned with a crowd of people to the forest. They fell prostrate before the icon and prayed to the ''[[Theotokos]]''.  They carried the icon to the city and placed it in the Assumption Cathedral.  A conflagration destroyed the cathedral and most of its icons soon thereafter, but the Feodorovskaya was found intact on the third day after the fire.<ref>For a complete list of the icon's purported miracles, see \u0421\u044b\u0440\u0446\u043e\u0432 \u0412.\u0410.

They recognized the newly found icon as the one that used to be in their church. Church legends differ as to why the icon was named after Saint [[Theodore Stratelates]] ({{lang-ru|\u0424\u0435\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0440 \u0421\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u043b\u0430\u0442}}, Feodor Stratilat), not to be confused with [[Theodore Tyro]]).

This dating seems to confirm the Novgorodian origin of the icon, as it was only in the 15th century that the veneration of Saint Paraskeva spread to other parts of the country.  The saint's noble dress may indicate that the icon was intended as a wedding gift to a princess whose patron saint was Saint Paraskeva. According to [[Vasily Tatishchev]], the only such princess known in the [[Rurikid]] family was Alexandra of Polotsk, the wife of Saint [[Alexander Nevsky]] of [[Novgorod]].\n\nThe feast day of St. Alexandra coincides with that of Saint Paraskeva (20 March). In the Rurikid family, it was customary for a groom to present his bride an icon representing her patron saint.<ref>For instance, Boris of Volokolamsk ([[Ivan III]]'s brother) presented to his bride, Princess Uliana Kholmskaya, an icon of St. Barbara, who was a likely patron-saint of the princess.

Kostroma, 1997.</ref> The church was consecrated on 24 July 1687.  As the [[Communists]] destroyed the Assumption Cathedral of Yaroslavl during the Russian Revolution, the [[Fyodorovskaya Church]] has served as the cathedral for the city and the archdiocese of [[Rostov]], the oldest in Russia.\n\n[[File:Feodorovskaya 1916.jpeg|thumb|left|150px|Metallic [[khorugv]] (processional banner) of the ''Theotokos of Saint Theodore'', Moscow (1916).]]\n\nAnother copy of the icon has been venerated in Gorodets, especially after the Feodorovsky Monastery was re-established in the early 18th century.  A new copy of the icon was brought to it from Kostroma.  This image was fitted into a [[Riza|golden ''riza'']] inlaid with precious stones, so as to rival the original by its sumptuous decoration.  During the annual [[Makariev Fair]], the icon was brought for veneration to [[Nizhny Novgorod]].<ref>For details about the Gorodets copy, see \u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0413\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0446\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0441\u0442\u044b\u0440\u044f. Nizhny Novgorod, 2002 (reprint of the 1913 edition).</ref>\n\nWhen the tercentenary of the [[Romanov dynasty]] was celebrated in 1913, [[Nicholas II of Russia]] commissioned a copy of the Gorodets icon, which he placed at the Royal Cathedral of Our Lady Saint Theodore, constructed to a design by [[Vladimir Pokrovsky]] in the town of [[Tsarskoye Selo]].  It is said that Nicholas II could not have had a copy from the original image because the icon in Kostroma had blackened so badly that the image was hardly visible.{{cn|date=February 2015}}  This was interpreted as a bad sign for the Romanov dynasty.  Indeed, the Romanovs were dethroned four years later during the Russian Revolution.  The Assumption Cathedral in Kostroma was blown up by the [[Bolsheviks]], but rebuilt in 2005.{{cn|date=February 2015}}\n\nUnlike the other great icons of Russia, the ''Feodorovskaya'' was not transferred to a museum, because the image was impossible to discern.  The Black Virgin was given to the sect of ''[[obnovlentsy]]'', which had it restored in Moscow in 1928.  After the sect was dissolved in 1944, the icon reverted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].  It deposited the icon in the famous [[Resurrection Church, Kostroma|Resurrection Church]] on the Lowlands in Kostroma.  In 1991 the icon was moved from there to the revived [[Theophany Monastery, Kostroma|Epiphany Cathedral]] in the same city.  Recently encased in a new [[chasuble]], the icon is still venerated at the convent associated with the cathedral.{{cn|date=February 2015}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Eleusa icon]]\n\n== References ==\n<references/>\n\n== External links ==\n*{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.pravoslavie.ru/put/040917102757#1 Feodorovskaya icon on the website of the Russian Orthodox Church]\n\n{{Theotokos in Russia}}\n[[Category:Marian apparitions]]\n[[Category:Marian shrines]]\n[[Category:Russian icons]]\n[[Category:12th-century paintings]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox icons of the Virgin Mary|Theodore]]\n[[Category:Vladimir-Suzdal]]\n[[Category:House of Romanov|*]]\n[[Category:Paintings of the Madonna and Child]]\n", "name_user": "JSlip", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eVeneration", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodorovskaya_Icon_of_the_Mother_of_God"}
