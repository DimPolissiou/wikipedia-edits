Development of mass transportation both followed existing economic and population patterns, and helped shape those patterns.\n\nMass transit in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]] began as a family-owned and operated ferry in around 1630.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Ferry Five|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/history/default.asp?id=952|website=MBTA|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref> Ground transportation started in Boston with a private stagecoach operation in 1793.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Omnibus|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/history/default.asp?id=954|website=MBTA|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref> The first rail line, which was horse-powered, began on March 26, 1856.

In order to regulate fares and reduce competition, the General Court of Massachusetts passed the West End Consolidation Act to consolidate the rail line operations.<ref>{{cite web|title=Horsecars on Rails and the West End Street Railway Company|url=http://www.mbta.com/about_the_mbta/history/default.asp?id=956|website=MBTA|accessdate=December 15, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Railroad era begins==\n[[File:1880 Boston railroads map.jpg|thumb|right|Steam railroads in Boston in 1880. From the [[United States Census Bureau]].]]\n\nThe [[steam locomotive]] became practical for mass transportation in the 1810s, and came to the United States in the 1820s. The private [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] was chartered in 1830, connecting Boston to [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], a major northerly mill town (which was also connected via the [[Middlesex Canal]]). It was one of the [[oldest railroads in North America]] and the first major one in Massachusetts. This route marked the beginning of the development of intercity railroads that eventually evolved into the MBTA Commuter Rail system and the Riverside [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]]. Origins of the various rail lines are listed below:\n\n=== [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] ===\nThe '''[[Haverhill Line]]''' was originally chartered as the [[Andover and Wilmington Railroad]] in 1833 and extended to [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]] in 1837 as the [[Andover and Haverhill Railroad]]. The line became the Boston & Maine's first acquisition, as the result of a consolidation of three railroads between Boston and [[Portland, Maine]].\n\n'''[[Lowell Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]], chartered 1830\n\n'''[[Fitchburg Railroad|Fitchburg Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Fitchburg Railroad]], chartered 1842\n\nThe '''[[Newburyport/Rockport Line]]''' was originally chartered as the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] in 1836. The line first opened between [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[East Boston]] in 1838.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern Railroad Company of Massachusetts Records, 1839-1840, 1874-1877|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/sfa/easternrr.htm|website=Harvard Business School|publisher=HBS Baker Library|accessdate=August 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034222/http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/sfa/easternrr.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The railroad expanded until it was running from Portland, Maine to Boston, putting the line in direct competition with the Boston & Maine. In 1884, the Eastern Railroad was leased by the Boston & Maine, ending the competition and leading to an outright purchase in 1900.\n\n===Penn Central===\nThe [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] came into existence in 1968 when the [[New York Central Railroad]] merged with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], absorbing the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] at the beginning of 1969.\n\n====New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad====\n* '''[[Providence/Stoughton Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Providence Railroad]], chartered 1831; Stoughton Branch Railroad portion chartered 1841; Cranston-Wickford Junction portion opened 1837 by the [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]]; Providence connector opened 1848\n* '''[[Fairmount Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Built in 1855 for the [[Norfolk County Railroad]]\n* '''[[Needham Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Inner portion opened 1850 as a branch of the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]], outer portion opened 1853 ([[Charles River Branch Railroad]]), connecting segment opened 1906 by the NYNH&H\n* '''[[Franklin Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Norfolk County Railroad]], opened 1849; later acquired by [[New York and New England Railroad]]\n\n====New York Central Railroad====\n* '''[[Framingham/Worcester Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]], chartered 1831\n\n=== [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony Lines]] ===\nAcquired by the large [[Old Colony Railroad]], much of which was since abandoned, and which later merged into the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] and then the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]].\n* '''[[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Plymouth/Kingston Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Original [[Old Colony Railroad]], opened to Plymouth in 1845\n* '''[[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Middleborough/Lakeville Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Randolph and Bridgewater Railroad and Middleborough Railroad&nbsp;\u2014 chartered 1845\n* '''[[Greenbush Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[South Shore Railroad (Old Colony Railroad)|South Shore Railroad]], chartered 1846\n* [[Gillette Stadium]] spur of Providence/Stoughton Line&nbsp;\u2014 [[Agricultural Branch Railroad]], chartered 1847?

In 2010, this trackage, along with several other portions of CSX-owned track with current or potential future MBTA service, was purchased by the state for the MBTA.  For years, the MBTA had used it only for non-revenue movement of trains between [[North\u2013South Rail Link|the northern and southern halves]] of its [[commuter rail]] system, but it now has plans to use the tracks to route some trains from west of Boston into [[North Station]], to supplement existing routes into [[South Station]].  As of 2012, there is some community opposition from the city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and it is not clear if or when such service will begin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/16/much_is_riding_on_worcester_rail_deal/ |title=Much is Riding on Worcester Rail Deal|author=Dyer, John |newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/09/signals_crossed_on_worcester_link/ |title=Signals crossed on Worcester link |author=Moskowitz, Eric |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> The Grand Junction trackage has also been considered for the proposed [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring Project]], intended to bypass severe overcrowding in the Downtown Boston rapid transit stations.\n\n==Streetcar era begins==\n{{Details|Boston Elevated Railway}}\n[[File:1885 West End Street Railway map.png|thumb|right|Planned West End Street Railway system, 1885; consolidation of these lines was complete by 1887. See also [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1880 Boston horse railroads map.jpg 1880 horse railway map].]]\n\nThe [[Cambridge Railroad]] was the first [[Tram|streetcar]] company in Massachusetts. It was chartered in 1853 to connect the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|West End of Boston]] to [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]] and [[Harvard Square]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] via the West End Bridge (which was at the site of the modern [[Longfellow Bridge]], itself completed in early August 1906), using horse-drawn streetcars. This is the same route followed by today's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] subway, but on the surface street network. Another streetcar company, the [[Dorchester Railroad]], was chartered in 1854. A profusion of streetcar lines were laid down throughout the Boston area by these and other competing companies.\n\nIn 1885, the [[West End Street Railway]] was chartered. The company consolidated ownership of existing streetcar lines in Boston and the inner suburbs, and began converting the animal-drawn vehicles to electric propulsion. The first electric trolleys ran in 1889, and the last [[horsecar]] went out of service around 1900.\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, two other streetcar companies gained consolidated ownership of many smaller lines. The [[Middlesex and Boston Street Railway]] came to control the western suburbs, and the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]] came to control the northern and southern suburbs.\n\n==Streetcar subways and elevated rail==\n[[File:Platforms at Park Street Station, 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Park Street station (MBTA)|Park Street]] on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] soon after opening, circa 1898]]\nSevere streetcar congestion on streets in downtown Boston created the need for [[Rapid transit|subway]]s and elevated rail. These [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] railways would add transportation capacity, and avoid delays caused by intersections with cross streets and growing congestion in mixed street traffic. The West End Street Railway was renamed the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy), and undertook several such projects.\n\nBoston's subway was the first in the [[United States]] and is often called \"America's First Subway\" by the MBTA and others.<ref>{{cite web | title = Famous Firsts in Massachusetts | publisher = Commonwealth of Massachusetts | url = http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/firsts_1800.htm | accessdate = November 13, 2006}}</ref> In 1897 and 1898, the [[Tremont Street Subway]] opened as the core of the precursor to the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]].<ref>The Boston Daily Globe, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829090042/http://members.aol.com/netransit/private/tss/tssnews.html Experiences of the first Subway Riders in Boston], [[The Boston Globe|The Boston Daily Globe]], September 1, 1897</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Main Line Elevated]], the precursor to the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] opened. It was a rapid transit line running as an [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]] through outlying areas and using the Tremont Street Subway downtown, with the outer tracks and platforms reconfigured for Elevated trains.<ref name=\"Koebel\">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-012Spring2002/Readings/detail/green_line_project.htm |title=Boston Transit Milestones |first=Romin |last=Koebel |work=MIT Open Courseware |year=2005 |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920021538/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-012Spring2002/Readings/detail/green_line_project.htm |archivedate=September 20, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened soon after, providing a second route through downtown. This was the first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston, three years before the first underground line of the [[New York City Subway]], but some 33 years after [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|the first elevated railway in New York.]]\n\nIn 1904, the next line to open was the East Boston Tunnel, a streetcar tunnel under [[Boston Harbor]] to [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]]. This replaced a transfer between streetcars and [[Ferry|ferries]], and provided access to the other subways downtown. The tunnel was converted to [[rapid transit]] specifications in 1924, with an easy cross-platform streetcar transfer at the East Boston end.\n\nIn 1908, the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Washington Street Tunnel]] opened, giving the Elevated a shorter route through downtown and returning the older Tremont Street Subway to full streetcar service.<ref name=\"Koebel\" /> Various extensions and branches were built to the Tremont Street Subway in both directions, bypassing more surface tracks. In addition, when the Main Line El opened in 1901, many surface routes were cut back to its [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]] and [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan Square]] terminals to provide a transfer for a faster route downtown. Further elevated extensions, as with the [[Charlestown Elevated]], were soon built on each end, and more streetcar lines were connected.\n\nIn 1912, the [[Cambridge Tunnel]] opened, connecting the Downtown Boston routes to [[Harvard Square]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. It was soon extended south from Downtown to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] as the [[Dorchester Tunnel]]. The Dorchester Extension, opening in stages from 1927, took the line further along a former [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] branch through Dorchester, with the [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]] continuing along the old right-of-way to [[Mattapan, Massachusetts|Mattapan]]. This, too, resulted in cutbacks in streetcar service to its terminals.\n\nAs built, many of the key rapid transit transfer stations were [[Paid area|prepayment stations]], in which free transfers could be made between surface streetcar lines and grade-separated subway or elevated lines. This was made possible by the operation of all services under one umbrella; some suburban services that operated over the same streetcar tracks used different areas outside [[Paid area|fare control]]. Some of the streetcar levels in transfer stations were later converted for bus or [[Trolleybus|trackless trolley]] operation; other such spaces have been closed.  Some of the prepaid transfer areas still exist architecturally, and faregates enclose all subway stations (but not most above-ground Green Line stops).\n\nFree in-station transfers were eliminated in October 1961, except among subway routes at the transfer stations in Downtown Boston. Transfers between bus and rapid transit were restored, in a limited capacity in 2000, and in full in 2007 as long as a [[CharlieCard]] is used.  Transfers between bus and subway are reduced price but not free, while a single transfer between one local bus and another is free.\n\nPrepayment stations included [[Andrew (MBTA station)|Andrew]] (still in place), [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]], [[Ashmont (MBTA station)|Ashmont]], [[Broadway (MBTA station)|Broadway]], [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]], Egleston, [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Fields Corner (MBTA station)|Fields Corner]], [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills]], [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]] (still in place), [[Hynes Convention Center (MBTA station)|Hynes Convention Center]], [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] (still in place), [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] (still in place), [[Maverick (MBTA station)|Maverick]], [[Ruggles (MBTA station)|Ruggles]] (built for buses, still in place), [[Savin Hill (MBTA station)|Savin Hill]], [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan Square]], [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]] (only served surface and surface-subway streetcars) and [[Wood Island (MBTA station)|Wood Island]] (built for buses).\n\n== Mid-20th century ==\n\n===Decline of streetcars and railroads===\nThe Boston Elevated Railway started replacing rail vehicles with buses in 1922, a process later dubbed \"[[Rail replacement bus service|bustitution]]\". The last Middlesex and Boston Street Railway streetcars ran in 1930. The BERy started replacing some rail vehicles with trackless trolleys in 1936.\n\nBy the beginning of 1953, the only [[Boston-area streetcar lines|remaining streetcar lines]] fed two tunnels&nbsp;\u2014 the main [[Tremont Street Subway]] network downtown and the short tunnel (now the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]]) in [[Harvard Square]]. Diesel-powered buses could not be used in the tunnels due to the problem of venting exhaust fumes.\n\nIn 1958, the Harvard Square tunnel routes were replaced with electrically powered trackless trolleys, which were the only such MBTA routes.  A short non-revenue connection from the terminus of the #71 trackless trolley out of Harvard Square runs to the [[Watertown Yard (MBTA station)|Watertown Carhouse]] for maintenance. In the 21st century, with the new Phase 2 [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] in South Boston, trackless trolley services were extended for the first time in decades.\n\nThe old elevated railways proved to be an eyesore, and several sharp curves following Boston's twisty streets became more problematic because of severe speed limitations, high maintenance, and noise. The beginning of the decline of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] line was the [[Great Molasses Flood|Boston molasses disaster]] of 1919, which interrupted service on the line. After another serious accident in 1928, the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially closed, running as a stub shuttle.  In 1938, it was completely shut down, and then demolished for scrap metal in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, passenger service on the [[Fairmount Line]] was canceled by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] after a long period of declining ridership.  As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to the increasingly popular [[automobile]], government takeover became necessary to prevent abandonment of commuter rail services by bankrupt railroad companies.\n\n===MTA incorporation and takeovers===\nIn 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the [[Boston Elevated Railway]].<ref>[http://members.aol.com/netransit/private/LRV.html Boston's Green Line Crisis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The original MTA district consisted of 14 cities and towns&nbsp;\u2014 [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], Boston, [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], and [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]].\n\nThe last two streetcar lines running into the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] of the [[Tremont Street Subway]] were replaced with buses in 1953 and 1962, and the portal has since been covered over by a public park.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, the Revere Extension (now part of the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]) opened to [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]], mostly along the former [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]] right-of-way.\n\nIn 1959, MTA streetcar service opened on what is now the Riverside [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]], connecting to the Boylston Street Subway and using trackage purchased from the [[New York Central Railroad]], which had stopped running on the line the previous year. The new service required much more rolling stock than expected, due to heavy ridership.\n\nAlso in 1959, with the opening of the [[Interstate 93|Southeast Expressway]], the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] halted passenger service on the former [[Old Colony Railroad]] lines.  Replacement rapid transit service was promised. but did not open [[Red Line (MBTA)#South Shore Line|until a dozen years later]], with the service finally going just beyond [[Braintree Split|the new Expressway's southern end]] [[Red Line (MBTA)#Braintree Extension|nine years afterwards]].\n\n==MBTA incorporation==\n===Formation and commuter rail takeovers===\n<!-- [[M.T.A. (song)]] links here -->\nOn August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an enlarged service area of 78 cities and towns. A 79th community ([[Maynard, Massachusetts|Maynard]]) joined in or before 1972 and left in or after 1976.\n\nThe MBTA was formed partly to [[subsidize]] existing commuter rail operations, provided at that time by three private railroad companies&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]] (via the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]), and the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]&nbsp;\u2014 with the B&M running the north-side lines and the NYC and NYNH&H (both merged into Penn Central in 1968, and taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976) on the south side. The MBTA soon began to subsidize the companies, and acquired the lines in stages from 1973 through 1976, but with major cutbacks in service and coverage area. Since then, many of these lines have seen service return, most notably the [[Old Colony Railroad]] (NYNH&H) lines to the [[South Shore (Boston)|South Shore]].\n\nBy 1964, commuter rail service to Worcester was being provided. In 1965, the Boston and Maine Railroad started receiving MBTA subsidies for its commuter service. In 1973, the MBTA bought most of its present-day commuter rail trackage from the Boston and Maine Railroad and Penn Central (into which the New York Central Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had merged). It also purchased rolling stock at this time. Trackage between Framingham and Worcester was not acquired by the agency, and due to a lack of state subsidy, commuter rail service on this portion was cut in 1975. Service was resumed in 1994, though the track was still privately owned until the state purchased it from CSX Transportation in 2011. The [[Fairmount Line]] was purchased from Penn Central in 1976. Passenger service resumed there in 1979 during diversion of other lines during [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] construction, and was continued even after the project was complete.\n\n===Bus expansion and streetcar cutbacks===\nIn 1965, the MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines, and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. However, shortages of streetcars, among other factors, eventually caused bus substitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. In 1969, the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]] was replaced by bus service in its entirety. In 1985, the portion of the [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" Branch]] from [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] to [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] was replaced by buses.\n\nIn 1968, the MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north and south, from the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]]. Western suburban routes were purchased in 1972 from the [[Middlesex and Boston Street Railway]]. (Both of these companies had long since ceased running any streetcar service). A few routes to the north were taken over from Service Bus Lines in 1975, and one in the south in 1980 from the Brush Hill Transportation Company. As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes were dropped soon before or after the takeover, due to low ridership and high operating costs, and out-of-district communities refusal to join or contract with the MBTA.\n\n===Rapid transit expansion===\nIn the 1970s, the MBTA received a boost from the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review|BTPR]] areawide re-evaluation of the role of transit relative to highways. Following a moratorium on major highway construction inside Route 128, numerous transit lines were planned for expansion by the Voorhees-Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-ESL consulting team.\n\nThe [[Charlestown Elevated]], part of the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] north of downtown Boston, was replaced by the ''Haymarket North Extension'' in 1975.\n\nThe ''Braintree Extension'', a branch of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] to [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], opened in stages from 1971 to 1980, upgrading an existing rail corridor. The ''[[Red Line Northwest Extension]]'' to [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] opened in 1985, with an intermediate opening in 1984, partly along a railroad corridor and partly through a newly built deep-bore tunnel.\n\nThe southern part of the [[Washington Street Elevated]] lasted until 1987, when the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] was opened, rerouting service from discontinued elevated trackage to new facilities in a parallel existing rail corridor. The closure of the Washington Street Elevated south of downtown Boston brought the end of rapid transit service to the [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] neighborhood, which was eventually replaced with the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Bus Rapid Transit]].\n\nThese extensions provided not only additional subway system coverage, but also major [[parking]] structures at several of the terminal and intermediate stations. For example, the [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] [[freeway]] ends at the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] terminus, [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] station, where there is a large parking garage operated by the MBTA.\n\nWith the 2004 replacement of the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] by a subway tunnel connection, the only remaining [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]]s are a short portion of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], and a short portion of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] between [[Science Park (MBTA station)|Science Park]] and [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]].\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n===MBTA expansion and the Big Dig===\nIn 1999, the district was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most communities that were served by or adjacent to Commuter Rail lines (again including Maynard). The MBTA did not assume responsibility for local transit service in those communities, some of which run their own buses, and some of which depend on private bus services.\n\nPrior to July 1, 2000, the MBTA had been automatically reimbursed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all costs above revenue collected (net cost of service). Beginning on that date, the T was granted a dedicated revenue stream consisting of amounts assessed on served cities and towns, along with a dedicated 20% portion of the 5% state [[sales tax]]. Going forward, the MBTA now would have to live within this \"forward funding\" budget.\n\nThe Commonwealth assigned to the MBTA responsibility for increasing public transit to compensate for increased automobile pollution from the [[Big Dig]]. The T submerged a nearby portion of the Green Line and rebuilt [[Haymarket (MBTA station)|Haymarket]] and [[North Station]]s during Big Dig construction. However, these projects have strained the MBTA's limited resources, since the Big Dig project did not include funding for these improvements. Since 1988, the MBTA has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as [[Greater Boston]] has been one of the slowest growing metropolitan areas in the United States.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/05/24/t_expansion_on_wrong_track/|work=The Boston Globe|title=T expansion on wrong track|date=May 24, 2006}}</ref>\nWhen, in 2000, the MBTA's budget became limited, the agency began to run into debt from scheduled projects and obligatory Big Dig remediation work, which have now given the MBTA the highest debt of any transit authority in the country. In an effort to compensate, rates underwent an appreciable hike on January 1, 2007.

From the [[United States Census Bureau]].]]\n\nThe [[steam locomotive]] became practical for mass transportation in the 1810s, and came to the United States in the 1820s. The private [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]] was chartered in 1830, connecting Boston to [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], a major northerly mill town (which was also connected via the [[Middlesex Canal]]). It was one of the [[oldest railroads in North America]] and the first major one in Massachusetts. This route marked the beginning of the development of intercity railroads that eventually evolved into the MBTA Commuter Rail system and the Riverside [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]]. Origins of the various rail lines are listed below:\n\n=== [[Boston and Maine Railroad]] ===\nThe '''[[Haverhill Line]]''' was originally chartered as the [[Andover and Wilmington Railroad]] in 1833 and extended to [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]] in 1837 as the [[Andover and Haverhill Railroad]]. The line became the Boston & Maine's first acquisition, as the result of a consolidation of three railroads between Boston and [[Portland, Maine]].\n\n'''[[Lowell Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Lowell Railroad]], chartered 1830\n\n'''[[Fitchburg Railroad|Fitchburg Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Fitchburg Railroad]], chartered 1842\n\nThe '''[[Newburyport/Rockport Line]]''' was originally chartered as the [[Eastern Railroad (Massachusetts)|Eastern Railroad]] in 1836. The line first opened between [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] and [[East Boston]] in 1838.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eastern Railroad Company of Massachusetts Records, 1839-1840, 1874-1877|url=http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/sfa/easternrr.htm|website=Harvard Business School|publisher=HBS Baker Library|accessdate=August 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405034222/http://www.library.hbs.edu/hc/sfa/easternrr.htm|archive-date=April 5, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> The railroad expanded until it was running from Portland, Maine to Boston, putting the line in direct competition with the Boston & Maine. In 1884, the Eastern Railroad was leased by the Boston & Maine, ending the competition and leading to an outright purchase in 1900.\n\n===Penn Central===\nThe [[Penn Central Transportation Company]] came into existence in 1968 when the [[New York Central Railroad]] merged with the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], absorbing the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] at the beginning of 1969.\n\n====New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad====\n* '''[[Providence/Stoughton Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Providence Railroad]], chartered 1831; Stoughton Branch Railroad portion chartered 1841; Cranston-Wickford Junction portion opened 1837 by the [[New York, Providence and Boston Railroad]]; Providence connector opened 1848\n* '''[[Fairmount Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Built in 1855 for the [[Norfolk County Railroad]]\n* '''[[Needham Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Inner portion opened 1850 as a branch of the [[Boston and Providence Railroad]], outer portion opened 1853 ([[Charles River Branch Railroad]]), connecting segment opened 1906 by the NYNH&H\n* '''[[Franklin Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Norfolk County Railroad]], opened 1849; later acquired by [[New York and New England Railroad]]\n\n====New York Central Railroad====\n* '''[[Framingham/Worcester Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[Boston and Worcester Railroad]], chartered 1831\n\n=== [[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Old Colony Lines]] ===\nAcquired by the large [[Old Colony Railroad]], much of which was since abandoned, and which later merged into the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] and then the [[Penn Central Transportation Company]].\n* '''[[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Plymouth/Kingston Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Original [[Old Colony Railroad]], opened to Plymouth in 1845\n* '''[[Old Colony Lines (MBTA)|Middleborough/Lakeville Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 Randolph and Bridgewater Railroad and Middleborough Railroad&nbsp;\u2014 chartered 1845\n* '''[[Greenbush Line]]'''&nbsp;\u2014 [[South Shore Railroad (Old Colony Railroad)|South Shore Railroad]], chartered 1846\n* [[Gillette Stadium]] spur of Providence/Stoughton Line&nbsp;\u2014 [[Agricultural Branch Railroad]], chartered 1847?

In 2010, this trackage, along with several other portions of CSX-owned track with current or potential future MBTA service, was purchased by the state for the MBTA.  For years, the MBTA had used it only for non-revenue movement of trains between [[North\u2013South Rail Link|the northern and southern halves]] of its [[commuter rail]] system, but it now has plans to use the tracks to route some trains from west of Boston into [[North Station]], to supplement existing routes into [[South Station]].  As of 2012, there is some community opposition from the city of [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], and it is not clear if or when such service will begin.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/06/16/much_is_riding_on_worcester_rail_deal/ |title=Much is Riding on Worcester Rail Deal|author=Dyer, John |newspaper=Boston Globe|date=June 16, 2010|accessdate=October 11, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/09/signals_crossed_on_worcester_link/ |title=Signals crossed on Worcester link |author=Moskowitz, Eric |newspaper=Boston Globe |date=August 9, 2010 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}</ref> The Grand Junction trackage has also been considered for the proposed [[Urban Ring Project (MBTA)|Urban Ring Project]], intended to bypass severe overcrowding in the Downtown Boston rapid transit stations.\n\n==Streetcar era begins==\n{{Details|Boston Elevated Railway}}\n[[File:1885 West End Street Railway map.png|thumb|right|Planned West End Street Railway system, 1885; consolidation of these lines was complete by 1887. See also [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:1880 Boston horse railroads map.jpg 1880 horse railway map].]]\n\nThe [[Cambridge Railroad]] was the first [[Tram|streetcar]] company in Massachusetts. It was chartered in 1853 to connect the [[West End, Boston, Massachusetts|West End of Boston]] to [[Central Square (Cambridge)|Central Square]] and [[Harvard Square]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]] via the West End Bridge (which was at the site of the modern [[Longfellow Bridge]], itself completed in early August 1906), using horse-drawn streetcars. This is the same route followed by today's [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] subway, but on the surface street network. Another streetcar company, the [[Dorchester Railroad]], was chartered in 1854. A profusion of streetcar lines were laid down throughout the Boston area by these and other competing companies.\n\nIn 1885, the [[West End Street Railway]] was chartered. The company consolidated ownership of existing streetcar lines in Boston and the inner suburbs, and began converting the animal-drawn vehicles to electric propulsion. The first electric trolleys ran in 1889, and the last [[horsecar]] went out of service around 1900.\n\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, two other streetcar companies gained consolidated ownership of many smaller lines. The [[Middlesex and Boston Street Railway]] came to control the western suburbs, and the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]] came to control the northern and southern suburbs.\n\n==Streetcar subways and elevated rail==\n[[File:Platforms at Park Street Station, 1898.jpg|thumb|[[Park Street station (MBTA)|Park Street]] on the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] soon after opening, circa 1898]]\nSevere streetcar congestion on streets in downtown Boston created the need for [[Rapid transit|subway]]s and elevated rail. These [[Grade separation|grade-separated]] railways would add transportation capacity, and avoid delays caused by intersections with cross streets and growing congestion in mixed street traffic. The West End Street Railway was renamed the [[Boston Elevated Railway]] (BERy), and undertook several such projects.\n\nBoston's subway was the first in the [[United States]] and is often called \"America's First Subway\" by the MBTA and others.<ref>{{cite web | title = Famous Firsts in Massachusetts | publisher = Commonwealth of Massachusetts | url = http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/firsts_1800.htm | accessdate = November 13, 2006}}</ref> In 1897 and 1898, the [[Tremont Street Subway]] opened as the core of the precursor to the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]].<ref>The Boston Daily Globe, [https://web.archive.org/web/20050829090042/http://members.aol.com/netransit/private/tss/tssnews.html Experiences of the first Subway Riders in Boston], [[The Boston Globe|The Boston Daily Globe]], September 1, 1897</ref>\n\nIn 1901, the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Main Line Elevated]], the precursor to the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] opened. It was a rapid transit line running as an [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]] through outlying areas and using the Tremont Street Subway downtown, with the outer tracks and platforms reconfigured for Elevated trains.<ref name=\"Koebel\">{{cite web|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-012Spring2002/Readings/detail/green_line_project.htm |title=Boston Transit Milestones |first=Romin |last=Koebel |work=MIT Open Courseware |year=2005 |accessdate=August 1, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060920021538/http://ocw.mit.edu/OcwWeb/Civil-and-Environmental-Engineering/1-012Spring2002/Readings/detail/green_line_project.htm |archivedate=September 20, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] opened soon after, providing a second route through downtown. This was the first elevated railway and the first rapid transit line in Boston, three years before the first underground line of the [[New York City Subway]], but some 33 years after [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line|the first elevated railway in New York.]]\n\nIn 1904, the next line to open was the East Boston Tunnel, a streetcar tunnel under [[Boston Harbor]] to [[East Boston, Massachusetts|East Boston]]. This replaced a transfer between streetcars and [[Ferry|ferries]], and provided access to the other subways downtown. The tunnel was converted to [[rapid transit]] specifications in 1924, with an easy cross-platform streetcar transfer at the East Boston end.\n\nIn 1908, the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Washington Street Tunnel]] opened, giving the Elevated a shorter route through downtown and returning the older Tremont Street Subway to full streetcar service.<ref name=\"Koebel\" /> Various extensions and branches were built to the Tremont Street Subway in both directions, bypassing more surface tracks. In addition, when the Main Line El opened in 1901, many surface routes were cut back to its [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]] and [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan Square]] terminals to provide a transfer for a faster route downtown. Further elevated extensions, as with the [[Charlestown Elevated]], were soon built on each end, and more streetcar lines were connected.\n\nIn 1912, the [[Cambridge Tunnel]] opened, connecting the Downtown Boston routes to [[Harvard Square]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]]. It was soon extended south from Downtown to [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] as the [[Dorchester Tunnel]]. The Dorchester Extension, opening in stages from 1927, took the line further along a former [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] branch through Dorchester, with the [[Ashmont-Mattapan High Speed Line]] continuing along the old right-of-way to [[Mattapan, Massachusetts|Mattapan]]. This, too, resulted in cutbacks in streetcar service to its terminals.\n\nAs built, many of the key rapid transit transfer stations were [[Paid area|prepayment stations]], in which free transfers could be made between surface streetcar lines and grade-separated subway or elevated lines. This was made possible by the operation of all services under one umbrella; some suburban services that operated over the same streetcar tracks used different areas outside [[Paid area|fare control]]. Some of the streetcar levels in transfer stations were later converted for bus or [[Trolleybus|trackless trolley]] operation; other such spaces have been closed.  Some of the prepaid transfer areas still exist architecturally, and faregates enclose all subway stations (but not most above-ground Green Line stops).\n\nFree in-station transfers were eliminated in October 1961, except among subway routes at the transfer stations in Downtown Boston. Transfers between bus and rapid transit were restored, in a limited capacity in 2000, and in full in 2007 as long as a [[CharlieCard]] is used.  Transfers between bus and subway are reduced price but not free, while a single transfer between one local bus and another is free.\n\nPrepayment stations included [[Andrew (MBTA station)|Andrew]] (still in place), [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]], [[Ashmont (MBTA station)|Ashmont]], [[Broadway (MBTA station)|Broadway]], [[Dudley Square (MBTA station)|Dudley]], Egleston, [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Fields Corner (MBTA station)|Fields Corner]], [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Forest Hills]], [[Harvard (MBTA station)|Harvard]] (still in place), [[Hynes Convention Center (MBTA station)|Hynes Convention Center]], [[Kenmore (MBTA station)|Kenmore]] (still in place), [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]] (still in place), [[Maverick (MBTA station)|Maverick]], [[Ruggles (MBTA station)|Ruggles]] (built for buses, still in place), [[Savin Hill (MBTA station)|Savin Hill]], [[Sullivan Square (MBTA station)|Sullivan Square]], [[Watertown Square (MBTA station)|Watertown]] (only served surface and surface-subway streetcars) and [[Wood Island (MBTA station)|Wood Island]] (built for buses).\n\n== Mid-20th century ==\n\n===Decline of streetcars and railroads===\nThe Boston Elevated Railway started replacing rail vehicles with buses in 1922, a process later dubbed \"[[Rail replacement bus service|bustitution]]\". The last Middlesex and Boston Street Railway streetcars ran in 1930. The BERy started replacing some rail vehicles with trackless trolleys in 1936.\n\nBy the beginning of 1953, the only [[Boston-area streetcar lines|remaining streetcar lines]] fed two tunnels&nbsp;\u2014 the main [[Tremont Street Subway]] network downtown and the short tunnel (now the [[Harvard Bus Tunnel]]) in [[Harvard Square]]. Diesel-powered buses could not be used in the tunnels due to the problem of venting exhaust fumes.\n\nIn 1958, the Harvard Square tunnel routes were replaced with electrically powered trackless trolleys, which were the only such MBTA routes.  A short non-revenue connection from the terminus of the #71 trackless trolley out of Harvard Square runs to the [[Watertown Yard (MBTA station)|Watertown Carhouse]] for maintenance. In the 21st century, with the new Phase 2 [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] in South Boston, trackless trolley services were extended for the first time in decades.\n\nThe old elevated railways proved to be an eyesore, and several sharp curves following Boston's twisty streets became more problematic because of severe speed limitations, high maintenance, and noise. The beginning of the decline of the [[Atlantic Avenue Elevated]] line was the [[Great Molasses Flood|Boston molasses disaster]] of 1919, which interrupted service on the line. After another serious accident in 1928, the Atlantic Avenue Elevated was partially closed, running as a stub shuttle.  In 1938, it was completely shut down, and then demolished for scrap metal in 1942.\n\nIn 1944, passenger service on the [[Fairmount Line]] was canceled by the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] after a long period of declining ridership.  As rail passenger service became increasingly unprofitable, largely due to the increasingly popular [[automobile]], government takeover became necessary to prevent abandonment of commuter rail services by bankrupt railroad companies.\n\n===MTA incorporation and takeovers===\nIn 1947, the newly formed Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) purchased and took over subway, elevated, streetcar, and bus operations from the [[Boston Elevated Railway]].<ref>[http://members.aol.com/netransit/private/LRV.html Boston's Green Line Crisis<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The original MTA district consisted of 14 cities and towns&nbsp;\u2014 [[Arlington, Massachusetts|Arlington]], [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]], Boston, [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Everett, Massachusetts|Everett]], [[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]], [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]], [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Revere, Massachusetts|Revere]], [[Somerville, Massachusetts|Somerville]], and [[Watertown, Massachusetts|Watertown]].\n\nThe last two streetcar lines running into the [[Pleasant Street Portal]] of the [[Tremont Street Subway]] were replaced with buses in 1953 and 1962, and the portal has since been covered over by a public park.\n\nBetween 1952 and 1954, the Revere Extension (now part of the [[Blue Line (MBTA)|Blue Line]]) opened to [[Wonderland (MBTA station)|Wonderland]], mostly along the former [[Narrow-gauge railway|narrow-gauge]] [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]] right-of-way.\n\nIn 1959, MTA streetcar service opened on what is now the Riverside [[Green Line \"D\" Branch]], connecting to the Boylston Street Subway and using trackage purchased from the [[New York Central Railroad]], which had stopped running on the line the previous year. The new service required much more rolling stock than expected, due to heavy ridership.\n\nAlso in 1959, with the opening of the [[Interstate 93|Southeast Expressway]], the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]] halted passenger service on the former [[Old Colony Railroad]] lines.  Replacement rapid transit service was promised. but did not open [[Red Line (MBTA)#South Shore Line|until a dozen years later]], with the service finally going just beyond [[Braintree Split|the new Expressway's southern end]] [[Red Line (MBTA)#Braintree Extension|nine years afterwards]].\n\n==MBTA incorporation==\n===Formation and commuter rail takeovers===\n<!-- [[M.T.A. (song)]] links here -->\nOn August 3, 1964, the MBTA succeeded the MTA, with an enlarged service area of 78 cities and towns. A 79th community ([[Maynard, Massachusetts|Maynard]]) joined in or before 1972 and left in or after 1976.\n\nThe MBTA was formed partly to [[subsidize]] existing commuter rail operations, provided at that time by three private railroad companies&nbsp;\u2014 the [[Boston and Maine Railroad]], the [[New York Central Railroad]] (via the [[Boston and Albany Railroad]]), and the [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]]&nbsp;\u2014 with the B&M running the north-side lines and the NYC and NYNH&H (both merged into Penn Central in 1968, and taken over by [[Conrail]] in 1976) on the south side. The MBTA soon began to subsidize the companies, and acquired the lines in stages from 1973 through 1976, but with major cutbacks in service and coverage area. Since then, many of these lines have seen service return, most notably the [[Old Colony Railroad]] (NYNH&H) lines to the [[South Shore (Boston)|South Shore]].\n\nBy 1964, commuter rail service to Worcester was being provided. In 1965, the Boston and Maine Railroad started receiving MBTA subsidies for its commuter service. In 1973, the MBTA bought most of its present-day commuter rail trackage from the Boston and Maine Railroad and Penn Central (into which the New York Central Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad had merged). It also purchased rolling stock at this time. Trackage between Framingham and Worcester was not acquired by the agency, and due to a lack of state subsidy, commuter rail service on this portion was cut in 1975. Service was resumed in 1994, though the track was still privately owned until the state purchased it from CSX Transportation in 2011. The [[Fairmount Line]] was purchased from Penn Central in 1976. Passenger service resumed there in 1979 during diversion of other lines during [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] construction, and was continued even after the project was complete.\n\n===Bus expansion and streetcar cutbacks===\nIn 1965, the MBTA assigned colors to its four rapid transit lines, and lettered the branches of the Green Line from north to south. However, shortages of streetcars, among other factors, eventually caused bus substitution of rail service on two branches of the Green Line. In 1969, the [[Green Line \"A\" Branch|\"A\" Branch]] was replaced by bus service in its entirety. In 1985, the portion of the [[Green Line \"E\" Branch|\"E\" Branch]] from [[Heath Street (MBTA station)|Heath Street]] to [[Forest Hills (MBTA station)|Arborway]] was replaced by buses.\n\nIn 1968, the MBTA purchased bus routes in the outer suburbs to the north and south, from the [[Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway]]. Western suburban routes were purchased in 1972 from the [[Middlesex and Boston Street Railway]]. (Both of these companies had long since ceased running any streetcar service). A few routes to the north were taken over from Service Bus Lines in 1975, and one in the south in 1980 from the Brush Hill Transportation Company. As with the commuter rail system, many of the outlying routes were dropped soon before or after the takeover, due to low ridership and high operating costs, and out-of-district communities refusal to join or contract with the MBTA.\n\n===Rapid transit expansion===\nIn the 1970s, the MBTA received a boost from the [[Boston Transportation Planning Review|BTPR]] areawide re-evaluation of the role of transit relative to highways. Following a moratorium on major highway construction inside Route 128, numerous transit lines were planned for expansion by the Voorhees-Skidmore, Owings and Merrill-ESL consulting team.\n\nThe [[Charlestown Elevated]], part of the [[Orange Line (MBTA)|Orange Line]] north of downtown Boston, was replaced by the ''Haymarket North Extension'' in 1975.\n\nThe ''Braintree Extension'', a branch of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] to [[Braintree (MBTA station)|Braintree]], opened in stages from 1971 to 1980, upgrading an existing rail corridor. The ''[[Red Line Northwest Extension]]'' to [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] opened in 1985, with an intermediate opening in 1984, partly along a railroad corridor and partly through a newly built deep-bore tunnel.\n\nThe southern part of the [[Washington Street Elevated]] lasted until 1987, when the [[Southwest Corridor (Boston)|Southwest Corridor]] was opened, rerouting service from discontinued elevated trackage to new facilities in a parallel existing rail corridor. The closure of the Washington Street Elevated south of downtown Boston brought the end of rapid transit service to the [[Roxbury, Massachusetts|Roxbury]] neighborhood, which was eventually replaced with the [[Silver Line (MBTA)|Silver Line]] [[Bus Rapid Transit]].\n\nThese extensions provided not only additional subway system coverage, but also major [[parking]] structures at several of the terminal and intermediate stations. For example, the [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] [[freeway]] ends at the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] terminus, [[Alewife (MBTA station)|Alewife]] station, where there is a large parking garage operated by the MBTA.\n\nWith the 2004 replacement of the [[Causeway Street Elevated]] by a subway tunnel connection, the only remaining [[Rapid transit|elevated railway]]s are a short portion of the [[Red Line (MBTA)|Red Line]] at [[Charles/MGH (MBTA station)|Charles/MGH]], and a short portion of the [[Green Line (MBTA)|Green Line]] between [[Science Park (MBTA station)|Science Park]] and [[Lechmere (MBTA station)|Lechmere]].\n\n== 21st century ==\n\n===MBTA expansion and the Big Dig===\nIn 1999, the district was expanded further to 175 cities and towns, adding most communities that were served by or adjacent to Commuter Rail lines (again including Maynard). The MBTA did not assume responsibility for local transit service in those communities, some of which run their own buses, and some of which depend on private bus services.\n\nPrior to July 1, 2000, the MBTA had been automatically reimbursed by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all costs above revenue collected (net cost of service). Beginning on that date, the T was granted a dedicated revenue stream consisting of amounts assessed on served cities and towns, along with a dedicated 20% portion of the 5% state [[sales tax]]. Going forward, the MBTA now would have to live within this \"forward funding\" budget.\n\nThe Commonwealth assigned to the MBTA responsibility for increasing public transit to compensate for increased automobile pollution from the [[Big Dig]]. The T submerged a nearby portion of the Green Line and rebuilt [[Haymarket (MBTA station)|Haymarket]] and [[North Station]]s during Big Dig construction. However, these projects have strained the MBTA's limited resources, since the Big Dig project did not include funding for these improvements. Since 1988, the MBTA has been the fastest expanding transit system in the country, even as [[Greater Boston]] has been one of the slowest growing metropolitan areas in the United States.<ref>\n{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2006/05/24/t_expansion_on_wrong_track/|work=The Boston Globe|title=T expansion on wrong track|date=May 24, 2006}}</ref>\nWhen, in 2000, the MBTA's budget became limited, the agency began to run into debt from scheduled projects and obligatory Big Dig remediation work, which have now given the MBTA the highest debt of any transit authority in the country.

Secondly, that it should have a Spiritual significance. The surmounting figure on the cenotaph represents Glory to the Dead, holding the torch of Freedom for which they died. The sorrowing Love on the Shrine at the base, will, I think, appeal to all who have lost dear ones in the War. The symbol over the Cross is an old Celtic sign for the Voice or Presence of God\".

See [[Delville Wood South African National Memorial]].\nA plaster cast of \"Dioscuri\", the title of Turner's work was shown in the forecourt of Burlington House in 1925 before the bronze was despatched to France the next year and unveiled on 10 October 1926 by the widow of [[General Botha]]. Two full-size bronze replicas went to South Africa in April 1928, one being erected in front of Capitol Buildings in Pretoria and the other in Cape Town. A bronze model was also placed in the Queen's Hall of the South African Houses of Parliament. 10 October was chosen as the unveiling date as this was the date in 1899 when the first shot was fired in the South African War and the date in 1908 of the National Conference which brought the Union of South Africa into being. In file TGA 8713.1.7 at Tate Britain Archive there is a copy of the unveiling ceremony programme of Sunday 10 October 1926. This describes the bronze sculpture as follows:\n\n\u201cThe stone dome which crowns the monument supports a group in bronze of two men representing Physical Energy and the two races of South Africa, between them leading a war horse into battle, and with one hand clasped over the horse's back.

The panel on the left side features an angel, her sword drawn to protect a woman and her children (the defence of the children of the poor) and that on the right shows a warrior who has slain a dragon and holds a severed head (punishing the wrongdoer). At his side a woman holds his shield. In the central panel another angel holds a globe and points downwards towards the building's main entrance.

The Strasbourg judges are elected by the 324 members of the\n[[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]], though this is itself not an elected body. Raab contended that many of the judges were lacking experience and as a result \"are undermining the credibility and value of the Court\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://civitas.org.ukhttp//www.civitas.org.uk/2011/04/21/strasbourg-court-flouting-democratic-self-government/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927235257/http://www.civitas.org.uk/wordpress/2011/04/21/strasbourg-court-flouting-democratic-self-government/|url-status=dead|title=Strasbourg Court flouting democratic self-government|date=21 April 2011|archivedate=27 September 2011|website=Civitas: Institute for the Study of Civil Society}}</ref> Raab made a range of proposals to strengthen the authority of Britain's [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|Supreme Court]], give elected lawmakers the last word on the creation of new rights, and reform the Strasbourg Court.\n\nIn July 2011, Raab called for reform of the [[UK Borders Act 2007]] which allows foreign criminals to avoid deportation by claiming a \"right to family life\" under [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights|Article 8]] of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. He proposed that the reference to the Human Rights Act be removed.

This period in [[Prussia]] was marked by a persecution of [[Old Lutherans]] who refused to use join the [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|Prussian Union]] under King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick Wilhelm III]]. On 23 and 24 May 1839, Kavel convened a meeting of the [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s of the three Prussian settlements at [[Klemzig, South Australia|Klemzig]], [[Hahndorf, South Australia|Hahndorf]], and [[Glen Osmond, South Australia|Glen Osmond]]. At this meeting, the [[constitution]] of the new Australian Lutheran synod was adopted.\n\nIn 1841, a second wave of Prussian immigrants started. with the arrival of Pastor [[Gotthard Fritzsche]]. They settled in [[Lobethal, South Australia|Lobethal]] and [[Bethany, South Australia|Bethanien]].\n\n==Division into Immanuel Synod and Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Australia==\nRelations with the earlier Prussian settlers was initially quite harmonious; however this soon changed. In 1842, Kavel, in an attempt to consolidate the settlers into one localized community, strongly urged the settlers in the early settlements at [[Klemzig, South Australia|Klemzig]] and [[Hahndorf, South Australia|Hahndorf]] to relocate to the newly settled [[Tanunda, South Australia|Langmeil]]. Many of the settlers in these towns refused, and an underlying tension arose between these communities and Kavel.\n\nAt the synodical gatherings of 1844 and 1845, the subject of [[millennialism]] was discussed. Kavel who had developed millennialistic views, was preaching on the subject. Fritzsche disagreed with millennialism, and had the subject discussed at these gatherings. No resolution was reached by the end of the synod in 1845. This disagreement between the two pastors divided the Lutheran community.\n\nIn 1846, Kavel released a proclamation regarding the power of civil government in the church. Kavel specifically pronounced disagreements with the [[Lutheran Confessions]], favoring instead statements made in the 1938 church constitution. Fritzsche explicitly disagreed with Kavel, affirming the Confessions over the constitution. As a result, the divide between the followers of Fritzsche and of Kavel intensified.\n\nAt the synodical gathering at Bethany, on 16 and 17 August 1846, the most significant event took place. The subject of millennialism was once again brought up, and as the discussion became heated, Kavel and his followers left the synod. They went to nearby Langmeil and had their own synod gathering there, while the remainder continued with their synod. The followers of Kavel formed the Immanuel Synod, and those of Fritzsche, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of South Australia. The latter was renamed as the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Australia (ELSA) in 1863.\n\nAfter Kavel's (1860), and Fritzsche's (1863) deaths, the Immanuel Synod, and the ELSA were able to reconcile some of their differences. This resulted in a \u201cConfessional Union\u201d, but not an organizational merger.\n\n==Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia==\nThe ELSA continued to coexist independently with the other Lutheran synods until 1966. It underwent a name change in 1944, to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia (ELCA). One group broke away from the ELSA in 1904, and became a district of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio]]. This group called themselves the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Australia ''auf alter Grundlage'' (ELSA a.a. G) (''auf alter Grundlage'' being German for \"on old basis\").\n\n==Lutherans in Victoria==\nIn 1856, a new independent synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Victoria (ELSV), with Pastor [[Matthias Goethe]] serving as president, was founded to serve the Lutheran congregations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n==General Synod and the Immanuel Synod==\nIn 1860, the year of Kavel's death, a group broke away from the Immanuel Synod. This break away group developed a union with the ELSV that was called the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod (General Synod).\n\nIn 1874, the Immanuel Synod also developed an affiliation with the ELSV. The ESLA was opposed to the practice of ELSV calling non-Lutheran pastors, so the Confessional Union they had with Immanuel Synod was dissolved. With this event the Immanuel Synod renamed themselves the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod (ELIS).\n\nThe ELIS in 1884 broke ties with the General Synod, due to this same practice of calling non-Lutheran pastors. When this event occurred in 1884, a small group from the ELIS choose not to break away, and they organized as a separate synod named the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod ''auf alter Grundlage'' (ELIS a.a. G).\n\n==Lutherans in Queensland==\nIn 1885, two Lutheran groups formed in [[Queensland]], namely, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Queensland (ELSQ) and the United German-Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Queensland (UGSELSQ). The ELSQ was initially independent, but joined the General Synod in 1889. The UGSELSQ was also independent at first but merged with the ELIS in 1910.\n\n==United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia==\nAfter [[World War I]], [[Papua New Guinea]] was put into the hands of the Australian government. As part of this, a large number of German missionaries were to be transferred to the control of Australian churches. This issue is cited as a major reason for the formal amalgamation in 1921 of all the independent synods affiliated in the General Synod and the ELIS. The new organization was known as the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia (UELCA). The ELSA a.a. G, which had continued to operate independently since they formed in 1904, merged with UELCA in 1926.\n\n==Merger of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia==\nOn 27 August 1956, the UELCA and ELCA both adopted the ''Theses of Agreement'', which set the stage for the merging of the two organizations. The final merge occurred in [[Tanunda, South Australia]], at a joint synod held on 29 October to 2 November 1966. The merged organization was named the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]] (LCA).\n\nIn 1973, the Lutheran Church of Australia published its first hymnal, the ''Lutheran Hymnal'', revised in the mid-1980s into the present hymn book, the [[Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement|''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplemen''t]].\n\n==References==\n* \u2018[https://web.archive.org/web/20060105231802/http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/nativetitle/pdf/connection_guide.pdf Guide to Compiling a Connection Report for Native Title Claims in Queensland October 2003]\u2019, \u2018[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030153123/http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/nativetitle/ Native Title and Indigenous Land Services]\u2019\n* '[https://web.archive.org/web/20050619030632/http://www.lca.org.au/resources/archives/achivesscope04.pdf Records from the following Lutheran Churches]', Lutheran Church of Australia Archives\n* '[https://lca.box.com/shared/static/bdg4ln3qxraafcaaf2o7.pdf Synod Diagram]', Lutheran Church of Australia Archives (Good diagrammatical representation.

The latter was renamed as the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Australia (ELSA) in 1863.\n\nAfter Kavel\u2019s (1860), and Fritzsche\u2019s (1863) deaths, the Immanuel Synod, and the ELSA were able to reconcile some of their differences. This resulted in a \u201cConfessional Union\u201d, but not an organizational merger.\n\n==Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia==\nThe ELSA continued to coexist independently with the other Lutheran synods until 1966. It underwent a name change in 1944, to the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Australia (ELCA). One group broke away from the ELSA in 1904, and became a district of the [[Evangelical Lutheran Joint Synod of Ohio]]. This group called themselves the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Australia ''auf alter Grundlage'' (ELSA a.a. G) (''auf alter Grundlage'' being German for \"on old basis\").\n\n==Lutherans in Victoria==\nIn 1856, a new independent synod, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Victoria (ELSV), with Pastor [[Matthias Goethe]] serving as president, was founded to serve the Lutheran congregations in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].\n\n==General Synod and the Immanuel Synod==\nIn 1860, the year of Kavel\u2019s death, a group broke away from the Immanuel Synod. This break away group developed a union with the ELSV that was called the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod (General Synod).\n\nIn 1874, the Immanuel Synod also developed an affiliation with the ELSV. The ESLA was opposed to the practice of ELSV calling non-Lutheran pastors, so the Confessional Union they had with Immanuel Synod was dissolved. With this event the Immanuel Synod renamed themselves the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod (ELIS).\n\nThe ELIS in 1884 broke ties with the General Synod, due to this same practice of calling non-Lutheran pastors. When this event occurred in 1884, a small group from the ELIS choose not to break away, and they organized as a separate synod named the Evangelical Lutheran Immanuel Synod ''auf alter Grundlage'' (ELIS a.a. G).\n\n==Lutherans in Queensland==\nIn 1885, two Lutheran groups formed in [[Queensland]], namely, the Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Queensland (ELSQ) and the United German-Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Synod of Queensland (UGSELSQ). The ELSQ was initially independent, but joined the General Synod in 1889. The UGSELSQ was also independent at first but merged with the ELIS in 1910.\n\n==United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia==\nAfter [[World War I]], [[Papua New Guinea]] was put into the hands of the Australian government. As part of this, a large number of German missionaries were to be transferred to the control of Australian churches. This issue is cited as a major reason for the formal amalgamation in 1921 of all the independent synods affiliated in the General Synod and the ELIS. The new organization was known as the United Evangelical Lutheran Church in Australia (UELCA). The ELSA a.a. G, which had continued to operate independently since they formed in 1904, merged with UELCA in 1926.\n\n==Merger of UELCA and ELCA into the Lutheran Church of Australia==\nOn 27 August 1956, the UELCA and ELCA both adopted the ''Theses of Agreement'', which set the stage for the merging of the two organizations. The final merge occurred in [[Tanunda, South Australia]], at a joint synod held on 29 October to 2 November 1966. The merged organization was named the [[Lutheran Church of Australia]] (LCA).\n\nIn 1973, the Lutheran Church of Australia published its first hymnal, the ''Lutheran Hymnal'', revised in the mid-1980s into the present hymn book, the [[Lutheran Hymnal with Supplement|''Lutheran Hymnal with Supplemen''t]].\n\n==References==\n* \u2018[https://web.archive.org/web/20060105231802/http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/nativetitle/pdf/connection_guide.pdf Guide to Compiling a Connection Report for Native Title Claims in Queensland October 2003]\u2019, \u2018[https://web.archive.org/web/20051030153123/http://www.nrm.qld.gov.au/nativetitle/ Native Title and Indigenous Land Services]\u2019\n* '[https://web.archive.org/web/20050619030632/http://www.lca.org.au/resources/archives/achivesscope04.pdf Records from the following Lutheran Churches]', Lutheran Church of Australia Archives\n* '[https://lca.box.com/shared/static/bdg4ln3qxraafcaaf2o7.pdf Synod Diagram]', Lutheran Church of Australia Archives (Good diagrammatical representation.

{"title_page": "Shear wall", "text_new": "[[File:TimberShearwall.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical timber shear wall consists of braced panels in the wall line, constructed using structural plywood sheathing, specific nailing at the edges, and supporting framing.]]In [[structural engineering]], a '''shear wall''' is a vertical element of a seismic force resisting system that is designed to resist in-[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] lateral forces, typically [[wind]] and [[earthquake|seismic]] loads. In many jurisdictions, the [[International Building Code]] and [[International Residential Code]] govern the design of shear walls.\n\nA shear wall resists loads parallel to the plane of the wall. Collectors, also known as [[drag (physics)|drag]] members, transfer the [[diaphragm (structural system)|diaphragm]] shear to shear walls and other vertical elements of the seismic force resisting system. Shear walls are typically light-framed or braced [[wood]]en walls with shear panels, [[reinforced concrete]] walls, reinforced [[Concrete masonry unit|masonry]] walls, or steel plates.\n\n[[Plywood]] is the conventional material used in wood (timber) shear walls, but with advances in technology and modern building methods, other prefabricated options have made it possible to inject shear assemblies into narrow walls that fall at either side of an opening. Sheet steel and steel-backed shear panels in the place of structural plywood in shear walls has proved to provide stronger seismic resistance.\n\n==  Structural design considerations ==\n\n=== Loading and failure mechanisms ===\n\n[[File:Figure 1 Chris.png|thumb|440x440px|'''Figure&nbsp;1''' Failure mechanisms of shear walls. (a) flexural failure, (b) horizontal shear, (c) vertical shear, (d) buckling.]]\nA shear wall is stiffer in its principal axis than it is in the other axis. It is considered as a primary structure which provides relatively stiff resistance to vertical and horizontal forces acting in its plane. Under this combined loading condition, a shear wall develops compatible axial, shear, torsional and flexural strains, resulting in a complicated internal stress distribution. In this way, loads are transferred vertically to the building's foundation. Therefore, there are four critical failure mechanisms; as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. The factors determining the failure mechanism include geometry, loading, material properties, restraint, and construction.\n\n=== Slenderness ratio ===\n\nThe slenderness ratio of a wall is defined as a function of the effective height divided by either the effective thickness or the radius of the gyration of the wall section. It is highly related to the slenderness limit that is the cut-off between elements being classed \"slender\" or \"stocky\". Slender walls are vulnerable to buckling failure modes, including Euler in-plane buckling due to axial compression, Euler out-of-plane buckling due to axial compression and lateral torsional buckling due to bending moment. In the design process, structural engineers need to consider all these failure modes to ensure that the wall design is safe under various kinds of possible loading conditions.\n\n=== Coupling effect of shear walls ===\n\nIn actual structural systems, the shear walls may function as a coupled system instead of isolated walls depending on their arrangements and connections. Two neighboring wall panels can be considered coupled when the interface transfers longitudinal shear to resist the deformation mode. This stress arises whenever a section experiences a flexural or restrained warping stress and its magnitude is dependent on the stiffness of the coupling element. Depending on this stiffness, the performance of a coupled section will fall between that of an ideal uniform element of similar gross plan cross-section and the combined performance of the independent component parts. Another advantage of coupling is that it enhances the overall flexural stiffness dis-proportionally to shear stiffness, resulting in smaller shear deformation.\n\n== Arrangement in buildings with different functions ==\nThe location of a shear wall significantly affects the building function, such as natural ventilation and daylighting performance. The performance requirements vary for buildings of different functions.\n\n=== Hotel and dormitory buildings ===\n\n[[File:Figure 2 Chris.jpg|thumb|'''Figure 2''' Coupled shear wall acting as the partitioning system.]]\nHotel or dormitory buildings require many partitions, allowing insertions of shear walls. In these structures, traditional cellular construction (Figure&nbsp;2) is preferred and a regular wall arrangement with transverse cross walls between rooms and longitudinal spine walls flanking a central corridor is used.\n\n=== Commercial buildings ===\n\n[[File:Figure 3 Chris.png|thumb|'''Figure&nbsp;3''' Shear core structure.]]\nA structure of shear walls in the center of a large building\u2014often encasing an [[elevator shaft]] or stairwell\u2014form a ''shear core''. In multi-story commercial buildings, shear walls form at least one core (Figure&nbsp;3). From a building services perspective, the shear core houses communal services including stairs, lifts, toilets and service risers. Building serviceability requirements necessitates a proper arrangement of a shear core. From the structural point of view, a shear core could strengthen the building's resistance to lateral loads, i.e., wind load and seismic load, and significantly increase the building safety.\n\n== Construction methods\u2014concrete ==\n[[File:Figure 4 Chris.jpg|thumb|'''Figure&nbsp;4''' Reinforced concrete shear wall with both horizontal and vertical reinforcement.]]\n\nConcrete shear walls are reinforced with both horizontal and vertical reinforcement (Figure&nbsp;4). A reinforcement ratio is defined as the ratio of the gross concrete area for a section taken orthogonal to the reinforcement. Construction codes of practice define maximum and minimum amounts of reinforcement as well as the detailing of steel bars. Common construction methods for in-situ reinforced concrete walls include traditional shuttered lifts, slip form, jump form and tunnel form.\n\n=== Shuttered lifts method ===\nThe traditional shuttered lifts method should be used when the total number of walls is small or the arrangement is irregular. In this method, walls are formed one story at one time together with the columns. Although it is slow, this technique may produce a premium finish quality or texture.\n\n=== Slip form method ===\nSlip forming is method of concrete placement whereby a moving form is used to create a continuous wall extrusion. This method is very efficient for well-suited structures, such as flanged and core wall systems. A very accurate wall thickness can be achieved but the surface is rough because of the abrasion of the form on the walls.\n\n=== Jump form method ===\nJump forming, also known as climbing forming, is a method of construction whereby the walls are cast in discrete lifts. It is a stop-start process with day joints formed at each lift level. Similar to slip forming, jump forming is only efficient for structures with repetition of wall arrangement. Moreover, it is convenient for adding connections and extrusions at the floor level due to the discrete features. Nevertheless, the inclusion of day joints leaves higher chances for defects and imperfections.\n\n=== Tunnel form method ===\nTunnel form construction uses a formwork system to cast slabs and walls as a single pour operation. It is suitable for cellular structures with regular repetition of both horizontal and vertical members. The advantage of this method is that the construction can progress vertically and horizontally at the same time, thereby increasing the integrity and stability of the structure.\n\n== Nonplanar shear walls ==\n\nDue to functional requirements, the designer may choose non planar sections like C,L as opposed to the planar sections like rectangular/bar bell sections. Nonplanar sections require 3D analysis and are a research area.\n\n== Modeling techniques ==\nModeling techniques have been progressively updated during the last two decades, moving from linear static to nonlinear dynamic, enabling more realistic representation of global behavior, and different [[Failure mode and effects analysis|failure modes]]. Different modeling techniques shear walls span from macro models such as modified beam-column elements, to micro models such as 3D finite element models. An appropriate modeling technique should:\n\n* Be capable of predicting the inelastic response  \n* Incorporating important materials characteristics\n* [[Simulation|Simulate]] behavioural feature: Lap splice and Bar Slip\n* Represent the migration of the [[neutral axis]]\n* Tension stiffening\n* Interaction of [[Bending|flexure]] and shear actions\n\nDifferent models have been developed over time, including macro-models, vertical line element models, [[Finite element method|finite-element models]], and multi-layer models. More recently, fiber-section beam-columns elements have become popular, as they can model most of the global response and failure modes properly, while avoiding sophistications associated with finite element models.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fprimec.com/modeling-shear-walls|title=Major Techniques for Modeling Shear Walls {{!}} FPrimeC Solutions|date=2016-07-29|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-29}}</ref>\n\n== Methods of analysis ==\n\n* [[Finite element method]]\n* Stringer panel model\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[hold down (structural engineering)|Hold down]]\n* [[Earthquake engineering]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{cite book|last=Reitherman|first=Robert|title=Earthquakes and Engineers: An International History|year=2012|publisher=ASCE Press|location=Reston, VA|isbn=9780784410714|url=http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&productid=154097877|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120726183407/http://www.asce.org/Product.aspx?id=2147487208&productid=154097877|archivedate=2012-07-26}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Shear Wall}}\n[[Category:Structural system]]\n[[Category:Earthquake engineering]]\n[[Category:Construction]]\n\n\n{{civil-engineering-stub}}\n{{Engineering-stub}}\n{{Architecture-stub}}\n", "text_old": "[[File:TimberShearwall.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical timber shear wall consists of braced panels in the wall line, constructed using structural plywood sheathing, specific nailing at the edges, and supporting framing.]]In [[structural engineering]], a '''shear wall''' is a vertical element of a seismic force resisting system that is designed to resist in-[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] lateral forces, typically [[wind]] and [[earthquake|seismic]] loads.

However, it was a critical battle for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and that it would not eventually become part of the future state of West Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>. \n\n==Background==\nIn December, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward Johnson]] occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly 4,400 feet above sea level)  to defend the [[Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike]]. The occupation of the high mountain pass coincided with a bitter winter, with much suffering and disease among the Southern troops<ref>https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/CampAlleghenyConfederateOutpost/</ref>. Early Union victories in the current area of West Virginia had solidified control in much of the western mountains of Virginia, emboldening a Union move to take the strategic Staunton to Petersburg Pike<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Perhaps thinking that Confederate morale was low<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>, a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] force of 2,000 under [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Robert H. Milroy]] attacked Johnson and his 1,200 Confederates at sunrise on December 13.<ref name=\"ABPP\" /><ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting continued for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy had posted a strong force in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to drive off. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" Finally, Milroy's troops were repulsed, and he retreated to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the conflict, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. Ironically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to leave Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The loss of men due to the climate and the logistical challenges of keeping the mountain post effectively supplied led to a decision to abandon it in April 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia, including the Battle of Camp Allegheny, were small by later standards but left and enduring footprint because those states that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia.

However, it was a critical battle for the future border of Virginia and West Virginia, ensuring Highland County remained in Confederate hands and that it would not eventually become part of the future state of West Virginia<ref>https://www.richmond.com/special-section/battle-shaped-destiny-of-virginia-west-virginia/article_228cc12d-12a6-57cb-bdff-815e4ff7364f.html?mode=jqm&alt=gal&pos=1</ref>. \n\n==Background==\nIn December, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces under [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edward Johnson (general)|Edward Johnson]] occupied the summit pass of Allegheny Mountain (roughly at 4,400 feet above sea level)  to defend the [[Staunton and Parkersburg Turnpike]]. The occupation of the high mountain pass coincided with a bitter winter, with much suffering and disease among the Southern troops<ref>https://www.virginia.org/listings/HistoricSites/CampAlleghenyConfederateOutpost/</ref>. Early Union victories in the current area of West Virginia had solidified control in much of the western mountains of Virginia, emboldening a Union move to take the strategic Staunton to Petersburg Pike<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Perhaps thinking that Confederate morale was low<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>, a [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] force of 2,000 under [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Robert H. Milroy]] attacked Johnson and his 1,200 Confederates at sunrise on December 13.<ref name=\"ABPP\" /><ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Camp_Allegheny_Battlefield_West_Virginia.jpg|305px|thumb|right|Map of Camp Allegheny Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]].]]\nIn a piercing winter wind, fighting continued for much of the sunny morning as each side maneuvered on the hillside fields and woods to gain the advantage. On the right flank, Milroy had posted a strong force in a mountain clearing, among the fallen timber, stumps and brush, which proved to be too difficult for the Confederate infantry to drive off. A Confederate [[artillery|artillery battery]] unlimbered and unleashed a \"storm of round shot and canister among them, knocking their timber defences about their heads, and making their nest too hot to hold them...\" Finally, Milroy's troops were repulsed, and he retreated to his camps at Green Spring Run near Cheat Mountain. Johnson's losses were high: 25 men were killed and 97 were wounded in the engagement, plus 23 went missing.\n\nAccording to one Confederate soldier in the [[52nd Virginia Infantry]]:<ref name=\"JSR\" />\n<blockquote>I had a splendid position in this battle and could see the whole fight without having to take any part in it, and I remember how I thought Colonel Johnson must be the most wonderful hero in the world, as I saw him at one point, where his men were hard pressed, snatch a musket in one hand and, swinging a big club in the other, he led his line right up among the enemy, driving them headlong down the mountain, killing and wounding many with the bayonet and capturing a large number of prisoners...</blockquote>\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe battle, though considered insignificant compared to later battles in the conflict, was actually one of the bloodiest in the initial year of the war<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The Union casualties are estimated at 137 and Confederate casualities at 147<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/learn/civil-war/battles/camp-allegheny</ref>. Johnson would receive the nickname \"Allegheny\" Johnson for his role at the battle and for commanding the forbidding mountainous Camp Allegheny post. Ironically, the Confederates had received orders to withdraw a few days prior to the battle<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. But the failed Union advance convinced the Confederate higher command to leave Johnson\u2019s force in place at Camp Allegheny through the remainder of the harsh winter of 1861\u201362<ref>https://www.wvencyclopedia.org/articles/191</ref>. The loss of men due to the climate and the logistical challenges of keeping the mountain post effectively supplied led to a decision to abandon it in April 1862<ref>https://www.battlefields.org/visit/heritage-sites/camp-allegheny</ref>.\n\nThe battles in the rugged and mountainous region of western Virginia, including the Battle of Camp Allegheny, were small by later standards but left and enduring footprint because those states that were in Union control formed the nucleus of the new state of West Virginia. Because of the Battle of Camp Allegheny, the state line between Virginia and West Virginia began and stopped at the Pocohantas and Highland County line.  Pocohantas County remained in Union Control, Highland County in Confederate hands.

Her research was in the field of [[stellar nucleosynthesis]], including the influential [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]].

Clarke]], who was then an undergraduate student at UCL.<ref name=snt/>\n\nIn 1951 she took a position at the [[University of Chicago]]'s [[Yerkes Observatory]], Wisconsin, her first job in the United States. Her research during this period focused on the abundances of [[chemical elements]] in stars. She returned to the UK in 1953, when Margaret and her husband [[Geoffrey Burbidge]] were invited to work with [[William Alfred Fowler]] and [[Fred Hoyle]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].<ref name=snt/> The team combined data on elemental abundances produced by the Burbidges with Hoyle's hypothesis that all chemical elements might be produced in stars by a series of nuclear reactions, and Fowler's laboratory experiments on those reactions.<ref name=snt/> The idea became known as [[stellar nucleosynthesis]]. They published their model in a series of papers, culminating in a [[magnum opus]] in 1957, now known as the [[B2FH paper|B<sup>2</sup>FH paper]] after the initials of Burbidge, Burbidge, Fowler & Hoyle.

Fowler was later awarded the 1983 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] (shared with [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]) for his work on nucleosynthesis, and expressed surprise that Burbidge was not included.<ref name=snt/>\n\nWhen Fowler moved back to the US, he advised the Burbidges to come with him to California, suggesting Margaret (the observer) should re-apply for the fellowship at Mount Wilson Observatory while Geoff (the theorist) should seek the Kellogg Fellowship at [[Caltech]].<ref name=rubin_science/> Margaret's application was again refused on gender grounds, so the couple swapped applications. Geoff won the position at Mount Wilson, while Margaret took the Caltech job in 1955. Whenever Geoff was required to go observing on Mount Wilson, Margaret would accompany him, ostensibly as his assistant.<ref name=rubin_science/> In reality, Geoff worked in the [[photographic dark room]] while Margaret operated the telescope.<ref name=snt/> When the observatory's management found out, they eventually agreed that she could observe there, but only if she and her husband stayed in a separate self-catered cottage on the grounds, rather than the catered dormitory which had been designed for men only.<ref name=nyt/>\n\nShe joined the the [[University of California San Diego]] in 1962.

Beginning in the 1540s, further exploitation of its remaining forests ensued as British factories began consuming vast amounts of wood to fuel its iron industry. In an attempt to preserve its dwindling resource, parliament passed Act for the Preservation of Woods in 1543, limiting further felling of timber to 440 yards from landed property.  However,  the seventeenth century even the tracts that had been reserved for the Crown had been depleted.  As a result, the price of [[firewood]] doubled between 1540 and 1570, leaving the poorest literally freezing to death.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 7\"/><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 14</ref>\n\nIn 1584 [[Richard Hakluyt]], archdeacon of London's Westminster Abbey and preeminent geographer in Europe, published a manuscript titled ''A Discourse of Western Planting'', in which he advocated the colonization of North America for the \u201cemploymente of numbers of idle men\u201d to extract its natural resources for exportation to England. Among the commodities listed as marketable goods was trees.  It was Hakluyt's belief that North America and its endless stock of resources would solve the nation's dilemma.  Hakluyt projected that an established lumber industry would deliver returns that would in itself justify investment in settling the area that was becoming commonly known by several names including; Norumbega, Acadia, Virginia or [[New England]].<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 11-15</ref>\n\nHakluyt and seven other men formed a [[joint stock company]] aptly named the [[Virginia Company]], and on April 10, 1606 received the [[First Charter of Virginia]] from [[King James I]].  The charter split the company into two separate groups, a London-based group known as the [[London Company]] (of which Hakluyt was a member) and a Plymouth-based group known as the [[Plymouth Company]].  The charter decreed the right upon both companies to \u201cmake habitation, plantation, and to deduce a colony of sundry of our people into that part of America commonly called Virginia\u201d between the thirty-fourth and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude.<ref>Billings 1975, p. 3</ref>\nOn December 20, 1606 one hundred men and four boys boarded the ships Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery and set sail down the Thames under [[Captain Christopher Newport]].<ref>Billings 1975 p. 5</ref>\n\nOn April 10, they entered the [[Chesapeake Bay|\u201cChesupioc\u201d Bay]] and landed alongside \u201cfaire meddowes and goodly tall trees.\u201d<ref>Jester 1957, p. 2</ref> Finally on April 26, 1607, the London Company reached Virginia, and declared their settlement Jamestown in honor of the King.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 17-18</ref>\nAlmost immediately the London Company began sending shipments of trees back to England. A letter written in 1608 expressing the abundant discovery of good trees for export read, \u201cI heare not of any novelties or other commodities she hath brought more then sweet woode.\u201d However, exportation of any scale was delayed.  During the winter of 1609, 154 of the original 214 colonists perished.  The event would be remembered as the [[Starving Time]], and it would be another eleven years before [[timber]] production of any consequence would resume in [[New England]].<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 18-19</ref>\n\nIn 1621 pressure from Plymouth Company's financiers impelled the colonists to ship to England a load of their commodities upon the vessel Fortune \u201claden with good clapboard as full as she could stowe.\u201d However, it wasn't long before the pilgrims realized that their wood supply was too precious a resource to export, and promptly restricted overseas sales in a colony-wide decree:\n\n\u201cThat for the preventing of such inconveniences as do and may befall the plantation by the want of timber, That no man of what condition soever sell or transport any manner of works\u2026[that] may tend to the destruction of timber\u2026without the consent approbation and liking of the Governor and councile.\u201d<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 21-22</ref>\n\nBy the 1680s, over two dozen [[sawmill]]s were operating in southern Maine.<ref name=\"answers\">\"Lumber Industry.\" Encyclopedia of American History. Answers Corporation, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Early housing===\nHomes serve as a stabilizer for settlements attempting to establish permanent residence.<ref>Jester 1957, p. 1</ref> Therefore, upon the establishment of Jamestown, the London Company quickly set about constructing a fortification for protection from hostile natives.  By mid-June 1607 the company had finished constructing its fort, triangular in shape, enclosing about one acre, with its river side extending 420 feet and its other sides measuring 300 feet.  Within the fort the company built a church, storehouse, living quarters - all the amenities the colony would need to survive.    Between February and May 1609, improvements were made to the colony; twenty cabins were built, and by 1614 Jamestown consisted of, \u201ctwo faire rowes of howses, all of framed timber, two stories, and an upper garret or corne loft high, besides three large, and substantial storehowses joined together in length some hundred and twenty foot, and in breadth forty\u2026.\u201d Without the town\u201d...in the Island [were] some very pleasant, and beautiful howses, two blockhowses...and certain other framed howses.\u201d<ref>Hatch 1957, pp 4, 8, 13</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Patuxet tribe|Patuxet Indians]] had been shaping the forests for thousands of years.  Where natural clearings already didn\u2019t exist, the Patuxet systematically burned and felled tracts of forest for growing corn and constructing their dwellings.  Many of the original colonial settlements would later be located on such sites, including Plymouth, Boston, Salem, Medford, and Watertown.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 20</ref> However, by the mid-1630s the original treeless outcroppings became overpopulated and could no longer support additional settlement.  As a wave of new immigration arrived, settlers were forced into the woods to make their property claims.\n\nOne colonist explained the process of constructing a rudimentary shelter, whereby an individual would, \u201cdig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, 6 or 7 feet deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all around the wall, and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth; floor this cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with bark and green sods.\"<ref>Rutkow 2012, p22</ref>\n\nAs [[commodities]], tools and building supplies steadily flowed into Virginia, home construction advanced, producing sturdy foundations upon which hewn timbers were erected, the exterior covered with clapboard, and the interior coated with wainscoting.  By 1612, clay was being dredged from the James and Chickahominy Rivers.  Bricks were fired and constructed into chimneys, as well as homes for the more affluent.  However, necessity required clearing the land of timber resulting in an abundance of optimal material for building wood frame houses.\n\nRegarding the architecture of the typical seventeenth century home, the structures were on average one-story structures with a loft accessible via a ladder-like stairway.  There were often chimneys at both ends of the home, where meals typically were prepared upon an open hearth.  The houses averaged between thirty and forty feet in length, and between eighteen and twenty feet in width.<ref>Jester 1957, pp. 20-21, 24</ref><ref>Stanard 1970, p.60</ref>\n\n[[File:Jamestown House.jpg|thumbnail|A Small Colonial Jamestown House, Built Around 1630]]\n\n===Commercial markets===\n\nIn the 1600s virtually no commercial trade existed between [[Britain (placename)|Britain]] and New England.  In fact, it would take nearly fifty years for the Admiralty to personally send mast ships and recruit colonials willing to produce timber for British stores.  However, wood became a material used in abundance for everyday items. Hickory, ash, and hornbeam were used to craft bowls and tools. Cedar and black walnut were used for their ornate properties and crafted into decorative boxes, furniture and ceremonial gunstocks. And sweet sap was extracted from maple, rivaling honey as the colony's premier source of sweetener.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\">Manning 1979, p. 17</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 22-23</ref>\n\nBritain's [[Navigation Acts]] prevented New England from trading its valuable commodities with other European nations. However, timber was excluded from the Navigation Acts allowing the colonies to export vast quantities of wood commodities to nations otherwise beholden to British duties.  Oak staves for wine barrels, along with building timber, white pine boards, and cedars shingles were traded to Spain, Portugal, the [[Canary Islands]], the Azores, and Madeira.  In addition, inter-colonial trade was unrestricted, allowing for the development of a major trade relationship with British Barbados.\n\nHaving long since dropped all other crops in favor of sugar production, and thoroughly stripped their islands of timber, [[Barbados]] and later other Caribbean islands became virtually dependent upon timber imports from New England.  A letter from Barbadian representatives to the British Parliament in 1673 illustrated the necessity to which they relied upon New England timber.  Lumber was required to maintain their buildings, staves and heading of porous red oak were in need for transporting sugar and molasses casks - even production resources were in demand to ensure economies of scale. By 1652 New England had established robust overseas markets shipping lumber, seafaring vessels, and fishing goods.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 24-25</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 22</ref>\n\n===Maritime markets===\n\nOn April 27, 1607, one day after the London Company reached the Chesapeake, a group of colonists built a small boat and launched it the following day.<ref>Hudson 1957, p. 1</ref>  By the 1600s, nearly all commerce was waterborne, and in Virginia the [[shallop]] was the most popular boat for use in the colony.  Due to its relatively small size (16\u201320 feet in length) it was perfectly suited for exploring rivers and creeks, as well as for trading and transporting tobacco to ships.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 21</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 5</ref>\n\nShortly after its inception, shipbuilding in the [[Virginia colony]] was a very simple operation carried out by plantation owners. A suitable location along the bank of a stream with water deep enough to float a vessel was essential.  Likewise, access to suitable timber and the means to transport the materials were crucial.  However, boatbuilding stagnated and shipbuilding failed to develop in those early years. Furthermore, the few boatwrights inhabiting the colony perished in the great [[Indian massacre of 1622]].<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 13\">Manning 1979, p. 13</ref><ref>Evans 1957, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[File:Early Ship Yard.jpg|thumb|Early Ship Yard]]\n\nBy 1629 the respective companies\u2019 financiers had become increasingly concerned upon failures to realize returns on their investment.  As a result, the [[New England Company]] (a reorganized version of the Plymouth Company) along with the directors of the Massachusetts Company sent their own shipwrights to jump-start domestic shipbuilding.  Accordingly, shipbuilding in the early 1630s suddenly came to life along the banks of Boston and Charlestown. The region appeared as though it were designed for building ships.\n\n[[White oak]]s provided excellent ship timber and planking. Cedars, chestnuts, and black oaks were perfect for the underwater portion of the ships \u2013 due to their impermeability to liquids, shock resistance, strength, natural durability, and decay-resistant properties among others.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\"/><ref>Panshin & De Zeeuw 1970, pp. 572, 576</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 23</ref> Within a decade boats and ships proliferated.\n\nIn ''A Perfect Description of Virginia'', an unnamed author wrote that the colony was swarming with \u201cpinnaces, barks, great and small boats many hundreds, for most of their plantations stand upon the rivers\u2019 sides and up little creeks and but a small way into the land.\u201d<ref>Evans 1957, p. 12</ref>\nIn 1662 the [[General Assembly of Virginia]] sought further to encourage shipbuilding by enacting a series of incentivizing laws which declared:\n\n\u201cBe it enacted that every one that shall build a small vessel with a deck be allowed, if above twenty and under fifty tons, fifty pounds of tobacco per ton; if above fifty and under one hundred tons, two hundred pounds of tobacco per ton; if above one hundred tons, two hundred pounds per ton. Provided the vessel is not sold except to an inhabitant of this country in three years.\u201d\n\nBuilders were also incentivized by receiving two shilling exemptions off export duties per hogshead of tobacco, as well as exemption from castle duties, two pence reduction per gallon on imported liquor, and exemption from duties traditionally imposed on shipmasters upon entering and clearing. Furthermore, throughout the duration of the royal government there would be various laws remitting the duties on imports received on native ships, remission of tonnage duties,  and exemptions for licensing and bond where applicable.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe size of vessels in Virginia had steadily been increasing as well, and the craftsmanship had been improving, such that in a letter to [[Lord Arlington]], Secretary of the Colony Thomas Ludwell boasted: \u201cWe have built several vessels to trade with our neighbors, and do hope ere long to build bigger ships and such as may trade with England.\u201d Such was the astonishment at how quickly New England's shipbuilding had rapidly progressed that an article was submitted in the English News Letter of March 12, 1666 describing \u201cA frigate of between thirty and forty [tons?], built in Virginia, looks so fair, it is believed that in short time, they will get the art of shipbuilding as good frigates as there are in England\u201d.<ref>Evans 1957, pp. 24, 25</ref>  As early as 1690 Dr. Lyon G. Tyler in The Cradle of the Republic wrote that ships of 300 tons were built in Virginia and trade in the West Indies was conducted in small sloops.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 26</ref>\n\nRegardless of the increase in timber production, the commodity was not as profitable as Richard Hakluyt had hoped.  The cause was due in part to the higher wages paid by freeholders compared to their serf counterparts in Europe, as well as the cost of transatlantic shipping.  While Boston ports charged forty to fifty shillings, the Baltic ports only charged nine.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p 24</ref>\n\nThat changed when England awoke to a timber crisis after commercial competition with the Dutch came to a breaking point.  The Navigation Acts of 1651 had greatly limited imports into England, prompting Denmark to prey upon British ships as they sailed to and from the Baltic Sea transporting their timber cargo. It was at this time, on the eve of the first Anglo-Dutch War (1652\u20131654) that the Admiralty considered a plan to develop a North American source of timber and masts, and forgo possible crisis as a result of impending lengthy repair of battle-shattered masts.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 13\"/>\n\nNorth European fir had been the Admiralty's timber of choice for its mast construction.  However, finding its supply chain obstructed, the Admiralty's second choice was the North American white pine.  A shipload had been received from Jamestown in 1609 and another in 1634 from Penobscot Bay, both of which were found to be agreeable .<ref>Manning 1979, p. 9</ref>  There is disagreement amongst scholars about which variety was the strongest, however the North American white pine was considered more resilient, one fourth lighter in weight, and exponentially larger; reaching a height of 250 feet, several feet in diameter at the base, and weighing in as much as 15 to 20 tons.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 27, 28</ref> Accordingly, the Admiralty sent a fleet of mast ships in 1652 and thus began Britain's steady importation New England masts .<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of New England's shipbuilding industry, it became common for the British to retail New England ships due to significantly lower production costs. The abundance of naval stores and good timber enabled colonists to produce ships thirty percent cheaper than the English, making it the most profitable manufactured export during the colonial period.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 23, 24</ref>\n\nThe Admiralty's venture to get mast logs out of the New England forest, in turn, produced a labor force that with it developed into a booming domestic lumber industry. Since ninety-plus percent of New England pines harvested were unsuitable for masts, an important building and commodities lumber market emerged converting rejected masts into merchantable boards, joists and other structural lumber. Such was the success of the colonial entrepreneurs that the Crown became concerned that its newfound resource of dependable naval stores and masts would quickly dwindle.\n\nIn response, [[King William III]] enacted a new charter in October 1691 governing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, reserving for the King \u201call Trees of the Diameter of Twenty Four Inches and upwards\u201d that were not previously granted to private persons.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 25, 27</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 25</ref> The portion of the charter quickly became known as the King's Broad Arrow.  All timber consigned under the charter were marked with three strikes of an ax resembling an upside down arrow. The importance of the policy only increased with the onset of The Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), which all but halted Baltic exports to England. Consequently, British Parliament began passing a series of acts regulating imports from the Baltic and promoting imports from New England.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\">Manning 1979, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:The King's Broad Arrow.jpg|thumb|Agents Marking Trees with the King's Broad Arrow]]\n\nThe Act of 1704 encouraged the import of naval stores form New England, offering \u00a34 per ton of tar or pitch, \u00a33 per ton of resin of turpentine, and \u00a31 per ton of masts and bowsprits (40 cubic feet).  The Act of 1705 forbade the cutting of unfenced or small pitch pine and tar trees with a diameter less than twelve inches.  The Act of 1711 gave the Survey General of the King's Forests authority over all colonies from New Jersey to Maine. Lastly, the Act of 1721 extended dominion of the King's Forests to any trees not found within a township or its boundaries, and officially recognized the American word \u2018lumber\u2019 for the first time.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\"/>\n\nHowever, the acts and policy proved virtually impossible to enforce. A survey in 1700 documented more than fifteen thousand logs that violated the twenty-four inch restriction.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\"/>  Attempts to curb illegal lumbering continued under the appointment of John Bridger as survey general in 1705.  His task was to survey and protect His Majesty's Woods, duties of which he performed with great enthusiasm.  Bridger conducted extensive mast surveys, confiscated illegal timber, and prosecuted violators, to no avail.  Colonists didn't care, and often disregarded the Broad Arrow mark.  It became virtually impossible for a single surveyor with a few deputies to police the entire expanse of New England's forests. After much pleading on behalf of Bridger for more resources and authority, the Parliamentary Acts (1704\u20131729) slowly eased the burden of his charge.  Ironically, in 1718 Bridger was removed for corruption and his predecessor Colonel David Dunbar, treated the post with indifference.<ref>Manning 1979, p. 33</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 29</ref>\n\nThe effects of the policy on the American economy remains unclear.  Without the Admiralty's quest for choice timber the American lumber industry may not have developed as quickly.  Certainly, the policy ensured a steady reliable source of mast timber during England's ascension to naval dominance, but at a price. Perceived violations of property rights on New England colonists served only to stoke the embers of rebellion.  Shipments of New England timber continued unabated until the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  The last supply of New England masts reached the home country on July 31, 1775 after more than 4500 white pines had been sent under the Broad Arrow policy.<ref>Manning 1979, pp. 13, 33</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe American industrial revolution caused the national demand for timber to spike. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], more than ninety percent of the nation's energy came from wood, fueling the great transportation vehicles of the era.<ref name=\"answers\"/> As Americans settled the timber-starved Great Plains, they needed material from the lumber-rich parts of the nation with which to build their cities. The burgeoning railroad industry accounted for a fourth of the national lumber demand and required the product to build rail cars and stations, fashion ties, and power trains.<ref name=\"answers\"/> Even as the coal began to replace wood as an energy source, the coal mining industry itself needed lumber to support its mining structures and create its own rail beds.\nTechnological development helped the industry meet the soaring demand. New methods of transporting lumber, like the steam engine, provided the means to log further inland and away from water. New machines such as the circular saw and the band saw allowed forests to be felled with significantly improved efficiency.<ref name=\"encarta\">\"Lumber Industry,\" Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae Online Encyclopedia 2000 http://encarta.msn.com   {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWPcsSb?url=http://encarta.msn.com/ |date=2009-10-31 }} \u00a9 1997-2000 Microsoft Corporation</ref> The resulting increased timber production saw New England forests become rapidly depleted, and American loggers began methodically cutting their way south and west in search of new forests.\n\n==Nineteenth century==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"float:right;margin-left:10px\"\n!colspan=2|United States<br>Lumber Production <ref>United States Forest Service.

The shift west was sudden and precipitous: in 1899, [[Idaho]] produced 65 million board feet of lumber; in 1910, it produced 745 million.<ref>Pacific Northwest Research Station.

Total production of lumber fell at a devastating rate, from 35 billion board feet in 1920 to 10 billion board feet in 1932.

President Roosevelt believed that unrestrained competition was one of the root causes of the Great Depression. According to The Effect of the N.R.A. Lumber Code on Forest Policy, national lumber codes regulated various aspects of the industry, including wages, hours, and price.<ref name=\"Duncan 1941, p. 92\">Duncan 1941, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe industry was suffering on many fronts.  It was incurring low prices for its products, low wages for its workers, and facing exhausted tracts of forest caused previously by overproduction in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"Duncan 1941, p. 92\"/> As illustrated in table 2, prices rebounded in 1934. Note that it is not only because of Lumber code but also comprehensive impact of devaluation, amplified public work spending, and improved banking system.<ref>Duncan 1941, p. 94</ref>\n\nAs old-growth forest disappeared rapidly, the United States' timber resources ceased to appear limitless. Canadian lumberman James Little remarked in 1876 that the rate at which the Great Lakes forests were being logged was \"not only burning the candle at both ends, but cutting it in two, and setting the match to the four ends to enable them to double the process of exhaustion.\"<ref>Little, James. The Timber Supply Question, of the Dominion of Canada and the United States of America. Montreal: Lovell, 1876. p. 14.</ref>\n\nTo deal with the increasingly limited availability of timber resources, the [[Division of Forestry]] was established in 1885, and in 1891 the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891|Forest Reserve Act]] passed, setting aside large tracts of forest as federal land. Loggers were forced to make already cut lands productive again, and the reforesting of timberlands became integral to the industry. Some loggers pushed further northwest to [[Alaskan]] forests, but by the 1960s most of the remaining uncut forest became protected.<ref name=\"answers\"/>\n\nThe portable [[chain saw]] and other technological developments helped drive more efficient logging, but the proliferation of other building materials in the twentieth century saw the end of the rapidly rising demand of the previous century. In 1950, the United States produced 38 billion board feet of lumber, and that number remained fairly constant throughout the decades moving forward, with the national production at 32.9 billion board feet in 1960 and 34.7 billion board feet in 1970.<ref>Ulrich, Alice H.

Beginning in the 1540s, further exploitation of its remaining forests ensued as British factories began consuming vast amounts of wood to fuel its iron industry. In an attempt to preserve its dwindling resource, parliament passed Act for the Preservation of Woods in 1543, limiting further felling of timber to 440 yards from landed property.  However,  the seventeenth century even the tracts that had been reserved for the Crown had been depleted.  As a result, the price of [[firewood]] doubled between 1540 and 1570, leaving the poorest literally freezing to death.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 7\"/><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 14</ref>\n\nIn 1584 [[Richard Hakluyt]], archdeacon of London's Westminster Abbey and preeminent geographer in Europe, published a manuscript titled ''A Discourse of Western Planting'', in which he advocated the colonization of North America for the \u201cemploymente of numbers of idle men\u201d to extract its natural resources for exportation to England. Among the commodities listed as marketable goods was trees.  It was Hakluyt's belief that North America and its endless stock of resources would solve the nation's dilemma.  Hakluyt projected that an established lumber industry would deliver returns that would in itself justify investment in settling the area that was becoming commonly known by several names including; Norumbega, Acadia, Virginia or [[New England]].<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 11-15</ref>\n\nHakluyt and seven other men formed a [[joint stock company]] aptly named the [[Virginia Company]], and on April 10, 1606 received the [[First Charter of Virginia]] from [[King James I]].  The charter split the company into two separate groups, a London-based group known as the [[London Company]] (of which Hakluyt was a member) and a Plymouth-based group known as the [[Plymouth Company]].  The charter decreed the right upon both companies to \u201cmake habitation, plantation, and to deduce a colony of sundry of our people into that part of America commonly called Virginia\u201d between the thirty-fourth and forty-fifth degrees of north latitude.<ref>Billings 1975, p. 3</ref>\nOn December 20, 1606 one hundred men and four boys boarded the ships Susan Constant, Godspeed, and Discovery and set sail down the Thames under [[Captain Christopher Newport]].<ref>Billings 1975 p. 5</ref>\n\nOn April 10, they entered the [[Chesapeake Bay|\u201cChesupioc\u201d Bay]] and landed alongside \u201cfaire meddowes and goodly tall trees.\u201d<ref>Jester 1957, p. 2</ref> Finally on April 26, 1607, the London Company reached Virginia, and declared their settlement Jamestown in honor of the King.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 17-18</ref>\nAlmost immediately the London Company began sending shipments of trees back to England. A letter written in 1608 expressing the abundant discovery of good trees for export read, \u201cI heare not of any novelties or other commodities she hath brought more then sweet woode.\u201d However, exportation of any scale was delayed.  During the winter of 1609, 154 of the original 214 colonists perished.

By mid-June 1607 the company had finished constructing its fort, triangular in shape, enclosing about one acre, with its river side extending 420 feet and its other sides measuring 300 feet.  Within the fort the company built a church, storehouse, living quarters - all the amenities the colony would need to survive.    Between February and May 1609, improvements were made to the colony; twenty cabins were built, and by 1614 Jamestown consisted of, \u201ctwo faire rowes of howses, all of framed timber, two stories, and an upper garret or corne loft high, besides three large, and substantial storehowses joined together in length some hundred and twenty foot, and in breadth forty\u2026.\u201d Without the town\u201d...in the Island [were] some very pleasant, and beautiful howses, two blockhowses...and certain other framed howses.\u201d<ref>Hatch 1957, pp 4, 8, 13</ref>\n\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans, [[Patuxet tribe|Patuxet Indians]] had been shaping the forests for thousands of years.  Where natural clearings already didn\u2019t exist, the Patuxet systematically burned and felled tracts of forest for growing corn and constructing their dwellings.  Many of the original colonial settlements would later be located on such sites, including Plymouth, Boston, Salem, Medford, and Watertown.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 20</ref> However, by the mid-1630s the original treeless outcroppings became overpopulated and could no longer support additional settlement.  As a wave of new immigration arrived, settlers were forced into the woods to make their property claims.\n\nOne colonist explained the process of constructing a rudimentary shelter, whereby an individual would, \u201cdig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, 6 or 7 feet deep, as long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all around the wall, and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to prevent the caving in of the earth; floor this cellar with plank and wainscot it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up and cover the spars with bark and green sods.\"<ref>Rutkow 2012, p22</ref>\n\nAs [[commodities]], tools and building supplies steadily flowed into Virginia, home construction advanced, producing sturdy foundations upon which hewn timbers were erected, the exterior covered with clapboard, and the interior coated with wainscoting.  By 1612, clay was being dredged from the James and Chickahominy Rivers.  Bricks were fired and constructed into chimneys, as well as homes for the more affluent.  However, necessity required clearing the land of timber resulting in an abundance of optimal material for building wood frame houses.\n\nRegarding the architecture of the typical seventeenth century home, the structures were on average one-story structures with a loft accessible via a ladder-like stairway.  There were often chimneys at both ends of the home, where meals typically were prepared upon an open hearth.  The houses averaged between thirty and forty feet in length, and between eighteen and twenty feet in width.<ref>Jester 1957, pp. 20-21, 24</ref><ref>Stanard 1970, p.60</ref>\n\n[[File:Jamestown House.jpg|thumbnail|A Small Colonial Jamestown House, Built Around 1630]]\n\n===Commercial markets===\n\nIn the 1600s virtually no commercial trade existed between [[Britain (placename)|Britain]] and New England.  In fact, it would take nearly fifty years for the Admiralty to personally send mast ships and recruit colonials willing to produce timber for British stores.  However, wood became a material used in abundance for everyday items. Hickory, ash, and hornbeam were used to craft bowls and tools. Cedar and black walnut were used for their ornate properties and crafted into decorative boxes, furniture and ceremonial gunstocks. And sweet sap was extracted from maple, rivaling honey as the colony's premier source of sweetener.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\">Manning 1979, p. 17</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 22-23</ref>\n\nBritain's [[Navigation Acts]] prevented New England from trading its valuable commodities with other European nations. However, timber was excluded from the Navigation Acts allowing the colonies to export vast quantities of wood commodities to nations otherwise beholden to British duties.  Oak staves for wine barrels, along with building timber, white pine boards, and cedars shingles were traded to Spain, Portugal, the [[Canary Islands]], the Azores, and Madeira.  In addition, inter-colonial trade was unrestricted, allowing for the development of a major trade relationship with British Barbados.\n\nHaving long since dropped all other crops in favor of sugar production, and thoroughly stripped their islands of timber, [[Barbados]] and later other Caribbean islands became virtually dependent upon timber imports from New England.  A letter from Barbadian representatives to the British Parliament in 1673 illustrated the necessity to which they relied upon New England timber.  Lumber was required to maintain their buildings, staves and heading of porous red oak were in need for transporting sugar and molasses casks - even production resources were in demand to ensure economies of scale. By 1652 New England had established robust overseas markets shipping lumber, seafaring vessels, and fishing goods.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp 24-25</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 22</ref>\n\n===Maritime markets===\n\nOn April 27, 1607, one day after the London Company reached the Chesapeake, a group of colonists built a small boat and launched it the following day.<ref>Hudson 1957, p. 1</ref>  By the 1600s, nearly all commerce was waterborne, and in Virginia the [[shallop]] was the most popular boat for use in the colony.  Due to its relatively small size (16\u201320 feet in length) it was perfectly suited for exploring rivers and creeks, as well as for trading and transporting tobacco to ships.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 21</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 5</ref>\n\nShortly after its inception, shipbuilding in the [[Virginia colony]] was a very simple operation carried out by plantation owners. A suitable location along the bank of a stream with water deep enough to float a vessel was essential.  Likewise, access to suitable timber and the means to transport the materials were crucial.  However, boatbuilding stagnated and shipbuilding failed to develop in those early years. Furthermore, the few boatwrights inhabiting the colony perished in the great [[Indian massacre of 1622]].<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 13\">Manning 1979, p. 13</ref><ref>Evans 1957, p. 16</ref>\n\n[[File:Early Ship Yard.jpg|thumb|Early Ship Yard]]\n\nBy 1629 the respective companies\u2019 financiers had become increasingly concerned upon failures to realize returns on their investment.  As a result, the [[New England Company]] (a reorganized version of the Plymouth Company) along with the directors of the Massachusetts Company sent their own shipwrights to jump-start domestic shipbuilding.  Accordingly, shipbuilding in the early 1630s suddenly came to life along the banks of Boston and Charlestown. The region appeared as though it were designed for building ships.\n\n[[White oak]]s provided excellent ship timber and planking. Cedars, chestnuts, and black oaks were perfect for the underwater portion of the ships \u2013 due to their impermeability to liquids, shock resistance, strength, natural durability, and decay-resistant properties among others.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\"/><ref>Panshin & De Zeeuw 1970, pp. 572, 576</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 23</ref> Within a decade boats and ships proliferated.\n\nIn ''A Perfect Description of Virginia'', an unnamed author wrote that the colony was swarming with \u201cpinnaces, barks, great and small boats many hundreds, for most of their plantations stand upon the rivers\u2019 sides and up little creeks and but a small way into the land.\u201d<ref>Evans 1957, p. 12</ref>\nIn 1662 the [[General Assembly of Virginia]] sought further to encourage shipbuilding by enacting a series of incentivizing laws which declared:\n\n\u201cBe it enacted that every one that shall build a small vessel with a deck be allowed, if above twenty and under fifty tons, fifty pounds of tobacco per ton; if above fifty and under one hundred tons, two hundred pounds of tobacco per ton; if above one hundred tons, two hundred pounds per ton. Provided the vessel is not sold except to an inhabitant of this country in three years.\u201d\n\nBuilders were also incentivized by receiving two shilling exemptions off export duties per hogshead of tobacco, as well as exemption from castle duties, two pence reduction per gallon on imported liquor, and exemption from duties traditionally imposed on shipmasters upon entering and clearing. Furthermore, throughout the duration of the royal government there would be various laws remitting the duties on imports received on native ships, remission of tonnage duties,  and exemptions for licensing and bond where applicable.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 23</ref>\n\nThe size of vessels in Virginia had steadily been increasing as well, and the craftsmanship had been improving, such that in a letter to [[Lord Arlington]], Secretary of the Colony Thomas Ludwell boasted: \u201cWe have built several vessels to trade with our neighbors, and do hope ere long to build bigger ships and such as may trade with England.\u201d Such was the astonishment at how quickly New England's shipbuilding had rapidly progressed that an article was submitted in the English News Letter of March 12, 1666 describing \u201cA frigate of between thirty and forty [tons?], built in Virginia, looks so fair, it is believed that in short time, they will get the art of shipbuilding as good frigates as there are in England\u201d.<ref>Evans 1957, pp. 24, 25</ref>  As early as 1690 Dr. Lyon G. Tyler in The Cradle of the Republic wrote that ships of 300 tons were built in Virginia and trade in the West Indies was conducted in small sloops.<ref>Evans 1957, p. 26</ref>\n\nRegardless of the increase in timber production, the commodity was not as profitable as Richard Hakluyt had hoped.  The cause was due in part to the higher wages paid by freeholders compared to their serf counterparts in Europe, as well as the cost of transatlantic shipping.  While Boston ports charged forty to fifty shillings, the Baltic ports only charged nine.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p 24</ref>\n\nThat changed when England awoke to a timber crisis after commercial competition with the Dutch came to a breaking point.  The Navigation Acts of 1651 had greatly limited imports into England, prompting Denmark to prey upon British ships as they sailed to and from the Baltic Sea transporting their timber cargo. It was at this time, on the eve of the first Anglo-Dutch War (1652\u20131654) that the Admiralty considered a plan to develop a North American source of timber and masts, and forgo possible crisis as a result of impending lengthy repair of battle-shattered masts.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 13\"/>\n\nNorth European fir had been the Admiralty's timber of choice for its mast construction.  However, finding its supply chain obstructed, the Admiralty's second choice was the North American white pine.  A shipload had been received from Jamestown in 1609 and another in 1634 from Penobscot Bay, both of which were found to be agreeable .<ref>Manning 1979, p. 9</ref>  There is disagreement amongst scholars about which variety was the strongest, however the North American white pine was considered more resilient, one fourth lighter in weight, and exponentially larger; reaching a height of 250 feet, several feet in diameter at the base, and weighing in as much as 15 to 20 tons.<ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 27, 28</ref> Accordingly, the Admiralty sent a fleet of mast ships in 1652 and thus began Britain's steady importation New England masts .<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 17\"/>\n\nFollowing the development of New England's shipbuilding industry, it became common for the British to retail New England ships due to significantly lower production costs. The abundance of naval stores and good timber enabled colonists to produce ships thirty percent cheaper than the English, making it the most profitable manufactured export during the colonial period.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 23, 24</ref>\n\nThe Admiralty's venture to get mast logs out of the New England forest, in turn, produced a labor force that with it developed into a booming domestic lumber industry. Since ninety-plus percent of New England pines harvested were unsuitable for masts, an important building and commodities lumber market emerged converting rejected masts into merchantable boards, joists and other structural lumber. Such was the success of the colonial entrepreneurs that the Crown became concerned that its newfound resource of dependable naval stores and masts would quickly dwindle.\n\nIn response, [[King William III]] enacted a new charter in October 1691 governing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, reserving for the King \u201call Trees of the Diameter of Twenty Four Inches and upwards\u201d that were not previously granted to private persons.<ref>Rutkow 2012, pp. 25, 27</ref><ref>Manning 1979, p. 25</ref> The portion of the charter quickly became known as the King's Broad Arrow.  All timber consigned under the charter were marked with three strikes of an ax resembling an upside down arrow. The importance of the policy only increased with the onset of The Great Northern War (1700\u20131721), which all but halted Baltic exports to England. Consequently, British Parliament began passing a series of acts regulating imports from the Baltic and promoting imports from New England.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\">Manning 1979, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:The King's Broad Arrow.jpg|thumb|Agents Marking Trees with the King's Broad Arrow]]\n\nThe Act of 1704 encouraged the import of naval stores form New England, offering \u00a34 per ton of tar or pitch, \u00a33 per ton of resin of turpentine, and \u00a31 per ton of masts and bowsprits (40 cubic feet).  The Act of 1705 forbade the cutting of unfenced or small pitch pine and tar trees with a diameter less than twelve inches.  The Act of 1711 gave the Survey General of the King's Forests authority over all colonies from New Jersey to Maine. Lastly, the Act of 1721 extended dominion of the King's Forests to any trees not found within a township or its boundaries, and officially recognized the American word \u2018lumber\u2019 for the first time.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\"/>\n\nHowever, the acts and policy proved virtually impossible to enforce. A survey in 1700 documented more than fifteen thousand logs that violated the twenty-four inch restriction.<ref name=\"Manning 1979, p. 28\"/>  Attempts to curb illegal lumbering continued under the appointment of John Bridger as survey general in 1705.  His task was to survey and protect His Majesty's Woods, duties of which he performed with great enthusiasm.  Bridger conducted extensive mast surveys, confiscated illegal timber, and prosecuted violators, to no avail.  Colonists didn\u2019t care, and often disregarded the Broad Arrow mark.  It became virtually impossible for a single surveyor with a few deputies to police the entire expanse of New England's forests. After much pleading on behalf of Bridger for more resources and authority, the Parliamentary Acts (1704\u20131729) slowly eased the burden of his charge.  Ironically, in 1718 Bridger was removed for corruption and his predecessor Colonel David Dunbar, treated the post with indifference.<ref>Manning 1979, p. 33</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 29</ref>\n\nThe effects of the policy on the American economy remains unclear.  Without the Admiralty's quest for choice timber the American lumber industry may not have developed as quickly.  Certainly, the policy ensured a steady reliable source of mast timber during England's ascension to naval dominance, but at a price. Perceived violations of property rights on New England colonists served only to stoke the embers of rebellion.  Shipments of New England timber continued unabated until the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].  The last supply of New England masts reached the home country on July 31, 1775 after more than 4500 white pines had been sent under the Broad Arrow policy.<ref>Manning 1979, pp. 13, 33</ref><ref>Rutkow 2012, p. 32</ref>\n\nThe American industrial revolution caused the national demand for timber to spike. Prior to the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], more than ninety percent of the nation's energy came from wood, fueling the great transportation vehicles of the era.<ref name=\"answers\"/> As Americans settled the timber-starved Great Plains, they needed material from the lumber-rich parts of the nation with which to build their cities. The burgeoning railroad industry accounted for a fourth of the national lumber demand and required the product to build rail cars and stations, fashion ties, and power trains.<ref name=\"answers\"/> Even as the coal began to replace wood as an energy source, the coal mining industry itself needed lumber to support its mining structures and create its own rail beds.\nTechnological development helped the industry meet the soaring demand. New methods of transporting lumber, like the steam engine, provided the means to log further inland and away from water. New machines such as the circular saw and the band saw allowed forests to be felled with significantly improved efficiency.<ref name=\"encarta\">\"Lumber Industry,\" Microsoft\u00ae Encarta\u00ae Online Encyclopedia 2000 http://encarta.msn.com   {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5kvWPcsSb?url=http://encarta.msn.com/ |date=2009-10-31 }} \u00a9 1997-2000 Microsoft Corporation</ref> The resulting increased timber production saw New England forests become rapidly depleted, and American loggers began methodically cutting their way south and west in search of new forests.\n\n==Nineteenth century==\n{|class=wikitable style=\"float:right;margin-left:10px\"\n!colspan=2|United States<br>Lumber Production <ref>United States Forest Service.

The shift west was sudden and precipitous: in 1899, [[Idaho]] produced 65 million board feet of lumber; in 1910, it produced 745 million.<ref>Pacific Northwest Research Station.

Total production of lumber fell at a devastating rate, from 35 billion board feet in 1920 to 10 billion board feet in 1932.

President Roosevelt believed that unrestrained competition was one of the root causes of the Great Depression. According to The Effect of the N.R.A. Lumber Code on Forest Policy, national lumber codes regulated various aspects of the industry, including wages, hours, and price.<ref name=\"Duncan 1941, p. 92\">Duncan 1941, p. 92</ref>\n\nThe industry was suffering on many fronts.  It was incurring low prices for its products, low wages for its workers, and facing exhausted tracts of forest caused previously by overproduction in the late 1920s.<ref name=\"Duncan 1941, p. 92\"/> As illustrated in table 2, prices rebounded in 1934. Note that it is not only because of Lumber code but also comprehensive impact of devaluation, amplified public work spending, and improved banking system.<ref>Duncan 1941, p. 94</ref>\n\nAs old-growth forest disappeared rapidly, the United States' timber resources ceased to appear limitless. Canadian lumberman James Little remarked in 1876 that the rate at which the Great Lakes forests were being logged was \"not only burning the candle at both ends, but cutting it in two, and setting the match to the four ends to enable them to double the process of exhaustion.\"<ref>Little, James. The Timber Supply Question, of the Dominion of Canada and the United States of America. Montreal: Lovell, 1876. p. 14.</ref>\n\nTo deal with the increasingly limited availability of timber resources, the [[Division of Forestry]] was established in 1885, and in 1891 the [[Forest Reserve Act of 1891|Forest Reserve Act]] passed, setting aside large tracts of forest as federal land. Loggers were forced to make already cut lands productive again, and the reforesting of timberlands became integral to the industry. Some loggers pushed further northwest to [[Alaskan]] forests, but by the 1960s most of the remaining uncut forest became protected.<ref name=\"answers\"/>\n\nThe portable [[chain saw]] and other technological developments helped drive more efficient logging, but the proliferation of other building materials in the twentieth century saw the end of the rapidly rising demand of the previous century. In 1950, the United States produced 38 billion board feet of lumber, and that number remained fairly constant throughout the decades moving forward, with the national production at 32.9 billion board feet in 1960 and 34.7 billion board feet in 1970.<ref>Ulrich, Alice H.
