The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons being replaced by former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]], who had previously worked with the members of Pearl Jam in the Temple of the Dog project and had drummed on the band's first demos. Cameron has remained as Pearl Jam's drummer ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam released \"[[Last Kiss]]\" on the band's fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. \"Last Kiss\" became the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'', and initiated a series of \"[[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|official bootlegs]]\" of live albums. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629092938/http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |author=Davis, Darren |publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

''Ten'' broke Pearl Jam into the mainstream, and became one of the best-selling alternative albums of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |title=Top 100 Albums |publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |accessdate=July 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqv3Gpco?url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTop100 |archivedate=January 17, 2010}}</ref> Following an intense touring schedule, the band went into the studio to record what would become its second studio album, ''[[Vs.

Pearl Jam subsequently released ''[[No Code]]'' in 1996 and ''[[Yield (album)|Yield]]'' in 1998. The band once again changed drummers in 1998, with Irons being replaced by former Soundgarden drummer [[Matt Cameron]], who had previously worked with the members of Pearl Jam in the Temple of the Dog project and had drummed on the band's first demos. Cameron has remained as Pearl Jam's drummer ever since. In 1998, Pearl Jam released \"[[Last Kiss]]\" on the band's fan club Christmas single; however, by popular demand, the cover was released to the public as a single in 1999. \"Last Kiss\" became the band's highest-charting single, peaking at number two on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. In 2000, Pearl Jam released its sixth studio album, ''[[Binaural (album)|Binaural]]'', and initiated a series of \"[[Pearl Jam Official Bootlegs|official bootlegs]]\" of live albums. The band released seventy-two such live albums in 2000 and 2001, and set a record for most albums to debut in the ''Billboard'' 200 at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120629092938/http://music.yahoo.com/pearl-jam/news/artist-name-pearl-jam-id-1020778-breaks-its-own-chart-record--12055527 |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 29, 2012 |title=Pearl Jam Breaks Its Own Chart Record |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |author=Davis, Darren |publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

The error may also be used when a server does not wish to disclose whether it has the requested information or not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref>\nError 404.\n\nThe website hosting server will typically generate a \"404 Not Found\" web page when a user attempts to follow a [[link rot|broken or dead link]]; hence the 404 error is one of the most recognizable errors encountered on the [[World Wide Web]].\n\n==Overview==\n\nWhen communicating via HTTP, a server is required to respond to a request, such as a [[web browser]] request for a [[web page]], with a numeric response code and an optional, mandatory, or disallowed (based upon the status code) message. In the code 404, the first digit indicates a client error, such as a mistyped [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL). The following two digits indicate the specific error encountered. HTTP's use of three-digit codes is similar to the use of such codes in earlier protocols such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[Network News Transfer Protocol|NNTP]]. At the HTTP level, a 404 response code is followed by a human-readable \"reason phrase\". The HTTP specification suggests the phrase \"Not Found\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7231#section-6.5.4|title=RFC 7231, HTTP/1.1 Semantics and Content, Section 6.5.4 404 Not Found|publisher=ietf.org|date=June 2014|accessdate=2018-12-13}}</ref> and many web servers by default issue an HTML page that includes both the 404 code and the \"Not Found\" phrase.\n\nA 404 error is often returned when pages have been moved or deleted. In the first case, it is better to employ [[URL mapping]] or [[URL redirection]] by returning a 301 Moved Permanently response, which can be configured in most server configuration files, or through [[URL rewriting]]; in the second case, a 410 Gone should be returned. Because these two options require special server configuration, most websites do not make use of them.\n\n404 errors should not be confused with [[Domain Name System|DNS]] errors, which appear when the given URL refers to a server name that does not exist. A 404 error indicates that the server itself was found, but that the server was not able to retrieve the requested page.\n\n==Soft 404 errors==\n{{anchor|Soft 404}}\n\nSome websites report a \"not found\" error by returning a standard web page with a \"200 OK\" response code, falsely reporting that the page loaded properly; this is known as a ''soft 404''. The term \"soft 404\" was introduced in 2004 by Ziv Bar-Yossef ''et al''.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Sic Transit Gloria Telae: Towards an Understanding of the Web's Decay |journal=Proceedings of the 13th International Conference on World Wide Web (WWW) |author1=Ziv Bar-Yossef |author2=Andrei Z.

Where previously priests of Sol had been simply ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|sacerdotes]]'' and tended to belong to lower ranks of Roman society,<ref>{{harv|Hijmans|2009|pp=504\u20135}}</ref> they were now ''pontifices'' and members of the new [[College of Pontiffs|college of pontifices]] instituted by Aurelian. Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.<ref>For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J.&nbsp;Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order (''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' vol.&nbsp;6, 1739\u20131742). In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place ({{CIL|6|1779}}).</ref> Aurelian also built a new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|temple for Sol]], which was dedicated on December 25, 274,<ref name=\"auto\" /> and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.<ref>The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere.{{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 5}}</ref> He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.\n\nThe identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the ''[[Augustan History]]'', some scholars have argued that it was based on [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagablus]] (or Elagabla) of [[Emesa]]. Others, basing their argument on [[Zosimus]], suggest that it was based on the [[Shamash|\u0160ams]], the solar god of [[Palmyra]] on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|last=Dirven|first=Lucinda|title=The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004115897|page=169|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141034/https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|archivedate=2015-12-08}}</ref> Professor Gary Forsythe discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one based on the work of Steven Hijmans.

Every pontifex of Sol was a member of the senatorial elite, indicating that the priesthood of Sol was now highly prestigious. Almost all these senators held other priesthoods as well, however, and some of these other priesthoods take precedence in the inscriptions in which they are listed, suggesting that they were considered more prestigious than the priesthood of Sol.<ref>For a full list of the pontifices of Sol see J.&nbsp;Rupke (ed.), ''Fasti Sacerdotum'' (2005), p. 606. [[Memmius Vitrasius Orfitus]] lists his priesthoods as pontifex of [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]], one of the [[quindecimviri sacris faciundis]], and pontifex of Sol, in that order (''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' vol.&nbsp;6, 1739\u20131742). In a list of eight priesthoods, [[Vettius Agorius Praetextatus]] puts ''Pontifex Solis'' in third place ({{CIL|6|1779}}).</ref> Aurelian also built a new [[Temple of the Sun (Rome)|temple for Sol]], which was dedicated on December 25, 274,<ref name=\"auto\" /> and brought the total number of temples for the god in Rome to (at least) four.<ref>The other three were in the Circus Maximus, on the Quirinal, and in Trastevere.{{harv|Hijmans|2009|loc=chapter 5}}</ref> He also instituted games in honor of the sun god, held every four years from 274 onwards.\n\nThe identity of Aurelian's Sol Invictus has long been a subject of scholarly debate. Based on the ''[[Augustan History]]'', some scholars have argued that it was based on [[Elagabalus (deity)|Sol Elagablus]] (or Elagabla) of [[Emesa]]. Others, basing their argument on [[Zosimus]], suggest that it was based on the [[Shamash|\u0160ams]], the solar god of [[Palmyra]] on the grounds that Aurelian placed and consecrated a cult statue of the sun god looted from Palmyra in the temple of Sol Invictus.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|last=Dirven|first=Lucinda|title=The Palmyrenes of Dura-Europos: A Study of Religious Interaction in Roman Syria|year=1999|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-9004115897|page=169|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208141034/https://books.google.nl/books?id=_LfXg2r6FT0C&pg=PA169|archivedate=2015-12-08}}</ref> Professor Gary Forsythe discusses these arguments and adds a third more recent one based on the work of Steven Hijmans.

To Hijmans this implies the radiate crown of living emperors as a link to Augustus. His successors automatically inherited (or sometimes acquired) the same offices and honours due to Octavian as \"saviour of the Republic\" through his victory at Actium, piously attributed to Apollo-Helios.

Tashlykov was focused on the modification of the structure and properties of [[Solid|solids]] using ion-beam and ion-plasma methods and technologies, including the study of physical and chemical processes occurring during the interaction of accelerated [[Ion|ions]] with [[Elastomer|elastomers]], as well as  the formation of thin film (coating) / substrate systems. Scientific interests: radiation physics of solids; ion-beam modification of the surface properties of [[Metal|metals]], [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]], [[Elastomer|elastomers]]; nuclear physical methods of research of elemental composition; applications of nuclear physical methods for modifying the properties of materials; [[scanning probe microscopy]]; properties and mechanisms of wetting the surface; thin films of electrical contacts and absorbing layers of solar cells and elements of [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Postgraduate studies ===\nTashlykov began his scientific work on the study of radiation defects in bismuth and its alloys in postgraduate course in 1969 under the guidance of Associate Professors Georgy Alexandrovich Humansky and Valery Ivanovich Prokoshin. Since the sources of radiation exposure in Belarus were not available in those years (the linear electron accelerator was used only for medicine in the oncology center) or not applicable ([[Neutron|neutrons]] in the [[RBMK|reactor]] channel were lost at elevated temperature), then with the help of the management of the Belarusian State University an agreement was reached to irradiate samples at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute|Physical Institute of Academy of Sciences (PIAS)]] of the USSR and the Institute for Nuclear Research of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR]]. Experiments on electron irradiation of bismuth alloys were carried out on a [[microtron]] in the laboratory of Academician [[Pavel Cherenkov|P.A. Cherenkov]] (PIAS USSR), and on proton irradiation - in [[Kiev]], on a U-120 [[cyclotron]] in the laboratory of the director of the Institute of Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine M.V. Pasechnik (Institute for Nuclear Research, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR). As a result of successful work Tashlykov was recommended for a one-year internship at the Department of Ionometry of [[University of Jena|Jena University named after F. Schiller]] ([[East Germany|GDR]], 1971-1972). The latter largely determined his scientific interests. New methods for studying structure and composition were mastered: protonography and ionometry, later called [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|spectroscopy of Rutherford backscattering (RBS)]] ions in combination with their [[Channelling (physics)|channeling]]. At the general seminar in Moscow under the guidance of Professor [[Oleg Firsov|O. B. Firsov]] it was noted that Tashlykov was the first among Soviet scientists who held the years experiments in 1971-1972 using ion channeling for layer-by-layer analysis of radiation damages in [[Single crystal|single crystals]].\n\nThe obtained results were the basis for development, together with the scientist from the [[Moscow State University|Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University]], M.A. Kumakhov, of the original method of calculating the concentration of radiation defects in irradiated single crystals, using the method of ionometry, taking into account the multiple scattering of channeled helium ions. This work was discussed at seminars at the PIAS and the Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of Moscow State University and was published in the articles in the journal \u201cReports of the USSR Academy of Sciences, 217 (1974) 1277-1280\u201d on the recommendation of Academician P.A. Cherenkov and the journal \u201cReports of the Academy of Sciences of the BSSR, XVII (1973) 797-800\u201d on the recommendation of Academician of AS BSSR A.N. Sevchenko.

Research of the coatings based on metals (Ti, Cr, Mo, W, etc.) on silicon, graphite, steel, aluminum and its alloys, elastomers, with simultaneous irradiation of [[Ion|ions]] of the same [[Metal|metals]] was carried out with controlling the [[energy density]] released in the cascade of atomic collisions. Mechanisms of damage and interpenetration of components in the area of coating / substrate phase separation induced by [[radiation]] was established, strength, corrosion, adhesion, friction characteristics of materials modified by coating were studied. [[Patent|Patents]] of the Russian Federation (1994, 1995) and the Republic of Belarus (1996, 1998) have been received. Using the patented method, in frames of SSTP \"New materials and surface protection\" he introduced the new technology at the enterprises of the Republic of Belarus ([[:ru:\u0411\u0430\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439_\u0430\u0432\u0442\u043e\u0430\u0433\u0440\u0435\u0433\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439_\u0437\u0430\u0432\u043e\u0434|Baranovichi Automobile Aggregate Plant]], OJSC Belarusrezinotechnika, [[Babruysk]]), which resulted in creation of corrosion-resistant, inertial to the [[elastomer]] [[adhesion]] mold surface for manufacturing of rubber products.

The identification of a number of mechanisms of mass transfer in thin metal film / silicon substrate systems, formed by physical vacuum deposition under conditions of hyper-high-speed crystallization, has been performed. The mechanisms of diffusion and mass transfer in the film / substrate structure were established depending on the energy density released in cascades of atomic collisions and the integral flux of xenon ions irradiating the substrate. Under his leadership, a phenomenological model of the surface wettability of nanosized films with distilled water has been developed as an effective method for studying the characteristics of surfaces and the processes occurring on them.\n\n== Main scientific results ==\nHe was the first Soviet scientist who used the [[Channelling (physics)|channeling effect]] to study [[Crystallographic defect|radiation defects]] in ion-implanted crystals. Based on the solution of the analytical equation, he developed a method for constructing profiles of radiation defects in crystals, which takes into account de-channeling of analyzing ions not only on defects, but also on thermal [[Vibration|vibrations]] of atoms and their electrons.\n\n* The fundamentals of the technology of ion-beam synthesis of layers of solid solutions based on single- and multi-component systems of materials of solid-state electronics: silicon, silicon carbide (SiC), and ternary compounds based on gallium arsenide (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As, GaAs<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>) have been developed.\n\n* Mechanisms of defect formation (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and structural-phase rearrangements in semiconductor crystals during ion implantation have been established.\n\n* The following criteria were experimentally determined: the density of the released energy in cascades of atomic collisions, the ion current density, the ion energy values, the temperature implantation and annealing modes affecting the concentration, depth distribution, type of radiation defects in the near-surface layers of ion implanted semiconductors.\n\n* The developed regulations for ion-beam synthesis and doping of semiconductor crystals have been introduced at the enterprises of the Ministry of Electronics (1987, PO box A-1067, A-1561) and radio industry of the USSR (1988, PO box B-8574) with an economic effect from above 640 thousand soviet rubles.\n\n* The only complex in Belarus of nuclear physical methods for studying of solids was created with F.F. Komarov in the Research Institute of the APP BSU.\n\n* The scientific and technical materials \"Application of ion beams for the analysis of solids\" have been developed and implemented at the enterprises of the Ministry of Medium Engineering (1986, Institute of Atomic Energy named after I. Kurchatov, PO box P-6710) with an economic effect of over 40 thousand soviet rubles.\n\n* The complex of studies on ion-beam modification of electrode materials (Ni, Ti, graphite) used for the electrolysis of alkaline, acidic and other solutions was carried out according to the task of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The regulations for the creation by implantation of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions in Ni of catalytically active and corrosion-resistant anodes for water-alkaline electrolysis of water were developed and handed over to the Ministry of\u00a0 Chemical Industry and the USSR Academy of Sciences organizations, the application of which provided a 10% reduction in electricity costs per unit of output. The economic effect was 180 thousand rubles.\n\n* Fundamental results have been obtained on the mechanisms and dynamics of radiation defect formation in metal crystals during ion implantation, and a model for oxidizing the anode surface in aqueous alkaline electrolysis has been constructed.\n\n* A theory of ion-assisted protective coatings of rubber has been developed, which takes into account the capture of auxiliary gas atoms, surface spraying, the density of ionized and deposited neutral fractions generated by the ion source.\n\n* The \"Method of deposition of coatings\" has been experimentally proved and patented. Using this method, the new technology of ion-assisted deposition of coatings has been developed and introduced at the enterprises of Belarus (Baranovichi Automobile Units Plant, Belavtomaz Production Association (2001), JSC Belorussian Rubber Plant (2000) assisted coating application in self-irradiation conditions on cuffs for use in the rear axle assemblies of GAZ-3102, GAZ-3110 cars and MAZ car dampers. The economic effect in 2000 amounted to 1,015,000 thousand belarusian rubles.\n\n* Technological regimes for the formation of superhard nanosized films on silicon substrates for functional elements of nano- and microelectronics have been developed. The studied radiation-controlled processes of mass transfer during the deposition of thin films allow controlling adhesion at the atomic level, as well as modifying the surface properties of the absorbing layers and back contacts for solar cells.\n\n* A vacuum method for the production of chalcogenide semiconductors Pb<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub> (S, Te) has been developed, and regularities have been established for the variation of their electro-physical and optical properties and structural characteristics, depending on the composition and processing conditions of production, the practical applications of these materials in the field of optoelectronics as thin-film solar cells and photo converters, have been determined.\n\n== Pedagogical activity ==\n\nTashlykov paid much attention to the training of scientific and pedagogical specialists, forming their interest in [[science]] from the student years.

Since 1952 he had lived in [[Babruysk]]. He moved to [[Minsk]] with his parents in 1962. He finished secondary school No. 27 in Minsk in 1964 with a silver medal and entered the [[Belarusian State University|Physics Faculty of Belarusian State University (BSU)]]. Since that time his life had been connected with the [[Belarusian State University|BSU]] for 25 years. In 1969, he graduated with honors from the Physics Faculty with a specialization in [[Solid-state physics|solid state physics]] and entered full-time postgraduate study at the [http://www.physics.bsu.by/ru/departments/solid-state-physics/main-page Department of Solid State Physics].

From 1972 to 1989 he was Senior Researcher of the [http://niipfp.bsu.by/index.php/laboratoriya-elioniki Laboratory of Elionics of the Research Institute of APP of BSU]. In 1973, he was awarded the scientific degree of [[Candidate of Sciences|Candidate of Physical and Mathematical Sciences]] on the results of his thesis defense on the topic \"Investigation of radiation effects in [[bismuth]] and its alloys\" at the BSU (September 25, 1973). In 1976, he was awarded the title of Senior Research Fellow with speciality \"Solid State Physics\". Doctoral thesis in physics and mathematics on the subject \"Modification and study of structure in [[Crystal|crystals]] with different types of bonds ([[Silicon|Si]], [[Gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[Nickel|Ni]]) by nuclear physical methods\" was defended in the [[National University of Kharkiv|Kharkov State University]] on March 17, 1989.  \n\nAfter defending his doctoral thesis in 1989, he was invited to work as a professor at the Department of Physics at the [[Belarusian State Technological University|Belarusian Institute of Technology]], later renamed into the Belarusian Technological University, where he had been working for 14 years, till 2003. He was awarded the academic title of Professor in the Department of Physics in 1992. \n\nIn 2003, at the invitation of the [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the [[Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University|Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University named (BSPU)]], Kukharchik Petr Dmitrievich, he went to work as the Dean of the Physical Faculty at the [[Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University|BSPU]].

Tashlykov was focused on the modification of the structure and properties of [[Solid|solids]] using ion-beam and ion-plasma methods and technologies, including the study of physical and chemical processes occurring during the interaction of accelerated [[Ion|ions]] with [[Elastomer|elastomers]], as well as  the formation of thin film (coating) / substrate systems. Scientific interests: radiation physics of solids; ion-beam modification of the surface properties of [[Metal|metals]], [[Semiconductor|semiconductors]], [[Elastomer|elastomers]]; nuclear physical methods of research of elemental composition; applications of nuclear physical methods for modifying the properties of materials; [[scanning probe microscopy]]; properties and mechanisms of wetting the surface; thin films of electrical contacts and absorbing layers of solar cells and elements of [[optoelectronics]].\n\n=== Postgraduate studies ===\nTashlykov began his scientific work on the study of radiation defects in bismuth and its alloys in postgraduate course in 1969 under the guidance of Associate Professors Georgy Alexandrovich Humansky and Valery Ivanovich Prokoshin. Since the sources of radiation exposure in Belarus were not available in those years (the linear electron accelerator was used only for medicine in the oncology center) or not applicable ([[Neutron|neutrons]] in the [[RBMK|reactor]] channel were lost at elevated temperature), then with the help of the management of the Belarusian State University an agreement was reached to irradiate samples at the [[Lebedev Physical Institute|Physical Institute of Academy of Sciences (PIAS)]] of the USSR and the Institute for Nuclear Research of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR]]. Experiments on electron irradiation of bismuth alloys were carried out on a [[microtron]] in the laboratory of Academician [[Pavel Cherenkov|P.A. Cherenkov]] (PIAS USSR), and on proton irradiation - in [[Kiev]], on a U-120 [[cyclotron]] in the laboratory of the director of the Institute of Academician of the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine M.V. Pasechnik (Institute for Nuclear Research, Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR). As a result of successful work Tashlykov was recommended for a one-year internship at the Department of Ionometry of [[University of Jena|Jena University named after F. Schiller]] ([[East Germany|GDR]], 1971-1972). The latter largely determined his scientific interests. New methods for studying structure and composition were mastered: protonography and ionometry, later called [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry|spectroscopy of Rutherford backscattering (RBS)]] ions in combination with their [[Channelling (physics)|channeling]]. At the general seminar in Moscow under the guidance of Professor [[Oleg Firsov|O. B.

The identification of a number of mechanisms of mass transfer in thin metal film / silicon substrate systems, formed by physical vacuum deposition under conditions of hyper-high-speed crystallization, has been performed. The mechanisms of diffusion and mass transfer in the film / substrate structure were established depending on the energy density released in cascades of atomic collisions and the integral flux of xenon ions irradiating the substrate. Under his leadership, a phenomenological model of the surface wettability of nanosized films with distilled water has been developed as an effective method for studying the characteristics of surfaces and the processes occurring on them.\n\n== Main scientific results ==\nHe was the first Soviet scientist who used the [[Channelling (physics)|channeling effect]] to study [[Crystallographic defect|radiation defects]] in ion-implanted crystals. Based on the solution of the analytical equation, he developed a method for constructing profiles of radiation defects in crystals, which takes into account de-channeling of analyzing ions not only on defects, but also on thermal [[Vibration|vibrations]] of atoms and their electrons.\n\n* The fundamentals of the technology of ion-beam synthesis of layers of solid solutions based on single- and multi-component systems of materials of solid-state electronics: silicon, silicon carbide (SiC), and ternary compounds based on gallium arsenide (Al<sub>x</sub>Ga<sub>1-x</sub>As, GaAs<sub>1-x</sub>P<sub>x</sub>) have been developed.\n\n* Mechanisms of defect formation (homogeneous, heterogeneous) and structural-phase rearrangements in semiconductor crystals during ion implantation have been established.\n\n* The following criteria were experimentally determined: the density of the released energy in cascades of atomic collisions, the ion current density, the ion energy values, the temperature implantation and annealing modes affecting the concentration, depth distribution, type of radiation defects in the near-surface layers of ion implanted semiconductors.\n\n* The developed regulations for ion-beam synthesis and doping of semiconductor crystals have been introduced at the enterprises of the Ministry of Electronics (1987, PO box A-1067, A-1561) and radio industry of the USSR (1988, PO box B-8574) with an economic effect from above 640 thousand soviet rubles.\n\n* The only complex in Belarus of nuclear physical methods for studying of solids was created with F.F. Komarov in the Research Institute of the APP BSU.\n\n* The scientific and technical materials \"Application of ion beams for the analysis of solids\" have been developed and implemented at the enterprises of the Ministry of Medium Engineering (1986, Institute of Atomic Energy named after I. Kurchatov, PO box P-6710) with an economic effect of over 40 thousand soviet rubles.\n\n* The complex of studies on ion-beam modification of electrode materials (Ni, Ti, graphite) used for the electrolysis of alkaline, acidic and other solutions was carried out according to the task of the State Committee for Science and Technology of the Council of Ministers of the USSR. The regulations for the creation by implantation of Ag<sup>+</sup> ions in Ni of catalytically active and corrosion-resistant anodes for water-alkaline electrolysis of water were developed and handed over to the Ministry of\u00a0 Chemical Industry and the USSR Academy of Sciences organizations, the application of which provided a 10% reduction in electricity costs per unit of output. The economic effect was 180 thousand rubles.\n\n* Fundamental results have been obtained on the mechanisms and dynamics of radiation defect formation in metal crystals during ion implantation, and a model for oxidizing the anode surface in aqueous alkaline electrolysis has been constructed.\n\n* A theory of ion-assisted protective coatings of rubber has been developed, which takes into account the capture of auxiliary gas atoms, surface spraying, the density of ionized and deposited neutral fractions generated by the ion source.\n\n* The \"Method of deposition of coatings\" has been experimentally proved and patented. Using this method, the new technology of ion-assisted deposition of coatings has been developed and introduced at the enterprises of Belarus (Baranovichi Automobile Units Plant, Belavtomaz Production Association (2001), JSC Belorussian Rubber Plant (2000) assisted coating application in self-irradiation conditions on cuffs for use in the rear axle assemblies of GAZ-3102, GAZ-3110 cars and MAZ car dampers. The economic effect in 2000 amounted to 1,015,000 thousand belarusian rubles.\n\n* Technological regimes for the formation of superhard nanosized films on silicon substrates for functional elements of nano- and microelectronics have been developed. The studied radiation-controlled processes of mass transfer during the deposition of thin films allow controlling adhesion at the atomic level, as well as modifying the surface properties of the absorbing layers and back contacts for solar cells.\n\n* A vacuum method for the production of chalcogenide semiconductors Pb<sub>1-x</sub>Sn<sub>x</sub> (S, Te) has been developed, and regularities have been established for the variation of their electro-physical and optical properties and structural characteristics, depending on the composition and processing conditions of production, the practical applications of these materials in the field of optoelectronics as thin-film solar cells and photo converters, have been determined.\n\n== Pedagogical activity ==\n\nTashlykov paid much attention to the training of scientific and pedagogical specialists, forming their interest in [[science]] from the student years. The [[monograph]] \"Non-destructive Analysis of Solids Surfaces by Ion Beams\", published in the \u201cUniversitetskoye\u201d publishing house, is used as a textbook for reading special courses at the [https://www.bsu.by/ru/main.aspx?guid=5491 Departments of Semiconductor Physics] and [http://www.physics.bsu.by/ru/departments/solid-state-physics/main-page Solid State Physics] at the BSU. The developed method of resonance nuclear reactions for layer analysis of light impurities was used in a laboratory workshop on the \"Backscattering method and nuclear reactions in elemental analysis of substance\" for the training of students at the [[National University of Kharkiv|Kharkiv State University]], as well as in similar works at the D.V. Scobeltsyn Research Institute of Nuclear Physics of [[Moscow State University]], at the Research Institute of Physics of [[Southern Federal University|Rostov State University]]. A student research laboratory \"PHYSMATING\" fruitfully worked under his scientific guidance at the Physics and Mathematics Faculty of the [[Maxim Tank Belarusian State Pedagogical University|BSPU named after M. Tank]]. Five candidates of sciences have been trained. Igor S. Tashlykov supervised the Problem Council on physical sciences at the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, was chairman of the Council for the Defense of Doctoral dissertations D 02.21.01 at the BSPU (since 2011), a member of the Council for the Defense of Doctoral dissertations D 02.01.10 at the BSU. \n\n== Membership in scientific and public organizations ==\n\nIn the 1980s, he was a member of two coordination groups of the Councils of the USSR Academy of Sciences on direct-action accelerators and on methods of rapid nuclear analysis. Member of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] (since 1994).

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localised quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!-- ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020 --> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

While the stories told in each book are generally comparable, important differences sometimes emerge. The versions written in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament|Christian New Testament]] predate the Quran's versions. As such, Christians regard the Quran's versions as being derived directly or indirectly from the earlier materials. Muslims understand the Quran's versions to be witness accounts from an omnipotent God. As such, Muslims generally hold that the earlier versions are distorted through flawed processes of transmission and interpretation, and understand the Quran's versions to be more accurate to the actual events.\n\nOften, stories related in the Quran tend to concentrate on the moral or spiritual significance of events rather than the details.<ref>e.g. Gerald Hawting, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/john-wansbrough-remembered/3512288 interviewed] for ''The Religion Report'', [[Radio National]] (Australia), 26 June 2002.</ref> Biblical stories come from diverse sources and authors, so their attention to detail varies individually.\n\n==Torah narratives==\n{{More citations needed|comparison on the name/kind of tree between Qur'an & Bible|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Adam and Eve (\u0622\u062f\u0645 Adam and \u062d\u0648\u0627\u0621 Hawwaa)===\n{{Main|Adam|Eve|Adam and Eve|Adam in Islam}}\nAccording to one of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]s, God initially created the first human, a man named Adam, from \"the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\"; thereafter God created a woman named Eve from one of Adam's ribs.  God placed them in the paradisiacal [[Garden of Eden]], telling them to eat any food there they wished, except that from a single tree, the \"tree of the knowledge of good and evil\", warning that if they did eat from the tree, they would die.<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|2:17|HE}}</ref> According to the story, a [[Serpent (Bible)|Serpent]] (often believed to be [[Satan]]) tempted them to partake of fruit from the tree, telling them that they would become like God themselves by doing so; both then ate from it. Immediately thereafter, they became ashamed and covered their nakedness with leaves.<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|3:6\u20137|HE}}</ref> God questioned them concerning their actions, reminding them of His command to not eat of the tree.<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|3:9\u201313|HE}}</ref> He next put enmity between the woman and the serpent, and between humans and the 'tempter',<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|3:14\u201315|HE}}</ref> then forced Adam and Eve to leave the garden, following which these two humans then populated the earth.<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|5:4|HE}}</ref>\n\nAccording to the Islamic creation narrative in the Quran, before creating Adam from clay by uttering the simple word \"Be\",<ref name=\"3:59\">{{cite quran|3|59}}</ref> God informed the [[Angels]] of His divine plan to \"create a vicegerent on earth\".

Shaitaan subsequently swore to mislead mankind from the \"straight path of God\",<ref>{{cite quran|7|16}}</ref> and God responded to his arrogance and disobedience by expelling him from Heaven.\n\nIslam believes that God thoroughly forgave Adam and Eve their transgression when they begged His mercy; while in the biblical story death is a punishment for transgressing God's command and death remains on Adam, Eve and their descendants.<ref>Lawrence E. Brown, M.D.,[http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/1776/ Original Sin].</ref>\n\nAmong the many significant differences between the stories are:\n*In the Bible, God tells the man to name the animals.<ref>Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|2:19|HE}}</ref> In the Quran, God teaches Adam the names \"of all things\" and Adam repeats them.<ref name=\"cite quran|2|130\">{{cite quran|2|130}}</ref>\n*In the second of the Bible's creation stories, the woman is created from the rib of the man.

According to the Quran, no such curse was issued.

Each made sacrifices to God, but God only accepted Abel's sacrifice and offering, and not Cain's because Abel gave the '''''best''''' of his flocks, indicating that God came first in his heart. Cain, on the other hand, gave a sacrifice from the fruit of his ground, which shows that he was more focused upon only making a sacrifice rather than pleasing the Lord.(Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|4:1-7|HE}}; see Al-Ma'ida {{cite quran|5|30|end=32|style=nosup|expand=yes}}).  Although God attempted to remonstrate with Cain about his attitude, Cain refused to listen and ultimately murdered his brother, Abel (see Al-Ma'ida {{cite quran|5|30|style=nosup|expand=yes}}; Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|4:8|HE}}). Cain was subsequently called to account by God, who condemned him to a lifetime of wandering and fruitless toil, while promising to take vengeance upon any who tried to avenge his brother's blood upon him.  Abel, on the other hand, was regarded by the Bible as righteous.\n\nThe Quran relates a slightly different version; as in the Bible, both offered sacrifice and Cain's was rejected; Cain threatens Abel, who points out that killing him would put Cain ''among the companions of the fire''; Cain murders Abel, but regrets it. The Quran then draws a lesson: ''Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely'\n\nCompare the last part with the '''Talmud Yerushalmi''' (Mishnayot), Mishnah Sanhedrin Tractate 4:5, and Folia 23a, and in the '''Talmud Bavli''' Folia 37a.\n\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05db\u05da \u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d3\u05da \u05e9\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea [\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc] \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05de\u05dc\u05d0'' \u05d5\u05db\u05dc'\u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd''\n\n''Therefore, humans were created singly, to teach you that whoever destroys a single soul [of Israel], Scripture accounts it as if he had destroyed a full world; and whoever saves one soul of Israel, Scripture accounts it as if she had saved a full world.''

God decided to kill all the people through a vast flood while saving the righteous Noah and his immediate family; so he commanded Noah to build an Ark, using God's own instructions. (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|6:9\u201316|HE}}; Hud {{cite quran|11|39|style=nosup|expand=no}}) Noah did so and he, his family, seven pairs of birds and \"clean\" (hoofed) animals, and two of each other animal species (a female and a male) board the Ark (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|6:19|HE}}; Hud {{cite quran|11|42|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Water gushes up from the ground and rains fall from the sky, flooding the earth and killing all the wicked. (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|7:11\u201312|HE}}; Al-Qamar {{cite quran|54|11|end=13|style=nosup|expand=no}}). All aboard the Ark are safe until the waters retreat (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:14|HE}} ; Hud {{cite quran|11|44|style=nosup|expand=no}}).  There is disagreement among Jews, Christians, and Muslims concerning whether the flood was local or global.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThere are several differences between the biblical and Quranic versions of the story of Noah:\n\n*The Quran focuses on a dialogue between Noah and the wicked (Hud {{cite quran|11|32|end=37|style=nosup|expand=no}}), in which Noah unsuccessfully attempts to remonstrate with his countrymen, who reject his message.  Genesis does not mention such a dialogue. (In the Christian Bible, 2 Peter 2:5, Noah is called a \"preacher of righteousness\".) \n*In the Quran, Noah's wife and one of his sons reject him (Hud {{cite quran|11|43|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and die in the flood, while some people outside his family are faithful and join him (Hud {{cite quran|11|42|style=nosup|expand=no}}). In the biblical narrative, Noah's wife together with his three sons and their wives all board the Ark, but no others.\n*In the Quran, there is no such indication that the flood was universal, although many Islamic scholars claim to interpret otherwise. \n*In the Quran, the Ark is said to rest on the hills of [[Mount Judi]] (Hud {{cite quran|11|44|style=nosup|expand=no}}); in the Bible, it is said to rest on the [[mountains of Ararat]] (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:4|HE}}) The Al-Djoudi (Judi) is apparently a mountain in the biblical mountain range of Ararat. The Quran cites a particular mount in the Ararat Range, whereas the Bible just mentions the Ararat Range by name. There is a Mount Al-Djoudi in the present-day Ararat mountain range in Turkey.\n\n===Abraham (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645)===\n\n{{Main|Abraham in Islam|Abraham}}\n\n====Promised a son====\n{{Main|Isaac in Islam }}\n \nSee [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||gen|18:1\u201315|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||gen|22:1\u201320|HE}} and [[Hud (sura)|Hud]] {{cite quran|11|69|end=74|style=nosup|expand=n}}, [[Al-Hijr]] {{cite quran|15|51|end=56|style=nosup|expand=no}}, [[As-Saaffat]] {{cite quran|37|102|end=109|style=nosup|expand=no}}, and [[Adh-Dhariyat]] {{cite quran|51|24|end=30|style=nosup|expand=no}}. Several messengers come to Abraham on their way to destroy the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham welcomes them into his tent and provides them with food. They then promise their host that [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]] (\u02beIs\u1e25\u0101q \u0625\u0633\u062d\u0670\u0642) will soon be born to Abraham's wife, Sarah (S\u0101rah \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0629). Sarah laughs at the idea because she is far too old to bear children. The Hebrew name \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 means 'he laughs\" and is one of the literary tropes in the biblical story. These literary connections are typically lost in Quranic versions of biblical stories.\n\n:Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||gen|18:12|HE}} \"After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\"\n\n:Hud {{cite quran|11|72|t=y|tn=y|style=nosup|expand=no|quote=She said: \"Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!\"}}\n\nThe angels rebuke her, telling her that by God's will she can bear a son. A conversation ensues in which Abraham admits that he wished God to have mercy on the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n====Sacrifices his son====\n{{Main|Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael}}\nIn another narrative, Abraham receives a command (in his dream) from God to sacrifice his son. Abraham agrees to this and prepares to carry out the sacrifice. Before he can do so, however, God tells him to stop and gives him a replacement sacrifice. Abraham is subsequently honoured for his faithfulness to God. (As-Saaffat {{cite quran|37|102|end=108|style=nosup|expand=no}}; Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||gen|22:2\u201318|HE}})\n\nHowever, there are several differences between the biblical and Quranic accounts:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n*In Genesis, the sacrificial son is Isaac, whereas in the Quran name of the son is not mentioned explicitly, however many Muslims assume it is Ishmael (As-Saaffat {{cite quran|37|102|end=112|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Therefore, Muslims assumes the sacrificial son was Ishmael (Ism\u0101'\u012bl \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644) and that this event happened prior to Isaac's birth. It may be added that the name Abraham is a literary trope in Genesis Ab- \"father-of(-many-nations)\" while the Arabic name masks the connection. In the New Testament, the son is Isaac (James 2:21).\n*While God seems to speak directly to Abraham in Genesis, He speaks through a vision in the Quran.\n*In the Quran, Abraham directly tells his son (Again name is not mentioned in the text however assumed to be [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] (Ism\u0101'\u012bl \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644)) that he intends to sacrifice him. In Genesis, Abraham tells Isaac, that \"God will provide the sacrifice.\"\n\n===Abraham's Journeys in the Bible and Quran===\n\n{{expand section|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Bible describes Abraham as in Iraq-Syria, then in Canaan, Paran, and Egypt, with his final days in Canaan and Hebron. Both Isaac and Ishmael attend Abraham's funeral.\n\nThe Quran mentions that Abraham left his wife and Ishmael (as an infant) in the land where present-day Mecca is, while he left to what was apparently Palestine.\n\n===Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah (L\u016b\u1e6d \u0644\u0648\u0637 and \"The People of Lot\")===\n{{Main|Lot (Bible)|Lot in Islam|Sodom and Gomorrah}}\n\nAccording to the Bible in the [[Book of Genesis]], after visiting Abraham, two angels go to the city of Sodom in which Abraham's nephew Lot is a foreigner. They tell him God will soon destroy the city because of the wickedness of the people. The men of the city, upon hearing that Lot is entertaining male visitors, converge upon his house and demand that the men be brought out so that they can have sex with them.  Lot offers his daughters in their place, but the men insist upon raping the angels instead.  After blinding the city's inhabitants, the angels tell Lot and his family to flee by night and to not look back.  The following morning, God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with a shower of fiery stones from the sky.  Lot's wife looked back to see the burning city and was turned into a pillar of salt.<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:5\u201326|HE}}</ref>\n\nThe story continues further after the destruction of the twin cities, with Lot leaving Zoar (where he had fled for refuge) with his two daughters to live in a cave.<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:30|HE}}</ref> Fearing that all the men were dead, the daughters decided that in order to 'preserve the [[Kinship|seed of their father]]' and [[procreate]], they must have [[sexual intercourse]] with him;<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:31|HE}}</ref> they decide to get him into a [[Drunk|drunken stupor]] so as to be able to 'lie with him' and obtain his [[semen|seed]].<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:32|HE}}</ref>  And so they each sleep with their father (one each on successive nights), having intoxicated him to a point wherein he could 'perceive not',<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:33-35|HE}}</ref> and thus get [[impregnated]] by him. The Bible then continues \"And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the [[Moab]]ites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of [[Ammon]] unto this day\".<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:37-38|HE}}</ref> The biblical story of Lot ends here.\n\nAccording to the Quran, Lot (or Lut, as he is called in the Quran) was a [[Prophets in Islam|Prophet]]. He was also a nephew of Prophet [[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]] ([[Abraham]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} A group of [[Angels]] visited Ibrahim as guests<ref>{{cite quran|15|51}}</ref> and gave him glad tidings of a son \"endowed with wisdom\";<ref>{{cite quran|11|69}}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|15|53}}</ref> they told him that they had been sent by God to the \"guilty people\"<ref>{{cite quran|15|58}}</ref> of Sodom,<ref>{{cite quran|11|70}}</ref> to destroy them<ref>{{cite quran|29|31}}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|29|34}}</ref> with \"a shower of stones of clay ([[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]])\"<ref>{{cite quran|51|33|34}}</ref> and deliver Lot and those who believed in him.

The story of Lot in the Quran ends after describing the destruction of the city.\n\nThere are several differences between the Quran and the Bible:\n\n*In the Quran, Lot is described as a prophet, like his uncle Abraham. In Genesis ({{bibleverse|Genesis|19:1\u201329|HE}}), Lot is not described as a prophet. In the New Testament, ({{bibleverse|2 Peter|2:7,8|KJV}}) [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] describes Lot as a righteous man who was daily tormented by the lawless deeds he saw in Sodom.\n*In both the Bible and in the Quran, Abraham pleads for God to have mercy (Quran{{cite quran|11|75|style=nosup|expand=no}}; Gen. 18:24\u201333). In Genesis, God agrees to spare Sodom if just ten righteous men can be found here (but they are not found).  In the Quran, God commands Abraham not to ask for mercy on them. {{cite quran|11|76|style=nosup|expand=no}}\n*In Genesis, Lot's wife leaves with Lot but turns around briefly and God turns her into a pillar of salt ({{bibleverse|Genesis|19:26|HE}}). In the Quran, there is no mention of her leaving; rather Lot and his followers were commanded by the angels not to turn, but Lot is informed that his wife will turn and look behind (Quran Hud 11:123), and thus be destroyed with the rest of the two cities. {{cite quran|11|81|style=nosup|expand=no}}\n*Following the destruction of Sodom, the Bible describes an [[incest]]ous event between Lot and his two daughters, at his daughters' behest, in {{bibleverse|Genesis|19:30-38|HE}}. The Quran does not describe any such event, and Muslims reject any such occurrence .{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n(See Also: Bible: {{bibleverse|Genesis|19:1\u201326|HE}}. Quran: Surah [[Al-Hijr]] 57\u201377, Surah [[Hud (sura)|Hud]] 74\u201383, Surah [[Al-A'raf]] 80\u201384, Surah [[Ash-Shu'ara]] 160\u2013174, Surah [[An-Naml]] 54\u201358, Surah [[Al-Ankabut]] 28\u201335, Surah [[As-Saaffat]] 133\u2013138, Surah [[Adh-Dhariyat]] 31\u201337, and Surah [[Al-Qamar]] 36\u201339.)\n\n===Joseph (Y\u016bsuf \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641)===\nThe narratives of Joseph can be found in {{bibleverse|Genesis|37\u201345|KJV}} and in the first 102 verses of Surah [[Yusuf (surah)|Yusuf (Joseph)]] ([https://quran.com/12/1-102 Quran 12:1-102])\n\nIn both the Bible and the Quran, Joseph has a vision of eleven stars and the sun and the moon all bowing to him which he shares with his family.\n\n({{bibleverse|Genesis|37:9|HE}}) And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, \"Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\"\n\n(Yusuf|12.4) Behold! Joseph said to his father: \"O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!\"\n\nJoseph's brothers became jealous that their father preferred Joseph over them, and so they form a plot to kill Joseph. However, one brother convinces them not to kill him but throw him down a well while they are alone. The brothers come to the father asking his permission to take Joseph out with them to enjoy and play with them. Jacob expresses his reservations against letting him go with them and expressing fear about a wild animal killing him while they were not careful about him. The sons assure the father of their being a mighty group against any threats to Joseph. The father eventually agrees to send Yusuf with them (in the Quran), while in the Bible, Jacob sends Joseph out of his own accord without sons trying to persuade him to let him go with them. (Yusuf|12.8\u201310; {{bibleverse|Genesis|37:20\u201322|HE}}) They agree. They subsequently lie to their father as to Joseph's whereabouts, covering his clothing in blood and asserting that a wild animal had attacked him. A caravan passing the well inspires the brothers to pull Joseph out of the well and to sell him as a slave to traders in the caravan. Later the traders sell him to a wealthy Egyptian. ({{bibleverse|Genesis|37:27\u201336|HE}}; Yusuf|12.20\u201322)\n\nJoseph grows up in the house of the Egyptian. When Joseph is a grown man, his master's wife tries to seduce him. Joseph resists and runs away, but is caught by other servants and reported to his master. The wife lies to her husband, saying that Joseph tried to rape her. (Yusuf|12.25; {{bibleverse|Genesis|39:12|HE}}); At this point, the two stories differ.\n\nIn the Bible, Joseph's master (named as Potiphar) refuses to believe Joseph's denial and imprisons him.\nIn the Quran, Joseph's master (who is only identified as \"the Vizier\") accepts the suggestion of another wise person to check Joseph's tunic. If it is torn from the front, the wise person asserts, it will prove Joseph a liar; but if it is torn from the back (as proves to be the case), Joseph will be vindicated and the master's wife proven a liar and an adulteress. The Vizier reprimands his wife and permits Joseph to remain in his household. The Vizier's wife hosts a banquet for women who had been gossiping about her and Joseph providing them with knives; Joseph is commanded to appear before the wife and her ladyfriends; they cut their hands with knives. (The bible does not mention the banquet), a \"post-Biblical Jewish tradition\" describes Potiphar serving fruit to the gossips who cut themselves inadvertently, distracted by Joseph's good looks.)<ref name=\"Cook-1983-78\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Michael |title=Muhammad |date=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192876058 |pages=78}}</ref> Although the Vizier again recognizes Joseph's innocence, he orders him imprisoned nevertheless.\nIn prison, Joseph meets two men. One has a dream of making wine and the other dreams of carrying a stack of bread that birds are eating. Joseph tells the first that he will serve the Pharaoh again and the second will be executed. Both things happen, precisely as Joseph foretold. Although Joseph asks the first man to bring his name and unjust imprisonment to the attention of the Pharaoh, (referred to in the Quran as only the King, not a Pharaoh) the first man quickly forgets about him once restored to the royal favour.\n\nSometime thereafter, Pharaoh had a dream:\n\n({{bibleverse|Genesis|41:17\u201324|HE}}) \"17. Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 18.when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 19. After them, seven other cows came up \u2013 scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the Land of Egypt. 20. The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 21. But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.\" 22.\" In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. 23. After them, seven other heads sprouted \u2013 withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. 24. The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.\"\n\n(Quran: Yusuf|12.43) The king (of Egypt) said: \"I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions.\"\n\nPharaoh's cupbearer, who had been previously imprisoned with Joseph, suddenly remembers his promise and tells Pharaoh about the man who foretold his own restoration to favour. Pharaoh sent to the prison, asking Joseph to interpret his dream.\n\nIn the Quranic account, Joseph insists that the Vizier's wife vindicate him before the king before Joseph will agree to do so (this is not mentioned in the Bible); Pharaoh summons the Vizier's wife, who admits her lies about Joseph and proclaims his innocence. The Quran now rejoins the biblical narrative, where Joseph reveals the meaning of the king's dream: Egypt will have seven years of good crops followed by seven years of famine and the famine will be worse than the abundance. The king rewarded Joseph by giving him charge over the storehouses and the entire land of Egypt.\n\nDuring the famine, Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy food, but the youngest was left with their father. While Joseph recognized them, they did not recognize him. He demanded that they return with the missing brother. The brothers return home and find that Joseph had hidden in their packs more than they paid for. They asked their father if they might return with the youngest brother. Reluctantly, their father allows this. They return, and after some further incidents, Joseph ultimately reveals himself to his brothers. ({{bibleverse|Genesis|45:1|HE}}; Yusuf| 12.90).\n\nIn both the Quran and the Bible, the missing brother is Benjamin, (Arabic: \u0628\u0646 \u064a\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646) Joseph's only full blood brother. The others are half-brothers.\n\nThe Qur'an correctly does not refer to the king of Egypt during Joseph's time as the \"Pharaoh.\" The titular word \"Pharaoh\" was given to the kings of Egypt during the [[New Kingdom]] period later historically. This distinction is not found in the Bible.\n\n===Moses (M\u016bs\u0101 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649)===\n{{Musa|all}}\n{{Main|Moses in Islam|Moses}}\n\nIn the Bible, the narratives of Moses are in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]. The narratives here are mostly in {{bibleverse|Exodus|1\u201314|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Exodus|32|KJV}}. In the Quran, the Moses narratives are in the following passages: [[Al-Baqara|2]].49\u201361, [[Al-A'raf|7]].103\u2013160, [[Yunus (sura)|10]].75\u201393, [[Al-Isra|17]].101\u2013104, [[Ta-Ha|20]].9\u201397, [[Ash-Shu'ara|26]].10\u201366, [[An-Naml|27]].7\u201314, [[Al-Qisas|28]].3\u201346, [[Al-Ghafir|40]].23\u201330, [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].46\u201355, [[Ad-Dukhan|44]].17\u201331, and [[An-Naziat|79]].15\u201325.\n\nPharaoh slew the young male children of the Israelites (II:46), and to avoid this fate, [[Jochebed|Moses' mother]] cast Moses as an infant into a small ark, where God protected him. Moses was found by the household of the Pharaoh, who adopted him. Moses' sister, Miriam, had followed Moses, and she recommended that his own mother serves as a nurse to him. When Moses became an adult, he saw an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite, and he interceded and killed the Egyptian. The next day, the Israelite asked whether Moses intended to kill him as well. The Pharaoh tried to have Moses killed and Moses fled to a watering place in [[Midian]]. He met some sisters and watered their herd. When the women's father, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], learned of Moses, he invited him to stay and gave him a daughter, [[Zipporah]], to marry.\n\nIn Midian, Moses saw a fire and approached it. God spoke to him and told him to remove his shoes. God said that he had chosen Moses. God said to throw down his staff and to stretch out his arm as signs. His staff turned into a serpent and then returned to the form of a staff. His arm became white although he was not sick. God commanded him to go to Pharaoh to deliver a message. Moses said that he could not speak well. So God provided Aaron, his brother, to help Moses speak.\n\nGod sent Moses to the court of [[Pharaoh]]. Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses. In response, Moses threw down his staff and it became a serpent. This prompted Pharaoh's magicians also threw down their staffs, which also turned into snakes. But the snakes of Pharaoh's magicians were swallowed by Moses' serpent. \n\nGod caused a famine. God sent plagues of locusts, frogs, blood, and destruction. God sent at least nine signs to Pharaoh, but Pharaoh ignored these signs. When he could ignore them no longer, he agreed to let the Israelites go. However, after God had allowed tranquility, Pharaoh went back on his word and refused to let the Israelites go. As punishment, God made every first-born Egyptian son die and spared every Israelite (the first [[Passover]]). Pharaoh became hysterical and demanded that Moses and the Israelites leave at once- only to pursue them with his army after their exit. Then God helped Moses lead the Israelites into a desert and across a sea. Moses struck the sea with his staff and the sea split in half exposing dry land (while creating a wall of water on each side) for the Israelites to walk through. Pharaoh and his army were catching up to the Israelites but the water returned to its original state. Pharaoh and his army drowned. ({{bibleverse|Exodus|14:7|HE}}, II:47)\n\nMoses left the Hebrews for forty nights. He put his brother Aaron in charge of the people (Al-Baqara|2.48) On a mountain, God gave Moses a revelation of precepts for Israel to follow. God made tablets with writing on them which Moses carried back to Israel.\n\nMoses asked to see God. The people saw the fire and lightning and the mountain and were afraid. While Moses was gone, the Israelites demanded to worship an idol. They used the gold from their ornaments to construct a golden calf whom they said was the god who rescued them from Egypt. Aaron does not stop them. Then Moses returned and chastised them and Aaron. Many were killed for their actions. God sent down manna and quail to eat but the Hebrews still rebelled against God, and complained about the food. Moses asked God for water and God answered him. Moses struck a stone with his staff and water came forth. The Israelites were divided into twelve tribes.\n\nGod gave the Israelites a bountiful land, but this occurred at different times in the two scriptures. Besides that and the many additional details in the [[Torah]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} there are other differences:\n\n*The biblical Moses is reluctant to become a prophet and makes excuses. He eventually agrees and Aaron speaks and performs miracles at first until Moses is ready and takes over. In the Quran, Aaron was made God's messenger on Moses' request to back him up in the difficult task. Moses asked God to give him human support from his family, then asks for Aaron (his brother) praising Aaron by saying that he (Aaron) is a better speaker than him (Moses).\n*The sorcerers, in the Quranic story, repent after seeing Moses' signs and submit to God at the anger of Pharaoh.\n*In the Quran, Pharaoh didn't repent but tried to deceive Moses and God by saying that now he believes in one God, the God of Moses and Aaron (while drowning). But God didn't accept this because he sought repentance at the time of death after seeing the angels.\n*In the Bible, Moses first goes to Pharaoh without showing any signs.\n*In Exodus, Aaron helps make the golden calf. In the Quran,  Aaron himself was a messenger of God and was representing Moses in his absences. He opposed that idea with all his might and warned the Israelites that God will be angry with them. In the Quran, a person named Samiri (not to be confused with Samaritans) leads the Israelites to worship the golden calf.\n*In the Quran, Pharaoh drowned, but God said in the Quran that he preserved the pharaoh's body as an example for generations to come (or made an example for coming generations) ([[Ramesses II]])\n\nSee also [[Aaron]], [[Islamic view of Aaron]], and [[Islamic view of Pharaoh]].\n\n===Destruction of Korah===\n{{Main|Korah}}\n\nThe story of the destruction of [[Korah]] appears in {{bibleverse|Numbers|16:1\u201350|HE}} in the [[Torah]] and in [[Al-Qasas]] 76\u201382 in the Quran. Korah was an Israelite living during the time of Moses. Because of his wickedness, God caused him to die by opening the ground and swallowing him and his home ({{bibleverse|Numbers|16:31\u201333|HE}}; Al-Qasas|28.81). In the Quran, Karon is simply a rich man who is too arrogant. In the Torah, he leads a minor rebellion against Moses. God also kills the others who rebel with him and destroys their homes.\n\n==Later Hebrew Bible narratives==\n\n===Gideon/Talut===\nIn the Quran and the Bible, there are stories about smaller armies winning victory over larger ones. One story in the Quran and the Bible share strong resemblances, although they are placed at different times and attributed to different characters. The Bible story features [[Gideon]] from the [[Book of Judges]] and the Quran story features [[Talut]] (usually translated as [[King Saul|Saul]]).\n\nIn the [[Book of Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb|Judges|6-8|KJV}} of the Bible, Gideon receives commands from God to take the Israelites to war against the Midianites. Gideon is reluctant, but accedes after making God prove Himself with three different tests. As they are heading to fight, God tells Gideon to send away those who are homesick or afraid of dying. Because the army is still large enough to credit its own strength for victory, God tells Gideon to observe the drinking habits of his troops at the river. God says to send those who do not drink with their hands, but lap the water directly like a dog, back to their homes. The remaining Israelites go on to victory.\n\nIn [[Al-Baqarah|2]]:246-248 of the Quran, God chooses Talut (generally considered to be Saul) to lead the Israelites into battle against the army of Goliath. On their way, God tells Talut to warn the men that they will be tested by God, and that they must not drink from the next river in order to pass the test. Despite this warning, most of the men disobey and drink from the river. God tells Talut to leave the disobedient members behind, unless they only drank one handful so that the army will consist of only faithful members. The army then goes on to defeat General Goliath's army.\n\n===Saul, David and Goliath  (T\u0101l\u016bt \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a, D\u0101w\u016bd \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f and \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a Jalut)===\n{{Main|Saul|Islamic view of Saul|Goliath}}\n\nThe story appears in [[Book of Samuel|1 Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|8\u201312|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|17:1\u201358|KJV}}. The Prophet [[Samuel]] is petitioned by the Israelites for a king. God sends Samuel to appoint [[Saul the King|Saul]] as the king, although with the warning that kings only take from their people. At least a few people are not happy with Samuel's choice, but Saul then prophecizes and wins some victories, so the people embrace him. Later Saul falls out of God's favour and God promises to appoint someone else as king. The Philistines attack and are bolstered by the fear engendered by their champion [[Goliath]], a giant. God sends Samuel to recruit [[David]], who kills [[Goliath]]. David eventually goes on to become Israel's new king.\n\nA similar story appears in the Qu'ran [[Al-Baqarah|2]]:246\u2013251. The Israelites demand of their prophet to appoint a king, and so God appoints the man [[Talut]]. The people respond poorly to the selection, upset that Talut does not seem special. God gives the [[Ark of the Covenant]] back to the Israelites in order to verify His choice (this is an event that predates Saul in the Bible). Talut leads the men to battle against an army led by the General Goliath. The Israelite army is small and doubtful, but a few men trust that God can still give them victory. David then kills Goliath and becomes king of Israel. The account also bears similarity to when [[Gideon]] led an army. See the above Gideon/Talut subsection.\n\n===The Queen of Sheba===\n{{Main|Queen of Sheba|Islamic view of the Queen of Sheba}}\n\nThe story appears in {{bibleverse|1 Kings|10:1\u201313|HE}} and {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|9:1\u201313|HE}} and in verses Surah [[An-Naml|27]] 20\u201344. The two stories have almost nothing in common. In each, the Queen of Sheba comes to visit Solomon and is impressed by his wisdom and riches. In the Bible, the visit is only diplomatic. In the Quran, the Queen becomes monotheist and peace is established in the kingdoms. Although not part of the Quran, Islamic tradition holds that the name of the Queen of Sheba is [[Bilqis]] or Balqis.\n\n===Jonah (Yunus \u064a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and the big fish===\n{{Main|Jonah|Islamic view of Jonah}}\nIn both the Bible and the Quran, Jonah is swallowed by a \"big fish\", usually inferred to be a whale. The Book of Jonah in the [[Bible]] consists of four chapters about Jonah's mission to Nineveh. Jonah is referenced three times in the [[Quran]]: in verses 139\u2013148 of Sura 37 (As-Saaffat) (Those who set the ranks), verses 87\u201388 of Sura 21: al-Anbiya' (The Prophets) and verses 48\u201350 of Sura 68: al-Qalam (The Pen)/Nun. It is mentioned in verse 98 of Sura 10: Yunus (Jonah) and verse 86 of Sura 6: al-An'am (The Cattle).\n\nIn the Quran, Jonah gets frustrated by his own people and abandons them to God's mercy, however without asking permission from God and thus going against his given responsibility. In the Quran, it is also mentioned that if Jonah had not prayed inside the belly of the fish he would have stayed in there until the Judgement day. In the Bible, Jonah pays a fare to sail to Tarshish. In both stories, he boards the ship loaded with passengers, lots are cast and Jonah is thrown overboard and swallowed by a large fish ([[Jonah 1:17]], As-Saaffat 37|142). After praying, he is cast out of the fish and washed ashore, and God causes a gourd to grow (37|146) or weeds ({{bibleverse-nb|Jonah|2:5|KJV}}). In the Bible, Jonah continues into Nineveh, and the city is spared by God. In the Quran, God causes the gourd to grow to comfort Jonah after he lies on the shore in a sickly state (As-Saaffat 37|145), in the Bible the gourd plant grows up to provide shade for Jonah while he waits for Nineveh to be destroyed ([[Jonah 4:6]]). According to an Islamic tradition {{Citation needed|reason=name of the author or book|date=September 2008}} however, the big fish gets frightened at first, fearing it might have swallowed a holy person as it heard prayers and supplications read in a wonderful voice from her stomach, hearing which numerous sea creatures had surrounded it. But she comforts herself later since it was God's order to swallow Jonah. After two days the fish casts him out the beach of an island and he is very weak. The gastric juices with the hot sunlight burned his skin till the point he was about to scream of pain. God causes a vine to grow over him and provide him fruit and shade. He recovers and goes back to his people who had become good after he left. According to the Bible, Ninevah was a great city, with more than one hundred twenty thousand people and much livestock ([[Jonah 4:11]]). In the Quran, the number of people he was sent towards as a prophet exceeded a hundred thousand. They believed in his message and God granted them prosperity for a long time. (As-Saaffat 37|147\u2013148). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Ninevites repenting at the preaching of Jonah ({{bibleverse|Matthew|12:41|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|Luke|11:32|KJV}}).\n\n===Haman===\n{{Main|Haman (Bible)|Haman (Islam)}}\n\nIn the Bible, Haman was an Agagite noble and [[vizier]] of the empire under Persian King [[Ahasuerus]] who desires to persecute the Jews. In the Quran, Haman is an adviser and builder under a [[Firaun]] (Pharaoh) of ancient Egypt whose narrative relationship with Moses is recounted in the Quran.\n\nThe structure which Firaun commands Haman to build is similar to the [[Tower of Babel]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], unrelated to the narrative of Haman in the Bible. Both structures are made from burnt bricks for the purpose of ascending to the heavens.\n\nHowever, it's also been suggested that these two are different individuals. The name \"Haman\" was in fact mentioned in old Egyptian tablets which now stand in the Hof Museum, Vienna{{Citation needed|reason=More likely to be Hemen|date=December 2014}} (Walter Wreszinski, \u00c4gyptische Inschriften aus dem K.K. Hof Museum in Wien, 1906, J. C. Hinrichs' sche Buchhandlung).\n\n==New Testament narratives==\n\n===Zechariah and John (Zakariya (\u0632\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627) and Yahya (\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649))===\n{{Main|Zechariah (priest)|Islamic view of Zechariah|John the Baptist|Islamic view of John the Baptist}}\n\nThe story of Zechariah is told in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb|Luke|1:5\u201380|KJV}} and {{bibleverse|Luke|3:1\u201322|KJV}} and in the Quran 19.2\u201315. Zechariah and his wife reached an old age without bearing children. God spoke to Zechariah and told him his wife would conceive, despite her barrenness, and his name would be John. As a sign that this would happen, God struck Zechariah mute until John was born though he communicated using signs. John became a great and righteous prophet and came to confirm God's Word. Both accounts mention John's death.\n\nThe two accounts never directly disagree, but each has unique elements: In the Bible Zechariah is a priest. God speaks to him on [[Yom Kippur]] in the [[Holy of Holies]]. He doubts that God will act and his muteness is a sign and punishment. In the Quran, God promises him a child and he questions how would it come about since he is an old man and his wife long barren. Upon which he is told that for God it is indeed very easy and ''that hasn't God'' created you already while you were naught. In the Quranic narrative Zechariah is also reminded that the sign he should seek for would be a muteness for three nights although without being restrained from speech, implying,<ref>{{cite quran|19|10}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} he simply would not find an occasion to talk to anyone. Zechariah, therefore, is found emerging from his chamber and reminding his people to celebrate the praises of the Lord through an inspirational gesture (Surah Maryam 19|1\u201311). In the Bible, Zechariah confirms that the son's name is John and receives his speech back.\n\n===Mary (\"Maryam\" \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0645)===\n{{Main|Mary in Islam|Mary (mother of Jesus)}}\n\nMary's life is told in several books of the New Testament and [[Quran 19.16\u201335]]. \n====Bible====\nIn the Bible, in the sixth month after the conception of John the Baptist by Elizabeth, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to the Virgin Mary, at Nazareth. Mary was of the house of David, and was betrothed to Joseph, of the same royal family. And the angel had taken the figure and the form of man, came into the house and said to her: 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.' Mary having heard the greeting words did not speak; she was troubled in spirit, since she knew not the angel, nor the cause of his coming, nor the meaning of the salutation. And the angel continued and said: 'Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus (in [[Matthew 1:21]]\u2013[[Matthew 1:22|22]] a meaning for the name is given \"for he shall save his people from their sins. In Hebrew \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 sounds like the Hebrew word for salvation \"\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4\"). He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father, and he shall reign in the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.' Not doubting the word of God, unlike Zachariah, but filled with fear and astonishment, she said: \"How shall this be done, because I have not known a man?'\nThe angel, to remove Mary's anxiety and to assure her that her virginity would be spared, answered: 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.' In token of the truth of his word he made known to her the conception of John, the miraculous pregnancy of her relative now old and sterile: 'And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth; she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: because no word shall be impossible with God.' Mary may not yet have fully understood the meaning of the heavenly message and how the maternity might be reconciled with her vow of virginity, but clinging to the first words of the angel and trusting to the omnipotence of God she said: 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to me according to thy word.'\n\nIn [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Mary is betrothed to Joseph but the Quran never mentions any man. In the Quran, 'her people' have a conversation with Mary accusing her of fornication. In the Bible, no such conversation happens but Joseph knows that people are thinking this.\n====Quran====\nThe Quran states in [[Maryam (surah)|Maryam]], a surah named after Mary, verse 16\u201337:\n:In the Book, tell the story of Maryam, when she went away from her family (for Prayer) to a place in the East.\n:She placed a screen (to hide) from them; Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her in the form of a man of respect in every way.\n:She said: \"Verily, I ask shelter from you with the Most Gracious (Allah):(Do not come near me) if you guard yourself against evil.\"\n:He said: \"I am a messenger from your Lord, only to announce to you, the gift of a righteous son.\"\n:She said: \"How shall I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I am not indecent?\"\n:He said: \"It will be so: Your Lord says 'That is easy for Me: And (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign to men and a Mercy from Us': It is a thing (already) ordained.\"\n:So she started to carry him (Jesus), and she went (to rest) with him to a far place.\n:And the pains of childbirth took her to the trunk of a palm tree: She cried \"Oh! If I had died before this! If I was a thing forgotten and not seen!\"\n:Then (a voice) cried to her from under the tree: \"Do not feel sad! Because your Lord has made a stream underneath you; And shake towards yourself the trunk of the palm tree: It will drop fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and cool (wet your) eye. And if you see any man, say, 'I have promised solemnly to the Most Gracious, and this day I will not enter into talk with any human being.'\"\n:At the end she brought the baby to her people, carrying baby Jesus in her arms. They said \"O Maryam! Truly an amazing thing have you brought! O sister of Aaron! Your father was not an adulterous man, and your mother was not an immoral woman!\"\n:Then, she pointed to the baby. They said, \"How can we talk to one who is only a child in the cradle?\"\n:He (Baby Jesus) said, \"Indeed I am a servant of Allah: He has given me the Injeel (Gospel) and made me a prophet; and he has made me blessed where ever I be, and has commanded for me prayer and charity as long as I live; Allah has made me kind to my mother, and not arrogant or miserable;And Peace is on me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised up alive!\"\n:Jesus, the son of Maryam was like this: It is a statement of truth, about which they dispute (uselessly).\n:It is not suited for Almighty Allah that He should father a son. Glory to Him! When He determines anything, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\n:Jesus said: \"And surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him alone you, therefore, worship: That is the Straight Path.\"\n:Then, the groups differed among themselves: so this is a warning to the disbelievers because of the Judgement on a great Day! <ref>Translation: [[Syed Vickar Ahamed]], 2007.

Christians accept all four books as part of the canon of Scripture.\n\nJesus directly appears several times in the Quran: Al-Imran 35\u201359; An-Nisa' 156\u2013158; Al-Ma'idah 109\u2013120; Maryam 16\u201335, Al-Mu'minun 50; Az-Zukhruf 57\u201365; As-Saff 6 and 14. He is also indirectly referred to in other locations.\n\nThe Quran contains few narratives from [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]]' life, but does include many brief descriptions in common with the Bible:\n\n*Made the dead to live <ref name=\"Surah 5.110\">Surah 5.110</ref>\n*Was the prophesied [[Messiah]] <ref>Surah 3.45</ref> \n*Had [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]].<ref>Surah 3.52</ref>\n*Taught disciples to carry on his ministry.<ref>Surah 3.55</ref>\n*Healed individuals inflicted with blindness and [[leprosy]].<ref name=\"Surah 5.110\" />\n\nThe details of Jesus's birth differ from those offered in the gospels of Matthew and Luke (see [[Biblical and Quranic narratives#Mary|above section]]). Other accounts in the Quran do not exist in the Bible. Two such stories, one in which infant Jesus verbally testifies to Mary's virginity and another in which young Jesus forms and breathes life into clay birds, have counterparts in non-canonical Christian literature (see [[Infancy Gospels]]).<ref>Hans-Josef Klauck (2003). ''The Apocryphal Gospels: An Introduction''. p 18 056708390X \"The surprising element in this Sure is not the allusion to Jesus' miracles of feeding the crowds, but the reference to the remarkable visual miracle of breathing life into birds formed of clay. This is related in the Infancy Gospel of Thomas (2:2\u20134;\"</ref>\nThe Quran rejects that Jesus ever expected to be interpreted as divine and that he only taught strictly [[tawhid]]. It also denies the crucifixion <ref>Surah 4:157</ref> (see [[Islamic view of Jesus' death]]).\n\n==Other figures==\n{{Main|List of people in both the Bible and the Qur'an}}\nThe Quran and the Bible have over 50 characters in common, typically in the same narratives. The Quran identifies Enoch and Ishmael as [[prophet]]s, but they are never given a story. In the Bible, all these men are identified as righteous people but not prophets &mdash; except Ishmael who is blessed by God ({{bibleverse|Genesis|17:20|KJV}}).\n\nThere is also one person mentioned in the Quran, [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], who is not mentioned in the Bible by that name but whose story is similar to stories about [[Alexander the Great]] as mentioned in other Alexander romances and legends of its time (see  [[Alexander the Great in the Quran]]).\n\n==Mixed similarities==\nIn several cases, the Quran and the Bible have common events but occur in different narrations.\n\n===Idol calf and Samaritan===\nIn the Bible, in Moses' absence, certain people who went out of Egypt with the Hebrews worship a golden calf saying \"This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\" Hundreds of years later, Samaria was founded and became the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. King [[Jeroboam]], its first king, also made two golden calves and said, \"These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\"\n\nThe Quran tells the story of a calf while Moses is gone. A man called \"the Samari\" [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] or \"the Samaritan\" ([[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]]) is blamed for protagonizing their idolatry.\n\nA verse in [[Hosea]] 8:5\u20136 contains the same content as [[Ta-Ha]] 20.97 where Hosea refers to the Jeroboam calf and the Quran refers to the earlier calf. Both feature a prophet speaking to the Samaritan/Samaria promising to destroy the calf.\n\n{{cquote|Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity? They are from Israel! This calf \u2013 a craftsman has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria. }}\n\n{{cquote|(Moses) said: \"Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be that thou wilt say, 'touch me not'; ... Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly (melt) it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!\"([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]]  {{Quran-usc|20|97}}) }}\n\nIn the Quran, Moses' punishment that the Samari cannot be touched is the same as the modern Samaritan's punishment where no Jew was allowed to touch them because of their idolatry. In his commentary, [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] claims that the Samari is not a Samaritan.\n\n===Miriam and Mary===\nIn Arabic, both the names ''Mary'' and ''Miriam'' are called ''Maryam''. Mary, the mother of [[Jesus]], is the only female to have her name mentioned in the Quran. While speaking about Mary, the mother of Jesus, the Quran also refers to her as the sister of Aaron (in verses {{cite quran|66|12|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|19|28|style=nosup|expand=no |e=30}}), who in the bible also had a sister Miriam. According to James K. Walker, \u201ccritics have noted that the Qur\u2019an appears to confuse Mary \u2026 in the New Testament with Miram of the Old Testament, who \u2026 lived some 1400 years earlier\u201d.<ref name=\"Walker-37\">{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=James K. |title=What the Quran Really Teaches About Jesus: Prophet of Allah or Savior of the ... |date=2011 |publisher=Harvest House |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrFmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=quran+confuse+mary+and+miriam+in+the+bible?&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwis4JaqgtbkAhVTop4KHRPqCbYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=quran%20confuse%20mary%20and%20miriam%20in%20the%20bible%3F&f=false |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> \n\nHowever, according to Muslim interpreters, this Aaron is different from the brother of Moses. It  was a tradition to give people the names of prophets and pious persons who lived before them as mentioned in the following hadeeth:\n \n<blockquote>Mughira b. Shu'ba reported: When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of Najran) asked me: You read\" O sister of Harun\" (i. e. Hadrat Maryam) in the Quran, whereas Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) I asked him about that, whereupon he said: The (people of the old age) used to give names (to their persons) after the names of Apostles and pious persons who had gone before them. (Sheik Muslim \u2013 Adaaab Book)</blockquote>\n\n===Hannah and Hannah===\n{{further|Hannah (biblical figure)|Saint Anne}}\n\nIn the [[Books of Samuel]], [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] is grateful that God gave her a son, [[Samuel]]. She dedicated him to God by letting him live with [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]] the prophet and priest.\n\nIn the Quran, Mary's mother is grateful to God for Mary and dedicates her to God. Mary then lives in the household of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] the prophet.\n\nIn the Bible, Zechariah is also a priest. Mary's mother is unnamed in the Quran.\n<!-- review this, probably delete\n==Similar doctrine==\n\n===God===\nGod (''Allah'' in the Quran, [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] in the Bible) is the only creator of all things whose power and wisdom cannot be matched. Unlike [[Eastern religions]], God has a personhood with a consciousness. God demands humans to be moral. Acting morally and immorally both have great consequences. However, he is described by the Quran as unknowable, at least completely. This makes Allah more similar to the Dharmic \"Brahman\" than the Hebrew Yahweh.\n\n====Monotheism====\nThe Quran and Bible strongly agree that only One God exists and should be worshiped. In both books, idolatry is the greatest sin. Both Abraham in the Quran and [[Jeremiah]] in the Bible argue the logic of not worshiping a speechless idol whom a human creates, as the creator or someone with wisdom.\n\n====Fatalism====\nBoth books have had a controversy regarding elements of [[fatalism]] within them, the worldview that God determines everything and no real choice exists. The argument follows that if God knows everything that will happen, then the future is already determined and humans can only follow the predetermined route. A counter-argument is that if God is omniscient, then he can allow for fate as well as choice.\n\n===Ethics===\nHonesty and faithfulness are valued while idolatry and murder are condemned. Prayer and fasting<ref>{{quran-usc|2|183}}</ref> are pivotal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe ethics of the Quran are more similar to the ethics of the Torah than the New Testament. Both recommend a pilgrimage to the holy city. Both condemn eating pork and some other foods. Adultery is severely punished. The Scriptures should be read or recited regularly. Prayers should be said facing Jerusalem, though the Quran later changed to face Mecca. Most of Islam's regulations are contained in the [[hadith]].\n\nThe New Testament is considered laxer (by some) in regard to actions but far stricter in regard to motivation and inward feelings. Jesus raises the standard, by saying that whoever lusts sexually in his heart is guilty of adultery, and whoever hates someone is guilty of murder.\n\n===Torah===\nThe Quran identifies the 'Taurat' as a revelation from God to Moses, not the Torah which is the set of the first five books of the Bible. The New Testament calls them the Torah of Moses, though the Torah itself does not give an author. According to the Quran and New Testament, the Gospel confirms the Torah.<ref>{{quran-usc|5|46}}</ref>\n\n===Word===\nBoth scriptures have a high veneration of the God's word, God's revelation to humankind. The Quran identifies the itself as the word of God; Muslims believe they were dictated by God. The Bible calls Jesus the [[Jesus Christ the Logos|Word of God]] because he is the full manifestation of God and the voice of God on earth.\n\n===Angels===\nAngels are God's supernatural agents who carry his messages. Gabriel is named in both books.\n-->\n\n==See also==\n*[[Abrahamic religion]]\n*[[Islam and Judaism]]\n*[[Isra'iliyat]]\n*[[Christianity and Islam]]\n*[[Christianity and Judaism]]\n*[[Comparative religion]]\n*[[Cyrus (Bible)]]\n*[[Cyrus the Great in the Quran]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Biblical Narratives And The Quran}}\n[[Category:Quranic narratives]]\n[[Category:Islam and other religions]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English Oxford spelling|date=June 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2019}}\n{{Religious text primary|date=October 2017}}\n{{Quran |expanded=content|width=22.0em}}\n{{Bible-related|expanded=perspectives}}\n\nThe [[Quran]], the central [[religious text]] of [[Islam]], contains references to [[List of people in both the Bible and the Quran|more than fifty people]] and events also found in the [[Bible]]. While the stories told in each book are generally comparable, important differences sometimes emerge. The versions written in the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament|Christian New Testament]] predate the Quran's versions. As such, Christians regard the Quran's versions as being derived directly or indirectly from the earlier materials. Muslims understand the Quran's versions to be witness accounts from an omnipotent God. As such, Muslims generally hold that the earlier versions are distorted through flawed processes of transmission and interpretation, and understand the Quran's versions to be more accurate to the actual events.\n\nOften, stories related in the Quran tend to concentrate on the moral or spiritual significance of events rather than the details.<ref>e.g. Gerald Hawting, [http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/religionreport/john-wansbrough-remembered/3512288 interviewed] for ''The Religion Report'', [[Radio National]] (Australia), 26 June 2002.</ref> Biblical stories come from diverse sources and authors, so their attention to detail varies individually.\n\n==Torah narratives==\n{{More citations needed|comparison on the name/kind of tree between Qur'an & Bible|date=September 2008}}\n\n===Adam and Eve (\u0622\u062f\u0645 Adam and \u062d\u0648\u0627\u0621 Hawwaa)===\n{{Main|Adam|Eve|Adam and Eve|Adam in Islam}}\nAccording to one of the [[Genesis creation narrative]]s, God initially created the first human, a man named Adam, from \"the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life\"; thereafter God created a woman named Eve from one of Adam's ribs.

Shaitaan subsequently swore to mislead mankind from the \"straight path of God\",<ref>{{cite quran|7|16}}</ref> and God responded to his arrogance and disobedience by expelling him from Heaven.\n\nIslam believes that God thoroughly forgave Adam and Eve their transgression when they begged His mercy; while in the biblical story death is a punishment for transgressing God's command and death remains on Adam, Eve and their descendants.<ref>Lawrence E.

Each made sacrifices to God, but God only accepted Abel's sacrifice and offering, and not Cain's because Abel gave the '''''best''''' of his flocks, indicating that God came first in his heart. Cain, on the other hand, gave a sacrifice from the fruit of his ground, which shows that he was more focused upon only making a sacrifice rather than pleasing the Lord.(Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|4:1-7|HE}}; see Al-Ma'ida {{cite quran|5|30|end=32|style=nosup|expand=yes}}).  Although God attempted to remonstrate with Cain about his attitude, Cain refused to listen and ultimately murdered his brother, Abel (see Al-Ma'ida {{cite quran|5|30|style=nosup|expand=yes}}; Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|4:8|HE}}). Cain was subsequently called to account by God, who condemned him to a lifetime of wandering and fruitless toil, while promising to take vengeance upon any who tried to avenge his brother's blood upon him.  Abel, on the other hand, was regarded by the Bible as righteous.\n\nThe Quran relates a slightly different version; as in the Bible, both offered sacrifice and Cain's was rejected; Cain threatens Abel, who points out that killing him would put Cain ''among the companions of the fire''; Cain murders Abel, but regrets it. The Quran then draws a lesson: ''Because of that, We decreed upon the Children of Israel that whoever kills a soul unless for a soul or for corruption [done] in the land - it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely'\n\nCompare the last part with the '''Talmud Yerushalmi''' (Mishnayot), Mishnah Sanhedrin Tractate 4:5, and Folia 23a, and in the '''Talmud Bavli''' Folia 37a.\n\n\u05dc\u05e4\u05d9\u05db\u05da \u05e0\u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 \u05d0\u05d3\u05dd \u05d9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d3\u05d9 \u05dc\u05dc\u05de\u05d3\u05da \u05e9\u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05de\u05d0\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea [\u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc] \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05d0\u05d9\u05d1\u05d3 \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd \u05de\u05dc\u05d0'' \u05d5\u05db\u05dc'\u05d4\u05de\u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e0\u05e4\u05e9 \u05d0\u05d7\u05ea \u05de\u05d9\u05e9\u05e8\u05d0\u05dc \u05de\u05e2\u05dc\u05d4 \u05e2\u05dc\u05d9\u05d5 \u05d4\u05db\u05ea\u05d5\u05d1 \u05db\u05d0\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5 \u05e7\u05d9\u05d9\u05dd \u05e2\u05d5\u05dc\u05dd''\n\n''Therefore, humans were created singly, to teach you that whoever destroys a single soul [of Israel], Scripture accounts it as if he had destroyed a full world; and whoever saves one soul of Israel, Scripture accounts it as if she had saved a full world.''

God decided to kill all the people through a vast flood while saving the righteous Noah and his immediate family; so he commanded Noah to build an Ark, using God's own instructions. (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|6:9\u201316|HE}}; Hud {{cite quran|11|39|style=nosup|expand=no}}) Noah did so and he, his family, seven pairs of birds and \"clean\" (hoofed) animals, and two of each other animal species (a female and a male) board the Ark (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|6:19|HE}}; Hud {{cite quran|11|42|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Water gushes up from the ground and rains fall from the sky, flooding the earth and killing all the wicked. (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|7:11\u201312|HE}}; Al-Qamar {{cite quran|54|11|end=13|style=nosup|expand=no}}). All aboard the Ark are safe until the waters retreat (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:14|HE}} ; Hud {{cite quran|11|44|style=nosup|expand=no}}).  There is disagreement among Jews, Christians, and Muslims concerning whether the flood was local or global.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nThere are several differences between the biblical and Quranic versions of the story of Noah:\n\n*The Quran focuses on a dialogue between Noah and the wicked (Hud {{cite quran|11|32|end=37|style=nosup|expand=no}}), in which Noah unsuccessfully attempts to remonstrate with his countrymen, who reject his message.  Genesis does not mention such a dialogue. (In the Christian Bible, 2 Peter 2:5, Noah is called a \"preacher of righteousness\".) \n*In the Quran, Noah's wife and one of his sons reject him (Hud {{cite quran|11|43|style=nosup|expand=no}}) and die in the flood, while some people outside his family are faithful and join him (Hud {{cite quran|11|42|style=nosup|expand=no}}). In the biblical narrative, Noah's wife together with his three sons and their wives all board the Ark, but no others.\n*In the Quran, there is no such indication that the flood was universal, although many Islamic scholars claim to interpret otherwise. \n*In the Quran, the Ark is said to rest on the hills of [[Mount Judi]] (Hud {{cite quran|11|44|style=nosup|expand=no}}); in the Bible, it is said to rest on the [[mountains of Ararat]] (Gen. {{bibleverse-nb||Gen|8:4|HE}}) The Al-Djoudi (Judi) is apparently a mountain in the biblical mountain range of Ararat. The Quran cites a particular mount in the Ararat Range, whereas the Bible just mentions the Ararat Range by name. There is a Mount Al-Djoudi in the present-day Ararat mountain range in Turkey.\n\n===Abraham (Ibr\u0101h\u012bm \u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645)===\n\n{{Main|Abraham in Islam|Abraham}}\n\n====Promised a son====\n{{Main|Isaac in Islam }}\n \nSee [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] {{bibleverse-nb||gen|18:1\u201315|HE}}, {{bibleverse-nb||gen|22:1\u201320|HE}} and [[Hud (sura)|Hud]] {{cite quran|11|69|end=74|style=nosup|expand=n}}, [[Al-Hijr]] {{cite quran|15|51|end=56|style=nosup|expand=no}}, [[As-Saaffat]] {{cite quran|37|102|end=109|style=nosup|expand=no}}, and [[Adh-Dhariyat]] {{cite quran|51|24|end=30|style=nosup|expand=no}}. Several messengers come to Abraham on their way to destroy the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. Abraham welcomes them into his tent and provides them with food. They then promise their host that [[Isaac in Islam|Isaac]] (\u02beIs\u1e25\u0101q \u0625\u0633\u062d\u0670\u0642) will soon be born to Abraham's wife, Sarah (S\u0101rah \u0633\u0627\u0631\u0629). Sarah laughs at the idea because she is far too old to bear children. The Hebrew name \u05d9\u05e6\u05d7\u05e7 means 'he laughs\" and is one of the literary tropes in the biblical story. These literary connections are typically lost in Quranic versions of biblical stories.\n\n:Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||gen|18:12|HE}} \"After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?\"\n\n:Hud {{cite quran|11|72|t=y|tn=y|style=nosup|expand=no|quote=She said: \"Alas for me! shall I bear a child, seeing I am an old woman, and my husband here is an old man? That would indeed be a wonderful thing!\"}}\n\nThe angels rebuke her, telling her that by God's will she can bear a son. A conversation ensues in which Abraham admits that he wished God to have mercy on the people of Sodom and Gomorrah.\n\n====Sacrifices his son====\n{{Main|Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael}}\nIn another narrative, Abraham receives a command (in his dream) from God to sacrifice his son. Abraham agrees to this and prepares to carry out the sacrifice. Before he can do so, however, God tells him to stop and gives him a replacement sacrifice. Abraham is subsequently honoured for his faithfulness to God. (As-Saaffat {{cite quran|37|102|end=108|style=nosup|expand=no}}; Genesis {{bibleverse-nb||gen|22:2\u201318|HE}})\n\nHowever, there are several differences between the biblical and Quranic accounts:{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}\n\n*In Genesis, the sacrificial son is Isaac, whereas in the Quran name of the son is not mentioned explicitly, however many Muslims assume it is Ishmael (As-Saaffat {{cite quran|37|102|end=112|style=nosup|expand=no}}). Therefore, Muslims assumes the sacrificial son was Ishmael (Ism\u0101'\u012bl \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644) and that this event happened prior to Isaac's birth. It may be added that the name Abraham is a literary trope in Genesis Ab- \"father-of(-many-nations)\" while the Arabic name masks the connection. In the New Testament, the son is Isaac (James 2:21).\n*While God seems to speak directly to Abraham in Genesis, He speaks through a vision in the Quran.\n*In the Quran, Abraham directly tells his son (Again name is not mentioned in the text however assumed to be [[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]] (Ism\u0101'\u012bl \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644)) that he intends to sacrifice him. In Genesis, Abraham tells Isaac, that \"God will provide the sacrifice.\"\n\n===Abraham's Journeys in the Bible and Quran===\n\n{{expand section|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe Bible describes Abraham as in Iraq-Syria, then in Canaan, Paran, and Egypt, with his final days in Canaan and Hebron. Both Isaac and Ishmael attend Abraham's funeral.\n\nThe Quran mentions that Abraham left his wife and Ishmael (as an infant) in the land where present-day Mecca is, while he left to what was apparently Palestine.\n\n===Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah (L\u016b\u1e6d \u0644\u0648\u0637 and \"The People of Lot\")===\n{{Main|Lot (Bible)|Lot in Islam|Sodom and Gomorrah}}\n\nAccording to the Bible in the [[Book of Genesis]], after visiting Abraham, two angels go to the city of Sodom in which Abraham's nephew Lot is a foreigner. They tell him God will soon destroy the city because of the wickedness of the people. The men of the city, upon hearing that Lot is entertaining male visitors, converge upon his house and demand that the men be brought out so that they can have sex with them.  Lot offers his daughters in their place, but the men insist upon raping the angels instead.  After blinding the city's inhabitants, the angels tell Lot and his family to flee by night and to not look back.  The following morning, God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah with a shower of fiery stones from the sky.  Lot's wife looked back to see the burning city and was turned into a pillar of salt.<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:5\u201326|HE}}</ref>\n\nThe story continues further after the destruction of the twin cities, with Lot leaving Zoar (where he had fled for refuge) with his two daughters to live in a cave.<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:30|HE}}</ref> Fearing that all the men were dead, the daughters decided that in order to 'preserve the [[Kinship|seed of their father]]' and [[procreate]], they must have [[sexual intercourse]] with him;<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:31|HE}}</ref> they decide to get him into a [[Drunk|drunken stupor]] so as to be able to 'lie with him' and obtain his [[semen|seed]].<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:32|HE}}</ref>  And so they each sleep with their father (one each on successive nights), having intoxicated him to a point wherein he could 'perceive not',<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:33-35|HE}}</ref> and thus get [[impregnated]] by him. The Bible then continues \"And the firstborn bare a son, and called his name Moab: the same is the father of the [[Moab]]ites unto this day. And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name Ben-ammi: the same is the father of the children of [[Ammon]] unto this day\".<ref>{{bibleverse|Genesis|19:37-38|HE}}</ref> The biblical story of Lot ends here.\n\nAccording to the Quran, Lot (or Lut, as he is called in the Quran) was a [[Prophets in Islam|Prophet]]. He was also a nephew of Prophet [[Islamic view of Abraham|Ibrahim]] ([[Abraham]]).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} A group of [[Angels]] visited Ibrahim as guests<ref>{{cite quran|15|51}}</ref> and gave him glad tidings of a son \"endowed with wisdom\";<ref>{{cite quran|11|69}}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|15|53}}</ref> they told him that they had been sent by God to the \"guilty people\"<ref>{{cite quran|15|58}}</ref> of Sodom,<ref>{{cite quran|11|70}}</ref> to destroy them<ref>{{cite quran|29|31}}</ref><ref>{{cite quran|29|34}}</ref> with \"a shower of stones of clay ([[Fire and brimstone|brimstone]])\"<ref>{{cite quran|51|33|34}}</ref> and deliver Lot and those who believed in him.

The story of Lot in the Quran ends after describing the destruction of the city.\n\nThere are several differences between the Quran and the Bible:\n\n*In the Quran, Lot is described as a prophet, like his uncle Abraham. In Genesis ({{bibleverse|Genesis|19:1\u201329|HE}}), Lot is not described as a prophet. In the New Testament, ({{bibleverse|2 Peter|2:7,8|KJV}}) [[Saint Peter|Peter the Apostle]] describes Lot as a righteous man who was daily tormented by the lawless deeds he saw in Sodom.\n*In both the Bible and in the Quran, Abraham pleads for God to have mercy (Quran{{cite quran|11|75|style=nosup|expand=no}}; Gen. 18:24\u201333). In Genesis, God agrees to spare Sodom if just ten righteous men can be found here (but they are not found).  In the Quran, God commands Abraham not to ask for mercy on them. {{cite quran|11|76|style=nosup|expand=no}}\n*In Genesis, Lot's wife leaves with Lot but turns around briefly and God turns her into a pillar of salt ({{bibleverse|Genesis|19:26|HE}}). In the Quran, there is no mention of her leaving; rather Lot and his followers were commanded by the angels not to turn, but Lot is informed that his wife will turn and look behind (Quran Hud 11:123), and thus be destroyed with the rest of the two cities. {{cite quran|11|81|style=nosup|expand=no}}\n*Following the destruction of Sodom, the Bible describes an [[incest]]ous event between Lot and his two daughters, at his daughters' behest, in {{bibleverse|Genesis|19:30-38|HE}}. The Quran does not describe any such event, and Muslims reject any such occurrence .{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\n(See Also: Bible: {{bibleverse|Genesis|19:1\u201326|HE}}. Quran: Surah [[Al-Hijr]] 57\u201377, Surah [[Hud (sura)|Hud]] 74\u201383, Surah [[Al-A'raf]] 80\u201384, Surah [[Ash-Shu'ara]] 160\u2013174, Surah [[An-Naml]] 54\u201358, Surah [[Al-Ankabut]] 28\u201335, Surah [[As-Saaffat]] 133\u2013138, Surah [[Adh-Dhariyat]] 31\u201337, and Surah [[Al-Qamar]] 36\u201339.)\n\n===Joseph (Y\u016bsuf \u064a\u0648\u0633\u0641)===\nThe narratives of Joseph can be found in {{bibleverse|Genesis|37\u201345|KJV}} and in the first 102 verses of Surah [[Yusuf (surah)|Yusuf (Joseph)]] ([https://quran.com/12/1-102 Quran 12:1-102])\n\nIn both the Bible and the Quran, Joseph has a vision of eleven stars and the sun and the moon all bowing to him which he shares with his family.\n\n({{bibleverse|Genesis|37:9|HE}}) And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brothers, and said, \"Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold, the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to me.\"\n\n(Yusuf|12.4) Behold! Joseph said to his father: \"O my father! I did see eleven stars and the sun and the moon: I saw them prostrate themselves to me!\"\n\nJoseph's brothers became jealous that their father preferred Joseph over them, and so they form a plot to kill Joseph. However, one brother convinces them not to kill him but throw him down a well while they are alone. The brothers come to the father asking his permission to take Joseph out with them to enjoy and play with them. Jacob expresses his reservations against letting him go with them and expressing fear about a wild animal killing him while they were not careful about him. The sons assure the father of their being a mighty group against any threats to Joseph. The father eventually agrees to send Yusuf with them (in the Quran), while in the Bible, Jacob sends Joseph out of his own accord without sons trying to persuade him to let him go with them. (Yusuf|12.8\u201310; {{bibleverse|Genesis|37:20\u201322|HE}}) They agree. They subsequently lie to their father as to Joseph's whereabouts, covering his clothing in blood and asserting that a wild animal had attacked him. A caravan passing the well inspires the brothers to pull Joseph out of the well and to sell him as a slave to traders in the caravan. Later the traders sell him to a wealthy Egyptian. ({{bibleverse|Genesis|37:27\u201336|HE}}; Yusuf|12.20\u201322)\n\nJoseph grows up in the house of the Egyptian. When Joseph is a grown man, his master's wife tries to seduce him. Joseph resists and runs away, but is caught by other servants and reported to his master. The wife lies to her husband, saying that Joseph tried to rape her. (Yusuf|12.25; {{bibleverse|Genesis|39:12|HE}}); At this point, the two stories differ.\n\nIn the Bible, Joseph's master (named as Potiphar) refuses to believe Joseph's denial and imprisons him.\nIn the Quran, Joseph's master (who is only identified as \"the Vizier\") accepts the suggestion of another wise person to check Joseph's tunic. If it is torn from the front, the wise person asserts, it will prove Joseph a liar; but if it is torn from the back (as proves to be the case), Joseph will be vindicated and the master's wife proven a liar and an adulteress. The Vizier reprimands his wife and permits Joseph to remain in his household. The Vizier's wife hosts a banquet for women who had been gossiping about her and Joseph providing them with knives; Joseph is commanded to appear before the wife and her ladyfriends; they cut their hands with knives. (The bible does not mention the banquet), a \"post-Biblical Jewish tradition\" describes Potiphar serving fruit to the gossips who cut themselves inadvertently, distracted by Joseph's good looks.)<ref name=\"Cook-1983-78\">{{cite book |last1=Cook |first1=Michael |title=Muhammad |date=1983 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0192876058 |pages=78}}</ref> Although the Vizier again recognizes Joseph's innocence, he orders him imprisoned nevertheless.\nIn prison, Joseph meets two men. One has a dream of making wine and the other dreams of carrying a stack of bread that birds are eating. Joseph tells the first that he will serve the Pharaoh again and the second will be executed. Both things happen, precisely as Joseph foretold. Although Joseph asks the first man to bring his name and unjust imprisonment to the attention of the Pharaoh, (referred to in the Quran as only the King, not a Pharaoh) the first man quickly forgets about him once restored to the royal favour.\n\nSometime thereafter, Pharaoh had a dream:\n\n({{bibleverse|Genesis|41:17\u201324|HE}}) \"17. Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, \"In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile, 18.when out of the river there came up seven cows, fat and sleek, and they grazed among the reeds. 19. After them, seven other cows came up \u2013 scrawny and very ugly and lean. I had never seen such ugly cows in all the Land of Egypt. 20. The lean, ugly cows ate up the seven fat cows that came up first. 21. But even after they ate them, no one could tell that they had done so; they looked just as ugly as before. Then I woke up.\" 22.\" In my dreams I also saw seven heads of grain, full and good, growing on a single stalk. 23. After them, seven other heads sprouted \u2013 withered and thin and scorched by the east wind. 24. The thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads. I told this to the magicians, but none could explain it to me.\"\n\n(Quran: Yusuf|12.43) The king (of Egypt) said: \"I do see (in a vision) seven fat kine, whom seven lean ones devour, and seven green ears of corn and seven (others) withered. O ye chiefs! Expound to me my vision if it be that ye can interpret visions.\"\n\nPharaoh's cupbearer, who had been previously imprisoned with Joseph, suddenly remembers his promise and tells Pharaoh about the man who foretold his own restoration to favour. Pharaoh sent to the prison, asking Joseph to interpret his dream.\n\nIn the Quranic account, Joseph insists that the Vizier's wife vindicate him before the king before Joseph will agree to do so (this is not mentioned in the Bible); Pharaoh summons the Vizier's wife, who admits her lies about Joseph and proclaims his innocence. The Quran now rejoins the biblical narrative, where Joseph reveals the meaning of the king's dream: Egypt will have seven years of good crops followed by seven years of famine and the famine will be worse than the abundance. The king rewarded Joseph by giving him charge over the storehouses and the entire land of Egypt.\n\nDuring the famine, Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy food, but the youngest was left with their father. While Joseph recognized them, they did not recognize him. He demanded that they return with the missing brother. The brothers return home and find that Joseph had hidden in their packs more than they paid for. They asked their father if they might return with the youngest brother. Reluctantly, their father allows this. They return, and after some further incidents, Joseph ultimately reveals himself to his brothers. ({{bibleverse|Genesis|45:1|HE}}; Yusuf| 12.90).\n\nIn both the Quran and the Bible, the missing brother is Benjamin, (Arabic: \u0628\u0646 \u064a\u0627\u0645\u064a\u0646) Joseph's only full blood brother. The others are half-brothers.\n\nThe Qur'an correctly does not refer to the king of Egypt during Joseph's time as the \"Pharaoh.\" The titular word \"Pharaoh\" was given to the kings of Egypt during the [[New Kingdom]] period later historically. This distinction is not found in the Bible.\n\n===Moses (M\u016bs\u0101 \u0645\u0648\u0633\u0649)===\n{{Musa|all}}\n{{Main|Moses in Islam|Moses}}\n\nIn the Bible, the narratives of Moses are in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]], and [[Deuteronomy]]. The narratives here are mostly in {{bibleverse|Exodus|1\u201314|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Exodus|32|KJV}}. In the Quran, the Moses narratives are in the following passages: [[Al-Baqara|2]].49\u201361, [[Al-A'raf|7]].103\u2013160, [[Yunus (sura)|10]].75\u201393, [[Al-Isra|17]].101\u2013104, [[Ta-Ha|20]].9\u201397, [[Ash-Shu'ara|26]].10\u201366, [[An-Naml|27]].7\u201314, [[Al-Qisas|28]].3\u201346, [[Al-Ghafir|40]].23\u201330, [[Az-Zukhruf|43]].46\u201355, [[Ad-Dukhan|44]].17\u201331, and [[An-Naziat|79]].15\u201325.\n\nPharaoh slew the young male children of the Israelites (II:46), and to avoid this fate, [[Jochebed|Moses' mother]] cast Moses as an infant into a small ark, where God protected him. Moses was found by the household of the Pharaoh, who adopted him. Moses' sister, Miriam, had followed Moses, and she recommended that his own mother serves as a nurse to him. When Moses became an adult, he saw an Egyptian fighting with an Israelite, and he interceded and killed the Egyptian. The next day, the Israelite asked whether Moses intended to kill him as well. The Pharaoh tried to have Moses killed and Moses fled to a watering place in [[Midian]]. He met some sisters and watered their herd. When the women's father, [[Jethro (Bible)|Jethro]], learned of Moses, he invited him to stay and gave him a daughter, [[Zipporah]], to marry.\n\nIn Midian, Moses saw a fire and approached it. God spoke to him and told him to remove his shoes. God said that he had chosen Moses. God said to throw down his staff and to stretch out his arm as signs. His staff turned into a serpent and then returned to the form of a staff. His arm became white although he was not sick. God commanded him to go to Pharaoh to deliver a message. Moses said that he could not speak well. So God provided Aaron, his brother, to help Moses speak.\n\nGod sent Moses to the court of [[Pharaoh]]. Pharaoh refused to listen to Moses. In response, Moses threw down his staff and it became a serpent. This prompted Pharaoh's magicians also threw down their staffs, which also turned into snakes. But the snakes of Pharaoh's magicians were swallowed by Moses' serpent. \n\nGod caused a famine. God sent plagues of locusts, frogs, blood, and destruction. God sent at least nine signs to Pharaoh, but Pharaoh ignored these signs. When he could ignore them no longer, he agreed to let the Israelites go. However, after God had allowed tranquility, Pharaoh went back on his word and refused to let the Israelites go. As punishment, God made every first-born Egyptian son die and spared every Israelite (the first [[Passover]]). Pharaoh became hysterical and demanded that Moses and the Israelites leave at once- only to pursue them with his army after their exit. Then God helped Moses lead the Israelites into a desert and across a sea. Moses struck the sea with his staff and the sea split in half exposing dry land (while creating a wall of water on each side) for the Israelites to walk through. Pharaoh and his army were catching up to the Israelites but the water returned to its original state. Pharaoh and his army drowned. ({{bibleverse|Exodus|14:7|HE}}, II:47)\n\nMoses left the Hebrews for forty nights. He put his brother Aaron in charge of the people (Al-Baqara|2.48) On a mountain, God gave Moses a revelation of precepts for Israel to follow. God made tablets with writing on them which Moses carried back to Israel.\n\nMoses asked to see God. The people saw the fire and lightning and the mountain and were afraid. While Moses was gone, the Israelites demanded to worship an idol. They used the gold from their ornaments to construct a golden calf whom they said was the god who rescued them from Egypt. Aaron does not stop them. Then Moses returned and chastised them and Aaron. Many were killed for their actions. God sent down manna and quail to eat but the Hebrews still rebelled against God, and complained about the food. Moses asked God for water and God answered him. Moses struck a stone with his staff and water came forth. The Israelites were divided into twelve tribes.\n\nGod gave the Israelites a bountiful land, but this occurred at different times in the two scriptures. Besides that and the many additional details in the [[Torah]],{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} there are other differences:\n\n*The biblical Moses is reluctant to become a prophet and makes excuses. He eventually agrees and Aaron speaks and performs miracles at first until Moses is ready and takes over. In the Quran, Aaron was made God's messenger on Moses' request to back him up in the difficult task. Moses asked God to give him human support from his family, then asks for Aaron (his brother) praising Aaron by saying that he (Aaron) is a better speaker than him (Moses).\n*The sorcerers, in the Quranic story, repent after seeing Moses' signs and submit to God at the anger of Pharaoh.\n*In the Quran, Pharaoh didn't repent but tried to deceive Moses and God by saying that now he believes in one God, the God of Moses and Aaron (while drowning). But God didn't accept this because he sought repentance at the time of death after seeing the angels.\n*In the Bible, Moses first goes to Pharaoh without showing any signs.\n*In Exodus, Aaron helps make the golden calf. In the Quran,  Aaron himself was a messenger of God and was representing Moses in his absences. He opposed that idea with all his might and warned the Israelites that God will be angry with them. In the Quran, a person named Samiri (not to be confused with Samaritans) leads the Israelites to worship the golden calf.\n*In the Quran, Pharaoh drowned, but God said in the Quran that he preserved the pharaoh's body as an example for generations to come (or made an example for coming generations) ([[Ramesses II]])\n\nSee also [[Aaron]], [[Islamic view of Aaron]], and [[Islamic view of Pharaoh]].\n\n===Destruction of Korah===\n{{Main|Korah}}\n\nThe story of the destruction of [[Korah]] appears in {{bibleverse|Numbers|16:1\u201350|HE}} in the [[Torah]] and in [[Al-Qasas]] 76\u201382 in the Quran. Korah was an Israelite living during the time of Moses. Because of his wickedness, God caused him to die by opening the ground and swallowing him and his home ({{bibleverse|Numbers|16:31\u201333|HE}}; Al-Qasas|28.81). In the Quran, Karon is simply a rich man who is too arrogant. In the Torah, he leads a minor rebellion against Moses. God also kills the others who rebel with him and destroys their homes.\n\n==Later Hebrew Bible narratives==\n\n===Gideon/Talut===\nIn the Quran and the Bible, there are stories about smaller armies winning victory over larger ones. One story in the Quran and the Bible share strong resemblances, although they are placed at different times and attributed to different characters. The Bible story features [[Gideon]] from the [[Book of Judges]] and the Quran story features [[Talut]] (usually translated as [[King Saul|Saul]]).\n\nIn the [[Book of Judges]] {{bibleverse-nb|Judges|6-8|KJV}} of the Bible, Gideon receives commands from God to take the Israelites to war against the Midianites. Gideon is reluctant, but accedes after making God prove Himself with three different tests. As they are heading to fight, God tells Gideon to send away those who are homesick or afraid of dying. Because the army is still large enough to credit its own strength for victory, God tells Gideon to observe the drinking habits of his troops at the river. God says to send those who do not drink with their hands, but lap the water directly like a dog, back to their homes. The remaining Israelites go on to victory.\n\nIn [[Al-Baqarah|2]]:246-248 of the Quran, God chooses Talut (generally considered to be Saul) to lead the Israelites into battle against the army of Goliath. On their way, God tells Talut to warn the men that they will be tested by God, and that they must not drink from the next river in order to pass the test. Despite this warning, most of the men disobey and drink from the river. God tells Talut to leave the disobedient members behind, unless they only drank one handful so that the army will consist of only faithful members. The army then goes on to defeat General Goliath's army.\n\n===Saul, David and Goliath  (T\u0101l\u016bt \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a, D\u0101w\u016bd \u062f\u0627\u0648\u062f and \u062c\u0627\u0644\u0648\u062a Jalut)===\n{{Main|Saul|Islamic view of Saul|Goliath}}\n\nThe story appears in [[Book of Samuel|1 Samuel]] {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|8\u201312|KJV}} and {{bibleverse-nb|1 Samuel|17:1\u201358|KJV}}. The Prophet [[Samuel]] is petitioned by the Israelites for a king. God sends Samuel to appoint [[Saul the King|Saul]] as the king, although with the warning that kings only take from their people. At least a few people are not happy with Samuel's choice, but Saul then prophecizes and wins some victories, so the people embrace him. Later Saul falls out of God's favour and God promises to appoint someone else as king. The Philistines attack and are bolstered by the fear engendered by their champion [[Goliath]], a giant. God sends Samuel to recruit [[David]], who kills [[Goliath]]. David eventually goes on to become Israel's new king.\n\nA similar story appears in the Qu'ran [[Al-Baqarah|2]]:246\u2013251. The Israelites demand of their prophet to appoint a king, and so God appoints the man [[Talut]]. The people respond poorly to the selection, upset that Talut does not seem special. God gives the [[Ark of the Covenant]] back to the Israelites in order to verify His choice (this is an event that predates Saul in the Bible). Talut leads the men to battle against an army led by the General Goliath. The Israelite army is small and doubtful, but a few men trust that God can still give them victory. David then kills Goliath and becomes king of Israel. The account also bears similarity to when [[Gideon]] led an army. See the above Gideon/Talut subsection.\n\n===The Queen of Sheba===\n{{Main|Queen of Sheba|Islamic view of the Queen of Sheba}}\n\nThe story appears in {{bibleverse|1 Kings|10:1\u201313|HE}} and {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|9:1\u201313|HE}} and in verses Surah [[An-Naml|27]] 20\u201344. The two stories have almost nothing in common. In each, the Queen of Sheba comes to visit Solomon and is impressed by his wisdom and riches. In the Bible, the visit is only diplomatic. In the Quran, the Queen becomes monotheist and peace is established in the kingdoms. Although not part of the Quran, Islamic tradition holds that the name of the Queen of Sheba is [[Bilqis]] or Balqis.\n\n===Jonah (Yunus \u064a\u0648\u0646\u0633) and the big fish===\n{{Main|Jonah|Islamic view of Jonah}}\nIn both the Bible and the Quran, Jonah is swallowed by a \"big fish\", usually inferred to be a whale. The Book of Jonah in the [[Bible]] consists of four chapters about Jonah's mission to Nineveh. Jonah is referenced three times in the [[Quran]]: in verses 139\u2013148 of Sura 37 (As-Saaffat) (Those who set the ranks), verses 87\u201388 of Sura 21: al-Anbiya' (The Prophets) and verses 48\u201350 of Sura 68: al-Qalam (The Pen)/Nun. It is mentioned in verse 98 of Sura 10: Yunus (Jonah) and verse 86 of Sura 6: al-An'am (The Cattle).\n\nIn the Quran, Jonah gets frustrated by his own people and abandons them to God's mercy, however without asking permission from God and thus going against his given responsibility. In the Quran, it is also mentioned that if Jonah had not prayed inside the belly of the fish he would have stayed in there until the Judgement day. In the Bible, Jonah pays a fare to sail to Tarshish. In both stories, he boards the ship loaded with passengers, lots are cast and Jonah is thrown overboard and swallowed by a large fish ([[Jonah 1:17]], As-Saaffat 37|142). After praying, he is cast out of the fish and washed ashore, and God causes a gourd to grow (37|146) or weeds ({{bibleverse-nb|Jonah|2:5|KJV}}). In the Bible, Jonah continues into Nineveh, and the city is spared by God. In the Quran, God causes the gourd to grow to comfort Jonah after he lies on the shore in a sickly state (As-Saaffat 37|145), in the Bible the gourd plant grows up to provide shade for Jonah while he waits for Nineveh to be destroyed ([[Jonah 4:6]]). According to an Islamic tradition {{Citation needed|reason=name of the author or book|date=September 2008}} however, the big fish gets frightened at first, fearing it might have swallowed a holy person as it heard prayers and supplications read in a wonderful voice from her stomach, hearing which numerous sea creatures had surrounded it. But she comforts herself later since it was God's order to swallow Jonah. After two days the fish casts him out the beach of an island and he is very weak. The gastric juices with the hot sunlight burned his skin till the point he was about to scream of pain. God causes a vine to grow over him and provide him fruit and shade. He recovers and goes back to his people who had become good after he left. According to the Bible, Ninevah was a great city, with more than one hundred twenty thousand people and much livestock ([[Jonah 4:11]]). In the Quran, the number of people he was sent towards as a prophet exceeded a hundred thousand. They believed in his message and God granted them prosperity for a long time. (As-Saaffat 37|147\u2013148). In the New Testament, Jesus refers to the Ninevites repenting at the preaching of Jonah ({{bibleverse|Matthew|12:41|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|Luke|11:32|KJV}}).\n\n===Haman===\n{{Main|Haman (Bible)|Haman (Islam)}}\n\nIn the Bible, Haman was an Agagite noble and [[vizier]] of the empire under Persian King [[Ahasuerus]] who desires to persecute the Jews. In the Quran, Haman is an adviser and builder under a [[Firaun]] (Pharaoh) of ancient Egypt whose narrative relationship with Moses is recounted in the Quran.\n\nThe structure which Firaun commands Haman to build is similar to the [[Tower of Babel]] in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], unrelated to the narrative of Haman in the Bible. Both structures are made from burnt bricks for the purpose of ascending to the heavens.\n\nHowever, it's also been suggested that these two are different individuals. The name \"Haman\" was in fact mentioned in old Egyptian tablets which now stand in the Hof Museum, Vienna{{Citation needed|reason=More likely to be Hemen|date=December 2014}} (Walter Wreszinski, \u00c4gyptische Inschriften aus dem K.K. Hof Museum in Wien, 1906, J. C. Hinrichs' sche Buchhandlung).\n\n==New Testament narratives==\n\n===Zechariah and John (Zakariya (\u0632\u0643\u0631\u064a\u0627) and Yahya (\u064a\u062d\u064a\u0649))===\n{{Main|Zechariah (priest)|Islamic view of Zechariah|John the Baptist|Islamic view of John the Baptist}}\n\nThe story of Zechariah is told in the [[Gospel of Luke]] {{bibleverse-nb|Luke|1:5\u201380|KJV}} and {{bibleverse|Luke|3:1\u201322|KJV}} and in the Quran 19.2\u201315. Zechariah and his wife reached an old age without bearing children. God spoke to Zechariah and told him his wife would conceive, despite her barrenness, and his name would be John. As a sign that this would happen, God struck Zechariah mute until John was born though he communicated using signs. John became a great and righteous prophet and came to confirm God's Word. Both accounts mention John's death.\n\nThe two accounts never directly disagree, but each has unique elements: In the Bible Zechariah is a priest. God speaks to him on [[Yom Kippur]] in the [[Holy of Holies]]. He doubts that God will act and his muteness is a sign and punishment. In the Quran, God promises him a child and he questions how would it come about since he is an old man and his wife long barren. Upon which he is told that for God it is indeed very easy and ''that hasn't God'' created you already while you were naught. In the Quranic narrative Zechariah is also reminded that the sign he should seek for would be a muteness for three nights although without being restrained from speech, implying,<ref>{{cite quran|19|10}}</ref> {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} he simply would not find an occasion to talk to anyone. Zechariah, therefore, is found emerging from his chamber and reminding his people to celebrate the praises of the Lord through an inspirational gesture (Surah Maryam 19|1\u201311). In the Bible, Zechariah confirms that the son's name is John and receives his speech back.\n\n===Mary (\"Maryam\" \u0645\u0631\u064a\u0645)===\n{{Main|Mary in Islam|Mary (mother of Jesus)}}\n\nMary's life is told in several books of the New Testament and [[Quran 19.16\u201335]]. \n====Bible====\nIn the Bible, in the sixth month after the conception of John the Baptist by Elizabeth, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to the Virgin Mary, at Nazareth. Mary was of the house of David, and was betrothed to Joseph, of the same royal family. And the angel had taken the figure and the form of man, came into the house and said to her: 'Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.' Mary having heard the greeting words did not speak; she was troubled in spirit, since she knew not the angel, nor the cause of his coming, nor the meaning of the salutation. And the angel continued and said: 'Fear not, Mary, for thou hast found grace with God. Behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and shalt bring forth a son; and thou shalt call his name Jesus (in [[Matthew 1:21]]\u2013[[Matthew 1:22|22]] a meaning for the name is given \"for he shall save his people from their sins. In Hebrew \u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2 sounds like the Hebrew word for salvation \"\u05d9\u05e9\u05d5\u05e2\u05d4\"). He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of David his father, and he shall reign in the house of Jacob forever. And of his kingdom there shall be no end.' Not doubting the word of God, unlike Zachariah, but filled with fear and astonishment, she said: \"How shall this be done, because I have not known a man?'\nThe angel, to remove Mary's anxiety and to assure her that her virginity would be spared, answered: 'The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the Most High shall overshadow thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.' In token of the truth of his word he made known to her the conception of John, the miraculous pregnancy of her relative now old and sterile: 'And behold, thy cousin Elizabeth; she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month with her that is called barren: because no word shall be impossible with God.' Mary may not yet have fully understood the meaning of the heavenly message and how the maternity might be reconciled with her vow of virginity, but clinging to the first words of the angel and trusting to the omnipotence of God she said: 'Behold the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to me according to thy word.'\n\nIn [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], Mary is betrothed to Joseph but the Quran never mentions any man. In the Quran, 'her people' have a conversation with Mary accusing her of fornication. In the Bible, no such conversation happens but Joseph knows that people are thinking this.\n====Quran====\nThe Quran states in [[Maryam (surah)|Maryam]], a surah named after Mary, verse 16\u201337:\n:In the Book, tell the story of Maryam, when she went away from her family (for Prayer) to a place in the East.\n:She placed a screen (to hide) from them; Then We sent to her Our angel, and he appeared before her in the form of a man of respect in every way.\n:She said: \"Verily, I ask shelter from you with the Most Gracious (Allah):(Do not come near me) if you guard yourself against evil.\"\n:He said: \"I am a messenger from your Lord, only to announce to you, the gift of a righteous son.\"\n:She said: \"How shall I have a son, when no man has touched me, and I am not indecent?\"\n:He said: \"It will be so: Your Lord says 'That is easy for Me: And (We wish) to appoint him as a Sign to men and a Mercy from Us': It is a thing (already) ordained.\"\n:So she started to carry him (Jesus), and she went (to rest) with him to a far place.\n:And the pains of childbirth took her to the trunk of a palm tree: She cried \"Oh! If I had died before this! If I was a thing forgotten and not seen!\"\n:Then (a voice) cried to her from under the tree: \"Do not feel sad! Because your Lord has made a stream underneath you; And shake towards yourself the trunk of the palm tree: It will drop fresh ripe dates upon you. So eat and drink and cool (wet your) eye. And if you see any man, say, 'I have promised solemnly to the Most Gracious, and this day I will not enter into talk with any human being.'\"\n:At the end she brought the baby to her people, carrying baby Jesus in her arms. They said \"O Maryam! Truly an amazing thing have you brought! O sister of Aaron! Your father was not an adulterous man, and your mother was not an immoral woman!\"\n:Then, she pointed to the baby. They said, \"How can we talk to one who is only a child in the cradle?\"\n:He (Baby Jesus) said, \"Indeed I am a servant of Allah: He has given me the Injeel (Gospel) and made me a prophet; and he has made me blessed where ever I be, and has commanded for me prayer and charity as long as I live; Allah has made me kind to my mother, and not arrogant or miserable;And Peace is on me the day I was born, the day I die, and the day I will be raised up alive!\"\n:Jesus, the son of Maryam was like this: It is a statement of truth, about which they dispute (uselessly).\n:It is not suited for Almighty Allah that He should father a son. Glory to Him! When He determines anything, He only says to it, \"Be\", and it is.\n:Jesus said: \"And surely Allah is my Lord and your Lord: Him alone you, therefore, worship: That is the Straight Path.\"\n:Then, the groups differed among themselves: so this is a warning to the disbelievers because of the Judgement on a great Day! <ref>Translation: [[Syed Vickar Ahamed]], 2007.

Christians accept all four books as part of the canon of Scripture.\n\nJesus directly appears several times in the Quran: Al-Imran 35\u201359; An-Nisa' 156\u2013158; Al-Ma'idah 109\u2013120; Maryam 16\u201335, Al-Mu'minun 50; Az-Zukhruf 57\u201365; As-Saff 6 and 14. He is also indirectly referred to in other locations.\n\nThe Quran contains few narratives from [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]]' life, but does include many brief descriptions in common with the Bible:\n\n*Made the dead to live <ref name=\"Surah 5.110\">Surah 5.110</ref>\n*Was the prophesied [[Messiah]] <ref>Surah 3.45</ref> \n*Had [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]].<ref>Surah 3.52</ref>\n*Taught disciples to carry on his ministry.<ref>Surah 3.55</ref>\n*Healed individuals inflicted with blindness and [[leprosy]].<ref name=\"Surah 5.110\" />\n\nThe details of Jesus's birth differ from those offered in the gospels of Matthew and Luke (see [[Biblical and Quranic narratives#Mary|above section]]). Other accounts in the Quran do not exist in the Bible. Two such stories, one in which infant Jesus verbally testifies to Mary's virginity and another in which young Jesus forms and breathes life into clay birds, have counterparts in non-canonical Christian literature (see [[Infancy Gospels]]).<ref>Hans-Josef Klauck (2003). ''The Apocryphal Gospels: An Introduction''. p 18 056708390X \"The surprising element in this Sure is not the allusion to Jesus' miracles of feeding the crowds, but the reference to the remarkable visual miracle of breathing life into birds formed of clay.

It also denies the crucifixion <ref>Surah 4:157</ref> (see [[Islamic view of Jesus' death]]).\n\n==Other figures==\n{{Main|List of people in both the Bible and the Qur'an}}\nThe Quran and the Bible have over 50 characters in common, typically in the same narratives. The Quran identifies Enoch and Ishmael as [[prophet]]s, but they are never given a story. In the Bible, all these men are identified as righteous people but not prophets &mdash; except Ishmael who is blessed by God ({{bibleverse|Genesis|17:20|KJV}}).\n\nThere is also one person mentioned in the Quran, [[Dhul-Qarnayn]], who is not mentioned in the Bible by that name but whose story is similar to stories about [[Alexander the Great]] as mentioned in other Alexander romances and legends of its time (see  [[Alexander the Great in the Quran]]).\n\n==Mixed similarities==\nIn several cases, the Quran and the Bible have common events but occur in different narrations.\n\n===Idol calf and Samaritan===\nIn the Bible, in Moses' absence, certain people who went out of Egypt with the Hebrews worship a golden calf saying \"This is your God, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\" Hundreds of years later, Samaria was founded and became the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. King [[Jeroboam]], its first king, also made two golden calves and said, \"These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of Egypt.\"\n\nThe Quran tells the story of a calf while Moses is gone. A man called \"the Samari\" [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] or \"the Samaritan\" ([[Arthur John Arberry|Arberry]]) is blamed for protagonizing their idolatry.\n\nA verse in [[Hosea]] 8:5\u20136 contains the same content as [[Ta-Ha]] 20.97 where Hosea refers to the Jeroboam calf and the Quran refers to the earlier calf. Both feature a prophet speaking to the Samaritan/Samaria promising to destroy the calf.\n\n{{cquote|Throw out your calf-idol, O Samaria! My anger burns against them. How long will they be incapable of purity? They are from Israel! This calf \u2013 a craftsman has made it; it is not God. It will be broken in pieces, that calf of Samaria. }}\n\n{{cquote|(Moses) said: \"Get thee gone! but thy (punishment) in this life will be that thou wilt say, 'touch me not'; ... Now look at thy god, of whom thou hast become a devoted worshipper: We will certainly (melt) it in a blazing fire and scatter it broadcast in the sea!\"([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]]  {{Quran-usc|20|97}}) }}\n\nIn the Quran, Moses' punishment that the Samari cannot be touched is the same as the modern Samaritan's punishment where no Jew was allowed to touch them because of their idolatry. In his commentary, [[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] claims that the Samari is not a Samaritan.\n\n===Miriam and Mary===\nIn Arabic, both the names ''Mary'' and ''Miriam'' are called ''Maryam''. Mary, the mother of [[Jesus]], is the only female to have her name mentioned in the Quran. While speaking about Mary, the mother of Jesus, the Quran also refers to her as the sister of Aaron (in verses {{cite quran|66|12|style=nosup|expand=no}} and {{cite quran|19|28|style=nosup|expand=no |e=30}}), who in the bible also had a sister Miriam. According to James K. Walker, \u201ccritics have noted that the Qur\u2019an appears to confuse Mary \u2026 in the New Testament with Miram of the Old Testament, who \u2026 lived some 1400 years earlier\u201d.<ref name=\"Walker-37\">{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=James K. |title=What the Quran Really Teaches About Jesus: Prophet of Allah or Savior of the ... |date=2011 |publisher=Harvest House |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qrFmDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA37&dq=quran+confuse+mary+and+miriam+in+the+bible?&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwis4JaqgtbkAhVTop4KHRPqCbYQ6AEwAHoECAAQAg#v=onepage&q=quran%20confuse%20mary%20and%20miriam%20in%20the%20bible%3F&f=false |accessdate=16 September 2019}}</ref> \n\nHowever, according to Muslim interpreters, this Aaron is different from the brother of Moses. It  was a tradition to give people the names of prophets and pious persons who lived before them as mentioned in the following hadeeth:\n \n<blockquote>Mughira b. Shu'ba reported: When I came to Najran, they (the Christians of Najran) asked me: You read\" O sister of Harun\" (i. e. Hadrat Maryam) in the Quran, whereas Moses was born much before Jesus. When I came back to Allah's Messenger (may peace be upon him) I asked him about that, whereupon he said: The (people of the old age) used to give names (to their persons) after the names of Apostles and pious persons who had gone before them. (Sheik Muslim \u2013 Adaaab Book)</blockquote>\n\n===Hannah and Hannah===\n{{further|Hannah (biblical figure)|Saint Anne}}\n\nIn the [[Books of Samuel]], [[Hannah (biblical figure)|Hannah]] is grateful that God gave her a son, [[Samuel]]. She dedicated him to God by letting him live with [[Eli (biblical figure)|Eli]] the prophet and priest.\n\nIn the Quran, Mary's mother is grateful to God for Mary and dedicates her to God. Mary then lives in the household of [[Zechariah (priest)|Zechariah]] the prophet.\n\nIn the Bible, Zechariah is also a priest. Mary's mother is unnamed in the Quran.\n<!-- review this, probably delete\n==Similar doctrine==\n\n===God===\nGod (''Allah'' in the Quran, [[Tetragrammaton|YHWH]] in the Bible) is the only creator of all things whose power and wisdom cannot be matched. Unlike [[Eastern religions]], God has a personhood with a consciousness. God demands humans to be moral. Acting morally and immorally both have great consequences. However, he is described by the Quran as unknowable, at least completely. This makes Allah more similar to the Dharmic \"Brahman\" than the Hebrew Yahweh.\n\n====Monotheism====\nThe Quran and Bible strongly agree that only One God exists and should be worshiped. In both books, idolatry is the greatest sin. Both Abraham in the Quran and [[Jeremiah]] in the Bible argue the logic of not worshiping a speechless idol whom a human creates, as the creator or someone with wisdom.\n\n====Fatalism====\nBoth books have had a controversy regarding elements of [[fatalism]] within them, the worldview that God determines everything and no real choice exists. The argument follows that if God knows everything that will happen, then the future is already determined and humans can only follow the predetermined route. A counter-argument is that if God is omniscient, then he can allow for fate as well as choice.\n\n===Ethics===\nHonesty and faithfulness are valued while idolatry and murder are condemned. Prayer and fasting<ref>{{quran-usc|2|183}}</ref> are pivotal.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nThe ethics of the Quran are more similar to the ethics of the Torah than the New Testament. Both recommend a pilgrimage to the holy city. Both condemn eating pork and some other foods. Adultery is severely punished. The Scriptures should be read or recited regularly. Prayers should be said facing Jerusalem, though the Quran later changed to face Mecca. Most of Islam's regulations are contained in the [[hadith]].\n\nThe New Testament is considered laxer (by some) in regard to actions but far stricter in regard to motivation and inward feelings. Jesus raises the standard, by saying that whoever lusts sexually in his heart is guilty of adultery, and whoever hates someone is guilty of murder.\n\n===Torah===\nThe Quran identifies the 'Taurat' as a revelation from God to Moses, not the Torah which is the set of the first five books of the Bible. The New Testament calls them the Torah of Moses, though the Torah itself does not give an author. According to the Quran and New Testament, the Gospel confirms the Torah.<ref>{{quran-usc|5|46}}</ref>\n\n===Word===\nBoth scriptures have a high veneration of the God's word, God's revelation to humankind. The Quran identifies the itself as the word of God; Muslims believe they were dictated by God. The Bible calls Jesus the [[Jesus Christ the Logos|Word of God]] because he is the full manifestation of God and the voice of God on earth.\n\n===Angels===\nAngels are God's supernatural agents who carry his messages.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be as the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become the biggest metal band of [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] and was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial point where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward joined the band. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. While Alvin was forming a band with Tarang, he already had in mind about these members who he got on board with Binit as the bassist and Dheeraj as the drummer for the band. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and Thunderstrock Festival (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj wasn't the founding members of the band was the very first drummer when the band started but within a year he decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first out-of-the-state show and became a spot where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting the stagnant rock & metal music festival called Thunderstrock. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing the stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nDheeraj wanted to join the band again and was considered into the band's line-up and eventually, the band had to part ways with Johnson who came in as the replacement of Dheeraj when he (Dheeraj) left the band in 2014. The band went onto participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at NIFFT Ranchi, Thundermarch at NIT Silchar and Avalanche of Srijan at IIT ISM Dhanbad. The band won the competitions at NIFFT Ranchi and IIT ISM Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at NIT Silchar. The same year the band headlined at the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nBut later in the year 2015, the band again drew into the confusion as to who will continue the band as the permanent drummer because Dheeraj wasn't able to continue with regular practice and shows. Also after parting ways with Johnson, they did not consider in approaching him once again. During this time, the band practised with various drummers but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who were in the line-up of Thunderstrock Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Tarang. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and John also agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of KIIT Bhubaneswar, Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of IIM Ahmedabad, Distortion - Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur, Rocktaves - Oasis of BITS Pilani,<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Waves - Searock of BITS Pilani (Goa campus), Till Deaf Do We Part - Pearl of BITS Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Resonance - Festember of NIT Trichy,<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity - Antaragni of IIT Kanpur, Decibelz - Xpressions of XIM Bhubaneswar and Thundermarch - Incandescene of NIT Silchar.

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain recognization in the music scene and has been appreciated by musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from Jamshedpur called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil the band did a couple of shows and participated in competitions of NIT Trichy and IIT Madras. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by Bangalore Open Air alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing more original songs by the band. The band also went to headline at music festivals in Jharkhand and eventually started gaining the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when started the work for that year's Thunderstrock Festival, he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work further in their debut album and give preference to booked shows.

The band was formed in 2012 in [[Ranchi]] by vocalist Tarang Kerketta and guitarist [[Alvin Rozario]], and has been based in [[Ranchi]] ever-since it's formation. The band has been the winners of numerous battle of band titles across their country and is known for their fast tempos, instrumental and aggressive style of playing. The band has performed twice as the finalists at Hornbill International Rock Contest of [[Hornbill Festival]] in [[Nagaland]] for the year 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=Musical route to national stage|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/jharkhand/musical-route-to-national-stage/cid/1342721|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> and 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nine bands to vie for Hornbill Rock Contest finale today|url=https://www.easternmirrornagaland.com/nine-bands-to-vie-for-hornbill-rock-contest-finale-today/|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Their drummer has also bagged the title of the 'Best Drummer' in the year 2017 at this festival and was felicitated by [[Uday Benegal]] from the [[Indus Creed]] which is a band considered to be as the pioneers of the Indian rock music.\n\nHailing from a small place quite unknown to the rest of the country, the band had to face discrimination and hardships in their path to fame. Their artistry and love for music guided them through tough times, on course to become the biggest metal band of [[East India]]. Highway 69 performs extensively all over the country and is evolving with a huge fan base. Currently, the band is working on its debut album.\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation and early years (2012\u20132013)===\n[[File:Highway 69 at BIT Mesra Deoghar campus during Utthaan 2012.jpg|thumb|Highway 69 after doing their first show together as a band at Utthaan fest of BIT Mesra (Deoghar campus) in October 2012.\n(From left: Binit Barla, Tarang Kerketta, [[Alvin Rozario]] and Dheeraj Edward.)]]\nHighway 69 was formed in [[Ranchi]], [[Jharkhand]] in mid-2012 with the founding members being Tarang Kerketta and [[Alvin Rozario]]. Tarang used to live in [[Jamshedpur]] and was the vocalist of a metal-band based in Jamshedpur called Atript while Alvin was the guitarist for a metal-band in Ranchi called Destiny. Both of them met for the first time during a local battle of the band competition in Ranchi. It is considered that it was the initial point where both of them decided on forming a band of their own.\n\nThe band Highway 69 was started with Tarang on the vocals and Alvin on the guitars, along with that two local musicians Binit Barla and Dheeraj Edward joined the band. Binit used to play bass for Alvin's show while Alvin and Dheeraj were bandmates in their metal band named Destiny. While Alvin was forming a band with Tarang, he already had in mind about these members who he got on board with Binit as the bassist and Dheeraj as the drummer for the band. Hence the line-up was formed and the band started to practice together and composed their first song called 'Disturbed' and covered other popular metal songs. They went on to participate in a battle of bands competition organized at [[Birla Institute of Technology (Deoghar)]] by Utthaan where the band won the competition along with that Alvin was awarded the best guitarist in the competition. As it was the year-end of 2012, then went on to do few local gigs in Ranchi and Jamshedpur. They also had a major achievement in their early years by winning the Wheels competition organized by TATA Steel in Jamshedpur.\n\n===''Dheeraj quits, Johnson joins the band'' and Thunderstrock Festival (2013-2014)===\nDheeraj wasn't the founding members of the band was the very first drummer when the band started but within a year he decided to quit the band citing difficulty in managing his time between the band and his higher studies.\n\n[[File:Highway 69 at IIM Bangalore during Unmaad 2014.jpg|thumb|left|Highway 69 performing at Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of IIM Bangalore]]\nDheeraj was replaced by Anugraha Sonal Johnson Mundu, a local musician who belonged to Alvin's neighbourhood. He joined the band and the band continued with him. With the new line-up, the band won the battle of bands competitions at [[St. Xavier's School, Ranchi]], [[National Institute of Foundry and Forge Technology]] Ranchi, made their appearance in the Avalanche of [[Srijan]] at [[Indian School of Mines, Dhanbad]] and in Rockolesseum of Unmaad, the cultural festival of [[IIM Bangalore]]. Performing in Bangalore became their very first out-of-the-state show and became a spot where the band got the exposure of various other bands and musicians who were the part of that fest. The band also performed at Detox, which was an initiative by the Government of Jharkhand to promote the local rock & metal music culture. They shared the stage with [[Demonic Resurrection]], [[Girish and The Chronicles]] and other local bands from the city.\n\nLater during mid-2014, Tarang Kerketta took the initiative of starting the stagnant rock & metal music festival called Thunderstrock. It was a charitable music festival started in 2008 with the initiative of promoting the local music scene as well as to donate the funds generated from it to the people in need. Tarang is generally credited in bringing the stagnant music festival back to life again in 2014 with giving the stage to the local bands like Death Note (now Reciprocal), Destiny (band in which Alvin used to play earlier), Error 404, Virus (the drummer of this band later joins Highway 69), Genesis, Highway 69 and Head Motif all the way from [[Darjeeling]], [[West Bengal]].\n\n===Replacement of drummers and winning competitions across India (2015-2018)===\n[[File:Tarang Kerketta, Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks, in 2015.jpg|thumb|Tarang Kerketta performing at Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1, in 2015]]\nDheeraj wanted to join the band again and was considered into the band's line-up and eventually, the band had to part ways with Johnson who came in as the replacement of Dheeraj when he (Dheeraj) left the band in 2014. The band went onto participating at i-Rock of Jinks-Pranav at NIFFT Ranchi, Thundermarch at NIT Silchar and Avalanche of Srijan at IIT ISM Dhanbad. The band won the competitions at NIFFT Ranchi and IIT ISM Dhanbad but couldn't secure any position at NIT Silchar. The same year the band headlined at the Pepsi MTV Indies - Ranchi Rocks: Chapter 1 which had the local bands of Ranchi along with that the headliner band from Bangalore named Live Banned.\n\n[[File:John receiving the Best Drummer award at Hornbill Festival in 2017..jpg|thumb|left|John receiving the Best Drummer award from Uday Benegal of Indus Creed (band) at Hornbill International Rock Contest in 2017.]]\nBut later in the year 2015, the band again drew into the confusion as to who will continue the band as the permanent drummer because Dheeraj wasn't able to continue with regular practice and shows. Also after parting ways with Johnson, they did not consider in approaching him once again. During this time, the band practised with various drummers but ultimately settled for John Raj Swami, who was a drummer for a local metal band called Virus who were in the line-up of Thunderstrock Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Bipolar Shadows all set to perform at Thunderstrock Festival in Ranchi|url=https://etchronicle.com/bipolar-shadows-all-set-to-perform-at-thunderstrock-festival-in-ranchi/|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> 2014, which is a festival initiated by Tarang. The band was already familiar with the playing style of John as they have shared the stage in various competitions and music festivals. The band went for practice with him and did a couple of few shows in Ranchi and were quite impressed with his playing style and John also agreed in joining the band as their permanent replacement for a drummer. The growing confusion over who'll continue the band as a drummer was finally sorted out. This gave the band it's ample time to practice and compose new songs. John came as a perfect replacement and has been with the band ever since. John is quite popular amongst the audience and other fellow musicians because of his aggressive style of drumming.\n\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | footer    = John and Alvin during their performance at Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur in 2016.

During the span of 2015\u20132018, the band went to participate in festivals across India of which they won the competitions like Fuego - KIIT Fest of KIIT Bhubaneswar, Blizzard of Rock - Chaos of IIM Ahmedabad, Distortion - Culfest of NIT Jamshedpur, Rocktaves - Oasis of BITS Pilani,<ref>{{cite web|title=BITS PILANI OASIS ROCK EVENT: ROCKTAVES|url=https://atkt.in/articles/bits-pilani-oasis-rock-event-rocktaves/|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Waves - Searock of BITS Pilani (Goa campus), Till Deaf Do We Part - Pearl of BITS Pilani (Hyderabad Campus), Resonance - Festember of NIT Trichy,<ref>{{cite web|title=METAL BAND HIGHWAY 69 WREAK HAVOC AT FESTEMBER|url=https://atkt.in/articles/highway-69-trichy/|website=The Pioneer|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref> Synchronicity - Antaragni of IIT Kanpur, Decibelz - Xpressions of XIM Bhubaneswar and Thundermarch - Incandescene of NIT Silchar.

During their span of covering all the major music competitions across India, the band started to attain recognization in the music scene and has been appreciated by musicians and promoters at the events.\n\nIn the mid-2017, there was some misunderstanding within the band due to which John was removed from the band and in his replacement, a drummer from Jamshedpur called Nikhil Dhanraj played the drums for Highway 69. With Nikhil the band did a couple of shows and participated in competitions of NIT Trichy and IIT Madras. Within a short span of John's absence, he was again included in the line-up. Also in the same year, the band was shortlisted for the first time in the Eastern-leg of Wacken Metal Battle organized by Bangalore Open Air alongside Astitiva (now Existence), Reciprocal from Ranchi and [[Chronic Xorn]] from Kolkata but due to the unavailability of their bassist; they did not go for the competition.\n\nAlong with the competitions, the timeline of 2015-2018 was also spent in composing more original songs by the band. The band also went to headline at music festivals in Jharkhand and eventually started gaining the pace of a popular upcoming metal band in their own state. Having spent a long-time in competitions, the year 2018 was marked as the last year to participate in competitions.\n\n=== Headlining & judging shows, upcoming debut album (2019\u2013present)===\n[[File:Highway 69 after completing their show at Jalpaiguri in 2019..jpg|thumb|left|A group photo with the audience after completing the show at Jalpaiguri in 2019.]]\nDuring the mid-2018, when started the work for that year's Thunderstrock Festival, he took on-board Tarun Paul Kachhap to manage the promotions of the festival and eventually he made Tarun as the manager for Highway 69. Also by the end of 2018 when the band was returning from Hornbill Festival<ref>{{cite web|title=Ranchi bands Highway 69 and Vikrit in the finals|url=https://www.bhaskar.com/jharkhand/ranchi/news/ranchi-rock-band-highway-69-and-distorted-to-the-final-of-contest-035603-3389144.html|website=Dainik Bhaskar}}</ref> in Nagaland they decided to give an end to participating in music competitions and work further in their debut album and give preference to booked shows.
