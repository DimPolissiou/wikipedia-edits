{"title_page": "History of broadcasting in Canada", "text_new": "Radio was introduced in Canada in the late 1890s, although initially transmissions were limited to the dot-and-dashes of [[Morse code]], and primarily used for point-to-point services, especially for maritime communication. The '''history of broadcasting in Canada''' dates to the early 1920s, as part of the worldwide development of radio stations sending information and entertainment programming to the general public. Television was introduced in the 1950s, and soon became the primary broadcasting service. \n\n==History==\n\nMajor themes in Canadian broadcasting history include:\n* development of the engineering technology\n* construction of stations and the building of networks\n* widespread purchase and use of radio and [[television sets]] by the public\n* debates regarding state versus private ownership of stations\n* financing of the broadcast media through the government, licence fees, and advertising\n* changing programming content, including concerns about American \"cultural imperialism\" via the airwaves, and its impact on Canadian identity\n* media's influence on shaping audience responses to music, sports and politics\n* role of the Qu\u00e9bec government and Francophone versus Anglophone cultural tastes and the role of other ethnic groups and First Nations\n* impact of the Internet and smartphones on traditional broadcasting media.<ref>Robert Armstrong, ''Broadcasting Policy in Canada'' (2013)</ref><ref>Marc Raboy, ''Missed Opportunities: The Story of Canada's Broadcasting Policy'' (1990)</ref>\n\n===Early radio development===\n\nFrom the late 1890s until 1913 there were few regulations covering radio communication in Canada. The earliest stations were only capable of transmitting Morse code; despite this limitation as early as May 1907 the Marconi station at Camperdown, Nova Scotia began broadcasting time signals on a regular schedule.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=nyp.33433111623926&view=1up&seq=62 \"The First Wireless Time Signal\"] by Captain J.

Similar to the law in force in Britain, this act required that operation of \"any radiotelegraph apparatus\" required a licence, issued by the Minister of the Naval Service.<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015064554697&view=1up&seq=211 \"Laws and Regulations\u2014Canada\"], ''The Year-Book of Wireless Telegraphy & Telephony'' (1914 edition), pages 131-132.</ref> This included members of the general public who only possessed a radio receiver and were not making transmissions, who were required to hold an \"Amateur Experimental Station\" licence,<ref>[https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.c2605161&view=1up&seq=1508 \"Regulations: 18.

This restriction remained in force until 1 May 1919.<ref>[https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ASeptember_1919_QST.djvu&page=26 \"Our Canadian Cousins\"] (correspondence from E. T.

There was no formal category of radio stations providing entertainment broadcasts intended for the general public until April 1922, so the earliest Canadian stations making broadcasts operated under a mixture of Experimental, Amateur, and governmental authorizations.\n\nInformation about the earliest experimental broadcasts is limited.

A major reallocation of U.S. stations on November 11, 1928 informally set aside six frequencies for exclusive Canadian use, but the country complained this was insufficient. In 1941, implementation of the [[North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement]] gave Canada some additional exclusive assignments, and the development of the FM band eventually eased the restrictions on the number of available broadcasting slots.\n\n===Canadian National Railway Radio: 1923\u201333===\n{{Main|CNR Radio}}\nThe [[Canadian National Railway]] Company (CNR) became interested in radio broadcasting in 1923, due in large part to the leadership of its president, [[Henry Worth Thornton|Sir Henry Thornton]]. That year it began equipping its trains with radio receivers to allow passengers to hear radio broadcasts. In 1924, CNR began building its own stations, and by 1928 it had created Canada's first national network, ''CNR Radio''<ref>[https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/canadas-first-network-cnr-radio \"Canada's First Network: CNR Radio\"], Canadian Communications Foundation (broadcasting-history.ca)</ref> (officially the [[Canadian National Railways Radio Department]]),<ref name=drama>[https://thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/english-language-radio-drama \"English-Language Radio Drama\"] by Howard Funk, ''The Canadian Encyclopedia'', February 7, 2006 (revised March 4, 2015) (thecanadianencyclopedia.ca)</ref><ref>[http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1901-1939.shtml CBC/Radio-Canada milestones (1901-1939)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113032124/http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/history/1901-1939.shtml |date=2008-01-13 }}, ''CBC/Radio-Canada Corporate Website'', accessed January 23, 2008</ref> developed, owned and operated by CNR to provide [[wiktionary:en route|en route]] entertainment and information for its passengers.<ref name=arch>[https://hermis.alberta.ca/paa/Details.aspx?ObjectID=PR0101&dv=True&deptID=1 Canadian National Railway Company fonds], Provincial Archives of Alberta (alberta.ca)</ref>  As broadcasts could be received by anyone living in the coverage area of station transmitters, the network provided radio programming to Canadians from the Pacific coast at Vancouver to the Atlantic coast at Halifax.\n\nDuring its nine-year existence, CNR Radio provided music, sports, information and drama programming to Canadians. Programs were produced in English, French and occasionally in some [[First Nations]] languages, and distributed nationwide through the railway's own telegraph lines and through rented airtime on private radio stations. However, political and competitive pressure forced CNR Radio to close, with many of its assets and personnel migrating to a new government-operated agency, the [[Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission]] (CRBC).\n\nRival [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) had applied for licences in January 1930 to compete with the CNR Radio service, but the onset of the [[Great Depression]] meant that CPR did not end up pursuing these applications, but instead operated a [[phantom station]] in Toronto known as \"CPRY\"; the call letters standing for \"Canadian Pacific Royal York\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html|title=Presenting: A Behind-The-Scenes Look At The Historic Royal York Hotel&nbsp;\u2013 One of Toronto's Crown Jewels (part I)|publisher=Advisor.d6cn.com|date=30 August 2007|first=Susanne|last=Pacher|accessdate=29 September 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208205810/http://advisor.d6cn.com/Travel/ttttqc/Presenting_A_Behind_The_Scenes_Look_At_The_Historic_Royal_York_Hotel_One_Of_Toronto_s_Crown_Jewels_part_I.html|archivedate=8 December 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.broadcasting-history.ca/radio-broadcast-fulfilled-promise|title=The Radio Broadcast that Fulfilled the Promise|accessdate=25 September 2019|publisher=Canadian Communication Foundation (broadcasting-history.ca)}}</ref> While a network of affiliates carried the CPR radio network's broadcasts in the first half of the 1930s, the takeover of CNR's Radio service by the CRBC  removed CPR's need to have a network for competitive reasons, and it was discontinued in 1935.\n\n===The Aird Commission===\n{{Main|Royal Commission on Radio Broadcasting}}\n\nA number of problems arose during the 1920s, causing debates on how broadcasting should be managed.

The Aird Report recommended the creation of a [[public broadcasting]] system.\n\n==Public broadcasting==\nThe 1930 election of a [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] government, led by [[R.B.

At its creation, Bennett spoke of the need for public control of radio saying:\n: \"This country must be assured of complete Canadian control of broadcasting from Canadian sources. Without such control, broadcasting can never be the agency by which national consciousness may be fostered and sustained and national unity still further strengthened.\"<ref name=jackson>John D.

The CBC was controlled by the national government, and funded largely by taxes (licence fees) collected from radio sets owners. The CBC took over the regulatory role of the Radio Branch, and focused most of its attention on providing programming for a national network. However, private stations continued to exist, which were allowed to rebroadcast CBC programs.<ref>Gerald Hallowell, editor, ''The Oxford Companion to Canadian History'' (2004) pp 90-91</ref>\n\n==French-language services==\nThe CBC set up a French-language network in Quebec and adjacent Francophone areas. Although the French-language service had little competition from American stations, it proved quite conservative in technology and programming. It was closely aligned with powerful newspaper and church interests and was seen as a propaganda forum for the traditional elites of Quebec. It did not promote separatism or a sense of Qu\u00e9bec nationalism.<ref>Mary Vipond, \"One Network or Two?

There is no [[Canadian content]] requirement for talk radio, or \"spoken word,\" programming, unless the individual station's license expressly stipulates such a requirement; most do not. (In Canada, prospective radio stations may propose certain restrictions on their license in order to gain favour with the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] and have an easier time obtaining a license.)<ref>Andreas Krebs, \"Reproducing colonialism: Subject formation and talk radio in English Canada.\" ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' 44#2 (2011): 317-339.</ref>\n\nThe only nationally syndicated, politically oriented weekday talk radio show in Canada is ''Adler On Line'', hosted by [[Charles Adler (broadcaster)|Charles Adler]] and heard on eleven stations across the country. Until 2006, [[Peter Warren (radio)|Peter Warren's]] ''[[Warren on the Weekend]]'' was heard Saturdays and Sundays. Both programs are or were distributed by the [[Corus Entertainment|Corus Radio Network]] and, coincidentally, both hosts had hosted different morning call-in programs in the same time slot on [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]'s [[CJOB]] 680 before they became nationally syndicated (Adler's show still originates from CJOB and retained its original title, while Warren was based in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].) Prior to ''Adler On Line'', Corus had syndicated ''Rutherford'', hosted by conservative [[Dave Rutherford]] and originating from its [[Calgary]] station, [[CHQR|QR77]]. ''Rutherford'' is no longer syndicated nationally but continues to air in Calgary, [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], and [[London, Ontario|London]].<ref>Paul Saurette and Shane Gunster. \"Ears wide shut: Epistemological populism, argutainment and Canadian conservative talk radio.\" ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' 44#1 (2011): 195-218.</ref>\n\nOther Canadian talk radio programs which have been syndicated to different markets include:\n* ''The [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] Show'' airs on Sunday nights on stations in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]].\n* ''The Home Discovery Show'', a call-in home renovation program hosted by Shell Busey.\n* ''[[Live Audio Wrestling]]''; a 2-hour show focusing on [[mixed martial arts]] and [[professional wrestling]], distributed on [[Live Audio Wrestling#Fight Network Radio|Fight Network Radio]].\n* ''Love and Romance'', a [[Personal relationship|relationship]] advice program hosted by Sue McGarvie.\n* ''[[Prime Time Sports]]'', a [[sports radio|sports talk]] program hosted by [[Bob McCown]]. A three-hour program originating from [[CJCL|The Fan 590]], usually only the third hour is broadcast nationally.\n* ''Renovations Cross Canada'', a weekend program about home renovations hosted by Ren Molnar. It is the most widely distributed talk radio program in Canada.\n* ''The Roy Green Show'', a political and entertainment based show hosted by Roy Green that airs on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, primarily on the Corus Radio Network.\n* ''[[The 'X' Zone]]'', a nightly show about [[paranormal]] topics hosted by Rob McConnell. It is also syndicated throughout the United States.\n\nThe two largest talk radio networks in Canada are the publicly owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[English language]] [[CBC Radio One]] and [[French language]] [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]]. These stations typically produce their own local morning and afternoon programs and regional noon hour programs to go along with the network programming that is aired during the rest of the day. Both networks are commercial-free. CBC Radio One's flagship national talk program is the weekend ''[[Cross Country Checkup]]'', which has been broadcast since 1965.\n\n[[CFRA]] (580 AM) in Ottawa (formerly part of the [[CHUM Limited|CHUM network]], which is now part of CTV) has a large and dedicated listening audience. The station is heard throughout the Ottawa valley and on the Internet. Several key programs focus on local political and world issues. Christina Sgro offers a bit of both worlds on her show, ''Christina's Corner'', which has been gaining popularity since its inception in 2010.\n\nPrivately owned talk radio syndication networks in Canada are generally formed for the purposes of sharing programs across a group of stations with common ownership, although some are formed to distribute their one or two talk radio programs to a number of stations regardless of ownership. The largest of these is the [[Corus Entertainment|Corus]] Radio Network. [[TSN Radio]], the successor to the long-defunct [[The Team (radio network)|the Team]], is one of the newest national networks in Canada, with operations in three of its major markets, and has room for expansion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of broadcasting]]\n* [[Canadian Communications Foundation]]\n* [[CNR Radio]], The radio network operated by Canadian National Railway 1923-33\n* [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ali, Christopher. \"A broadcast system in whose interest?

The CBC was controlled by the national government, and funded largely by taxes (licence fees) collected from radio sets owners. The CBC took over the regulatory role of the Radio Branch, and focused most of its attention on providing programming for a national network.

Both programs are or were distributed by the [[Corus Entertainment|Corus Radio Network]] and, coincidentally, both hosts had hosted different morning call-in programs in the same time slot on [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]'s [[CJOB]] 680 before they became nationally syndicated (Adler's show still originates from CJOB and retained its original title, while Warren was based in [[Victoria, British Columbia]].) Prior to ''Adler On Line'', Corus had syndicated ''Rutherford'', hosted by conservative [[Dave Rutherford]] and originating from its [[Calgary]] station, [[CHQR|QR77]]. ''Rutherford'' is no longer syndicated nationally but continues to air in Calgary, [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]], and [[London, Ontario|London]].<ref>Paul Saurette and Shane Gunster. \"Ears wide shut: Epistemological populism, argutainment and Canadian conservative talk radio.\" ''Canadian Journal of Political Science'' 44#1 (2011): 195-218.</ref>\n\nOther Canadian talk radio programs which have been syndicated to different markets include:\n* ''The [[George Stroumboulopoulos]] Show'' airs on Sunday nights on stations in [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]].\n* ''The Home Discovery Show'', a call-in home renovation program hosted by Shell Busey.\n* ''[[Live Audio Wrestling]]''; a 2-hour show focusing on [[mixed martial arts]] and [[professional wrestling]], distributed on [[Live Audio Wrestling#Fight Network Radio|Fight Network Radio]].\n* ''Love and Romance'', a [[Personal relationship|relationship]] advice program hosted by Sue McGarvie.\n* ''[[Prime Time Sports]]'', a [[sports radio|sports talk]] program hosted by [[Bob McCown]]. A three-hour program originating from [[CJCL|The Fan 590]], usually only the third hour is broadcast nationally.\n* ''Renovations Cross Canada'', a weekend program about home renovations hosted by Ren Molnar. It is the most widely distributed talk radio program in Canada.\n* ''The Roy Green Show'', a political and entertainment based show hosted by Roy Green that airs on Saturday and Sunday afternoons, primarily on the Corus Radio Network.\n* ''[[The 'X' Zone]]'', a nightly show about [[paranormal]] topics hosted by Rob McConnell. It is also syndicated throughout the United States.\n\nThe two largest talk radio networks in Canada are the publicly owned [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]'s [[English language]] [[CBC Radio One]] and [[French language]] [[Ici Radio-Canada Premi\u00e8re]]. These stations typically produce their own local morning and afternoon programs and regional noon hour programs to go along with the network programming that is aired during the rest of the day. Both networks are commercial-free. CBC Radio One's flagship national talk program is the weekend ''[[Cross Country Checkup]]'', which has been broadcast since 1965.\n\n[[CFRA]] (580 AM) in Ottawa (formerly part of the [[CHUM Limited|CHUM network]], which is now part of CTV) has a large and dedicated listening audience. The station is heard throughout the Ottawa valley and on the Internet. Several key programs focus on local political and world issues. Christina Sgro offers a bit of both worlds on her show, ''Christina's Corner'', which has been gaining popularity since its inception in 2010.\n\nPrivately owned talk radio syndication networks in Canada are generally formed for the purposes of sharing programs across a group of stations with common ownership, although some are formed to distribute their one or two talk radio programs to a number of stations regardless of ownership. The largest of these is the [[Corus Entertainment|Corus]] Radio Network. [[TSN Radio]], the successor to the long-defunct [[The Team (radio network)|the Team]], is one of the newest national networks in Canada, with operations in three of its major markets, and has room for expansion.\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of broadcasting]]\n* [[Canadian Communications Foundation]]\n* [[CNR Radio]], The radio network operated by Canadian National Railway 1923-33\n* [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]]\n\n==Notes and references==\n\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ali, Christopher. \"A broadcast system in whose interest?

It is the body primarily responsible for [[blood donation]] and related services in Australia.  Australian Red Cross Blood Service employs around 3,700 employees across scientific, medical and support services, processing over half a million non-remunerated blood donors each year.\n\nThe Blood Service is funded by the state and federal governments of Australia and is a division of Australian Red Cross.

[[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]'s Blood Transfusion Service was founded in 1929, and by 1941 each state had its own Organ Transfusion Service. Also in 1941, the National Emergency Blood Transfusion Service (later the National Blood Transfusion Committee) was formed to coordinate the state groups. In 1945, the Red Cross took over blood and serum preparation units established by the [[Australian Army]].\n\nIn 1995, a government report recommended the foundation of a separate national structure, and the ARCBS was formed in 1996, encompassing the old state and territory blood donation/transfusion services.\n\n==Relationship with CSL==\nAustralian Red Cross Lifeblood and its predecessors had a long-standing relationship with the [[CSL Limited|Commonwealth Serum Laboratories]] (CSL), a government medical body founded in 1916. The Red Cross supplied CSL with donated blood for use in research and manufacture of medical products (e.g. serum for transfusion).\n\nIn 1994, CSL was privatised, becoming CSL Limited. The ARCBS continued to supply CSL with donated blood.\n\n==Infectious diseases==\nBlood donated in Australia has been tested for [[Hepatitis B]] since 1972, [[HIV]]-1 since 1985, [[Hepatitis C]] since 1990, HIV-2 since 1992/3, and [[Human T-lymphotropic virus|HTLV-1]] since 1993.\n\nAs with other blood transfusion services, the ARCBS has had to strike a balance between protecting blood recipients against infection, and accepting enough donors to maintain an adequate supply of blood. This has led to debate over which categories of potential donors should be excluded. For example, to protect against [[Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease|CJD]], the ARCBS now refuses donations from anybody who lived in the [[United Kingdom]] for a total of six months or more between 1980 and 1996.\n\nIn 2003, a federal government report found that despite the introduction of Hepatitis C screening from February 1990, infected donors were told to keep donating until July of that same year; a total of 20,000 people were estimated to have been infected with Hepatitis C via blood products. Some infected blood was given to CSL and may have been used in thousands of CSL products, although it has not been shown that any of these products caused infection in the recipients.<ref>http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/05/14/1052885298025.html</ref>\n\nThe service has a policy of barring [[Men who have sex with men|men who have had sex with men (MSM)]] during the previous twelve months from donating blood (an earlier policy had excluded any men who had had sex with other men since 1980, regardless of time elapsed).

These setbacks, along with the deep [[Late 1980s recession|recession of the late 1980s and early 1990s]] forced Mulroney to resign in 1993. He was replaced, albeit only briefly from June to November 1993, by [[Kim Campbell]], Canada's first, and so far only female Prime Minister.\n\n[[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] became prime minister in the [[1993 Canadian federal election|1993 election]], pledging to repeal the GST, although this proved unfeasible due to the economic circumstances at the time (or, apparently, any time during his prime ministership, showing the new source of income was needed, as the outgoing Progressive Conservative party had claimed). {{POV statement|date=December 2014}}  By 1995, however, Canada had eliminated the federal deficit, becoming the only [[G7]] country to have a budget surplus.\n\nSome of the problems faced by the Chr\u00e9tien government included the debate over the universal health care system, as well as military spending, which Chr\u00e9tien's government decreased significantly throughout its term. Canada did not play as large a role in United Nations peacekeeping as it once had, and Chr\u00e9tien faced some criticism for not participating in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], most notably from [[Leader of the Official Opposition (Canada)|Opposition Leader]] [[Stephen Harper]] and the [[United States government]].  However, with the mounting criticisms about the false pretences for that war and the United States' troubled occupation of Iraq, Chr\u00e9tien was hailed for keeping the nation out of the affair. The value of the [[Canadian dollar]] was greatly weakened during Chr\u00e9tien's time as Prime Minister, dropping as low at 67 cents; although in 2003, it regained about 20% of its value during the year due to the declining economic situation in the United States\u2014such a dramatic climb that industry leaders worried that the high currency would harm exports.\n\n===The Turbot War===\n{{Main|Turbot War}}\n\nThe \"Turbot War\" of 1990 was an international fishing dispute between Canada and the [[European Union]] which ended in the Canadian [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada|Department of Fisheries and Oceans]] boarding a Spanish fishing trawler, the ''Estai'', in [[international waters]] and arresting its crew.  Canada claimed that European Union factory [[fishing trawlers]] were illegally overfishing the nose and tail of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], just outside Canada's declared 200 nautical mile (370&nbsp;km) [[Exclusive Economic Zone]] (EEZ).<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/01/11/estai-lawsuit050111.html Turbot trawler case resurfaces in Federal Court], CBC News, January 11, 2005</ref>\n\nThe Spanish ship's crew had been using a net with a mesh size that was smaller than permitted (larger mesh sizes permit juvenile fish to escape and grow).

The federal ''[[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' and the provincial ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]'' favoured separation from Canada. Federalists rallied to keep Quebec as part of Canada and claimed the referendum question (\"Do you agree that Quebec should become sovereign after having made a formal offer to Canada for a new economic and political partnership within the scope of the bill respecting the future of Quebec and of the agreement signed on June 12, 1995?\") was vague and confusing. After large campaigns from both the \"'''oui''\" and \"''non''\" sides, the referendum was defeated by the narrowest of margins: a victory for those opposed to secession, with 50.58% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Qu\u00e9bec Referendum (1995)|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-referendum-1995/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=December 20, 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Creation of Nunavut===\n[[Image:Nunavut, Canada.svg|thumb|right|Nunavut on the map of Canada]]\nIn April 1982, a majority of [[Northwest Territories]] residents voted in favour of a division of the area, and the federal government gave a conditional agreement seven months later. After a long series of land claim negotiations between the [[Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami|Inuit Tapirisat of Canada]] and the federal government (begun earlier in 1976), an agreement was reached in September 1992. In June 1993, the ''[[Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act]]'' and the ''[[Nunavut Act]]''<ref>{{cite web|author1=Justice Canada|title=Nunavut Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-28.6/index.html|accessdate=December 19, 2014|date=1993}}</ref> were passed by the Canadian Parliament, and the transition to the new territory of [[Nunavut]] was completed on April 1, 1999.\n\n===Peacekeeping===\nAfter the end of the [[Cold War]], the frequency of international [[peacekeeping]] missions and [[humanitarian intervention]]s grew dramatically and Canadian participation grew along with it. In the 1990s, Canadians were active in [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions in [[United Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara|Western Sahara]], [[United Nations Transitional Authority in Cambodia|Cambodia]], [[United Nations Protection Force|the former Yugoslavia]], [[United Nations Mission in Haiti|Haiti]], [[International Force for East Timor|East Timor]] and [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone|Sierra Leone]]. During the [[Unified Task Force|US-led humanitarian mission]] to [[Somalia]] in 1993, Canadian soldiers tortured a Somali teenager to death, leading to the [[Somalia Affair]]. Following an inquiry, the elite [[The Canadian Airborne Regiment|Canadian Airborne Regiment]] was disbanded and the reputation of the Canadian Forces suffered within Canada.\n{{See also|List of Canadian Peacekeeping Missions}}\n\n==The Harper governments==\nFollowing the resignation of Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien|Chr\u00e9tien]] at the end of 2003, Canadian Auditor General Sheila Fraser released a report in February 2004 which revealed that $100 million was mishandled by government officials in the purchasing of advertisements under the Chr\u00e9tien government.<ref>{{cite web|last1=McDermott|first1=Vincent|title=Timeline: The many revelations of Sheila Fraser, Auditor General|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2010/10/26/timeline-the-many-revelations-of-sheila-fraser-auditor-general/|website=National Post|accessdate=December 26, 2014|date=October 26, 2010}}</ref> The opposition was quick to make charges of corruption in what become known as the [[Sponsorship Scandal]].\n\nOwing in large part to the scandal, the Liberal Party (by this time, led by [[Paul Martin]]) lost its majority in the [[2004 Canadian federal election|2004 election]], but was able to form a [[minority government]]. The [[38th Canadian Parliament]] successfully passed the ''[[Civil Marriage Act]]'', legalizing [[same-sex marriage in Canada]], despite the opposition of the newly formed [[Conservative Party of Canada]].  Ultimately, the Liberals fell to a [[motion of no confidence]] in November 2005, leading to another election after only two years.\n\n[[Stephen Harper]]'s Conservatives were able to secure minority governments in the [[2006 Canadian federal election|2006]] and [[2008 Canadian federal election|2008 federal elections]]. In December 2008, a [[2008\u20132009 Canadian parliamentary dispute|parliamentary dispute began]] when the Liberal leader [[St\u00e9phane Dion]] and the [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] leader [[Jack Layton]] announced an agreement to form a [[coalition government]] with the support of the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] if they were successful in ousting the Conservative minority government in a confidence vote. [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Micha\u00eblle Jean]], however, granted the Conservatives' request to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue parliament]] until January 26, 2009, thereby avoiding the confidence vote.\n\nThe succession of minority governments ended on May 2, 2011 when Stephen Harper and his Conservative party won the [[41st Canadian federal election]] with a majority of seats (166 of a total of 308 seats) over Jack Layton's New Democratic Party (which formed the official opposition, with 103 seats, after winning all but four of the seats formerly held by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Quebec and making gains elsewhere in Canada) while the Liberals under [[Michael Ignatieff]] finished third for the first time in that party's history, with 34 seats.\n\n== The Trudeau government ==\nOn October 19, 2015, [[2015 Canadian federal election|Canada's 42nd general federal election]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/how-the-trudeau-liberals-won-a-majority-in-the-2015-federalelection/article27048562/|title=How the Trudeau Liberals won a majority in the 2015 federal election|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> was held.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-numbers-1.3281210|title=How new voters tipped the scales for Liberals|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> The Liberal Party won 39.5% of the popular vote and 184 seats in the House of Commons, with [[Justin Trudeau]] elected Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-numbers-1.3281210|title=How new voters tipped the scales for Liberals|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>{{Portal|History|Canada}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Chapnick, Adam, and Christopher J.

[[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Micha\u00eblle Jean]], however, granted the Conservatives' request to [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogue parliament]] until January 26, 2009, thereby avoiding the confidence vote.\n\nThe succession of minority governments ended on May 2, 2011 when Stephen Harper and his Conservative party won the [[41st Canadian federal election]] with a majority of seats (166 of a total of 308 seats) over Jack Layton's New Democratic Party (which formed the official opposition, with 103 seats, after winning all but four of the seats formerly held by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois in Quebec and making gains elsewhere in Canada) while the Liberals under [[Michael Ignatieff]] finished third for the first time in that party's history, with 34 seats.\n\n== The Trudeau government ==\nOn October 19, 2015, [[2015 Canadian federal election|Canada's 42nd general federal election]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/how-the-trudeau-liberals-won-a-majority-in-the-2015-federalelection/article27048562/|title=How the Trudeau Liberals won a majority in the 2015 federal election|website=The Globe and Mail|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> was held.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-numbers-1.3281210|title=How new voters tipped the scales for Liberals|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> The Liberal Party won 39.5% of the popular vote and 184 seats in the House of Commons, with [[Justin Trudeau]] elected Prime Minister.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-numbers-1.3281210|title=How new voters tipped the scales for Liberals|website=www.cbc.ca|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref>{{Portal|History|Canada}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Chapnick, Adam, and Christopher J.

St. Laurent succeeded in extending the welfare state, and helped bring [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] into Confederation as Canada's tenth province in 1949.\n\n== Newfoundland joins the country ==\n{{Main|Newfoundland referendums, 1948}}\nFollowing the Second World War, in 1946, an election was held for the [[Newfoundland National Convention]] to decide the future of the independent [[Dominion of Newfoundland]]. The Convention voted to hold a referendum to decide between continuing the direct rule of the [[Commission of Government]] or restoring [[responsible government]]. [[Joseph R. Smallwood]], the leader of the confederates, moved that a third option of confederation with Canada should be included. Although his motion was defeated by the convention, Smallwood did not give up, but instead gathered more than 5000 petitions from the people within a fortnight which he sent to London through the Governor. The United Kingdom, insisting that it would not give Newfoundland any further financial assistance, added a third option of having Newfoundland join Canada to the ballot.\n\n[[File:Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada.svg|thumb|left|Newfoundland and Labrador.]]\n\nAfter much debate, an initial referendum was held on June 3, 1948 to decide between continuing with the Commission of Government, reverting to [[dominion]] status, or joining [[Canadian Confederation]]. The referendum was fought by three parties, Smallwood's [[Confederate Association]] campaigned for the Confederation option while the anti-Confederation campaign was split amongst [[Peter Cashin]]'s [[Responsible Government League]] and [[Chesley Crosbie]]'s [[Party for Economic Union with the United States]], both of which called for a vote for [[responsible government]]. No party advocated continuing the Commission of Government.\n\nThe result was inconclusive, with 44.6% supporting the restoration of dominion status, 41.1% for confederation with Canada, and 14.3% for continuing the Commission of Government. Between the first and second referendums, rumours had it that Catholic bishops were using their religious influence to alter the outcome of the votes. The [[Orange Institution|Orange Order]] was incensed and called on all its members to vote for confederation, as the Catholics voted for responsible government. The Protestants of Newfoundland outnumbered the Catholics at a ratio of 2:1. This was believed to have greatly influenced the outcome of the second referendum. A second referendum on July 22, 1948, which asked Newfoundlanders to choose between confederation and dominion status, was decided by a vote of 52% to 48% for confederation with Canada. Newfoundland joined Canada on March 31, 1949.\n\nNot everyone was satisfied with the results, however. [[Peter Cashin]], an outspoken anti-Confederate, questioned the validity of the votes. He claimed that it was the ''unholy union between London and Ottawa'' that brought about confederation.\n\n== Cold War ==\n{{Main|Canada in the Cold War}}\n[[File:Igor Gouzenko hooded.jpg|thumb|Gouzenko wearing his white hood for anonymity]]\nMeanwhile, Canadian foreign relations were beginning to focus on the United States, which had eclipsed Britain as a world power. During World War II, Canada was a minor partner in the alliance between the United States and Britain, and the US had pledged to help defend Canada if necessary. Canada was one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, and also of the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in 1949, but was largely overshadowed in world affairs by the United States. Canada remained a close ally of the United States throughout the [[Cold War]].\n\nWhen [[Igor Gouzenko]], a [[cipher]] clerk for the [[Embassy of the Russian Federation in Canada|Soviet Embassy to Canada]] in [[Ottawa]], defected in 1945, fears of [[History of Soviet espionage|Soviet espionage]] led to a [[red scare]] and the arrest and conviction of 18 people, including [[Labor-Progressive Party]] (Communist) [[House of Commons of Canada|Member of Parliament]] [[Fred Rose (politician)|Fred Rose]].\n\n[[File:Avro Arrow rollout.jpg|thumb|left|The controversial Avro Arrow.]]\n\nCanada participated, under the [[United Nations]], in the [[Canada in the Korean War|Korean War]]. Minister of External Affairs in St. Laurent's [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], [[Lester Bowles Pearson]], was involved in the diplomatic side of the conflict and became more active in diplomacy with the United Nations after the war ended. In 1956 Pearson suggested a solution to the [[Suez Crisis]] - the creation of an international peacekeeping force. For his efforts, Pearson won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1957.\n\nSt. Laurent attempted to create a new, highly advanced [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]], the [[Avro Arrow]]. He succeeded in making the fastest aircraft in history up to this point, and still to this day remains close to the level of modern aircraft. However, this controversial aircraft was cancelled by St. Laurent's successor, John George Diefenbaker, in 1959, although Diefenbaker did help establish a [[missile defence system]] with the United States, [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]].\n\nThere were voices on both left and right that warned against being too close to the United States. Few Canadians listened before 1957. Instead, there was wide consensus on foreign and defence policies 1948 to 1957.  Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref>\n\n==High Arctic relocation==\n{{Main|High Arctic relocation}}\nEfforts to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War, i.e. the area's strategic geopolitical position, were part of the reasons that led the federal government to forcibly relocate [[Inuit]] from [[Nunavik|northern Quebec]] to barren [[Cornwallis Island, Nunavut]]. The first group of people were relocated in 1953 from [[Inukjuak, Quebec]] (then known as Port Harrison ) and from [[Pond Inlet, Nunavut]]. They were promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |website=Grise Fiord |title=History |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}</ref> They also had to endure weeks of 24-hour darkness during the winter, and 24-hour sunlight during the summer, something that does not occur in northern Quebec.  They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay.  Eventually, the Inuit learned the local [[beluga whale]] migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of {{convert|18,000|km2}} each year.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGrath |first=Melanie |title=The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival in the High Arctic |publisher=Alfred A.

Minister of External Affairs in St. Laurent's [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], [[Lester Bowles Pearson]], was involved in the diplomatic side of the conflict and became more active in diplomacy with the United Nations after the war ended. In 1956 Pearson suggested a solution to the [[Suez Crisis]] - the creation of an international peacekeeping force. For his efforts, Pearson won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1957.\n\nSt. Laurent attempted to create a new, highly advanced [[fighter aircraft|jet fighter]], the [[Avro Arrow]]. He succeeded in making the fastest aircraft in history up to this point, and still to this day remains close to the level of modern aircraft. However, this controversial aircraft was cancelled by St. Laurent's successor, John George Diefenbaker, in 1959, although Diefenbaker did help establish a [[missile defence system]] with the United States, [[North American Aerospace Defense Command|NORAD]].\n\nThere were voices on both left and right that warned against being too close to the United States. Few Canadians listened before 1957. Instead, there was wide consensus on foreign and defence policies 1948 to 1957.  Bothwell, Drummond and English state:\n:That support was remarkably uniform geographically and racially, both coast to coast and among French and English. From the CCF on the left to the Social Credit on the right, the political parties agreed that NATO was a good thing, and communism a bad thing, that a close association with Europe was desirable, and that the Commonwealth embodied a glorious past.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Bothwell|author2=Ian M.

By 1957 the Suez crisis alienated Canada from both Britain and France; politicians distrusted American leadership, businessmen questioned American financial investments; and intellectuals ridiculed the values of American television and Hollywood offerings that all Canadians watched. \"Public support for Canada's foreign policy big came unstuck. Foreign-policy, from being a winning issue for the Liberals, was fast becoming a losing one.\"<ref>Bothwell et al., p. 131</ref>\n\n==High Arctic relocation==\n{{Main|High Arctic relocation}}\nEfforts to assert sovereignty in the High Arctic during the Cold War, i.e. the area's strategic geopolitical position, were part of the reasons that led the federal government to forcibly relocate [[Inuit]] from [[Nunavik|northern Quebec]] to barren [[Cornwallis Island, Nunavut]]. The first group of people were relocated in 1953 from [[Inukjuak, Quebec]] (then known as Port Harrison ) and from [[Pond Inlet, Nunavut]]. They were promised homes and game to hunt, but the relocated people discovered no buildings and very little familiar wildlife.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |website=Grise Fiord |title=History |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228115824/http://www.grisefiord.ca/eng/history.html |archivedate=December 28, 2008 }}</ref> They also had to endure weeks of 24-hour darkness during the winter, and 24-hour sunlight during the summer, something that does not occur in northern Quebec.  They were told that they would be returned home after a year if they wished, but this offer was later withdrawn as it would damage Canada's claims to sovereignty in the area and the Inuit were forced to stay.  Eventually, the Inuit learned the local [[beluga whale]] migration routes and were able to survive in the area, hunting over a range of {{convert|18,000|km2}} each year.<ref>{{cite book |last=McGrath |first=Melanie |title=The Long Exile: A Tale of Inuit Betrayal and Survival in the High Arctic |publisher=Alfred A.
