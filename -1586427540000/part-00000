The result stands alone as the record home win in the competition's history and the joint biggest win either home or away. The two teams went into the match at opposite ends of the table; Manchester United were second, while Ipswich Town were second from last. In the corresponding fixture at Ipswich's [[Portman Road]] ground earlier in the season, they had beaten United 3\u20132. Manchester United were missing [[Eric Cantona]], their French international [[Forward (association football)|forward]] who was serving a nine-month suspension, and their attacking partnership of [[Andy Cole]] and [[Mark Hughes]] was not well regarded. \n\nPlaying in front of the highest attendance in the league to that point in the season, United scored three times in the first half; [[Roy Keane]] opened the scoring, before Cole added two more.

[[Manchester]], on 4 March 1995 as part of the [[1994\u201395 FA Premier League]] finished in a 9\u20130 victory for Manchester United.  The result stands alone as the record home win in the competition's history and the joint biggest win either home or away. The two teams went into the match at opposite ends of the table; Manchester United were second, while Ipswich Town were second from last. In the corresponding fixture at Ipswich's [[Portman Road]] ground earlier in the season, they had beaten United 3\u20132. Manchester United were missing [[Eric Cantona]], their French international [[Forward (association football)|forward]] who was serving a nine-month suspension, and their attacking partnership of [[Andy Cole]] and [[Mark Hughes]] was not well regarded. \n\nPlaying in front of the highest attendance in the league to that point in the season, United scored three times in the first half; [[Roy Keane]] opened the scoring, before Cole added two more. In the second half, United scored four times in the first twenty minutes; Cole scored his third and fourth, while Hughes also scored two. [[Paul Ince]] scored United's eighth with a [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] into an empty net while Ipswich's goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] was arguing with the referee, before Cole scored a Premier League-record fifth goal, United's ninth, in the 89th minute. Ipswich finished the season in last place and were [[Promotion and relegation|relegated]] that season while Manchester United were second, one point behind champions [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were the reigning [[Premier League]] champions, having won the [[1993\u201394 FA Premier League|1993\u201394 title]] by eight points ahead of [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.soccerbase.com/tournaments/tournament.sd?tourn_id=120 |publisher=Racing Post |work=Soccerbase |title=Premiership 1993/94 |accessdate=14 April 2011 }}</ref> However, they had been knocked out of the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League]] in the [[1994\u201395 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]],<ref name=\"cole-transfer\">{{cite news |first=David |last=Lacey |title=Ferguson invests \u00a37 million in Cole |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/47000426/ |page=18 |work=The Guardian |via=Newspapers.com |date=11 January 1995 }}</ref> and were trailing Blackburn by three points at the top of the table going into this match.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\">{{cite web |url=https://www.11v11.com/league-tables/premier-league/03-march-1995/ |title=Historic league table generator \u2013 Premier League table after close of play on 03 March 1995 |website=11v11.com |publisher=AFS Enterprises |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> In response to their elimination from European competition, and their need for a goal-scorer, they signed [[Andy Cole]] from [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] for a British record fee of \u00a37&nbsp;million in January 1995.<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>{{efn|The transfer for Cole was \u00a36&nbsp;million, plus the \u00a31&nbsp;million-rated [[Keith Gillespie]].<ref name=\"cole-transfer\"/>}}\n\n[[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] had returned to the top flight of English football in time for the start of the Premier League in the [[1992\u201393 in English football|1992\u201393 season]];<ref>{{Cite news |first=Ruaidhr\u00ed |last=Croke |title=The 22 original Premier League teams: Where are they now? |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sport/soccer/english-soccer/the-22-original-premier-league-teams-where-are-they-now-1.3181343 |work=[[Irish Times]] |date=10 August 2017 |accessdate=29 March 2020 }}</ref> however, they had finished in the bottom half of the table in both of the new league's first two seasons and had narrowly avoided relegation to the First Division in the final minutes of the 1993\u201394 campaign, finishing one point above the relegation zone.<ref>{{cite web |title=1993/94 Season Review |url=https://www.premierleague.com/history/1993-94 |website=premierleague.com |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=20 March 2020 }}</ref> Coming into this match, Ipswich were in 21st place in the league, three points and a game ahead of bottom club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but eight points away from escaping the relegation zone.<ref name=\"table_1995-03-03\"/>\n\nBefore this match, the two teams had met 50 times in all competitions; Manchester United had the upper hand with 24 wins to Ipswich's 18.

{"title_page": "Ur (continent)", "text_new": "{{short description|Proposed archaean supercontinent from about 3.1 billion years ago}}\n{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}\n{{Life timeline}}\n'''Ur''' is a proposed supercontinent that formed in the [[Archean]]  {{mya|3100}} (3.1 billion).\n\nIn Roger's reconstruction, Ur is half a billion years older than [[Arctica]] and, in the early period of its existence, it was probably the only continent on [[Earth]], and as such can be considered a [[supercontinent]], though it was probably smaller than present-day [[Australia (continent)|Australia]].  In more recent works geologists often refer to both Ur and other proposed Archaean continental assemblages as supercratons.  Ur can, nevertheless, be half a billion years younger than [[Vaalbara]], but the concepts of these two early cratonic assemblages are incompatible.\n\n==Incompatible reconstructions==\nAbout 1,300\u20131,071 Mya, Ur joined the continents [[Nena (supercontinent)|Nena]] and [[Atlantica]] to form the supercontinent [[Rodinia]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Rodinia, pp. 363\u2013364}}</ref>  In the reconstruction of {{Harvnb|Rogers|1996}}, Ur remained the nucleus of East [[Gondwana]] until the break-up of Gondwana.  In other reconstructions, however, India and East Antarctica did not collide until Rodinia formed 1,071 Mya.<ref>{{Harvnb|Zhao|Cawood|Wilde|Sun|2002|loc=Implications for a pre-Rodinia supercontinent, p. 155}}</ref>  Furthermore, in the Early Archaean Earth's mantle was 200&nbsp;\u00b0C hotter than today and many characteristics of modern tectonics, such as [[ophiolite]]s, [[blueschist]]s, [[lawsonite]]-bearing [[eclogite]]s, and [[Ultra-high-pressure metamorphism|ultra-high-pressure rocks]], did not exist or were rare.  This makes most proposed Archaean supercontinents controversial, including Rogers's 3 Gya supercontinent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nance|Murphy|Santosh|2014|loc=Pre-Rodinia supercontinents, pp. 11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nReconstructions of the supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] places two cratons, [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal]] in southern Africa and [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara]] in western Australia next to each other based on stratigraphic similarities.  In Roger's configuration of Ur, these cratons are placed far apart in their Gondwana configuration.  This configuration is contradicted by widespread Precambrian collisional events between Australia and Africa.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Kock|Evans|Beukes|2009|loc=Introduction, p. 145}}</ref>\n\nYet another possible supercraton, Zimgarn, proposed by {{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|S\u00f6derlund|2013}} and named after the [[Zimbabwe Craton|Zimbabwe]] and Yilgarn cratons, is distinct from both Vaalbara and Ur.  Vaalbara and Zimgarn, according to this proposal, both disintegrated about 2.1\u20132.0 Gya to reassemble as the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] and West Australian cratons 2.524\u20131.507 Gya.  Smirnov et al. based this reconstruction on: (1) Zimgarn was still undergoing cratonisation when an extensive [[carbonate platform]] developed over Vaalbara; (2) the magmatic signatures are different for the two supercratons during the period 2.6\u20132.0 Gya; and (3) paleomagnetic latitudes for 2.69 Gya are slightly different.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|S\u00f6derlund|2013|loc=Abstract; Discussion and conclusions, pp. 15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Original concept and later interpretations==\nImportant geological similarities link now remote Archaean cratons in India (Singhbhum and Dharwar), western Australia (Kilbaran and Pilbara), and southern Africa (Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe) which indicate that these [[protolith]]ic shields were close together in the Mid-Archaean. The name \"Ur\", from the German prefix ''[[:wikt:ur-|ur-]]'' meaning \"original\", was introduced by {{Harvnb|Rogers|1993}}, since it is the first continent in his tectonic reconstructions.<ref name=\"Rogers-1996\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|loc=Proposed Continents and Their Duration, pp. 94\u201395}}</ref> Other Archaean continental assemblages are considerably younger: [[Arctica]] ([[Baltica]], [[Laurentia]], Ur, and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]) consolidated around 2.565 Gya, [[Atlantica]] ([[West African Craton|West Africa]] and [[Amazonian Craton|eastern South America]]) consolidated around 2.11 Gya. In some reconstructions the shields of Ur stayed near each other until the Mesozoic break-up of Gondwana.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mondal|Piper|Hunt|Bandyopadhyay|2009|loc=The \u2018Ur\u2019 protocontinent, pp. 503\u2013505}}</ref>\n\nThe cratons that had become stable around 3 Gya were all in the same region within Pangaea, which is the main argument for them having formed a single continent 3 billion years ago.  The [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal craton]] in southern Africa became stable around 3.1 Gya. The [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara craton]] in western Australia is not well defined but formed around 3 Gya.  Three cratons in East Antarctica are of similar age but not well known.  These cratons share similar geological histories and are therefore assumed to have formed the continent [[Vaalbara]].<ref name=\"RogSan-2003\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Ur (~3000 Ma), pp. 358\u2013360}}</ref>\n\nThree small areas in the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica are also about 3 Gya old: western [[Dronning Maud Land]], the [[Napier Mountains|Napier complex]], and the [[Vestfold Hills]].  Within Gondwana, these areas were in a belt of [[Grenville orogeny|Grenville]]-age deformation, and because there is no evidence of ocean closure in this belt (except in Africa), the 1&nbsp;Ga orogen can be assumed to be intra-continental.  Consequently, the southern margin of Ur is now below the Antarctic ice cover.<ref name=\"Rogers-1996\" />\n\nTwo cratons in India of equal age, [[Dharwar Craton|Western Dharwar]] and [[Singhbhum Craton|Singhbhum]], were also part of Ur.  Two other Indian cratons, Eastern Dharwar and [[Bhandara Craton|Bhandara]], also formed around 3 Gya but underwent extensive magmatism around 2.5 Gya not seen elsewhere and their relation to Ur is unclear.  Ur, nevertheless, became larger around 2.524 Mya, and this so-called \"Expanded Ur\" incorporated the [[Zimbabwe Craton]] in Africa and the [[Yilgarn Craton]] in Australia.<ref name=\"RogSan-2003\" />\n\nThe largest preserved parts of Ur are now in India: [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]], [[Dharwar Craton|Dharwar]], [[Bundelkhand]], and [[Singhbhum]].  The [[Central Indian Tectonic Zone]] is the modern [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between the Bundelkhand-Aravalli block and the other Archaean blocks.  2.8\u20132.6 Gya metamorphism in Dharwar and Bundelkhand indicate that the stabilisation of Ur probably continued until the end of that period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mahapatro|Pant|Bhowmik|Tripathy|2012|loc=Implication for Ur Assembly, pp. 329\u2013330}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite journal\n | last1 = de Kock | first1 = M.

This makes most proposed Archaean supercontinents controversial, including Rogers's 3 Gya supercontinent.<ref>{{Harvnb|Nance|Murphy|Santosh|2014|loc=Pre-Rodinia supercontinents, pp. 11\u201313}}</ref>\n\nReconstructions of the supercontinent [[Vaalbara]] places two cratons, [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal]] in southern Africa and [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara]] in western Australia next to each other based on stratigraphic similarities.  In Roger's configuration of Ur, these cratons are placed far apart in their Gondwana configuration.  This configuration is contradicted by widespread Precambrian collisional events between Australia and Africa.<ref>{{Harvnb|de Kock|Evans|Beukes|2009|loc=Introduction, p. 145}}</ref>\n\nYet another possible supercraton, Zimgarn, proposed by {{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|S\u00f6derlund|2013}} and named after the [[Zimbabwe Craton|Zimbabwe]] and Yilgarn cratons, is distinct from both Vaalbara and Ur.  Vaalbara and Zimgarn, according to this proposal, both disintegrated about 2.1\u20132.0 Gya to reassemble as the [[Kalahari Craton|Kalahari]] and West Australian cratons 2.524\u20131.507 Gya.  Smirnov et al. based this reconstruction on: (1) Zimgarn was still undergoing cratonisation when an extensive [[carbonate platform]] developed over Vaalbara; (2) the magmatic signatures are different for the two supercratons during the period 2.6\u20132.0 Gya; and (3) paleomagnetic latitudes for 2.69 Gya are slightly different.<ref>{{Harvnb|Smirnov|Evans|Ernst|S\u00f6derlund|2013|loc=Abstract; Discussion and conclusions, pp. 15\u201316}}</ref>\n\n==Original concept and later interpretations==\nImportant geological similarities link now remote Archaean cratons in India (Singhbhum and Dharwar), western Australia (Kilbaran and Pilbara), and southern Africa (Kaapvaal and Zimbabwe) which indicate that these [[protolith]]ic shields were close together in the Mid-Archaean. The name \"Ur\", from the German prefix ''[[:wikt:ur-|ur-]]'' meaning \"original\", was introduced by {{Harvnb|Rogers|1993}}, since it is the first continent in his tectonic reconstructions.<ref name=\"Rogers-1996\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|1996|loc=Proposed Continents and Their Duration, pp. 94\u201395}}</ref> Other Archaean continental assemblages are considerably younger: [[Arctica]] ([[Baltica]], [[Laurentia]], Ur, and [[Siberia (continent)|Siberia]]) consolidated around 2.565 Gya, [[Atlantica]] ([[West African Craton|West Africa]] and [[Amazonian Craton|eastern South America]]) consolidated around 2.11 Gya. In some reconstructions the shields of Ur stayed near each other until the Mesozoic break-up of Gondwana.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mondal|Piper|Hunt|Bandyopadhyay|2009|loc=The \u2018Ur\u2019 protocontinent, pp. 503\u2013505}}</ref>\n\nThe cratons that had become stable around 3 Gya were all in the same region within Pangaea, which is the main argument for them having formed a single continent 3 billion years ago.  The [[Kaapvaal Craton|Kaapvaal craton]] in southern Africa became stable around 3.1 Gya. The [[Pilbara Craton|Pilbara craton]] in western Australia is not well defined but formed around 3 Gya.  Three cratons in East Antarctica are of similar age but not well known.  These cratons share similar geological histories and are therefore assumed to have formed the continent [[Vaalbara]].<ref name=\"RogSan-2003\">{{Harvnb|Rogers|Santosh|2003|loc=Ur (~3000 Ma), pp. 358\u2013360}}</ref>\n\nThree small areas in the Indian Ocean coast of Antarctica are also about 3 Gya old: western [[Dronning Maud Land]], the [[Napier Mountains|Napier complex]], and the [[Vestfold Hills]].  Within Gondwana, these areas were in a belt of [[Grenville orogeny|Grenville]]-age deformation, and because there is no evidence of ocean closure in this belt (except in Africa), the 1&nbsp;Ga orogen can be assumed to be intra-continental.  Consequently, the southern margin of Ur is now below the Antarctic ice cover.<ref name=\"Rogers-1996\" />\n\nTwo cratons in India of equal age, [[Dharwar Craton|Western Dharwar]] and [[Singhbhum Craton|Singhbhum]], were also part of Ur.  Two other Indian cratons, Eastern Dharwar and [[Bhandara Craton|Bhandara]], also formed around 3 Gya but underwent extensive magmatism around 2.5 Gya not seen elsewhere and their relation to Ur is unclear.  Ur, nevertheless, became larger around 2.524 Mya, and this so-called \"Expanded Ur\" incorporated the [[Zimbabwe Craton]] in Africa and the [[Yilgarn Craton]] in Australia.<ref name=\"RogSan-2003\" />\n\nThe largest preserved parts of Ur are now in India: [[Aravalli Range|Aravalli]], [[Dharwar Craton|Dharwar]], [[Bundelkhand]], and [[Singhbhum]].  The [[Central Indian Tectonic Zone]] is the modern [[Suture (geology)|suture]] between the Bundelkhand-Aravalli block and the other Archaean blocks.  2.8\u20132.6 Gya metamorphism in Dharwar and Bundelkhand indicate that the stabilisation of Ur probably continued until the end of that period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Mahapatro|Pant|Bhowmik|Tripathy|2012|loc=Implication for Ur Assembly, pp. 329\u2013330}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Sources===\n{{Refbegin|30em}}\n* {{Cite journal\n | last1 = de Kock | first1 = M.
