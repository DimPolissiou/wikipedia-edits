Previously a network of separate uniquely identifiable regional television channels, ITV currently operates in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nFrom 2001 until 2013, the primary ITV channel was called '''ITV1'''.  In 2004, [[Granada plc|Granada Television]] acquired [[Carlton Communications]] to form [[ITV plc]].\n\nITV is the biggest and most popular commercial television channel in the United Kingdom.  ITV, and its predecessor channels have contended with [[BBC One]] for the status of the UK's most watched television channel since the 1950s.  However, in line with other terrestrial channels, ITV's audience share has fallen as a result of availability of multi-channel television in the UK.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of ITV}}\nFollowing the creation of the [[Television Act 1954]], the establishment of a commercial television service in the UK began.\n\nThe '''Independent Television''' service, abbreviated ITV, was made up of distinct regions, with each region run by different franchisee companies.  The three largest regions, London, the Midlands, and the North of England, were sub-divided into weekday and weekend services, with a different company running each.  ITV existed in a region-heavy form from its inception through to the 2000s, although the switch to a single unified service was gradual.\n\nITV1 became the generic on-screen brand name used by the twelve franchises of the ITV Network in the United Kingdom.  The ITV1 brand was introduced in 2001 by Carlton- and Granada-owned franchises, initially used alongside the local regional name, such as \"ITV1 Anglia\" and \"ITV1 Meridian\". However, it became the sole on-air identity in 2002 when the two companies decided to create a single unified playout of the channel, with regional references only used prior to regional programming, such as local news and weather.  Carlton and Granada went on to [[Merger|merge]] in 2004, creating [[ITV plc]], which now owns thirteen of the fifteen regional ITV licences.\n\nThe ITV1 name was only used in England, Wales, [[Scotland|Southern Scotland]], and [[Isle of Man]], until [[Channel Television]] adopted the name in January 2006, bringing it to the [[Channel Islands]].  As national continuity is often used on Channel Television, ITV1 national branding had been seen on the station for several years previously.\n\nThe licencees that used the ITV brand were: [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]], [[ITV Border|Border Television]], [[ITV London|Carlton Television]], [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]], [[ITV Channel Television|Channel Television]], [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], [[ITV London|London Weekend Television]], [[ITV Meridian|Meridian Television]], [[ITV Tyne Tees|Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Westcountry|Westcountry Television]], and [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].\n\nITV Wales & West was the only exception, using the name ''ITV1 Wales'' at all times for the Welsh part of its broadcast area, as it has a higher regional commitment.  Latterly, the ''ITV1 Wales'' name was only used on break-bumpers and regionally advertised programmes until 2013.  Non ITV plc-owned licencees on the ITV network generally did not refer to the ITV name.\n\nThe network production arms of the ITV-plc owned licencees have been gradually combined since 1993, to eventually form [[ITV Studios]].\n\n==Corporate unification==\n[[File:ITV share of viewing 1992-2007.png|thumb|left|ITV share of viewing 1981\u20132007 BARB figures]]\n[[File:Itvplc formation.png|thumb|left|Flow diagram showing consolidation of ITV franchises into ITV]]\nITV was formed by the unification of eleven of the ITV licences.  The United Kingdom [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] changed many of the rules regulating the ITV network, which most notably relaxed separate franchise ownership, and hours of production.  However, as far back as 1974, Yorkshire Television and its [[North East England|North East]] neighbour, Tyne Tees Television, formally created [[Trident Television]], a merged entity of the two companies.  By 1981, due to regulation, the company was forced to de-merge; however, they resumed their alliance in 1993 as [[Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television]], which therefore owned the two franchises, and integrated the two company's assets more than its predecessor.\n\nThe intense race to own a larger share of the ITV network began in 1994, when [[Carlton Communications]], the owner of London weekday broadcaster Carlton Television, took control of [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Literally days afterwards, [[Granada plc]], owner of [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] of the [[North West England|North West]], purchased [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT).  [[ITV Meridian|Meridian's]] owner, Mills and Allen International, then went on to purchase [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] in the same year, before merging to become [[UBM plc|United News and Media]] (UNM) in 1995.  UNM then went on to purchase Wales and [[West of England|West]] broadcaster, [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] in 1996, while Carlton purchased Westcountry Television later that year.  Granada then agreed a deal to take over [[Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television]] in 1997, giving the broadcaster access to both [[Yorkshire]] and [[North East of England|North East]] franchises.\n\nThere was no further movement in the take-over of franchises until 2000, when [[ITV Border|Border Television]] and all of its [[radio]] assets were sold to [[Capital Radio Group]], who consequently sold the television broadcasting arm to Granada Media Group.  Granada then went on to purchase all of UNM's television interests (including its ITV franchises), which brought Meridian, Anglia, and HTV into its power, but due to regulation, Granada was forced to sell HTV to Carlton.  By this time, all of the franchises in England and Wales were owned by either Carlton or Granada.\n\nIn 2004, Granada plc officially merged with Carlton Communications, creating [[ITV plc]], although it was in effect, a takeover by Granada.  In 2011, ITV plc acquired [[Channel Television]] from its private owners [[Yattendon Group plc]].  On 19 October 2015, ITV announced they were to buy UTV for \u00a3100&nbsp;million subject to regulatory approval.  The deal also included [[UTV Ireland]], UTV's Irish channel.  Unlike other ITV franchises owned by ITV plc that use the ITV name, the UTV name will be retained.\n\n===Regional variations===\nITV consists of twelve franchises in England and Wales which broadcast regional news and other local programming to its area.  Many franchise areas in England previously had sub-regions providing separate regional news bulletins.  For example, the Anglia region was divided into West and East.  This arrangement came to an end in February 2009, when ITV implemented plans to save the company \u00a340m a year on the amount it spent making local news.\n\nSince 27 October 2002, on all ITV plc-owned franchises, regional programming has been preceded or plugged by an oral regional announcement, in the format ITV1 ''regional brand''; e.g. ITV1 Granada.  In English regions, up until 13 November 2006, regional names were also superimposed (post-production) on these idents below the ITV1 logo, but this practice has since ceased.  ITV Wales remains unaffected, and still continues to use dual-branding across all of its on-screen presentation.  Despite the lack of regional names on screen, the regional name is usually spoken by the [[continuity announcer]] prior to local programmes.  After ITV's unification in 2002, the two London franchises, [[Carlton Television]] and [[London Weekend Television]] were merged into a single entity, [[ITV London]], while the Wales and West franchise lost its official identity, and instead was substituted with ITV Wales and ITV West on-air, with no reference linking the two together (the licence was formally split in two by [[Ofcom]] from 1 January 2015).\n\nChannel Television adopted the ITV1 brand on-air prior to the 2011 ITV plc takeover of the channel.\n\nAreas with full ITV branding and continuity:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+\n!Broadcast area!!Pre-ITV1 branding!!Post-2015 franchise!!Post-ITV1 branding!!Post-2015 franchise map\n|-\n|English-Scottish border||rowspan=2|[[Border Television]]||[[ITV Border]]||rowspan=13|ITV||rowspan=14|[[File:ITV-branded franchises map 2015.svg|200px]]\n|-\n|Isle of Man||rowspan=2|[[ITV Granada]]\n|-\n|North West England||[[Granada Television]]\n|-\n|North East England||[[Tyne Tees Television]]||[[ITV Tyne Tees]]\n|-\n|Yorkshire and Lincolnshire||[[Yorkshire Television]]||[[ITV Yorkshire]]\n|-\n|The Midlands||[[Central Independent Television]]||[[ITV Central]]\n|-\n|East of England||[[Anglia Television]]||[[ITV Anglia]]\n|-\n|London (weekdays)||[[Carlton Television]]||[[ITV London]] (weekdays)\n|-\n|London (weekends)||[[LWT]]||[[ITV London]] (weekends)\n|-\n|South and South East England||[[Meridian Broadcasting]]||[[ITV Meridian]]\n|-\n|Channel Islands<sup>'''*'''</sup>||[[Channel Television]]||[[ITV Channel Television]]\n|-\n|South West England||[[Westcountry Television]]||rowspan=2|[[ITV West Country]]\n|-\n|West of England||[[HTV West]]\n|-\n|Wales||[[HTV Wales]]||[[ITV Cymru Wales]]||ITV Cymru Wales\n|}\n<small>'''*''' ITV+1 is not available in the main channels (e.g. channel 203 on Sky, channel 33 on Freeview, channel 112 on Freesat), and may be in the regional variation channels instead (e.g. channel 973 on Sky).</small>\n\nIn the English regions, the channel has been known from 2006 until 2013 as ITV1, and since 14 January 2013 as ITV at all times.

These changes were implemented in early 2009.  All sub-regional news programmes ceased; [[ITV Border]]'s ''[[Lookaround]]'' programme was merged with [[ITV Tyne Tees]]' ''[[North East Tonight]]'' programme, ITV Westcountry's ''[[Westcountry Live]]'' merged with [[ITV Wales & West|ITV West]]'s ''[[The West Tonight]]'' programme, and [[ITV Meridian]]'s ''[[Meridian Tonight]]'' south and south east editions merged with [[ITV Thames Valley]]'s ''[[Thames Valley Tonight]]''.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, ITV reverted to a more localised system, as was the case prior to a shake-up in 2009, with 14 news regions (rather than eight).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Press Gazette|title=Ofcom slashes number of regional news minutes|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ofcom-slashes-number-regional-news-minutes-itv-required-broadcast|date= |accessdate= }}</ref>  This meant people in the Borders, for example, saw a return to a Border-only news service, with all stories covered solely on Southern Scotland and Cumbria, similar to the pre-Tyne Tees merger in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=ATV ITV Border service returns with quiet re-launch|url=http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/p44634-border-tv/|website=ATVToday.co.uk|date= 16 September 2013|accessdate= }}</ref>  Meanwhile, in the Westcountry, viewers in Devon and Cornwall also saw a return to a more localised service.\n\n==Notable programming==\n{{main|List of television programmes broadcast by ITV}}\n\n===Daytime programming===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]''\n*''[[Dickinson's Real Deal]]''\n*''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]''\n*''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]''\n*''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]''\n*''[[ITV News|ITV Regional News]]''\n*''[[Judge Rinder]]''\n*''[[Loose Women]]''\n*''[[Tenable]]''\n*''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''\n*''[[Tipping Point (game show)|Tipping Point]]''\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Primetime programming===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[The Agenda with Tom Bradby]]''\n*''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]''\n*''[[Big Star's Little Star]]''\n*''[[Birds of a Feather]]''\n*''[[Cold Feet]]''\n*''[[Coronation Street]]''\n*''[[Doc Martin]]''\n*''[[Emmerdale]]''\n*''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure]]''\n*''[[Gino's Italian Escape]]''\n*''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

However, the regulator rejected ITV's proposed removal of large elements of the \"outdated\" CRR Undertakings while maintaining an obligation on ITV to offer ITV1 airtime on \"fair and reasonable\" terms.  The Competition Commission announced that such a change would leave the process too open to interpretation, and that they were \"not likely to be either practicable or effective in addressing the adverse effects of the merger\".\n\nOn 12 May 2010, the Competition Commission stood by its provisional decision to retain the contracts rights renewal system, but it added that the mechanism should be dropped at some point, and that the entire UK TV ad sales market needs a review.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2010/may/12/itv-crr-ad-rules-say|title=ITV's CRR ad rules stay \u2013 for now|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=12 May 2010|location=[[London]]|first=Mark|last=Sweney|accessdate= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/press_rel/2010/may/ITV_CRR_press_release_final_report.pdf|title=CC publishes final decision on PUBLISHES|publisher=[[Competition Commission]]|date=12 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119100012/http://www.competition-commission.org.uk/press_rel/2010/may/ITV_CRR_press_release_final_report.pdf|archive-date=19 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itvplc.com/media/newsrelease/?id=33696|title=ITV statement in response to the Competition Commission's final decision on Contract Rights Renewal (CRR)|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|date=12 May 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614014404/http://www.itvplc.com/media/newsrelease/?id=33696|archive-date=14 June 2011}}</ref>  \"ITV1 remains a 'must have' for certain advertisers and certain types of campaign\", said the chairman of the CRR review group at the Competition Commission, Diana Guy.  \"Despite all the changes in this market, no other channel or medium can come close to matching the size of audience that ITV regularly provides.  So the essential reason for the CRR undertakings remains: to protect advertisers and other commercial broadcasters\".  The ITV chief executive, Adam Crozier, said that the ruling was \"out of touch and damaging for the interests of creative Britain\".  He added that it was \"unlikely\" that ITV would look to seek a judicial review, but that ITV would redouble its lobbying campaign for a liberalisation of regulation and \"urgent modernisation\" of competition law.  But the commission said there was \"virtual unanimity\" among advertisers, media agencies, commercial broadcasters, and trade bodies, that CRR should be kept \"in some form\".  The commission confirmed that the CRR remedy should be broadened to include ITV+1 and ITV's high definition channels.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the [[House Of Lords]] confirmed plans to launch an inquiry into the television advertising market, which \"paid particular attention\" to the CRR mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a251914/lords-to-review-itv1s-crr-mechanism.html|title=Lords to review ITV1's CRR mechanism|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=28 July 2010|accessdate= }}</ref>  The Lords committee investigated the declining revenues that commercial broadcasters gain from the sale of advertising across their networks.  The members also considered possible changes to current ad market regulation, including the CRR system, product placement rules, and the scheduling and sale of advertising.  The committee wanted to hear evidence on the current levels of regulation, and what impact a relaxation of the rules could have had on the commercial broadcasting sector.  Interested parties submitted written evidence to the inquiry on 24 September 2010, with oral evidence been heard in October.  A written report was expected to follow in late 2010 or early 2011.{{Update after|2012}}\n\nOn 3 August 2010, ITV plc announced the launch of ITV1 +1 would take place in Q1 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.itvplc.com/media/news/itv-2010-interim-results|title=ITV plc 2010 Interim Results & Sky deal|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|date=3 August 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712130553/http://www.itvplc.com/media/news/itv-2010-interim-results|archive-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> with [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] (BARB)] later reporting that the channel would be launched on 11 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a293215/itv11-sets-january-launch-date.html|title=ITV1+1 sets January launch date|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=14 December 2010|accessdate= }}</ref>  In December 2010, full testing of all six regions began on satellite.\n\nITV1 +1 was launched on 11 January 2011 on Freesat channel 112, Freeview channel 33, Sky channel 203, and Virgin Media channel 114.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a297309/itv11-to-launch-tonight.html|title=ITV1+1 to launch tonight|date=11 January 2011|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate= }}</ref>  ITV1 broadcasts 22 different editions of digital satellite, but the timeshift service originally only transmitted six macro regional variants:<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a175012/itv-to-launch-itv11-channel.html|title=ITV to launch ITV1+1 channel|date=1 September 2009|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate= }}</ref>\n*London\n*South East Macro (encompassing Meridian Broadcasting and Anglia Television)\n*West Macro (encompassing Wales & West and Westcountry Television)\n*Central\n*Yorkshire/Tyne Tees Macro (encompassing Yorkshire Television and Tyne Tees Television)\n*Granada/Border Macro (encompassing Granada Television and Border Television)\n\nOn 1 March 2012, four additional variations were launched for the Anglia Television, Tyne Tees Television, West and Westcountry Television regions, with the South East Macro becoming Meridian Broadcasting, West Macro becoming Wales, and Yorkshire/Tyne Tees Macro becoming Yorkshire Television.\n\nThe channel was rebranded as ITV +1 on 14 January 2013, as part of the rebranding of ITV's television channels and ITV's online services.\n\n==Availability outside the UK==\nITV channels are available on cable and [[IPTV]] in [[Switzerland]] and [[Liechtenstein]].  In the Republic of Ireland, ITV (as [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]) was widely available, however, [[UTV Ireland]] was launched in 2015 and replaced UTV in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, ITV London has been offered by [[BFBS|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]] to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the [[BFBS#BFBS Television|BFBS3]] TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130603111429/http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march \"BFBS TV Set For A Makeover On 27th March\"], [[BFBS]]</ref>\n\n==Branding==\n{{Main|History of ITV television idents}}\n[[File:Sample ITV Reem typeface.png|thumbnail|right|ITV Reem (typeface used since 2013)]]\n\n===Independent Television (1955\u20131989)===\nFrom the founding of the ITV network in 1955, it was known nationally as Independent Television (later ITV) and locally by the regional branding of the local ITV franchise operator.\n\n===ITV (1989\u20132001)===\nIn 1989, the ITV Association set out a generic presentation package with a new ITV logo, which included [[station identification|idents]], promotions, and general on- and off-air design, and an edit of this package was designed for each franchise holder.  The dual branded idents included a large ITV logo, in which the V contained part of the franchise's logo, and written below the logo in a grey capitalised font was the name of the regional broadcaster.  However, only half of the regional broadcasters opted to use the package, which had completely failed by 1997.\n\n====\"TV from the Heart\" (1999\u20132001)====\nIn 1999, another second common presentation package (once again using dual-branding with the ITV name) was launched, under the theme, \"TV from the Heart\".  Like the 1989 attempt, a version was created for every franchise holder, but it was only taken by nine of the fifteen ITV broadcasters, two of which resorted to other designs, being [[London Weekend Television]], which actually used the look for a year but then adopted a more original look (claiming it \"wasn't exciting enough\"), and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] which adopted Carlton's identity<ref group=\"Note\">The opening films was retained, but the endings was in the \"Hearts\" style. {{cite web |title=TVARK > Branding > ITV Network > Regional TV > HTV > 2001 to 2002 |url=https://www.tvark.org/?page=3859 |website=www.tvark.org |accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref> when it was purchased by the company in 2001.  Carlton, owner of three ITV licences at the time, did not adopt the generic look, and instead used another package designed by [[Lambie-Nairn]], which again followed the \"TV from the Heart\" theme, but with more emphasis on the Carlton corporate identity.\n\n===ITV1 (2001\u20132013)===\nBy 2001, all eleven franchises of England and Wales were owned by either Granada plc or Carlton Communications, and a new common name, ITV1, was launched on 11 August 2001 because of the secondary channel [[ITV2]] on the air.  The existing \"Hearts\" idents were simply re-edited.\n\nHowever, from 28 October 2002, in England, the Scottish/English Border, and Isle of Man (where all the franchises are owned by ITV plc), the station dropped regional branding and identification before most programming and adopted a unified national branding of ITV1.  In Wales, although the HTV name has been dropped, some regional identification remains in the form of ITV1 Wales.  At this time all regional continuity announcers were replaced with a single team of six national continuity announcers.  Since the re-brand of 2006, that team has been reduced to just four.\n\nIn January 2006, the channel adopted a new on-air look, designed mainly to improve cross-channel promotion across ITV's multichannel presence.  \nThe new logo brought ITV1, ITV2 and [[ITV3]] in line with ITV4's, and had been observed on various billboard ads in the UK when the new identity was first used on-screen on 16 January 2006.  The overhaul also put an end to the former ITV Day brand, which was axed in favour of a full-time ITV1 identity.\n\nOn 13 November 2006, a new set of idents replaced the previous set which debuted in January, the theme being \"alive with colour\".  The initial set consisted of \"Beach\", \"Bike\", \"Lake\", and \"Market\"; \"Basketball\" and \"Pavement Art\" were added later in the year.  They were created by [[Blink Productions]] for ITV, unlike the old idents which were masterminded by [[Red Bee Media]].  The logo remained the same in essence; only the \"itv\" lettering was inverted from its previous white state to black, to allow it to stand out against the yellow more.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV1 rolls out more idents|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 November 2006|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1945157,00.org|accessdate=6 June 2006|location=London|first=Jason|last=Deans}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2007, four more idents were added to the set, featuring \"Bubbles\", \"Fountains\", \"Garden\", and \"Buildings\", and as of 19 September 2009, all now have \"the brighter side\" on their breakbumpers.  On 9 April 2010, four more idents where added to the set, \"Lanterns\", \"Sunflowers\", \"Snakes and Ladders\", and \"Dodgems\", featuring an updated ITV1 logo as seen on [[ITV HD|ITV1 HD]].\n\nIn September 2009, [[ITV plc]] announced that ITV1 +1, a one-hour time-shift version of ITV1, would launch in October 2009 from 10:25{{nbsp}}am to 7{{nbsp}}am daily.

ITV Day was treated as a separate entity to ITV1, and featured its own presentation set focusing using the colours of red, orange, and yellow, and featured scenes of typical \"daytime\" activities.  Promotions were used in a similar format to ITV1, and all daytime programmes advertised within ITV1 hours were branded with the ITV Day logo.  A similar \"UTV Day\" branding was adopted in Northern Ireland.  The branding was scrapped in January 2006 when the ITV corporate rebrand took place.\n\n===2013 rebranding===\nOn 14 January 2013, ITV unveiled a huge rebranding, including a new corporate logo inspired by handwriting, and the renaming of the flagship channel back from ITV1 to just ITV.  Its colour schemes vary on-air to complement its surroundings; a practice referred to internally as \"colour picking\".  Following the buyout in 2016, UTV also rebranded to these idents, using a tweaked version with the new UTV logo.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV1 to become ITV in channel rebrand|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9682449/ITV1-to-become-ITV-in-channel-rebrand.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/14/itv-launches-rebrand|title=ITV launches biggest on-screen rebrand in 12 years|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=14 January 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 January 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===2019 rebranding===\nOn 1 January 2019, ITV launched a refresh of its current on-air presentation, with a more \"crafted\" appearance, and use of layered \"cut-outs\" of the logo.  Idents were also changed as part of a project known as [[ITV Creates]], under which a new set of idents will be used weekly, built around interpretations of the ITV logo created by a British visual artist.  The first artist featured as part of the series was [[Ravi Deepres]].  UTV continued with its 2013-era idents, but used the new on-air presentation, with a tweaked version to accommodate the UTV logo.<ref>{{Cite

is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[free-to-air]] [[television channel]].  Previously a network of separate uniquely identifiable regional television channels, ITV currently operates in [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], the [[Isle of Man]], and the [[Channel Islands]].\n\nFrom 2001 until 2013, the primary ITV channel was called '''ITV1'''.  In 2004, [[Granada plc|Granada Television]] acquired [[Carlton Communications]] to form [[ITV plc]].\n\nITV is the biggest and most popular commercial television channel in the United Kingdom.  ITV, and its predecessor channels have contended with [[BBC One]] for the status of the UK's most watched television channel since the 1950s.  However, in line with other terrestrial channels, ITV's audience share has fallen as a result of availability of multi-channel television in the UK.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of ITV}}\nFollowing the creation of the [[Television Act 1954]], the establishment of a commercial television service in the UK began.\n\nThe '''Independent Television''' service, abbreviated ITV, was made up of distinct regions, with each region run by different franchisee companies.  The three largest regions, London, the Midlands, and the North of England, were sub-divided into weekday and weekend services, with a different company running each.  ITV existed in a region-heavy form from its inception through to the 2000s, although the switch to a single unified service was gradual.\n\nITV1 became the generic on-screen brand name used by the twelve franchises of the ITV Network in the United Kingdom.  The ITV1 brand was introduced in 2001 by Carlton- and Granada-owned franchises, initially used alongside the local regional name, such as \"ITV1 Anglia\" and \"ITV1 Meridian\". However, it became the sole on-air identity in 2002 when the two companies decided to create a single unified playout of the channel, with regional references only used prior to regional programming, such as local news and weather.  Carlton and Granada went on to [[Merger|merge]] in 2004, creating [[ITV plc]], which now owns thirteen of the fifteen regional ITV licences.\n\nThe ITV1 name was only used in England, Wales, [[Scotland|Southern Scotland]], and [[Isle of Man]], until [[Channel Television]] adopted the name in January 2006, bringing it to the [[Channel Islands]].  As national continuity is often used on Channel Television, ITV1 national branding had been seen on the station for several years previously.\n\nThe licencees that used the ITV brand were: [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]], [[ITV Border|Border Television]], [[ITV London|Carlton Television]], [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]], [[ITV Channel Television|Channel Television]], [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]], [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]], [[ITV London|London Weekend Television]], [[ITV Meridian|Meridian Television]], [[ITV Tyne Tees|Tyne Tees Television]], [[ITV Westcountry|Westcountry Television]], and [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].\n\nITV Wales & West was the only exception, using the name ''ITV1 Wales'' at all times for the Welsh part of its broadcast area, as it has a higher regional commitment.  Latterly, the ''ITV1 Wales'' name was only used on break-bumpers and regionally advertised programmes until 2013.  Non ITV plc-owned licencees on the ITV network generally did not refer to the ITV name.\n\nThe network production arms of the ITV-plc owned licencees have been gradually combined since 1993, to eventually form [[ITV Studios]].\n\n==Corporate unification==\n[[File:ITV share of viewing 1992-2007.png|thumb|left|ITV share of viewing 1981\u20132007 BARB figures]]\n[[File:Itvplc formation.png|thumb|left|Flow diagram showing consolidation of ITV franchises into ITV]]\nITV was formed by the unification of eleven of the ITV licences.  The United Kingdom [[Broadcasting Act 1990]] changed many of the rules regulating the ITV network, which most notably relaxed separate franchise ownership, and hours of production.  However, as far back as 1974, Yorkshire Television and its [[North East England|North East]] neighbour, Tyne Tees Television, formally created [[Trident Television]], a merged entity of the two companies.  By 1981, due to regulation, the company was forced to de-merge; however, they resumed their alliance in 1993 as [[Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television]], which therefore owned the two franchises, and integrated the two company's assets more than its predecessor.\n\nThe intense race to own a larger share of the ITV network began in 1994, when [[Carlton Communications]], the owner of London weekday broadcaster Carlton Television, took control of [[ITV Central|Central Independent Television]] in the [[English Midlands|Midlands]].  Literally days afterwards, [[Granada plc]], owner of [[ITV Granada|Granada Television]] of the [[North West England|North West]], purchased [[London Weekend Television]] (LWT).  [[ITV Meridian|Meridian's]] owner, Mills and Allen International, then went on to purchase [[ITV Anglia|Anglia Television]] in the same year, before merging to become [[UBM plc|United News and Media]] (UNM) in 1995.  UNM then went on to purchase Wales and [[West of England|West]] broadcaster, [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] in 1996, while Carlton purchased Westcountry Television later that year.  Granada then agreed a deal to take over [[Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television]] in 1997, giving the broadcaster access to both [[Yorkshire]] and [[North East of England|North East]] franchises.\n\nThere was no further movement in the take-over of franchises until 2000, when [[ITV Border|Border Television]] and all of its [[radio]] assets were sold to [[Capital Radio Group]], who consequently sold the television broadcasting arm to Granada Media Group.  Granada then went on to purchase all of UNM's television interests (including its ITV franchises), which brought Meridian, Anglia, and HTV into its power, but due to regulation, Granada was forced to sell HTV to Carlton.  By this time, all of the franchises in England and Wales were owned by either Carlton or Granada.\n\nIn 2004, Granada plc officially merged with Carlton Communications, creating [[ITV plc]], although it was in effect, a takeover by Granada.  In 2011, ITV plc acquired [[Channel Television]] from its private owners [[Yattendon Group plc]].  On 19 October 2015, ITV announced they were to buy UTV for \u00a3100&nbsp;million subject to regulatory approval.  The deal also included [[UTV Ireland]], UTV's Irish channel.  Unlike other ITV franchises owned by ITV plc that use the ITV name, the UTV name will be retained.\n\n===Regional variations===\nITV consists of twelve franchises in England and Wales which broadcast regional news and other local programming to its area.  Many franchise areas in England previously had sub-regions providing separate regional news bulletins.  For example, the Anglia region was divided into West and East.  This arrangement came to an end in February 2009, when ITV implemented plans to save the company \u00a340m a year on the amount it spent making local news.\n\nSince 27 October 2002, on all ITV plc-owned franchises, regional programming has been preceded or plugged by an oral regional announcement, in the format ITV1 ''regional brand''; e.g. ITV1 Granada.  In English regions, up until 13 November 2006, regional names were also superimposed (post-production) on these idents below the ITV1 logo, but this practice has since ceased.  ITV Wales remains unaffected, and still continues to use dual-branding across all of its on-screen presentation.  Despite the lack of regional names on screen, the regional name is usually spoken by the [[continuity announcer]] prior to local programmes.  After ITV's unification in 2002, the two London franchises, [[Carlton Television]] and [[London Weekend Television]] were merged into a single entity, [[ITV London]], while the Wales and West franchise lost its official identity, and instead was substituted with ITV Wales and ITV West on-air, with no reference linking the two together (the licence was formally split in two by [[Ofcom]] from 1 January 2015).\n\nChannel Television adopted the ITV1 brand on-air prior to the 2011 ITV plc takeover of the channel.\n\nAreas with full ITV branding and continuity:\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|+\n!Broadcast area!!Pre-ITV1 branding!!Post-2015 franchise!!Post-ITV1 branding!!Post-2015 franchise map\n|-\n|English-Scottish border||rowspan=2|[[Border Television]]||[[ITV Border]]||rowspan=13|ITV||rowspan=14|[[File:ITV-branded franchises map 2015.svg|200px]]\n|-\n|Isle of Man||rowspan=2|[[ITV Granada]]\n|-\n|North West England||[[Granada Television]]\n|-\n|North East England||[[Tyne Tees Television]]||[[ITV Tyne Tees]]\n|-\n|Yorkshire and Lincolnshire||[[Yorkshire Television]]||[[ITV Yorkshire]]\n|-\n|The Midlands||[[Central Independent Television]]||[[ITV Central]]\n|-\n|East of England||[[Anglia Television]]||[[ITV Anglia]]\n|-\n|London (weekdays)||[[Carlton Television]]||[[ITV London]] (weekdays)\n|-\n|London (weekends)||[[LWT]]||[[ITV London]] (weekends)\n|-\n|South and South East England||[[Meridian Broadcasting]]||[[ITV Meridian]]\n|-\n|Channel Islands<sup>'''*'''</sup>||[[Channel Television]]||[[ITV Channel Television]]\n|-\n|South West England||[[Westcountry Television]]||rowspan=2|[[ITV West Country]]\n|-\n|West of England||[[HTV West]]\n|-\n|Wales||[[HTV Wales]]||[[ITV Cymru Wales]]||ITV Cymru Wales\n|}\n<small>'''*''' ITV+1 is not available in the main channels (e.g. channel 203 on Sky, channel 33 on Freeview, channel 112 on Freesat), and may be in the regional variation channels instead (e.g. channel 973 on Sky).</small>\n\nIn the English regions, the channel has been known from 2006 until 2013 as ITV1, and since 14 January 2013 as ITV at all times.

These changes were implemented in early 2009.  All sub-regional news programmes ceased; [[ITV Border]]'s ''[[Lookaround]]'' programme was merged with [[ITV Tyne Tees]]' ''[[North East Tonight]]'' programme, ITV Westcountry's ''[[Westcountry Live]]'' merged with [[ITV Wales & West|ITV West]]'s ''[[The West Tonight]]'' programme, and [[ITV Meridian]]'s ''[[Meridian Tonight]]'' south and south east editions merged with [[ITV Thames Valley]]'s ''[[Thames Valley Tonight]]''.\n\nOn 16 September 2013, ITV reverted to a more localised system, as was the case prior to a shake-up in 2009, with 14 news regions (rather than eight).<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Press Gazette|title=Ofcom slashes number of regional news minutes|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/ofcom-slashes-number-regional-news-minutes-itv-required-broadcast|date= |accessdate= }}</ref>  This meant people in the Borders, for example, saw a return to a Border-only news service, with all stories covered solely on Southern Scotland and Cumbria, similar to the pre-Tyne Tees merger in February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=ATV ITV Border service returns with quiet re-launch|url=http://www.atvtoday.co.uk/p44634-border-tv/|website=ATVToday.co.uk|date= 16 September 2013|accessdate= }}</ref>  Meanwhile, in the Westcountry, viewers in Devon and Cornwall also saw a return to a more localised service.\n\n==Notable programming==\n{{main|List of television programmes broadcast by ITV}}\n\n===Daytime programming===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[The Chase (UK game show)|The Chase]]''\n*''[[Dickinson's Real Deal]]''\n*''[[Good Morning Britain (2014 TV programme)|Good Morning Britain]]''\n*''[[Lorraine (TV programme)|Lorraine]]''\n*''[[ITV Lunchtime News]]''\n*''[[ITV News|ITV Regional News]]''\n*''[[Judge Rinder]]''\n*''[[Loose Women]]''\n*''[[Tenable]]''\n*''[[This Morning (TV programme)|This Morning]]''\n*''[[Tipping Point (game show)|Tipping Point]]''\n{{Div col end}}\n\n===Primetime programming===\n{{Div col|colwidth=18em}}\n*''[[The Agenda with Tom Bradby]]''\n*''[[Benidorm (TV series)|Benidorm]]''\n*''[[Big Star's Little Star]]''\n*''[[Birds of a Feather]]''\n*''[[Cold Feet]]''\n*''[[Coronation Street]]''\n*''[[Doc Martin]]''\n*''[[Emmerdale]]''\n*''[[Exposure (UK TV series)|Exposure]]''\n*''[[Gino's Italian Escape]]''\n*''[[I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!

However, the regulator rejected ITV's proposed removal of large elements of the \"outdated\" CRR Undertakings while maintaining an obligation on ITV to offer ITV1 airtime on \"fair and reasonable\" terms.

So the essential reason for the CRR undertakings remains: to protect advertisers and other commercial broadcasters\".  The ITV chief executive, Adam Crozier, said that the ruling was \"out of touch and damaging for the interests of creative Britain\".  He added that it was \"unlikely\" that ITV would look to seek a judicial review, but that ITV would redouble its lobbying campaign for a liberalisation of regulation and \"urgent modernisation\" of competition law.  But the commission said there was \"virtual unanimity\" among advertisers, media agencies, commercial broadcasters, and trade bodies, that CRR should be kept \"in some form\".  The commission confirmed that the CRR remedy should be broadened to include ITV+1 and ITV's high definition channels.\n\nOn 27 July 2010, the [[House Of Lords]] confirmed plans to launch an inquiry into the television advertising market, which \"paid particular attention\" to the CRR mechanism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/media/news/a251914/lords-to-review-itv1s-crr-mechanism.html|title=Lords to review ITV1's CRR mechanism|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|date=28 July 2010|accessdate= }}</ref>  The Lords committee investigated the declining revenues that commercial broadcasters gain from the sale of advertising across their networks.  The members also considered possible changes to current ad market regulation, including the CRR system, product placement rules, and the scheduling and sale of advertising.

In the Republic of Ireland, ITV (as [[UTV (TV channel)|UTV]]) was widely available, however, [[UTV Ireland]] was launched in 2015 and replaced UTV in the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSince 27 March 2013, ITV London has been offered by [[BFBS|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]] to members of HM Forces and their families around the world, replacing the [[BFBS#BFBS Television|BFBS3]] TV channel, which already carried a selection of ITV programmes.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130603111429/http://www.bfbs.com/radio/article/bfbs-tv-set-for-a-makeover-on-27th-march \"BFBS TV Set For A Makeover On 27th March\"], [[BFBS]]</ref>\n\n==Branding==\n{{Main|History of ITV television idents}}\n[[File:Sample ITV Reem typeface.png|thumbnail|right|ITV Reem (typeface used since 2013)]]\n\n===Independent Television (1955\u20131989)===\nFrom the founding of the ITV network in 1955, it was known nationally as Independent Television (later ITV) and locally by the regional branding of the local ITV franchise operator.\n\n===ITV (1989\u20132001)===\nIn 1989, the ITV Association set out a generic presentation package with a new ITV logo, which included [[station identification|idents]], promotions, and general on- and off-air design, and an edit of this package was designed for each franchise holder.  The dual branded idents included a large ITV logo, in which the V contained part of the franchise's logo, and written below the logo in a grey capitalised font was the name of the regional broadcaster.  However, only half of the regional broadcasters opted to use the package, which had completely failed by 1997.\n\n====\"TV from the Heart\" (1999\u20132001)====\nIn 1999, another second common presentation package (once again using dual-branding with the ITV name) was launched, under the theme, \"TV from the Heart\".  Like the 1989 attempt, a version was created for every franchise holder, but it was only taken by nine of the fifteen ITV broadcasters, two of which resorted to other designs, being [[London Weekend Television]], which actually used the look for a year but then adopted a more original look (claiming it \"wasn't exciting enough\"), and [[ITV Wales & West|HTV]] which adopted Carlton's identity<ref group=\"Note\">The opening films was retained, but the endings was in the \"Hearts\" style. {{cite web |title=TVARK > Branding > ITV Network > Regional TV > HTV > 2001 to 2002 |url=https://www.tvark.org/?page=3859 |website=www.tvark.org |accessdate=29 January 2020}}</ref> when it was purchased by the company in 2001.  Carlton, owner of three ITV licences at the time, did not adopt the generic look, and instead used another package designed by [[Lambie-Nairn]], which again followed the \"TV from the Heart\" theme, but with more emphasis on the Carlton corporate identity.\n\n===ITV1 (2001\u20132013)===\nBy 2001, all eleven franchises of England and Wales were owned by either Granada plc or Carlton Communications, and a new common name, ITV1, was launched on 11 August 2001 because of the secondary channel [[ITV2]] on the air.  The existing \"Hearts\" idents were simply re-edited.\n\nHowever, from 28 October 2002, in England, the Scottish/English Border, and Isle of Man (where all the franchises are owned by ITV plc), the station dropped regional branding and identification before most programming and adopted a unified national branding of ITV1.  In Wales, although the HTV name has been dropped, some regional identification remains in the form of ITV1 Wales.  At this time all regional continuity announcers were replaced with a single team of six national continuity announcers.  Since the re-brand of 2006, that team has been reduced to just four.\n\nIn January 2006, the channel adopted a new on-air look, designed mainly to improve cross-channel promotion across ITV's multichannel presence.  \nThe new logo brought ITV1, ITV2 and [[ITV3]] in line with ITV4's, and had been observed on various billboard ads in the UK when the new identity was first used on-screen on 16 January 2006.  The overhaul also put an end to the former ITV Day brand, which was axed in favour of a full-time ITV1 identity.\n\nOn 13 November 2006, a new set of idents replaced the previous set which debuted in January, the theme being \"alive with colour\".  The initial set consisted of \"Beach\", \"Bike\", \"Lake\", and \"Market\"; \"Basketball\" and \"Pavement Art\" were added later in the year.  They were created by [[Blink Productions]] for ITV, unlike the old idents which were masterminded by [[Red Bee Media]].  The logo remained the same in essence; only the \"itv\" lettering was inverted from its previous white state to black, to allow it to stand out against the yellow more.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV1 rolls out more idents|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 November 2006|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1945157,00.org|accessdate=6 June 2006|location=London|first=Jason|last=Deans}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2007, four more idents were added to the set, featuring \"Bubbles\", \"Fountains\", \"Garden\", and \"Buildings\", and as of 19 September 2009, all now have \"the brighter side\" on their breakbumpers.  On 9 April 2010, four more idents where added to the set, \"Lanterns\", \"Sunflowers\", \"Snakes and Ladders\", and \"Dodgems\", featuring an updated ITV1 logo as seen on [[ITV HD|ITV1 HD]].\n\nIn September 2009, [[ITV plc]] announced that ITV1 +1, a one-hour time-shift version of ITV1, would launch in October 2009 from 10:25{{nbsp}}am to 7{{nbsp}}am daily.  The hours covered by [[GMTV]] from 7{{nbsp}}am to 10:25{{nbsp}}am will not originally have been included in the relay.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV1+1 to launch in October|publisher=Marketing Magazine|date=2 September 2009|url=http://www.marketingmagazine.co.uk/news/931190/ITV1+1-launch-October/|accessdate=5 September 2009}}</ref>  The channel launched on 11 January 2011.\n\n====ITV Day====\nIn 2005, [[ITV plc]] introduced a new channel branding called [[ITV Day]], used to identify ITV1 between 9:25{{nbsp}}am and 6{{nbsp}}pm.  ITV Day was treated as a separate entity to ITV1, and featured its own presentation set focusing using the colours of red, orange, and yellow, and featured scenes of typical \"daytime\" activities.  Promotions were used in a similar format to ITV1, and all daytime programmes advertised within ITV1 hours were branded with the ITV Day logo.  A similar \"UTV Day\" branding was adopted in Northern Ireland.  The branding was scrapped in January 2006 when the ITV corporate rebrand took place.\n\n===2013 rebranding===\nOn 14 January 2013, ITV unveiled a huge rebranding, including a new corporate logo inspired by handwriting, and the renaming of the flagship channel back from ITV1 to just ITV.  Its colour schemes vary on-air to complement its surroundings; a practice referred to internally as \"colour picking\".  Following the buyout in 2016, UTV also rebranded to these idents, using a tweaked version with the new UTV logo.<ref>{{cite news|title=ITV1 to become ITV in channel rebrand|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/mediatechnologyandtelecoms/9682449/ITV1-to-become-ITV-in-channel-rebrand.html|accessdate=16 November 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=16 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/jan/14/itv-launches-rebrand|title=ITV launches biggest on-screen rebrand in 12 years|last=Plunkett|first=John|date=14 January 2013|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=1 January 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>\n\n===2019 rebranding===\nOn 1 January 2019, ITV launched a refresh of its current on-air presentation, with a more \"crafted\" appearance, and use of layered \"cut-outs\" of the logo.  Idents were also changed as part of a project known as [[ITV Creates]], under which a new set of idents will be used weekly, built around interpretations of the ITV logo created by a British visual artist.  The first artist featured as part of the series was [[Ravi Deepres]].  UTV continued with its 2013-era idents, but used the new on-air presentation, with a tweaked version to accommodate the UTV logo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tvbeurope.com/tvbeverywhere/itv-announces-2019-idents-project|title=ITV announces 2019 idents project|last=Meier|first=Dan|website=TVBEurope.com|date= 18 December 2018|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://advanced-television.com/2018/12/18/itv-new-on-screen-identity-project/|title=ITV: New on-screen identity project|last=Mann|first=Colin|website=Advanced-Television.com|date=18 December 2018|accessdate=1 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n==On-air identity==\n<gallery widths=130>\nFile:ITV logo 1998 - 2006.svg|ITV logo, used from<br />5 October 1998 to 10 August 2001\nFile:ITV1 logo 1999-2002.svg|First ITV1 logo, a minor adjustment to the previous logo, used from<br />11 August 2001 to 27 October 2002\nFile:ITV1 logo 2004.png|ITV1 logo, broken into blocks, used from<br />1 November 2004 to 15 January 2006\nFile:ITV1 2006.png|ITV1 logo used from<br />16 January 2006 to 13 January 2013\nFile:ITV logo 2019.svg|ITV logo used from<br />1 January 2019 \n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=Note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|32em}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{itv.com|id=hub/itv|title=ITV}}\n\n{{ITV}}\n{{Media in the United Kingdom|television}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Itv}}\n[[Category:ITV television channels]]\n[[Category:Television channels in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1955]]\n[[Category:1955 establishments in the United Kingdom]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "MOS:DATEUNIFY (audit)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITV_(TV_channel)"}

Although raised in the northeast, he took a very early interest in bluegrass music, prompted chiefly by hearing Bill Monroe on radio and records. The region in which Val was raised had a very strong bluegrass affinity. He also listened to local bands, and especially the work of fiddler [[Tex Logan]]. It was Logan who coined the name 'Val' (short for ''Valiante''). Tex could not pronounce the Italian last name, thus introducing Joe onstage as Joe 'Val'.\n\nFor over 25 years, Joe Val was, in the words of \u00a0[[Peter Rowan]], \"The voice of bluegrass in New England.\" It didn't matter that he was a short, skinny Italian from a blue-collar [[Boston]] suburb, nor did it matter that his renditions of [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] standards were often tinted by a decidedly [[Yankee]] inflection. On-stage he was an unassuming, bespectacled, quietly smiling presence until he opened his mouth to sing. His smooth, high tenor voice made Joe no less an authority than a Bill Monroe or [[Del McCoury]].\n\nJoe Val worked a full-time day job as a typewriter repairman. He often had to ask for time off from work to tour with his band. Joe helped blaze the trail for Boston's folk and bluegrass scene with the [[Lilly Brothers]] in the early '60s, and later surrounded himself with the cream of that city's musical crop including [[Joan Baez]], The [[Charles River Valley Boys]], banjo legends [[Don Stover]] and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]], [[Jim Rooney (music)|Jim Rooney]], and the less well-known members of the [[New England Bluegrass Boys]] (most notably a relatively unknown guitarist and singer, [[Dave Dillon]]).\n\nVal had started out on [[guitar]], but also played [[banjo]] and finally the [[mandolin]], which brought him lasting renown. Joe honed his skills as he played with several bands including the [[Radio Rangers]], the [[Berkshire Mountain Boys]] and [[The Lilly Brothers]] & [[Don Stover]]. Val was in the right place to become involved with the Boston-area bluegrass boom among the region's university and college students in the 1960s. He played and recorded with the Bill Keith-Jim Rooney Band, and The Charles River Valley Boys. In both instances, he comfortably accommodated contemporary shifts in bluegrass but never lost his preference for the traditional form of the music.\n\nIn 1970, Joe Val formed his own band, [[The New England Bluegrass Boys]], bringing in [[Herb Applin]] (guitar/vocals), [[Bob French (bluegrass musician)|Bob French]] (banjo), and [[Bob Tidwell]] (bass). The band recorded their first album, the very first bluegrass release for Rounder Records, entitled ''One Morning In May'' in 1972. Joe Val & The New England Bluegrass Boys recorded exclusively with Rounder Records for what turned out to be a relatively short recording career, releasing albums from 1973-84 on that label.\n\nThe personnel varied slightly through the years. Among those that played in the band were guitarists/lead vocalists [[Dave Dillon]] and [[Dave Haney]], banjo players [[Paul Silvius]], [[Karl Lauber]] and [[Joe Dietz]], bass player [[Eric Levenson]], [[fiddler Sonny Miller]] and dobro player [[Roger Williams]].\n\nJust when Joe Val made the decision to finally make touring a full-time occupation, he learned that he was suffering from Lymphoma. Joe's last full show was performed during an afternoon set at a festival in Keene, NH in 1984. Shortly after that set, he was shuffled off to the hospital with the help of close friends and fellow musicians. Joe missed the evening set, perhaps for the first time in his long career. The band's final engagement was to be at the 1984 New Year's Eve Jekyll Island Bluegrass Festival in Georgia. Though Joe was feeling ill, he insisted on making the trip from New England and attempted to perform. However he was flown back home to a Boston hospital.\n\nTwo major fundraising benefits were held to help defray medical costs and household bills while Joe was ill and unable to work. The first benefit concert was organized in November 1984 by [[Len Domler]] (The Sounding Board Coffeehouse) and [[Kevin Lynch]]{{dn|date=March 2020}} in West Hartford, CT. [[The Johnson Mountain Boys]], Del & [[Jerry McCoury]], Bob & [[Dan Paisley]] and [[Traver Hollow]] donated their time, expenses, and talents to entertain a sold-out theater crowd.\n\nThe second benefit, the Joe Val Benefit and Appreciation Day, on June 9, 1985 (two days before Joe died) was organized by the Boston Bluegrass Union (BBU), the now defunct North River Bluegrass Association (Cathy & [[Ted Howland]] and [[Linda Fitzpatrick]]) and many volunteers. A full day and early evening of jams, workshops and concerts drew many familiar names and a large crowd. Among the performers were the duo of [[Tony Rice]] & [[Jimmy Gaudreau]] (making a surprise appearance), [[John Lincoln Wright]], Bill Keith, [[Traver Hollow]], [[White Mountain Bluegrass]], Joe's brother [[Paul Valiante]] (singing with Traver Hollow) and more.\n\nDuring his final weeks, Joe was humbled and comforted by the outpouring of good will and best wishes. He received calls, visits and countless cards & letters from fans and friends, as well as many of his peers in the music business. The likes of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, [[Ricky Skaggs]], and several other notable figures from Joe's early days in the Boston area music scene, took the time to make personal hospital visits and phone calls.\n\nJoe Val was honored throughout his funeral service with several renditions of Gospel songs sung and played in the upper loft of the church by [[New England Bluegrass Boys]], [[Dave Dillon]], [[Herb Applin]], [[Paul Silvius]], [[Dave Haney]]. and [[Karl Lauber]]. Joe was laid to rest in the historic Mount Feake Cemetery at 203 Prospect Street, Waltham, MA. His headstone is easily identifiable by an engraving of his 1923 Gibson 'Lloyd Loar' Mandolin, designed by Joe's devoted friend and bass player, [[Eric Levenson]].\n\nThe [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] posthumously presented Joe Val with an 'IBMA Award Of Merit' for his dedication and lifetime contributions to bluegrass music during their 1995 IBMA ''World of Bluegrass'' annual bluegrass trade show & convention. That presentation was made by [[John Rossbach]], accompanied by Joe's mandolin. Although John did not know Joe Val, he gave an impressive history of Joe as a person, as well as his accomplishments and contributions to the bluegrass music genre. Joe Val received a standing ovation from a knowledgeable IBMA audience, including many of Joe's peers.\n\nIn 1986, an annual \"Joe Val Day\" memorial event was organized and held on the Waltham Common in the center of [[Waltham, MA]]. One of Joe's best friends, next door neighbor and successful Waltham ophthalmologist, the late [[Rod O'Neill]], was the founder. O'Neill, along with town treasurer [[Steve Kilgore]] and handful of others, produced the event for several years. Many of Joe's friends, fans and fellow bluegrass musicians volunteered their time and talents, including nearly all of his sidemen. At that time a portion of the Joe Val Day proceeds were used to develop an annual 'Joe Val Music Scholarship' for the Waltham elementary school system. Sadly, that scholarship no longer exists.\n\nWhen the original \"Joe Val Day\" ceased operations on the Waltham Common, the Boston Bluegrass Union took the reins. The BBU eventually moved it to a larger location, the Newton North High School sports field in neighboring [[Newton, MA]]. In the mid-1990s, the BBU event ultimately evolved into the \"Joe Val Bluegrass Festival\".\n\nIn 2000, the BBU expanded and refined their festival concept, relocating it to Presidents' Day Weekend at a nearby hotel. The first indoor mid-winter event took place in [[Dedham, MA]] and, since 2003, in [[Framingham, MA]].\n\nThe festival won the coveted \"Event of the Year\" award in 2006 from the International Bluegrass Music Association. Information for the annual Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, held each February, can be found at the BBU website Joe Val Bluegrass Festival. Festival proceeds support a number of Bluegrass Music educational programs.\n\nMuch of Joe's memorabilia is housed in the Waltham Museum, including photos from the very first \"Joe Val Day\" on Waltham Common. Photos are mounted on the original 'Joe Val Day' banner which served as a backdrop for the stage. Also included in the museum are Waltham country music legends [[Gerry Robichaud]] & [[The Country Masters]], television personality [[Rex Trailer]], [[John Penny]] & [[Bella Lee]] and [[George Mahoney]] (of \"[[George & Dixie]]\") who opened the Webster, MA country music venue Indian Ranch in 1946.\n\n== Discography ==\n''Bluegrass and Old Time Music by the Charles River Valley Boys'' Prestige Records (1965) / Available on CD (2003)\n\n''Charles River Valley Boys \"Beatle Country\"'' Elektra Records (UK 1966) out of print / Available on CD (February 2006)\n\n=== Joe Val & The New England Bluegrass Boys ===\n''One Morning in May'' Rounder Records (1972)\n\n''Joe Val & the New England Bluegrass Boys'' Rounder Records (1974)\n\n''Not a Word from Home'' Rounder Records (1977)\n\n''Bound to Ride'' Rounder Records (1979)\n\n''Live in Holland'' Strictly Country Records (Netherlands 1981)\n\n''Sparkling Brown Eyes'' Rounder Records (1983)\n\n''Cold Wind Rounder'' Records (1983)\n\nReleased posthumously: ''Diamond Joe'' Rounder Records (1995)\n<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] posthumously presented Joe Val with an \"IBMA Award Of Merit\" for his dedication and lifetime contributions to bluegrass music during their 1995 IBMA ''World of Bluegrass'' annual bluegrass trade show & convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibma.org/awards/recipient-history#distinguished|title=Distinguished Achievement Award Recipients|work=International Bluegrass Music Association|access-date=2015-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109083948/https://www.ibma.org/awards/recipient-history#distinguished|archive-date=2016-11-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> That presentation was made by John Rossbach, accompanied by Joe's mandolin.

Although raised in the northeast, he took a very early interest in bluegrass music, prompted chiefly by hearing Bill Monroe on radio and records. The region in which Val was raised had a very strong bluegrass affinity. He also listened to local bands, and especially the work of fiddler [[Tex Logan]]. It was Logan who coined the name 'Val' (short for ''Valiante''). Tex could not pronounce the Italian last name, thus introducing Joe onstage as Joe 'Val'.\n\nFor over 25 years, Joe Val was, in the words of \u00a0[[Peter Rowan]], \"The voice of bluegrass in New England.\" It didn't matter that he was a short, skinny Italian from a blue-collar [[Boston]] suburb, nor did it matter that his renditions of [[Bill Monroe]] and [[Jimmie Rodgers (country singer)|Jimmie Rodgers]] standards were often tinted by a decidedly [[Yankee]] inflection. On-stage he was an unassuming, bespectacled, quietly smiling presence until he opened his mouth to sing. His smooth, high tenor voice made Joe no less an authority than a Bill Monroe or [[Del McCoury]].\n\nJoe Val worked a full-time day job as a typewriter repairman. He often had to ask for time off from work to tour with his band. Joe helped blaze the trail for Boston's folk and bluegrass scene with the [[Lilly Brothers]] in the early '60s, and later surrounded himself with the cream of that city's musical crop including [[Joan Baez]], The [[Charles River Valley Boys]], banjo legends [[Don Stover]] and [[Bill Keith (musician)|Bill Keith]], [[Jim Rooney (music)|Jim Rooney]], and the less well-known members of the [[New England Bluegrass Boys]] (most notably a relatively unknown guitarist and singer, [[Dave Dillon]]).\n\nVal had started out on [[guitar]], but also played [[banjo]] and finally the [[mandolin]], which brought him lasting renown. Joe honed his skills as he played with several bands including the [[Radio Rangers]], the [[Berkshire Mountain Boys]] and [[The Lilly Brothers]] & [[Don Stover]]. Val was in the right place to become involved with the Boston-area bluegrass boom among the region's university and college students in the 1960s. He played and recorded with the Bill Keith-Jim Rooney Band, and The Charles River Valley Boys. In both instances, he comfortably accommodated contemporary shifts in bluegrass but never lost his preference for the traditional form of the music.\n\nIn 1970, Joe Val formed his own band, [[The New England Bluegrass Boys]], bringing in [[Herb Applin]] (guitar/vocals), [[Bob French (bluegrass musician)|Bob French]] (banjo), and [[Bob Tidwell]] (bass). The band recorded their first album, the very first bluegrass release for Rounder Records, entitled ''One Morning In May'' in 1972. Joe Val & The New England Bluegrass Boys recorded exclusively with Rounder Records for what turned out to be a relatively short recording career, releasing albums from 1973-84 on that label.\n\nThe personnel varied slightly through the years. Among those that played in the band were guitarists/lead vocalists [[Dave Dillon]] and [[Dave Haney]], banjo players [[Paul Silvius]], [[Karl Lauber]] and [[Joe Dietz]], bass player [[Eric Levenson]], [[fiddler Sonny Miller]] and dobro player [[Roger Williams]].\n\nJust when Joe Val made the decision to finally make touring a full-time occupation, he learned that he was suffering from Lymphoma. Joe's last full show was performed during an afternoon set at a festival in Keene, NH in 1984. Shortly after that set, he was shuffled off to the hospital with the help of close friends and fellow musicians. Joe missed the evening set, perhaps for the first time in his long career. The band's final engagement was to be at the 1984 New Year's Eve Jekyll Island Bluegrass Festival in Georgia. Though Joe was feeling ill, he insisted on making the trip from New England and attempted to perform. However he was flown back home to a Boston hospital.\n\nTwo major fundraising benefits were held to help defray medical costs and household bills while Joe was ill and unable to work. The first benefit concert was organized in November 1984 by [[Len Domler]] (The Sounding Board Coffeehouse) and [[Kevin Lynch]]{dn|date=March 2020}} in West Hartford, CT. [[The Johnson Mountain Boys]], Del & [[Jerry McCoury]], Bob & [[Dan Paisley]] and [[Traver Hollow]] donated their time, expenses, and talents to entertain a sold-out theater crowd.\n\nThe second benefit, the Joe Val Benefit and Appreciation Day, on June 9, 1985 (two days before Joe died) was organized by the Boston Bluegrass Union (BBU), the now defunct North River Bluegrass Association (Cathy & [[Ted Howland]] and [[Linda Fitzpatrick]]) and many volunteers. A full day and early evening of jams, workshops and concerts drew many familiar names and a large crowd. Among the performers were the duo of [[Tony Rice]] & [[Jimmy Gaudreau]] (making a surprise appearance), [[John Lincoln Wright]], Bill Keith, [[Traver Hollow]], [[White Mountain Bluegrass]], Joe's brother [[Paul Valiante]] (singing with Traver Hollow) and more.\n\nDuring his final weeks, Joe was humbled and comforted by the outpouring of good will and best wishes. He received calls, visits and countless cards & letters from fans and friends, as well as many of his peers in the music business. The likes of Joan Baez, Bob Dylan, [[Ricky Skaggs]], and several other notable figures from Joe's early days in the Boston area music scene, took the time to make personal hospital visits and phone calls.\n\nJoe Val was honored throughout his funeral service with several renditions of Gospel songs sung and played in the upper loft of the church by [[New England Bluegrass Boys]], [[Dave Dillon]], [[Herb Applin]], [[Paul Silvius]], [[Dave Haney]]. and [[Karl Lauber]]. Joe was laid to rest in the historic Mount Feake Cemetery at 203 Prospect Street, Waltham, MA. His headstone is easily identifiable by an engraving of his 1923 Gibson 'Lloyd Loar' Mandolin, designed by Joe's devoted friend and bass player, [[Eric Levenson]].\n\nThe [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] posthumously presented Joe Val with an 'IBMA Award Of Merit' for his dedication and lifetime contributions to bluegrass music during their 1995 IBMA ''World of Bluegrass'' annual bluegrass trade show & convention. That presentation was made by [[John Rossbach]], accompanied by Joe's mandolin. Although John did not know Joe Val, he gave an impressive history of Joe as a person, as well as his accomplishments and contributions to the bluegrass music genre. Joe Val received a standing ovation from a knowledgeable IBMA audience, including many of Joe's peers.\n\nIn 1986, an annual \"Joe Val Day\" memorial event was organized and held on the Waltham Common in the center of [[Waltham, MA]]. One of Joe's best friends, next door neighbor and successful Waltham ophthalmologist, the late [[Rod O'Neill]], was the founder. O'Neill, along with town treasurer [[Steve Kilgore]] and handful of others, produced the event for several years. Many of Joe's friends, fans and fellow bluegrass musicians volunteered their time and talents, including nearly all of his sidemen. At that time a portion of the Joe Val Day proceeds were used to develop an annual 'Joe Val Music Scholarship' for the Waltham elementary school system. Sadly, that scholarship no longer exists.\n\nWhen the original \"Joe Val Day\" ceased operations on the Waltham Common, the Boston Bluegrass Union took the reins. The BBU eventually moved it to a larger location, the Newton North High School sports field in neighboring [[Newton, MA]]. In the mid-1990s, the BBU event ultimately evolved into the \"Joe Val Bluegrass Festival\".\n\nIn 2000, the BBU expanded and refined their festival concept, relocating it to Presidents' Day Weekend at a nearby hotel. The first indoor mid-winter event took place in [[Dedham, MA]] and, since 2003, in [[Framingham, MA]].\n\nThe festival won the coveted \"Event of the Year\" award in 2006 from the International Bluegrass Music Association. Information for the annual Joe Val Bluegrass Festival, held each February, can be found at the BBU website Joe Val Bluegrass Festival. Festival proceeds support a number of Bluegrass Music educational programs.\n\nMuch of Joe's memorabilia is housed in the Waltham Museum, including photos from the very first \"Joe Val Day\" on Waltham Common. Photos are mounted on the original 'Joe Val Day' banner which served as a backdrop for the stage. Also included in the museum are Waltham country music legends [[Gerry Robichaud]] & [[The Country Masters]], television personality [[Rex Trailer]], [[John Penny]] & [[Bella Lee]] and [[George Mahoney]] (of \"[[George & Dixie]]\") who opened the Webster, MA country music venue Indian Ranch in 1946.\n\n== Discography ==\n''Bluegrass and Old Time Music by the Charles River Valley Boys'' Prestige Records (1965) / Available on CD (2003)\n\n''Charles River Valley Boys \"Beatle Country\"'' Elektra Records (UK 1966) out of print / Available on CD (February 2006)\n\n=== Joe Val & The New England Bluegrass Boys ===\n''One Morning in May'' Rounder Records (1972)\n\n''Joe Val & the New England Bluegrass Boys'' Rounder Records (1974)\n\n''Not a Word from Home'' Rounder Records (1977)\n\n''Bound to Ride'' Rounder Records (1979)\n\n''Live in Holland'' Strictly Country Records (Netherlands 1981)\n\n''Sparkling Brown Eyes'' Rounder Records (1983)\n\n''Cold Wind Rounder'' Records (1983)\n\nReleased posthumously: ''Diamond Joe'' Rounder Records (1995)\n<br />\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[International Bluegrass Music Association]] posthumously presented Joe Val with an \"IBMA Award Of Merit\" for his dedication and lifetime contributions to bluegrass music during their 1995 IBMA ''World of Bluegrass'' annual bluegrass trade show & convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ibma.org/awards/recipient-history#distinguished|title=Distinguished Achievement Award Recipients|work=International Bluegrass Music Association|access-date=2015-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161109083948/https://www.ibma.org/awards/recipient-history#distinguished|archive-date=2016-11-09|url-status=dead}}</ref> That presentation was made by John Rossbach, accompanied by Joe's mandolin.

The production also features [[Donald Crisp]], [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]], [[Barton MacLane]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], and [[Sara Allgood]]. Its storyline is based on the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[novella]] ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' written by Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and first published in 1886. There have been [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|many filmed adaptations of the novella]]. This movie was a remake of the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Oscar-winning 1931 version, starring Fredric March.]] \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Henry Jekyll ([[Spencer Tracy]]) believes good and evil exist in everyone. Experiments reveal his evil side, named Mr. Hyde. Experience teaches him how evil and violent Hyde can be: he rapes Ivy Pearson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who earlier expressed interest in Jekyll. Meanwhile, Jekyll is preparing to marry Beatrix Emery ([[Lana Turner]]). Over the course of the film, Hyde abuses Ivy. Feeling remorse over the treatment inflicted on Ivy by his \u201cmonstrous\u201d counterpart, Jekyll vows never to take the serum again, destroys the key to his lab, and sends money to Ivy anonymously. Ivy believes the money was sent by Hyde in order to trick her into believing she is now free. On the advice of a friend over her rattled nerves, she goes to Jekyll for comfort. Jekyll promises that Hyde will never hurt her again.\n\nOn the way to Emery's house for the announcement of his marriage to Beatrix, Jekyll transforms into Hyde without taking the serum. He goes over to Ivy's house, accuses her of meeting with Jekyll, and strangles her. He escapes back to his locked lab, only to recall that he no longer has the key. He fails to break into the front door of his place, so he hurries to his friend Dr. Lanyon ([[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]) for help. Lanyon is shocked to find out that both Jekyll and Hyde are the same person as Hyde drinks the antidote in his friend's presence. Jekyll decides to break off his engagement to Bea in order to keep his dark secret. She refuses to accept, her reaction triggering Jekyll to become Hyde and frighten Bea. Her father ([[Donald Crisp]]) responds to her scream, only to be beaten to death by Hyde.\n\nLanyon later discovers a piece of Jekyll's cane at the scene, and he realizes his friend is responsible for the murder. He then leads police to search Jekyll's lab, where they find Jekyll, who earlier, as Hyde, had strong-armed past his butler, Poole ([[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]]), to get to the antidote. Soon the cornered doctor starts transforming once again into Hyde as authorities question him in the lab. A struggle ensues and Lanyon shoots Hyde. As the monster dies, he reverts yet again and finally to Jekyll.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Jekyll\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ivy Pearson\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Bea Emery\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Sir Charles Emery\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as John Lanyon\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Sam Higgins\n* [[C.

Both Hollywood productions differ greatly from the original literary work due to their heavy reliance on [[Thomas Russell Sullivan]]'s 1887 stage [[Theatrical adaptation|adaptation]] of the story. The director for the 1941 film was [[Victor Fleming]], who had directed ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'' and codirected ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', two major releases by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1939. MGM, where Fleming was under contract, acquired full rights to the 1931 film from [[Paramount Pictures]] prior to Fleming's production.

The production also features [[Donald Crisp]], [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]], [[Barton MacLane]], [[C. Aubrey Smith]], and [[Sara Allgood]]. Its storyline is based on the [[Gothic fiction|gothic]] [[novella]] ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]'' written by Scottish author [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] and first published in 1886. There have been [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (disambiguation)|many filmed adaptations of the novella]]. This movie was a remake of the [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Oscar-winning 1931 version, starring Fredric March.]] \n\n==Plot==\nDr. Henry Jekyll ([[Spencer Tracy]]) believes good and evil exist in everyone. Experiments reveal his evil side, named Mr. Hyde. Experience teaches him how evil and violent Hyde can be: he rapes Ivy Pearson ([[Ingrid Bergman]]), who earlier expressed interest in Jekyll. Meanwhile, Jekyll is preparing to marry Beatrix Emery ([[Lana Turner]]). Over the course of the film, Hyde abuses Ivy. Feeling remorse over the treatment inflicted on Ivy by his \u201cmonstrous\u201d counterpart, Jekyll vows never to take the serum again, destroys the key to his lab, and sends money to Ivy anonymously. Ivy believes the money was sent by Hyde in order to trick her into believing she is now free. On the advice of a friend over her rattled nerves, she goes to Jekyll for comfort. Jekyll promises that Hyde will never hurt her again.\n\nOn the way to Emery's house for the announcement of his marriage to Beatrix, Jekyll transforms into Hyde without taking the serum. He goes over to Ivy's house, accuses her of meeting with Jekyll, and strangles her. He escapes back to his locked lab, only to recall that he no longer has the key. He fails to break into the front door of his place, so he hurries to his friend Dr. Lanyon ([[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]]) for help. Lanyon is shocked to find out that both Jekyll and Hyde are the same person as Hyde drinks the antidote in his friend's presence. Jekyll decides to break off his engagement to Bea in order to keep his dark secret. She refuses to accept, her reaction triggering Jekyll to become Hyde and frighten Bea. Her father ([[Donald Crisp]]) responds to her scream, only to be beaten to death by Hyde.\n\nLanyon later discovers a piece of Jekyll's cane at the scene, and he realizes his friend is responsible for the murder. He then leads police to search Jekyll's lab, where they find Jekyll, who earlier, as Hyde, had strong-armed past his butler, Poole ([[Peter Godfrey (director)|Peter Godfrey]]), to get to the antidote. Soon the cornered doctor starts transforming once again into Hyde as authorities question him in the lab. A struggle ensues and Lanyon shoots Hyde. As the monster dies, he reverts yet again and finally to Jekyll.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:DrJandMrH001Crop.png|thumb|268px|Colorized publicity shot featuring [[w:Spencer Tracy|Spencer Tracy]], [[w:Lana Turner|Lana Turner]] and [[w:Donald Crisp|Donald Crisp]].]]\n{{div col}}\n* [[Spencer Tracy]] as Jekyll\n* [[Ingrid Bergman]] as Ivy Pearson\n* [[Lana Turner]] as Bea Emery\n* [[Donald Crisp]] as Sir Charles Emery\n* [[Ian Hunter (actor)|Ian Hunter]] as John Lanyon\n* [[Barton MacLane]] as Sam Higgins\n* [[C.
