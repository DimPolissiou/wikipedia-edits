{"title_page": "Endianness", "text_new": "{{redirect2|Big-endian|Little-endian|the conflicting ideologies in ''Gulliver's Travels''|Lilliput and Blefuscu#History and politics}}\n\nIn [[computing]], '''endianness''' refers to the order of [[byte]]s (or sometimes [[bit]]s) within a [[binary number|binary]] representation of a number. It can also be used more generally to refer to the internal ordering of any representation, such as the digits in a [[numeral system]] or the sections of a [[date format by country|date]].\n\nIn its most common usage, endianness indicates the ordering of bytes within a multi-byte number. A '''big-endian''' ordering places the [[most significant byte]] first and the [[least significant byte]] last, while a '''little-endian''' ordering does the opposite. For example, consider the [[signedness|unsigned]] [[hexadecimal]] number {{code|0x1234}}, which requires at least two bytes to represent. In a big-endian ordering they would be {{code|0x12 0x34|class=nowrap}}, while in a little-endian ordering, the bytes would be arranged {{code|0x34 0x12|class=nowrap}}.\n\nHistorically, various methods of endianness have been used in computing, including exotic forms such as middle-endianness. Today, however, big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols ([[Internet Protocol|IP]], [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]], [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]]). Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures ([[x86]], most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] implementations) and their associated [[computer memory|memory]]. [[File format]]s can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both.\n\nIn [[Writing system#Directionality|left-to-right scripts]], numbers are written with their digits in big-endian order. Similarly, programming languages use big-endian digit ordering for numeric [[Literal (computer programming)|literals]] as well as big-endian language (\u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d) for [[Bitwise operation#Logical shift|bit-shift]] operations, regardless of the endianness of the target architecture. This can lead to confusion when interacting with little-endian numbers.\n\n==Illustration==\n[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|200px|Big-Endian|right]]\n[[Image:Little-Endian.svg|200px|Little-Endian|right]]\nThe following two descriptive illustrations assume a reading and writing convention of ''left to right'', where the left-most digit or character therefore corresponds to data being sent or received first, or being in the ''lowest address in memory'', and the right-most digit or character corresponds to the data being sent or received last, or being in the ''highest'' address in memory.\n\nBig-endianness may be demonstrated by writing a decimal number, say one hundred twenty-three, on paper in the usual [[positional notation]] understood by a numerate reader: ''123''. The digits are written starting from the left and to the right, with the most significant digit, ''1'', written first. This is analogous to the lowest [[memory address|address of memory]] being used first. This is an example of a big-endian convention taken from daily life.\n\nThe little-endian way of writing the same number, one hundred twenty-three, would place the hundreds-digit ''1'' in the right-most position: ''321''. A person following conventional big-endian place-value order, who is not aware of this special ordering, would read a different number: three hundred twenty-one. Endianness in computing is similar, but it usually applies to the ordering of bytes, rather than of digits.\n\nThe illustrations to the right, where ''a'' is a memory address, show big-endian and little-endian storage in memory.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[Danny Cohen (computer scientist)|Danny Cohen]] introduced the terms ''Little-Endian'' and ''Big-Endian'' for byte ordering in an article published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in 1980.<ref name=\"HOLY\">{{cite IETF\n|title = On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace\n|ien = 137\n|last = Cohen |first = Danny\n|author-link = Danny Cohen (computer scientist)\n|date = 1980-04-01\n|url = http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt\n|quote = \u2026which bit should travel first, the bit from the little end of the word, or the bit from the big end of the word?

Each cell is identified in hardware and software by its [[memory address]]. If the total number of storage cells in memory is ''n'', then addresses are enumerated from 0 to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1. Computer programs often use data structures of [[Field (computer science)|fields]] that may consist of more data than is stored in one memory cell. For the purpose of this article where its use as an operand of an instruction is relevant, a field consists of a consecutive sequence of [[byte]]s and represents a simple data value. In addition to that, it has to be of numeric type in some [[Positional notation|positional number system]] (mostly base 10 or base 2 \u2013 or base 256 in case of 8-bit bytes).{{NoteTag|When character (text) strings are compared with one another, this is done [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest \u2013 as in the telephone book. This would have the consequence that almost every machine would be big-endian or at least mixed-endian. Therefore, for the criterion below to apply, the data type in question has to be ''numeric''.}} In such a number system the \"value\" of a digit is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, its \"significance\".

Big-endian memory representation is commonly referred to as [[Endianness#Networking|network order]], as used in the [[Internet protocol suite]]. Other processor types use little-endian memory representation; others use yet another scheme called \"[[Endianness#Middle|middle-endian]]\", \"mixed-endian\" or \"[[PDP-11]]-endian\".\n\nThe [[IBM System/360]] uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors [[System/370]], [[ESA/390]], and [[z/Architecture]]. The [[PDP-10]] also uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions. The [[IBM Series/1]] minicomputer also use big-endian byte order.\n\nDealing with data of different endianness is sometimes termed the ''NUXI problem''.<ref>{{cite web\n |title = NUXI problem\n |work = The [[Jargon File]]\n |url = http://catb.org/jargon/html/N/NUXI-problem.html\n |access-date = 2008-12-20\n}}</ref> This terminology alludes to the byte order conflicts encountered while [[Porting|adapting]] [[UNIX]], which ran on the mixed-endian PDP-11, to a big-endian IBM Series/1 computer.

The [[ARM architecture]] was little-endian before version 3 when it became bi-endian.\n\n=== Current architectures ===\nThe Intel [[x86]] and AMD64 / [[x86-64]] series of processors use the little-endian format. Other instruction set architectures that follow this convention, allowing only little-endian mode, include [[Nios II]], [[Andes Technology]] NDS32, and [[Qualcomm Hexagon]].\n\nSome instruction set architectures allow running software of either endianness on a bi-endian architecture. This includes ARM [[Aarch64]], [[C-Sky]], [[Power ISA]], and [[RISC-V]].\n\nSolely big-endian architectures include the IBM [[z/Architecture]], [[Freescale ColdFire]] (which is [[Motorola 68000 series]]-based), Atmel [[AVR32]], and [[OpenRISC]]. The [[IBM AIX]] and [[Oracle Solaris]] operating systems on bi-endian [[Power ISA]] and [[SPARC]] run in big-endian mode; some distributions of [[Linux]] on Power have moved to little-endian mode.\n\n{{anchor|Bi-endian hardware}}\n\n=== Bi-endianness ===\n<!-- Yes, that's bi, not big. \"Bi\" here means \"both of them\", i.e. switchable between big- & little-endianness. -->\nSome architectures (including [[ARM architecture|ARM]] versions 3 and above, [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[SPARC]] V9, [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[SuperH|SuperH SH-4]] and [[IA-64]]) feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word ''bi-endian'', when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.\n\nMany of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g. the Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the [[Cray T3E]]).\n\nNote that the term \"bi-endian\" refers primarily to how a processor treats ''data'' accesses. ''Instruction'' accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if ''data'' accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel's [[IA-64]]-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.\n\nNote, too, that some nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented [[PowerPC]] processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to [[Input/Output|I/O]] devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.\n\nSome CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.\n\nSPARC processors since the late 1990s (\"SPARC v9\" compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.\n\nThe [[ARM architecture]] supports two big-endian modes, called '''BE-8''' and '''BE-32'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Differences between BE-32 and BE-8 buses|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/ch06s05s01.html}}</ref> CPUs up to ARMv5 only support BE-32 or '''Word-Invariant''' mode. Here any naturally aligned 32-bit access works like in little-endian mode, but access to a byte or 16-bit word is redirected to the corresponding address and unaligned access is not allowed. ARMv6 introduces BE-8 or '''Byte-Invariant''' mode, where access to a single byte works as in little-endian mode, but accessing a 16-bit, 32-bit or (starting with ARMv8) 64-bit word results in a byte swap of the data. This simplifies unaligned memory access as well as memory mapped access to registers other than 32 bit. With ARMv7 and later, only BE-8 mode is allowed.{{clarify |date=March 2019 |reason=The use of \"little-endian\" in this paragraph gives the impression that this is not really big-endian. Possibly give examples for both cases.}}\n\nMany processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. All the individual bits are not reversed though.\n\nRecent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction ([[Intel Core]] since generation 4, after [[Intel Atom|Atom]]),<ref>{{cite web |title = How to detect New Instruction support in the 4th generation Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processor family |url = https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/405250/how-to-detect-new-instruction-support-in-the-4th-generation-intel-core-processor-family.pdf |access-date = 2 May 2017 }}</ref> which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian. They also already had a range of swap instructions to reverse the byte order of the contents of registers, such as when words have already been fetched from memory locations where they were in the 'wrong' endianness.\n\n===Floating point===\n{{anchor|Floating-point and endianness}}<!-- This section is transcluded on the [[Double-precision floating point]] article -->\n<section begin=\"Floating-point\" />\nAlthough the ubiquitous x86 processors of today use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point, [[binary coded decimal|BCD]]), there are a number of hardware architectures where [[floating-point]] numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form.<ref>{{citation |title=Floating-Point Formats |author-first=John J.

Because there have been many floating-point formats with no \"[[Computer network|network]]\" standard representation for them, the [[External Data Representation|XDR]] standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard does not specify endianness.<ref>{{cite web |title = pack \u2013 convert a list into a binary representation |url = http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlfunc/pack.html }}</ref> Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. (Small [[embedded system]]s using special floating-point formats may be another matter however.)<section end=\"Floating-point\" />\n\n=== Optimization ===\nThe little-endian system has the property that the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when [[byte alignment|alignment]] restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content {{code|4A 00 00 00|class=nowrap}} can be read at the same address as either [[8-bit]] (value = 4A), [[16-bit]] (004A), [[24-bit]] (00004A), or [[32-bit]] (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is often employed by code optimizers as well as by [[assembly language]] programmers.\n\nIn more concrete terms, such optimizations are the equivalent of the following [[C (programming language)|C code]] returning true on most little-endian systems:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\nunion {\n  uint8_t u8; uint16_t u16; uint32_t u32; uint64_t u64;\n} u = { .u64 = 0x4A };\nputs(u.u8 == u.u16 && u.u8 == u.u32 && u.u8 == u.u64 ? \"true\" : \"false\");\n</source>\n\nWhile not allowed by C++, such [[type punning]] code is allowed as \"implementation-defined\" by the C11 standard<ref>{{cite web |title = C11 standard |url = https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html |publisher = ISO |access-date=15 August 2018 |at = Section 6.5.2.3 \"Structure and Union members\", \u00a73 and footnote 95 |quote = 95) If the member used to read the contents of a union object is not the same as the member last used to store a value in the object, the appropriate part of the object representation of the value is reinterpreted as an object representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called \u201ctype punning\u201d).}}</ref> and commonly used<ref>{{cite web |title=3.10 Options That Control Optimization: -fstrict-aliasing |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning |website=GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref> in code interacting with hardware.<ref>{{cite mailing list |first=Linus |last=Torvalds |title=[GIT PULL] Device properties framework update for v4.18-rc1 |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/5/769 |mailing-list=Linux Kernel|accessdate=15 August 2018 | date=5 Jun 2018 |quote=The fact is, using a union to do type punning is the traditional AND STANDARD way to do type punning in gcc.

As carry propagation must start at the least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told how big the addition is going to be so that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.\n\n==Mapping multi-byte binary values to memory==\n<!-- \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#DDDDFF;\"\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center; float:left;\"\n|-\n-->\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center; float:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | ||style=\"width:2em;\" | || colspan=\"4\" | Big-Endian ||style=\"width:2em;\" | || colspan=\"4\" | Little-Endian ||style=\"width:.8em;\" | \n|-\n| ''C-type'' || ''name'' || ''initial value'' || || colspan=\"4\" | ''memory at offset'' || || colspan=\"4\" | ''memory at offset'' ||\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | ''of variable'' || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +0 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +1 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +2 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +3 || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +0 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +1 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +2 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +3 ||\n|-\n| {{code|int32_t}} || longVar || = 0x0a0b0c0d; || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> ||\n|-\n| {{code|int16_t}} || shortVar || = 0x0c0d; || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> || colspan=\"2\" | || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> || colspan=\"2\" | ||\n|-\n|colspan=\"14\" | <small>A simple way to remember is \"In {{em|L}}ittle-Endian, the {{em|L}}east significant byte goes into the {{em|L}}owest-addressed slot\".<br />So in the example in the table, <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>, the least significant byte, in a Little-Endian system goes into slot +0.</small>\n|}\n\nWe can assume that as we write text ''left to right'', we are increasing the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses&mdash;as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value <tt>0a0b0c0d</tt> (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in '''''de'''creasing'' significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes from ''left to right'' in '''''de'''creasing'' significance: <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> at +0, <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> at +1, <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> at +2, <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> at +3.\n\nOn a little-endian system, the bytes are written from ''left to right'' in '''''in'''creasing'' significance, starting with the one's byte: <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> at +0, <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> at +1, <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> at +2, <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses from left to right) shows that the order is ''reversed'' (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a [[hexdump]] is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows that they are reading a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data they are reading, reads the byte sequence <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or <tt>0x0a0b0c0d</tt> in hexadecimal notation. (Of course, this is ''not'' the same as the number <tt>0D0C0B0A<sub>h</sub></tt> = <tt>0x0d0c0b0a</tt> = 218893066.)\n\n==Examples==\nThis section provides example layouts of the 32-bit number 0A0B0C0D<sub>h</sub> in the most common variants of endianness. There exist several digital processors that use other formats. That is true for typical [[embedded system]]s as well as for general computer CPUs. Most processors used in non CPU roles in typical computers (in storage units, peripherals etc.) also use one of these two basic formats, although not always 32-bit.\n\nSome machines use addressable \"atoms\" of other sizes, such as 9-bit and 16-bit. They are laid out analogously in memory, in most or least-significant-word first order.\n\nThe examples refer to the storage in memory of the value. It uses [[hexadecimal]] notation.\n\n==={{anchor|Big}}Big-endian===\n[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|right]]\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|+ style=\"font-weight: bold\" | Big-endian, 8-bit atoms, 1-octet address\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\nThe [[most significant byte]] (MSB) value, <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>, is at the lowest address.

This ordering is known as ''PDP-endian''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1145_Handbook_1973.pdf|title=PDP-11/45 Processor Handbook|page=165|year=1973|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\nA way to interpret this endianness is that it stores an 32-bit integer as two 16-bit words in big-endian, but the words themselves are little-endian:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|+Storage of a 32-bit integer, <tt>0x0A0B0C0D</tt>, on a PDP-11\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" colspan=\"2\" | <tt>0A0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" colspan=\"2\" | <tt>0C0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\n(The 16-bit values here refer to their numerical values, not their actual layout.)\n\nThe [[ARM architecture]] can also produce this format when writing a 32-bit word to an address 2 bytes from a 32-bit word [[data structure alignment|alignment]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Honeywell 316 ====\nThe [[Honeywell 316]], also a series of 16-bit computers, happen to be the opposite of PDP-11 when it comes to storing 32-bit words in C.

In other words, it appears backwards when visualized, an oddity for programmers.\n\nThis behavior is mainly a concern for programmers utilizing [[FourCC]] or similar techniques that involve packing characters into an integer, so that it becomes a sequences of specific characters in memory. Let's define the notation {{code|'Wiki'}} as simply the result of writing the characters in hexadecimal [[ASCII]] and appending {{code|0x}} to the front, and analogously for shorter sequences (a [[C syntax#Character constants|C multicharacter literal]], in Unix/MacOS style):\n\n ' W i k i '\n hex 57 69 6B 69\n ----------------\n -> 0x57696B69\n\nOn big-endian machines, the value appears left-to-right, coinciding with the correct string order for reading the result:\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>57<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>6B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'W'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'k'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|}\n\nBut on a little-endian machine, one would see:\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>6B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>57<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'k'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>'W'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>...</tt>\n|}\n\nMiddle-endian machines like the Honeywell 316 above complicate this even further: the 32-bit value is stored as two 16-bit words {{mono|'ki'}} {{mono|'Wi'}} in little-endian, themselves with a big-endian notation (thus {{mono|'k' 'i' 'W' 'i'}}).\n\nThis conflict between the memory arrangements of binary data and text is intrinsic to the nature of the little-endian convention, but is a conflict only for languages written left-to-right, such as English. For right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], there is no conflict of text with binary, and the preferred display in both cases would be with addresses increasing to the left. (On the other hand, right-to-left languages have a complementary intrinsic conflict in the big-endian system.)\n\n==Files and byte swap==\nEndianness is a problem when a binary file created on a computer is read on another computer with different endianness. Some [[CPU]] instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as {{code|bswap}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2 (2A, 2B & 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z|at=p. 3\u2013112|publisher=Intel|date=September 2016|accessdate=2017-02-05}}</ref> ([[x86]] - [[Intel 80486|486]] and later), and {{code|rev}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0487a.k_10775/index.html|title=ARMv8-A Reference Manual|publisher=[[ARM Holdings]]}}</ref> ([[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] and later).\n\nSome [[compiler]]s have built-in facilities to deal with data written in other formats. For example, the [[Intel]] [[Fortran]] compiler supports the non-standard {{code|CONVERT}} specifier, so a file can be opened as\n:{{code|1=OPEN(unit,CONVERT='BIG_ENDIAN',...)|lang=Fortran}}\nor\n:{{code|1=OPEN(unit,CONVERT='LITTLE_ENDIAN',...)|lang=Fortran}}\nSome compilers have options to generate code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This allows programmers to reuse code on a system with the opposite endianness without having to modify the code itself. If the compiler does not support such conversion, the programmer needs to swap the bytes via ad hoc code.\n\nFortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a [[storage record|record]] (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted.\n\n[[Unicode]] text can optionally start with a [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In [[UTF-32]] for example, a big-endian file should start with {{code|00 00 FE FF|class=nowrap}}; a little-endian should start with {{code|FF FE 00 00|class=nowrap}}.\n\nApplication binary data formats, such as for example [[MATLAB]] <tt>.mat</tt> files, or the <tt>.bil</tt> data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by:\n# storing the data always in one fixed endianness, or \n# carrying with the data a switch to indicate which endianness the data was written with. \nWhen reading the file, the application converts the endianness, invisibly from the user. \nAn example of the first case is the binary [[XLS file]] format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little-endian, leaving the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}</ref>\n\n[[TIFF]] image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature {{code|MM}} it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while {{code|II}} means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are [[palindrome]]s (that is, they read the same forwards and backwards), so they are endianness independent. {{code|I}} stands for [[Intel]] and {{code|M}} stands for [[Motorola]], the respective [[CPU]] providers of the [[IBM PC]] compatibles (Intel) and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms (Motorola) in the 1980s. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.\n\nSince the required byte swap depends on the size of the numbers stored in the file (two 2-byte integers require a different swap than one 4-byte integer), the file format must be known to perform endianness conversion.\n\n=== Byte swap ===\nByte-swapping is a relatively simple routine. The simplest strategy, which is also the best-detected by compilers, consists simply of masking each byte and shifting them to the correct location:\n\n<source lang=c>\n/* C function to byte-swap a 32-bit integer */\nstatic uint32_t ChangeEndianness32(uint32_t value)\n{\n    uint32_t result = 0;\n    result |= (value & 0x000000FF) << 24;\n    result |= (value & 0x0000FF00) << 8;\n    result |= (value & 0x00FF0000) >> 8;\n    result |= (value & 0xFF000000) >> 24;\n    return result;\n}\n/* Larger byte-swaps can be constructed out of smaller ones */\nuint64_t ChangeEndianness64(uint64_t value)\n{\n    return (uint64_t)(ChangeEndianness32(value & 0xffffffff)) << 32\n                    | ChangeEndianness32(value >> 32);\n}\n</source>\n\nMany compilers provide [[Intrinsic function|built-ins]] that are more likely to be compiled into native processor instructions ({{code|bswap}}/{{code|movbe}}), such as {{code|__builtin_bswap32}}.\n\nSwapping to a known endianness is slightly harder as the program must determine what endianness it is using. Although this can be done at run-time by some code resembling the [[#C|C example]], it is much easier to just use a set of existing interfaces to do so. Such interfaces include:\n* Standard [[#Networking|network endianness]] functions (from/to BE, up to 32-bit).<ref>{{man|3|byteorder|Linux}}</ref> Windows has a 64-bit extension in {{code|winsocks2.h}}.\n* BSD and Glibc {{code|endian.h}} functions (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).<ref>{{man|3|endian|Linux}}</ref>\n* [[macOS]] {{code|OSByteOrder.h}} macros (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).\n\nTo speed things up, these interfaces are usually internally defined using macros or inline functions that adapt between swap and identity, according to what the compiler says about the platform endianness in macros, such as GCC's {{code|__BYTE_ORDER__}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pre-defined Compiler Macro: Endianness |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Endianness/ |website=sourceforge.net |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> The operation of byte-swap, like the identity operation, [[Inverse function#Self-inverses|is its own inverse]]. In other words, {{code|toSomeEndian}} and {{code|fromSomeEndian}} are essentially identical.\n\n==File systems==\nEndianness is also a problem when a [[file system]] created on a computer is processed on another computer with different endianness, because the values in the data structures maintained on the file system on [[secondary storage]] may be written in the endianness of the machine that created the file system.\n\nAs a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system is defined to use little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using other endiannesses natively, so code to read and write FAT file systems must byte-swap multi-byte values on non-little-endian processors.\n\n[[ZFS]]/[[OpenZFS]] combined [[file system]] and [[Logical volume management|logical volume manager]] is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.<ref>{{cite av media |url=http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Documentation/Read_Write_Lecture |title=FreeBSD Kernel Internals: An Intensive Code Walkthrough |author=Matt Ahrens |year=2016 |publisher=OpenZFS Documentation/Read Write Lecture }}</ref>\n\n==Networking==\nMany [[IETF RFC]]s use the term ''network order'', meaning the order of transmission for bits and bytes ''over the wire'' in [[network protocols]]. Among others, the historic RFC&nbsp;1700 (also known as [[Internet standard]] STD&nbsp;2) has defined the network order for protocols in the [[Internet protocol suite]] to be [[#Big-endian|big-endian]], hence the use of the term \"network byte order\" for big-endian byte order.<ref>\n{{cite IETF\n | title = Assigned Numbers\n | rfc = 1700\n | std = 2\n | sectionname = Data Notations\n | page = 3\n | last1 = Reynolds\n | first1 = J.\n | authorlink1 = Joyce K.

The [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) protocol uses little-endian byte order. In [[CANopen]], multi-byte parameters are always sent [[least significant byte]] first (little-endian). The same is true for [[Ethernet Powerlink]].<ref>Ethernet POWERLINK Standardisation Group (2012), ''EPSG Working Draft Proposal 301: Ethernet POWERLINK Communication Profile Specification Version 1.1.4'', chapter 6.1.1.</ref>\n\nThe [[Berkeley sockets]] [[application programming interface|API]] defines a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the {{code|htons}} (host-to-network-short) and {{code|htonl}} (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from machine (''host'') to network order; the {{code|ntohs}} and {{code|ntohl}} functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a [[no-op]] on a big-endian system.\n\nWhile the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as ''[[octet (computing)|octet]]'') as their atomic unit, the lowest network protocols may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.\n\n==Bit endianness==\n[[Bit numbering]] is a concept similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. ''Bit endianness'' or ''bit-level endianness'' refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in [[RS-232]], [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], and [[USB]]. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. [[Teletext]], [[I\u00b2C|I<sup>2</sup>C]], [[SMBus]], [[PMBus]], and [[synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]]<ref>Cf. Sec. 2.1 Bit Transmission of [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 \"Applicability Statement for PPP over SONET/SDH\"]</ref>). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception is caused by the feature of some [[cyclic redundancy check]]s to detect ''all'' [[burst error]]s up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.\n\nApart from serialization, the terms ''bit endianness'' and ''bit-level endianness'' are seldom used, as computer architectures where each individual bit has a unique address are rare. Individual bits or [[bit field]]s are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack [[software portability]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- other sources -->\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite IETF\n |last = Cohen |first = Danny\n |author-link = Danny Cohen (computer scientist)\n |title = On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace\n |date = 1980-04-01\n |url = https://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt\n |ien = 137\n |publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n }} <small>Also published at ''[[IEEE Computer]]'', [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1667115 October 1981 issue].</small>\n* {{cite journal\n |last = James |first = David V.\n |title = Multiplexed buses: the endian wars continue\n |journal = [[IEEE Micro]]\n |date = June 1990\n |volume = 10\n |issue = 3\n |pages = 9\u201321\n |doi = 10.1109/40.56322\n |issn = 0272-1732\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |last1 = Blanc |first1 = Bertrand \n |last2 = Maaraoui |first2 = Bob\n |title = Endianness or Where is Byte 0?\n |date = December 2005\n |url = http://3bc.bertrand-blanc.com/endianness05.pdf\n |access-date = 2008-12-21\n }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/ Understanding big and little endian byte order]\n* [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/ByteOrdering.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001150-CJBEJBHH Byte Ordering PPC]\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/articles/au-endianc/ Writing endian-independent code in C]\n\n[[Category:Computer memory]]\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Metaphors]]\n[[Category:Software wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect2|Big-endian|Little-endian|the conflicting ideologies in ''Gulliver's Travels''|Lilliput and Blefuscu#History and politics}}\n\nIn [[computing]], '''endianness''' refers to the order of [[byte|bytes]] (or sometimes [[bit|bits]]) within a [[binary_number|binary]] representation of a number. It can also be used more generally to refer to the internal ordering of any representation, such as the digits in a [[numeral system]] or the sections of a [[date format by country|date]].\n\nIn its most common usage, endianness indicates the ordering of bytes within a multi-byte number. A '''big-endian''' ordering places the [[most significant byte]] first and the [[least significant byte]] last, while a '''little-endian''' ordering does the opposite. For example, consider the [[signedness|unsigned]] [[hexadecimal]] number {{code|0x1234}}, which requires at least two bytes to represent. In a big-endian ordering they would be {{code|0x12 0x34|class=nowrap}}, while in a little-endian ordering, the bytes would be arranged {{code|0x34 0x12|class=nowrap}}.\n\nHistorically, various methods of endianness have been used in computing, including exotic forms such as middle-endianness. Today, however, big-endianness is the dominant ordering in networking protocols ([[Internet_Protocol|IP]], [[Transmission_Control_Protocol|TCP]], [[User_Datagram_Protocol|UDP]]). Conversely, little-endianness is the dominant ordering for processor architectures ([[x86]], most [[ARM architecture|ARM]] implementations) and their associated [[computer_memory|memory]]. [[file format|File formats]] can use either ordering; some formats use a mixture of both.\n\nIn [[Writing system#Directionality|left-to-right scripts]], numbers are written with their digits in big-endian order. Similarly, programming languages use big-endian digit ordering for numeric [[Literal_(computer_programming)|literals]] as well as big-endian language (\u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d) for [[Bitwise_operation#Logical_shift|bit-shift]] operations, regardless of the endianness of the target architecture. This can lead to confusion when interacting with little-endian numbers.\n\n==Illustration==\n\n[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|200px|Big-Endian|right]]\n[[Image:Little-Endian.svg|200px|Little-Endian|right]]\nThe following two descriptive illustrations assume a reading and writing convention of ''left to right'', where the left-most digit or character therefore corresponds to data being sent or received first, or being in the ''lowest address in memory'', and the right-most digit or character corresponds to the data being sent or received last, or being in the ''highest'' address in memory.\n\nBig-endianness may be demonstrated by writing a decimal number, say one hundred twenty-three, on paper in the usual [[positional notation]] understood by a numerate reader: ''123''. The digits are written starting from the left and to the right, with the most significant digit, ''1'', written first. This is analogous to the lowest [[memory address|address of memory]] being used first. This is an example of a big-endian convention taken from daily life.\n\nThe little-endian way of writing the same number, one hundred twenty-three, would place the hundreds-digit ''1'' in the right-most position: ''321''. A person following conventional big-endian place-value order, who is not aware of this special ordering, would read a different number: three hundred twenty-one. Endianness in computing is similar, but it usually applies to the ordering of bytes, rather than of digits.\n\nThe illustrations to the right, where ''a'' is a memory address, show big-endian and little-endian storage in memory.\n\n== Etymology ==\n[[Danny Cohen (computer scientist)|Danny Cohen]] introduced the terms ''Little-Endian'' and ''Big-Endian'' for byte ordering in an article published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) in 1980.<ref name=\"HOLY\">{{cite IETF\n|title = On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace\n|ien = 137\n|last = Cohen |first = Danny\n|author-link = Danny Cohen (computer scientist)\n|date = 1980-04-01\n|url = http://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt\n|quote = \u2026which bit should  travel first, the bit from the little end of the word, or the bit from the big end of the word?

Each cell is identified in hardware and software by its [[memory address]]. If the total number of storage cells in memory is ''n'', then addresses are enumerated from 0 to ''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1. Computer programs often use data structures of [[Field (computer science)|fields]] that may consist of more data than is stored in one memory cell. For the purpose of this article where its use as an operand of an instruction is relevant, a field consists of a consecutive sequence of [[byte]]s and represents a simple data value. In addition to that, it has to be of numeric type in some [[Positional notation|positional number system]] (mostly base 10 or base 2 \u2013 or base 256 in case of 8-bit bytes).{{NoteTag|When character (text) strings are compared with one another, this is done [[Lexicographical order|lexicographically]] where a single positional element (character) also has a positional value. Lexicographical comparison means almost everywhere: first character ranks highest \u2013 as in the telephone book. This would have the consequence that almost every machine would be big-endian or at least mixed-endian. Therefore, for the criterion below to apply, the data type in question has to be ''numeric''.}} In such a number system the \"value\" of a digit is determined not only by its value as a single digit, but also by the position it holds in the complete number, its \"significance\".

Big-endian memory representation is commonly referred to as [[Endianness#Networking|network order]], as used in the [[Internet protocol suite]].  Other processor types use little-endian memory representation; others use yet another scheme called \"[[Endianness#Middle|middle-endian]]\", \"mixed-endian\" or \"[[PDP-11]]-endian\".\n\nThe [[IBM System/360]] uses big-endian byte order, as do its successors [[System/370]], [[ESA/390]], and [[z/Architecture]]. The [[PDP-10]] also uses big-endian addressing for byte-oriented instructions.  The [[IBM Series/1]] minicomputer also use big-endian byte order.\n\nDealing with data of different endianness is sometimes termed the ''NUXI problem''.<ref>{{cite web\n |title = NUXI problem\n |work = The [[Jargon File]]\n |url = http://catb.org/jargon/html/N/NUXI-problem.html\n |access-date = 2008-12-20\n}}</ref> This terminology alludes to the byte order conflicts encountered while [[Porting|adapting]] [[UNIX]], which ran on the mixed-endian PDP-11, to a big-endian IBM Series/1 computer.

The [[ARM architecture]] was little-endian before version 3 when it became bi-endian.\n\n=== Current architectures ===\nThe Intel [[x86]] and AMD64 / [[x86-64]] series of processors use the little-endian format. Other instruction set architectures that follow this convention, allowing only little-endian mode, include [[Nios II]], [[Andes Technology]] NDS32, and [[Qualcomm Hexagon]].\n\nSome instruction set architectures allow running software of either endianness on a bi-endian architecture.  This includes ARM [[Aarch64]], [[C-Sky]], [[Power ISA]], and [[RISC-V]].\n\nSolely big-endian architectures include the IBM [[z/Architecture]], [[Freescale ColdFire]] (which is [[Motorola 68000 series]]-based), Atmel [[AVR32]], and [[OpenRISC]]. The [[IBM AIX]] and [[Oracle Solaris]] operating systems on bi-endian [[Power ISA]] and [[SPARC]] run in big-endian mode; some distributions of [[Linux]] on Power have moved to little-endian mode.\n\n{{anchor|Bi-endian hardware}}\n\n=== Bi-endianness ===\n<!-- Yes, that's bi, not big. \"Bi\" here means \"both of them\", i.e. switchable between big- & little-endianness. -->\nSome architectures (including [[ARM architecture|ARM]] versions 3 and above, [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[SPARC]] V9, [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[PA-RISC]], [[SuperH|SuperH SH-4]] and [[IA-64]]) feature a setting which allows for switchable endianness in data fetches and stores, instruction fetches, or both. This feature can improve performance or simplify the logic of networking devices and software. The word ''bi-endian'', when said of hardware, denotes the capability of the machine to compute or pass data in either endian format.\n\nMany of these architectures can be switched via software to default to a specific endian format (usually done when the computer starts up); however, on some systems the default endianness is selected by hardware on the motherboard and cannot be changed via software (e.g. the Alpha, which runs only in big-endian mode on the [[Cray T3E]]).\n\nNote that the term \"bi-endian\" refers primarily to how a processor treats ''data'' accesses. ''Instruction'' accesses (fetches of instruction words) on a given processor may still assume a fixed endianness, even if ''data'' accesses are fully bi-endian, though this is not always the case, such as on Intel's [[IA-64]]-based Itanium CPU, which allows both.\n\nNote, too, that some nominally bi-endian CPUs require motherboard help to fully switch endianness. For instance, the 32-bit desktop-oriented [[PowerPC]] processors in little-endian mode act as little-endian from the point of view of the executing programs, but they require the motherboard to perform a 64-bit swap across all 8 byte lanes to ensure that the little-endian view of things will apply to [[Input/Output|I/O]] devices. In the absence of this unusual motherboard hardware, device driver software must write to different addresses to undo the incomplete transformation and also must perform a normal byte swap.\n\nSome CPUs, such as many PowerPC processors intended for embedded use and almost all SPARC processors, allow per-page choice of endianness.\n\nSPARC processors since the late 1990s (\"SPARC v9\" compliant processors) allow data endianness to be chosen with each individual instruction that loads from or stores to memory.\n\nThe [[ARM architecture]] supports two big-endian modes, called '''BE-8''' and '''BE-32'''.<ref>{{cite web|title=Differences between BE-32 and BE-8 buses|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/index.jsp?topic=/com.arm.doc.ddi0290g/ch06s05s01.html}}</ref> CPUs up to ARMv5 only support BE-32 or '''Word-Invariant''' mode. Here any naturally aligned 32-bit access works like in little-endian mode, but access to a byte or 16-bit word is redirected to the corresponding address and unaligned access is not allowed. ARMv6 introduces BE-8 or '''Byte-Invariant''' mode, where access to a single byte works as in little-endian mode, but accessing a 16-bit, 32-bit or (starting with ARMv8) 64-bit word results in a byte swap of the data. This simplifies unaligned memory access as well as memory mapped access to registers other than 32 bit. With ARMv7 and later, only BE-8 mode is allowed.{{clarify |date=March 2019 |reason=The use of \"little-endian\" in this paragraph gives the impression that this is not really big-endian. Possibly give examples for both cases.}}\n\nMany processors have instructions to convert a word in a register to the opposite endianness, that is, they swap the order of the bytes in a 16-, 32- or 64-bit word. All the individual bits are not reversed though.\n\nRecent Intel x86 and x86-64 architecture CPUs have a MOVBE instruction ([[Intel Core]] since generation 4, after [[Intel Atom|Atom]]),<ref>{{cite web |title = How to detect New Instruction support in the 4th generation Intel\u00ae Core\u2122 processor family |url = https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/article/405250/how-to-detect-new-instruction-support-in-the-4th-generation-intel-core-processor-family.pdf |access-date = 2 May 2017 }}</ref> which fetches a big-endian format word from memory or writes a word into memory in big-endian format. These processors are otherwise thoroughly little-endian. They also already had a range of swap instructions to reverse the byte order of the contents of registers, such as when words have already been fetched from memory locations where they were in the 'wrong' endianness.\n\n===Floating point===\n{{anchor|Floating-point and endianness}}<!-- This section is transcluded on the [[Double-precision floating point]] article -->\n<section begin=\"Floating-point\" />\nAlthough the ubiquitous x86 processors of today use little-endian storage for all types of data (integer, floating point, [[binary coded decimal|BCD]]), there are a number of hardware architectures where [[floating-point]] numbers are represented in big-endian form while integers are represented in little-endian form.<ref>{{citation |title=Floating-Point Formats |author-first=John J.

Because there have been many floating-point formats with no \"[[Computer network|network]]\" standard representation for them, the [[External Data Representation|XDR]] standard uses big-endian IEEE 754 as its representation. It may therefore appear strange that the widespread [[IEEE 754]] floating-point standard does not specify endianness.<ref>{{cite web |title = pack \u2013 convert a list into a binary representation |url = http://www.perl.com/doc/manual/html/pod/perlfunc/pack.html }}</ref> Theoretically, this means that even standard IEEE floating-point data written by one machine might not be readable by another. However, on modern standard computers (i.e., implementing IEEE 754), one may in practice safely assume that the endianness is the same for floating-point numbers as for integers, making the conversion straightforward regardless of data type. (Small [[embedded system]]s using special floating-point formats may be another matter however.)<section end=\"Floating-point\" />\n\n=== Optimization ===\nThe little-endian system has the property that the same value can be read from memory at different lengths without using different addresses (even when [[byte alignment|alignment]] restrictions are imposed). For example, a 32-bit memory location with content {{code|4A 00 00 00|class=nowrap}} can be read at the same address as either [[8-bit]] (value = 4A), [[16-bit]] (004A), [[24-bit]] (00004A), or [[32-bit]] (0000004A), all of which retain the same numeric value. Although this little-endian property is rarely used directly by high-level programmers, it is often employed by code optimizers as well as by [[assembly language]] programmers.\n\nIn more concrete terms, such optimizations are the equivalent of the following [[C (programming language)|C code]] returning true on most little-endian systems:\n\n<source lang=\"C\">\nunion {\n  uint8_t u8; uint16_t u16; uint32_t u32; uint64_t u64;\n} u = { .u64 = 0x4A };\nputs(u.u8 == u.u16 && u.u8 == u.u32 && u.u8 == u.u64 ? \"true\" : \"false\");\n</source>\n\nWhile not allowed by C++, such [[type punning]] code is allowed as \"implementation-defined\" by the C11 standard<ref>{{cite web |title = C11 standard |url = https://www.iso.org/standard/57853.html |publisher = ISO |access-date=15 August 2018 |at = Section 6.5.2.3 \"Structure and Union members\", \u00a73 and footnote 95 |quote = 95) If the member used to read the contents of a union object is not the same as the member last used to store a value in the object, the appropriate part of the object representation of the value is reinterpreted as an object representation in the new type as described in 6.2.6 (a process sometimes called \u201ctype punning\u201d).}}</ref> and commonly used<ref>{{cite web |title=3.10 Options That Control Optimization: -fstrict-aliasing |url=https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html#Type-punning |website=GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) |publisher=Free Software Foundation |accessdate=15 August 2018}}</ref> in code interacting with hardware.<ref>{{cite mailing list |first=Linus |last=Torvalds |title=[GIT PULL] Device properties framework update for v4.18-rc1 |url=https://lkml.org/lkml/2018/6/5/769 |mailing-list=Linux Kernel|accessdate=15 August 2018 | date=5 Jun 2018 |quote=The fact is, using a union to do type punning is the traditional AND STANDARD way to do type punning in gcc.

As carry propagation must start at the least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told how big the addition is going to be so that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in the same amount of time they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.\n\n==Mapping multi-byte binary values to memory==\n<!-- \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#DDDDFF;\"\n|}\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center; float:left;\"\n|-\n-->\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center; float:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\" | ||style=\"width:2em;\" | || colspan=\"4\" | Big-Endian ||style=\"width:2em;\" | || colspan=\"4\" | Little-Endian ||style=\"width:.8em;\" | \n|-\n| ''C-type'' || ''name'' || ''initial value'' || ||  colspan=\"4\" | ''memory at offset'' || || colspan=\"4\" | ''memory at offset'' ||\n|-\n| colspan=\"3\" | ''of variable'' || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +0 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +1 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +2 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +3 || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +0 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +1 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +2 ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | +3 ||\n|-\n| {{code|int32_t}} || longVar || = 0x0a0b0c0d; || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> ||\n|-\n| {{code|int16_t}} || shortVar || = 0x0c0d; || \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> || colspan=\"2\" | ||  \n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> ||style=\"border: 1px solid;\" | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> || colspan=\"2\" | ||\n|-\n|colspan=\"14\" | <small>A simple way to remember is \"In {{em|L}}ittle-Endian, the {{em|L}}east significant byte goes into the {{em|L}}owest-addressed slot\".<br />So in the example in the table, <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>, the least significant byte, in a Little-Endian system goes into slot +0.</small>\n|}\n\nWe can assume that as we write text ''left to right'', we are increasing the 'address' on paper, as a processor would write bytes with increasing memory addresses &mdash; as in the adjacent table. On paper, the hex value <tt>0a0b0c0d</tt> (written 168496141 in usual decimal notation) is big-endian style since we write the most significant digit first and the rest follow in '''''de'''creasing'' significance. Mapping this number as a binary value to a sequence of 4 bytes in memory in big-endian style also writes the bytes from ''left to right'' in '''''de'''creasing'' significance: <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> at +0, <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> at +1, <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> at +2, <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> at +3.\n\nOn a little-endian system, the bytes are written from ''left to right'' in '''''in'''creasing'' significance, starting with the one's byte: <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt> at +0, <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt> at +1, <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt> at +2, <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> at +3. Writing a 32-bit binary value to a memory location on a little-endian system and outputting the memory location (with growing addresses from left to right) shows that the order is ''reversed'' (byte-swapped) compared to usual big-endian notation. This is the way a [[hexdump]] is displayed: because the dumping program is unable to know what kind of data it is dumping, the only orientation it can observe is monotonically increasing addresses. The human reader, however, who knows that they are reading a hexdump of a little-endian system and who knows what kind of data they are reading, reads the byte sequence <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>,<tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt> as the 32-bit binary value 168496141, or <tt>0x0a0b0c0d</tt> in hexadecimal notation. (Of course, this is ''not'' the same as the number <tt>0D0C0B0A<sub>h</sub></tt> = <tt>0x0d0c0b0a</tt> = 218893066.)\n\n==Examples==\nThis section provides example layouts of the 32-bit number 0A0B0C0D<sub>h</sub> in the most common variants of endianness. There exist several digital processors that use other formats. That is true for typical [[embedded system]]s as well as for general computer CPUs. Most processors used in non CPU roles in typical computers (in storage units, peripherals etc.) also use one of these two basic formats, although not always 32-bit.\n\nSome machines use addressable \"atoms\" of other sizes, such as 9-bit and 16-bit. They are laid out analogously in memory, in most or least-significant-word first order.\n\nThe examples refer to the storage in memory of the value. It uses [[hexadecimal]] notation.\n\n==={{anchor|Big}}Big-endian===\n[[Image:Big-Endian.svg|right]]\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|+ style=\"font-weight: bold\" | Big-endian, 8-bit atoms, 1-octet address\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\nThe [[most significant byte]] (MSB) value, <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>, is at the lowest address.

This ordering is known as ''PDP-endian''.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/dec/pdp11/handbooks/PDP1145_Handbook_1973.pdf|title=PDP-11/45 Processor Handbook|page=165|year=1973|publisher=[[Digital Equipment Corporation]]}}</ref>\n\nA way to interpret this endianness is that it stores an 32-bit integer as two 16-bit words in big-endian, but the words themselves are little-endian:\n\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|+Storage of a 32-bit integer, <tt>0x0A0B0C0D</tt>, on a PDP-11\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0A<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>0C<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" colspan=\"2\"           | <tt>0A0B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\" colspan=\"2\"           | <tt>0C0D<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\n(The 16-bit values here refer to their numerical values, not their actual layout.)\n\nThe [[ARM architecture]] can also produce this format when writing a 32-bit word to an address 2 bytes from a 32-bit word [[data structure alignment|alignment]].{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n==== Honeywell 316 ====\nThe [[Honeywell 316]], also a series of 16-bit computers, happen to be the opposite of PDP-11 when it comes to storing 32-bit words in C.

In other words, it appears backwards when visualized, an oddity for programmers.\n\nThis behavior is mainly a concern for programmers utilizing [[FourCC]] or similar techniques that involve packing characters into an integer, so that it becomes a sequences of specific characters in memory. Let's define the notation {{code|'Wiki'}} as simply the result of writing the characters in hexadecimal [[ASCII]] and appending {{code|0x}} to the front, and analogously for shorter sequences (a [[C_syntax#Character_constants|C multicharacter literal]], in Unix/MacOS style):\n\n    '  W  i  k  i  '\n hex  57 69 6B 69\n ----------------\n    -> 0x57696B69\n\nOn big-endian machines, the value appears left-to-right, coinciding with the correct string order for reading the result:\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>57<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>6B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'W'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'k'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\n\n\nBut on a little-endian machine, one would see:\n{| cellpadding=\"4\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; margin: 0.4em 0.4em; text-align: center;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"6\" |''increasing addresses''&nbsp;&nbsp;\u2192\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>6B<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>69<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>57<sub>h</sub></tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|-\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-left: hidden;\"  | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'k'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'i'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid;\"                       | <tt>'W'</tt>\n|style=\"border: 1px solid; border-right: hidden;\" | <tt>\u2026</tt>\n|}\n\nMiddle-endian machines like the Honeywell 316 above complicate this even further: the 32-bit value is stored as two 16-bit words {{mono|'ki'}} {{mono|'Wi'}} in little-endian, themselves with a big-endian notation (thus {{mono|'k' 'i' 'W' 'i'}}).\n\nThis conflict between the memory arrangements of binary data and text is intrinsic to the nature of the little-endian convention, but is a conflict only for languages written left-to-right, such as English. For right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic]] and [[Hebrew]], there is no conflict of text with binary, and the preferred display in both cases would be with addresses increasing to the left. (On the other hand, right-to-left languages have a complementary intrinsic conflict in the big-endian system.)\n\n==Files and byte swap==\nEndianness is a problem when a binary file created on a computer is read on another computer with different endianness. Some [[CPU]] instruction sets provide native support for endian byte swapping, such as {{code|bswap}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/content/dam/www/public/us/en/documents/manuals/64-ia-32-architectures-software-developer-instruction-set-reference-manual-325383.pdf|title=Intel 64 and IA-32 Architectures Software Developer's Manual Volume 2 (2A, 2B & 2C): Instruction Set Reference, A-Z|at=p. 3\u2013112|publisher=Intel|date=September 2016|accessdate=2017-02-05}}</ref> ([[x86]] - [[Intel 80486|486]] and later), and {{code|rev}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ddi0487a.k_10775/index.html|title=ARMv8-A Reference Manual|publisher=[[ARM Holdings]]}}</ref> ([[ARM architecture|ARMv6]] and later).\n\nSome [[compiler]]s have built-in facilities to deal with data written in other formats. For example, the [[Intel]] [[Fortran]] compiler supports the non-standard {{code|CONVERT}} specifier, so a file can be opened as\n:{{code|1=OPEN(unit,CONVERT='BIG_ENDIAN',...)|lang=Fortran}}\nor\n:{{code|1=OPEN(unit,CONVERT='LITTLE_ENDIAN',...)|lang=Fortran}}\nSome compilers have options to generate code that globally enables the conversion for all file IO operations. This allows programmers to reuse code on a system with the opposite endianness without having to modify the code itself. If the compiler does not support such conversion, the programmer needs to swap the bytes via ad hoc code.\n\nFortran sequential unformatted files created with one endianness usually cannot be read on a system using the other endianness because Fortran usually implements a [[storage record|record]] (defined as the data written by a single Fortran statement) as data preceded and succeeded by count fields, which are integers equal to the number of bytes in the data. An attempt to read such file on a system of the other endianness then results in a run-time error, because the count fields are incorrect. This problem can be avoided by writing out sequential binary files as opposed to sequential unformatted.\n\n[[Unicode]] text can optionally start with a [[byte order mark]] (BOM) to signal the endianness of the file or stream. Its code point is U+FEFF. In [[UTF-32]] for example, a big-endian file should start with {{code|00 00 FE FF|class=nowrap}}; a little-endian should start with {{code|FF FE 00 00|class=nowrap}}.\n\nApplication binary data formats, such as for example [[MATLAB]] <tt>.mat</tt> files, or the <tt>.bil</tt> data format, used in topography, are usually endianness-independent. This is achieved by:\n# storing the data always in one fixed endianness, or \n# carrying with the data a switch to indicate which endianness the data was written with. \nWhen reading the file, the application converts the endianness, invisibly from the user. \nAn example of the first case is the binary [[XLS file]] format that is portable between Windows and Mac systems and always little-endian, leaving the Mac application to swap the bytes on load and save when running on a big-endian Motorola 68K or PowerPC processor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/B/E/0BE8BDD7-E5E8-422A-ABFD-4342ED7AD886/Excel97-2007BinaryFileFormat(xls)Specification.xps |title=Microsoft Office Excel 97 - 2007 Binary File Format Specification (*.xls 97-2007 format) |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Corporation }}</ref>\n\n[[TIFF]] image files are an example of the second strategy, whose header instructs the application about endianness of their internal binary integers. If a file starts with the signature {{code|MM}} it means that integers are represented as big-endian, while {{code|II}} means little-endian. Those signatures need a single 16-bit word each, and they are [[palindrome]]s (that is, they read the same forwards and backwards), so they are endianness independent. {{code|I}} stands for [[Intel]] and {{code|M}} stands for [[Motorola]], the respective [[CPU]] providers of the [[IBM PC]] compatibles (Intel) and [[Apple Macintosh]] platforms (Motorola) in the 1980s. Intel CPUs are little-endian, while Motorola 680x0 CPUs are big-endian. This explicit signature allows a TIFF reader program to swap bytes if necessary when a given file was generated by a TIFF writer program running on a computer with a different endianness.\n\nSince the required byte swap depends on the size of the numbers stored in the file (two 2-byte integers require a different swap than one 4-byte integer), the file format must be known to perform endianness conversion.\n\n=== Byte swap ===\nByte-swapping is a relatively simple routine. The simplest strategy, which is also the best-detected by compilers, consists simply of masking each byte and shifting them to the correct location:\n\n<source lang=c>\n/* C function to byte-swap a 32-bit integer */\nstatic uint32_t ChangeEndianness32(uint32_t value)\n{\n    uint32_t result = 0;\n    result |= (value & 0x000000FF) << 24;\n    result |= (value & 0x0000FF00) << 8;\n    result |= (value & 0x00FF0000) >> 8;\n    result |= (value & 0xFF000000) >> 24;\n    return result;\n}\n/* Larger byte-swaps can be constructed out of smaller ones */\nuint64_t ChangeEndianness64(uint64_t value)\n{\n    return (uint64_t)(ChangeEndianness32(value & 0xffffffff)) << 32\n                    | ChangeEndianness32(value >> 32);\n}\n</source>\n\nMany compilers provide [[Intrinsic function|built-ins]] that are more likely to be compiled into native processor instructions ({{code|bswap}}/{{code|movbe}}), such as {{code|__builtin_bswap32}}.\n\nSwapping to a known endianness is slightly harder as the program must determine what endianness it is using. Although this can be done at run-time by some code resembling the [[#C|C example]], it is much easier to just use a set of existing interfaces to do so. Such interfaces include:\n* Standard [[#Networking|network endianness]] functions (from/to BE, up to 32-bit).<ref>{{man|3|byteorder|Linux}}</ref> Windows has a 64-bit extension in {{code|winsocks2.h}}.\n* BSD and Glibc {{code|endian.h}} functions (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).<ref>{{man|3|endian|Linux}}</ref>\n* [[macOS]] {{code|OSByteOrder.h}} macros (from/to BE and LE, up to 64-bit).\n\nTo speed things up, these interfaces are usually internally defined using macros or inline functions that adapt between swap and identity, according to what the compiler says about the platform endianness in macros, such as GCC's {{code|__BYTE_ORDER__}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pre-defined Compiler Macro: Endianness |url=https://sourceforge.net/p/predef/wiki/Endianness/ |website=sourceforge.net |accessdate=19 November 2019}}</ref> The operation of byte-swap, like the identity operation, [[Inverse_function#Self-inverses|is its own inverse]]. In other words, {{code|toSomeEndian}} and {{code|fromSomeEndian}} are essentially identical.\n\n==File systems==\nEndianness is also a problem when a [[file system]] created on a computer is processed on another computer with different endianness, because the values in the data structures maintained on the file system on [[secondary storage]] may be written in the endianness of the machine that created the file system.\n\nAs a consequence of its original implementation on the Intel 8080 platform, the operating system-independent [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system is defined to use little-endian byte ordering, even on platforms using other endiannesses natively, so code to read and write FAT file systems must byte-swap multi-byte values on non-little-endian processors.\n\n[[ZFS]]/[[OpenZFS]] combined [[file system]] and [[Logical volume management|logical volume manager]] is known to provide adaptive endianness and to work with both big-endian and little-endian systems.<ref>{{cite av media |url=http://open-zfs.org/wiki/Documentation/Read_Write_Lecture |title=FreeBSD Kernel Internals: An Intensive Code Walkthrough |author=Matt Ahrens |year=2016 |publisher=OpenZFS Documentation/Read Write Lecture }}</ref>\n\n==Networking==\nMany [[IETF RFC]]s use the term ''network order'', meaning the order of transmission for bits and bytes ''over the wire'' in [[network protocols]]. Among others, the historic RFC&nbsp;1700 (also known as [[Internet standard]] STD&nbsp;2) has defined the network order for protocols in the [[Internet protocol suite]] to be [[#Big-endian|big-endian]], hence the use of the term \"network byte order\" for big-endian byte order.<ref>\n{{cite IETF\n    | title = Assigned Numbers\n    | rfc = 1700\n    | std = 2\n    | sectionname = Data Notations\n    | page = 3\n    | last1 = Reynolds\n    | first1 = J.\n    | authorlink1 = Joyce K.

The [[Server Message Block]] (SMB) protocol uses little-endian byte order.  In [[CANopen]], multi-byte parameters are always sent [[least significant byte]] first (little-endian). The same is true for [[Ethernet Powerlink]].<ref>Ethernet POWERLINK Standardisation Group (2012), ''EPSG Working Draft Proposal 301: Ethernet POWERLINK Communication Profile Specification Version 1.1.4'', chapter 6.1.1.</ref>\n\nThe [[Berkeley sockets]] [[application programming interface|API]] defines a set of functions to convert 16-bit and 32-bit integers to and from network byte order: the {{code|htons}} (host-to-network-short) and {{code|htonl}} (host-to-network-long) functions convert 16-bit and 32-bit values respectively from machine (''host'') to network order; the {{code|ntohs}} and {{code|ntohl}} functions convert from network to host order. These functions may be a [[no-op]] on a big-endian system.\n\nWhile the high-level network protocols usually consider the byte (mostly meant as ''[[octet (computing)|octet]]'') as their atomic unit, the lowest network protocols may deal with ordering of bits within a byte.\n\n==Bit endianness==\n[[Bit numbering]] is a concept similar to endianness, but on a level of bits, not bytes. ''Bit endianness'' or ''bit-level endianness'' refers to the transmission order of bits over a serial medium. The bit-level analogue of little-endian (least significant bit goes first) is used in [[RS-232]], [[HDLC]], [[Ethernet]], and [[USB]]. Some protocols use the opposite ordering (e.g. [[Teletext]], [[I\u00b2C|I<sup>2</sup>C]], [[SMBus]], [[PMBus]], and [[synchronous optical networking|SONET and SDH]]<ref>Cf. Sec. 2.1 Bit Transmission of [http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 draft-ietf-pppext-sonet-as-00 \"Applicability Statement for PPP over SONET/SDH\"]</ref>). Usually, there exists a consistent view to the bits irrespective of their order in the byte, such that the latter becomes relevant only on a very low level. One exception is caused by the feature of some [[cyclic redundancy check]]s to detect ''all'' [[burst error]]s up to a known length, which would be spoiled if the bit order is different from the byte order on serial transmission.\n\nApart from serialization, the terms ''bit endianness'' and ''bit-level endianness'' are seldom used, as computer architectures where each individual bit has a unique address are rare. Individual bits or [[bit field]]s are accessed via their numerical value or, in high-level programming languages, assigned names, the effects of which, however, may be machine dependent or lack [[software portability]].\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n* {{FOLDOC}}\n{{refbegin}}\n<!-- other sources -->\n{{refend}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite IETF\n |last = Cohen |first = Danny\n |author-link = Danny Cohen (computer scientist)\n |title = On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace\n |date = 1980-04-01\n |url = https://www.ietf.org/rfc/ien/ien137.txt\n |ien = 137\n |publisher = [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]\n }} <small>Also published at ''[[IEEE Computer]]'', [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/1667115 October 1981 issue].</small>\n* {{cite journal\n |last = James |first = David V.\n |title = Multiplexed buses: the endian wars continue\n |journal = [[IEEE Micro]]\n |date = June 1990\n |volume = 10\n |issue = 3\n |pages = 9\u201321\n |doi = 10.1109/40.56322\n |issn = 0272-1732\n }}\n* {{cite journal\n |last1 = Blanc |first1 = Bertrand \n |last2 = Maaraoui |first2 = Bob\n |title = Endianness or Where is Byte 0?\n |date = December 2005\n |url = http://3bc.bertrand-blanc.com/endianness05.pdf\n |access-date = 2008-12-21\n }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://betterexplained.com/articles/understanding-big-and-little-endian-byte-order/ Understanding big and little endian byte order]\n* [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFMemoryMgmt/Concepts/ByteOrdering.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/20001150-CJBEJBHH Byte Ordering PPC]\n* [https://developer.ibm.com/articles/au-endianc/ Writing endian-independent code in C]\n\n[[Category:Computer memory]]\n[[Category:Data transmission]]\n[[Category:Metaphors]]\n[[Category:Software wars]]\n", "name_user": "Jamesmcmahon0", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: \u2026 \u2192 ...

It consists of a lower school for [[pre-kindergarten|2K]]-4th graders, a middle school for 5th-8th graders, and an upper school for 9th-12th graders.\n\n== History ==\nSpartanburg Day School was established on September 12, 1957 at the Drayton Mill Community Building, with 35 students in 1st\u20135th grades. As more upper-level grades were needed, a new location for SDS was established on Skylyn Drive, where the school is currently located. In October 1962, the new campus was officially opened. The lower school did not move to the current campus until 1993.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWhen the families of foreign expatriates began moving to the Greenville-Spartanburg area in the 20th century, most of the children attended Spartanburg Country Day School.<ref name=Kanter>Kanter, Rosabeth Moss.

SDS offers [[cross country running|cross country]], [[volleyball]], [[soccer]], [[physical education]], [[tennis]], [[basketball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[cheerleading]], [[baseball]], [[lacrosse]], [[golf]], and [[track and field]].<ref>[http://www.spartanburgdayschool.org/athletics/teams_and_schedules.asp List of athletic programs]</ref> The school does not deny students from participating in its athletic programs due to inexperience or ability.<ref>[http://www.spartanburgdayschool.org/athletics/overview.asp Overview of SDS athletics]</ref> SDS has enjoyed much athletic success in recent years, including back-to-back baseball state championships in 2001 and 2002, as well as state championship teams in men's and women's tennis.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== Events ==\n{{citations needed|date=July 2017}}\nSpartanburg Day School provides students with a number of after-school programs throughout the year.\n\n=== Fall Festival ===\nThe activities at the Fall Festival are aimed towards lower school students, although all students are welcome to attend. Games and prizes motivate the students to come. Juniors are required to attend Fall Festival because it is a main fundraiser for the Junior-Senior prom.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n=== Special studies ===\nBeginning in 1996, one week out of every year in March, upper school students are able to \"engage in a non-traditional learning activity\". Examples of special studies activities include trips to [[Puerto Rico]], [[Italy]], and [[Toronto]], and working with [[Habitat for Humanity]]. Activities located on campus include Independent Women, The Art of Movies, and [[Photoshop]]. Each student is required to either attend a special studies activity or come up with their own.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\n== Bands ==\nSpartanburg Day School currently has five bands, all directed by Dick Barnes. He also teaches ballroom dance to the 6th grade and teaches the 5th grade to play the recorder. The bands are the Middle School Concert Band, the Middle School Honor Band, the Middle School Jazz Band, the Upper School Band, the Upper School Jazz Band. Several of these require an audition, but not all. \n\nThe bands have done consistently well at all-state festivals. The High school Jazz band has earned Superiors at the past seven state festivals. Recently, The Highschool Jass band and Concert band have won the grand champion awards at both the Orlando festival event and the Virginia Festival event competing against Hundreds of other schools from across the nation. On March 3, 2007, the Middle School Jazz Band earned a Superior at the State Jazz festival. This was the first time the Middle School had ever earned a Superior at any state festival. The SDS Middle School Honors Band was awarded the Outstanding Performance Award in the spring of 2007 after receiving enough Superiors at the state Solo and Ensemble festival. In 2009, all 6th-grade students signed up for Beginning Band, even though the course was completely optional.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n== Seniors ==\nSeniors at Spartanburg Day School have special privileges, which include a special area that only they can enter, called the Senior Lounge.

It consists of a lower school for [[pre-kindergarten|2K]]-4th graders, a middle school for 5th-8th graders, and an upper school for 9th-12th graders.\n\n== History ==\nSpartanburg Day School was established on September 12, 1957 at the Drayton Mill Community Building, with 35 students in 1st\u20135th grades. As more upper-level grades were needed, a new location for SDS was established on Skylyn Drive, where the school is currently located. In October 1962, the new campus was officially opened. The lower school did not move to the current campus until 1993.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWhen the families of foreign expatriates began moving to the Greenville-Spartanburg area in the 20th century, most of the children attended Spartanburg Country Day School.<ref name=Kanter>Kanter, Rosabeth Moss.

He also teaches ballroom dance to the 6th grade and teaches the 5th grade to play the recorder. The bands are the Middle School Concert Band, the Middle School Honor Band, the Middle School Jazz Band, the Upper School Band, the Upper School Jazz Band. Several of these require an audition, but not all. \n\nThe bands have done consistently well at all-state festivals. The High school Jazz band has earned Superiors at the past seven state festivals. Recently, The Highschool Jass band and Concert band have won the grand champion awards at both the Orlando festival event and the Virginia Festival event competing against Hundreds of other schools from across the nation. On March 3, 2007, the Middle School Jazz Band earned a Superior at the State Jazz festival. This was the first time the Middle School had ever earned a Superior at any state festival. The SDS Middle School Honors Band was awarded the Outstanding Performance Award in the spring of 2007 after receiving enough Superiors at the state Solo and Ensemble festival.

In the event of an emergency, such as the ship sinking or an airplane crash, the transmitter is activated and begins transmitting a continuous radio signal which is used by search and rescue teams to quickly locate the emergency and render aid. The signal is detected by [[satellite]]s operated by an international consortium of rescue services, [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|COSPAS-SARSAT]]. The basic purpose of this system is to help rescuers find survivors within the so-called \"golden day\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100209202108/http://www1.va.gov/emshg/apps/kml/docs/CERT_Manual.pdf Community Emergency Response Team Participant Handbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (the first 24 hours following a traumatic event) during which the majority of survivors can usually be saved. The feature distinguishing modern EPIRBs, often called GPIRBs, from other types of emergency beacon is that it contains a [[GPS receiver]] and broadcasts its position, usually accurate within {{convert|100|m}}, to facilitate location.\n\nThe standard frequency of a modern EPIRB is 406&nbsp;MHz.

'''COSPAS''' (\u041a\u041e\u0421\u041f\u0410\u0421) is an [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] for the Russian words \"'''Co'''smicheskaya '''S'''istema '''P'''oiska '''A'''variynyh '''S'''udov\" (\u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0410\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432), which translates to \"Space System for the Search of Vessels in Distress\". A consortium of Russia, the U.S., Canada and France formed the organization in 1982. Since then, 29 others have joined.\n\nThe satellites used in the system include:\n* SARSAT (US/Canada/France LEO)\n* COSPAS (Russia LEO)\n* GOES (US geostationary)\n* MSG (European geostationary)\n* INSAT (Indian geostationary)\n* ELEKTRO/LUCH (Russia geostationary)\n\nCospas-Sarsat defines standards for beacons, auxiliary equipment to be mounted on conforming weather and communication satellites, ground stations, and communications methods. The satellites communicate the beacon data to their ground stations, which forward it to main control centers of each nation that can initiate a rescue effort.\n\n== Detection and location ==\n[[File:Radiogoniom\u00e9trie_VHF.JPG|thumb|VHF radio direction finding]]\nA transmission is typically detected and processed in this manner:\n# The transmitter is activated, either automatically in a crash or after sinking, or manually by survivors of an emergency situation.\n# At least one satellite picks up the beacon's transmission.\n# The satellites transfer the beacon's signal to their respective ground control stations.\n# The ground stations process the signals and forward the data, including approximate location, to a national authority.\n# The national authority forwards the data to a rescue authority\n# The rescue authority uses its own receiving equipment afterwards to locate the beacon and commence its own rescue or recovery operations.\n\nOnce the satellite data is received, it takes less than a minute to forward it to any signatory nation. The primary means of detection and location is by the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites. However, additional means of location are frequently used. For example, the FAA requires that all pilots monitor 121.500&nbsp;MHz whenever possible, and the [[USCG]] has a network of direction finder sites along the coastlines.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mdcap.org/userfiles/file/MDWG%20Conference%202008%20-%20406%20SARSAT%20(Rev-03).pdf|title=Civil Air Patrol, Maryland Wing Conference, Locating 121.5 & 406 MHz Emergency Beacons|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] maintains a near-real-time map that shows SARSAT U.S. Rescues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/sarsat-us-rescues|title=SARSAT U.S. Rescues|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere are several systems in use, with beacons of varying expense, different types of satellites and varying performance. Carrying even the oldest systems provides an immense improvement in safety over carrying none.\n\nThe types of satellites in the network are:\n* LEOSAR\n** Support Doppler detection and reception of encoded position\n** Receivers are payloads on various Low Earth Orbit satellites\n* MEOSAR\n** Medium Earth Orbiting Search and Rescue\n** Receivers are payloads on the U.S. GPS satellites, on the Russian GLONASS satellites, and on the European GALILEO satellites.\n* GEOSAR\n** Supports only reception of encoded position\n** Receivers are payloads on various geosynchronous satellites, including some of the U.S. GOES weather satellites (including [[GOES-16]]).\nWhen one of the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites detects a beacon, the detection is passed to one of the program's approximately 30 [[Mission Control Centre (Cospas-Sarsat)|Mission Control Centers]], such as USMCC (in Suitland, Maryland), where the detected location and beacon details are used to determine which [[Rescue coordination centre|Rescue Coordination Center]] (for example, the U.S. Coast Guard's PACAREA RCC, in Alameda, California) to pass the alert to.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/MEOSAR%20poster%202016%20(June%2023)%20S%20convert%20Reduced%20medium.pdf|title=MEOSAR: Medium Earth Orbiting Search & Rescue|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Beacon operation===\n====GPS-based, registered====\n406&nbsp;MHz beacons with [[GPS]] track with a precision of 100 meters in the 70% of the world closest to the equator, and send a serial number so the responsible authority can look up phone numbers to notify the registrator (e.g., next-of-kin) in four minutes.\n\nThe GPS system permits stationary, wide-view geosynchronous communications satellites to enhance the Doppler position received by [[low Earth orbit]] satellites. EPIRB beacons with built-in GPS are usually called GPIRBs, for GPS position-indicating radio beacon or global position-indicating radio beacon.\n\nHowever, rescue cannot begin until a Doppler track is available. The COSPAS-SARSAT specifications say<ref>See COSPAS-SARSAT document A.001, 2005</ref> that a beacon location is not considered \"resolved\" unless at least two Doppler tracks match or a Doppler track confirms an encoded (GPS) track. One or more GPS tracks are not sufficient.\n\n====High-precision registered====\nAn intermediate technology 406&nbsp;MHz beacon (now mostly obsolete in favor of GPS enabled units) has worldwide coverage, locates within 2&nbsp;km (12.5&nbsp;km\u00b2 search area), notifies kin and rescuers in 2 hours maximum (46 min average), and has a serial number to look up phone numbers, etc. This can take up to two hours because it has to use moving weather satellites to locate the beacon. To help locate the beacon, the beacon's frequency is controlled to 2 parts per billion, and its power is five watts.\n\nBoth of the above types of beacons usually include an auxiliary 25 milliwatt beacon at [[distress frequency|121.5 MHz]] to guide rescue aircraft.\n\n====Traditional ELT, unregistered====\nThe oldest, cheapest beacons are aircraft emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) that send an anonymous warble on the aviation band [[distress frequency]] at 121.5&nbsp;MHz. The frequency is often routinely monitored by commercial aircraft, but has not been monitored by satellite since Feb. 1, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/world/americas/11iht-fly.4.7466479.html|title=Aircraft beacon has become utterly outmoded, FAA says|first=Steve|last=Friess|date=September 11, 2007|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThese distress signals could be detected by satellite over only 60% of the earth, required up to 6 hours for notification, located within {{Convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} (search area of 1200&nbsp;km\u00b2), were anonymous, and couldn't be located well because their frequency is only accurate to 50 parts per million and the signals were broadcast using only 75\u2013100 milliwatts of power. Coverage was partial because the satellite had to be in view of both the beacon and a ground station at the same time \u2013 the satellites did not store and forward the beacon's position. Coverage in polar and south-hemisphere areas was poor.\n\nFalse alarms were common, as the beacon transmitted on the aviation emergency frequency, and there is interference from other electronic and electrical systems. To reduce false alarms, a beacon was confirmed by a second [[satellite pass]], which could easily slow confirmation of a 'case' of distress to up to about 4 hours (although in rare circumstances the satellites could be positioned such that immediate detection becomes possible.)\n\n====Location by Doppler (without GPS)====\nThe Cospas-Sarsat system was made possible by [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] processing. Local user terminals (LUTs) detecting non-geostationary satellites interpret the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency. The interpretation determines both bearing and range. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth. This [[triangulate]]s the position of the beacon. A faster change in the Doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite's [[orbit]]. If the beacon is moving toward or away from the satellite track due to the Earth's rotation, it is on one side or other of the satellite's path. Doppler shift is zero at the [[closest point of approach]] between the beacon and the orbit.\n\nIf the beacon's frequency is more precise, it can be located more precisely, saving search time, so modern 406&nbsp;MHz beacons are accurate to 2 parts per billion, giving a search area of only 2 square km, compared to the older beacons accurate to 50 parts per million that had 200 square kilometers of search area.\n\nIn order to increase the useful power, and handle multiple simultaneous beacons, modern 406&nbsp;MHz beacons transmit in bursts, and remain silent for about 50 seconds.\n\n[[Russia]] developed the original system, and its success drove the desire to develop the improved 406&nbsp;MHz system. The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low quality beacons, originally designed to aid air searches. It used just a simple, lightweight transponder on the satellite, with no digital recorders or other complexities. Ground stations listened to each satellite as long as it was above the horizon. Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon(s). Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a [[fast fourier transform]]. Also, two satellite passes per beacon were used. This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon's location from two different bearings. This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite. Regrettably, the second satellite pass almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority. However, the notification time was much less than a day.\n\n===Satellites===\nReceivers are auxiliary systems mounted on several types of satellites. This substantially reduces the program's cost.\n\nThe weather satellites that carry the SARSAT receivers are in \"ball of yarn\" orbits, inclined at 99 degrees. The longest period that all satellites can be out of line-of-sight of a beacon is about two hours.\n\nThe first satellite constellation was launched in the early 1970s by the [[Soviet Union]], Canada, France and the United States.\n\nSome geosynchronous satellites have beacon receivers. Since the end of 2003, there are four such geostationary satellites (GEOSAR) that cover more than 80% of the surface of the earth. As with all geosynchronous satellites, they are located above the equator. The GEOSAR satellites do not cover the polar caps.\n\nSince they see the Earth as a whole, they see the beacon immediately, but have no motion, and thus no Doppler frequency shift to locate it. However, if the beacon transmits GPS data, the geosynchronous satellites give nearly instantaneous response.\n\n==Search and rescue response==\nEmergency beacons operating on 406&nbsp;MHz transmit a unique 15, 22, or 30 character serial number called a ''hex code''. When the beacon is purchased, the hex code should be registered with the relevant national (or international) authority. After one of the Mission Control Centers has detected the signal, this registration information is passed to the Rescue Coordination Center, which then provides the appropriate search and rescue agency with crucial information such as:\n* phone numbers to call,\n* a description of the vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or person (in the case of a PLB)\n* the home port of a vessel or aircraft\n* any additional information that may be useful to SAR agencies\n\nRegistration information allows SAR agencies to start a rescue more quickly. For example, if a shipboard telephone number listed in the registration is unreachable, it could be assumed that a real distress event is occurring. Conversely, the information provides a quick and easy way for the SAR agencies to check and eliminate false alarms (potentially sparing the beacon's owner from significant false alert fines.)\n\nAn unregistered 406&nbsp;MHz beacon still carries some information, such as the manufacturer and serial number of the beacon, and in some cases, an [[MMSI]] or aircraft [[Aircraft registration|tail number]]/[[ICAO 24-bit address]]. Despite the clear benefits of registration, an unregistered 406&nbsp;MHz beacon is very substantially better than a 121.5&nbsp;MHz beacon; this is because the hex code received from a 406&nbsp;MHz beacon confirms the authenticity of the signal as a real distress signal.\n\nBeacons operating on 121.5&nbsp;MHz and 243.0&nbsp;MHz only simply transmit an anonymous siren tone, and thus carry no position or identity information to SAR agencies. Such beacons now rely solely on the terrestrial or aeronautical monitoring of the frequency.\n\n===Responsible agencies===\nRCC's are responsible for a geographic area, known as a \"search and rescue region of responsibility\" (SRR). SRR's are designated by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO). RCC's are operated unilaterally by personnel of a single military service (e.g. an Air Force, or a Navy) or a single civilian service (e.g. a national Police force, or a Coast Guard).\n\n==== Americas ====\nThese international Search and Rescue Points Of Contact (SPOCs)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://international-maritime-rescue.org/196-lifeline-february-2017-english/2386-sar-points-of-contact|title=SAR Points of Contact|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> receive SAR alerts from the USMCC.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/RccMsgsVersion3_06.pdf|title=USMCC 406 MHz Alert and Support Messages for the LEOSAR/GEOSAR/MEOSAR (LGM) System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!SPOC\n!SRR Name\n!Geographic Coverage\n!SAR Agency\n|-\n|Bermuda [[Maritime Operations Centre]]\n|BERMUDASP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Central American Corporation for Navigation Area Services\n|COCESNA\n|\n|\n|-\n|Colombia\n|COLMSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Dominican Republic\n|DOMREPSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ecuador\n|ECSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Guyana\n|GUYSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mexico\n|MEXISP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mexico Telecommunications\n|MEXTEL\n|\n|\n|-\n|Netherlands Antilles\n|NANTSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Panama\n|PANSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|TTSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Venezuela\n|VZMCC\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bolivia\n|BOLSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chile RCC\n|ChileRCC\n|\n|\n|-\n|Paraguay\n|PARSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Uruguay\n|URSP\n|\n|\n|}\n\n===== United States =====\nThe U.S. NOAA operates the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nIt distributes beacon signal reports to one or more of these RCCs:<ref name=\":3\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+United States SPOCs\n!RCC\n!SRR Name\n!Geographic Coverage\n!SAR Agency\n!Phone Number\n|-\n|[[United States Air Force Rescue Coordination Center|Air Force Rescue Coordination Center]]\n|AFRCC\n|land-based emergency signals in the lower 48 states\n|United States Air Force Auxiliary [[Civil Air Patrol]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Alaska Air National Guard|Alaska Air national Guard]] operates the [[Alaska Rescue Coordination Center]]\n|AKRCC\n|Alaskan inland areas\n|On-shore beacons are investigated by local search-and-rescue services in Alaska.\n|\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Response-Policy-CG-5R/Office-of-Incident-Management-Preparedness-CG-5RI/US-Coast-Guard-Office-of-Search-and-Rescue-CG-SAR/RCC-Numbers/|title=U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] investigates offshore beacons and rescues victims.\n|\n|-\n|Coast Guard Atlantic Area\n|LANTAREA\n|\n|\n|757-398-6700\n|-\n|District 1: Boston, MA\n(RCC Boston)\n|CGD01\n|\n|\n|'''(617)223-8555'''\n|-\n|District 5: Portsmouth, VA\n(RCC Norfolk)\n|CGD05\n|\n|\n|'''(757)398-6231'''\n|-\n|District 7: Miami, FL\n(RCC Miami)\n|CGD07\n|\n|\n|'''(305)415-6800'''\n|-\n|District 8: New Orleans, LA\n(RCC New Orleans)\n|CGD08\n|\n|\n|'''(504)589-6225'''\n|-\n|District 9: Cleveland, OH\n(RCC Cleveland)\n|CGD09\n|\n|\n|'''(216)902-6117'''\n|-\n|District 11: Alameda, CA\n(RCC Alameda and\n\nPacific SAR Coordinator)\n|PACAREA\n|\n|\n|'''(510)437-3701'''\n|-\n|District 13: Seattle, WA\n(RCC Seattle)\n|CGD13\n|\n|\n|'''(206)220-7001'''\n|-\n|District 14: Honolulu, HI\n(RCC Honolulu; operated as JRCC with DOD)\n|CGD14\n|\n|\n|'''(808)535-3333'''\n|-\n|District 17: Juneau, AK\n(RCC Juneau)\n|CGD17\n|\n|\n|'''(907)463-2000'''\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard Sector San Juan (RSC)\n(sub-sector of RCC Miami)\n|SANJN\n|\n|\n|'''(787)289-2042'''\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard Sector Guam (RSC) (coordinates SAR under RCC Honolulu)\n|MARSEC\n|\n|\n|'''(671)355-4824'''\n|}\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] web page for EPIRBs states: \"You may be fined for false activation of an unregistered EPIRB.

In Canada, only air traffic service stations (control towers or flight service facilities) monitor 121.5&nbsp;MHz during operating hours. Overflying commercial or private aircraft monitor 121.5&nbsp;MHz only if equipped with a suitable receiver, and if time/courtesy permits; monitoring 121.5&nbsp;MHz is not mandatory. SAR authorities have no way of knowing whether a 121.5&nbsp;MHz/243.0&nbsp;MHz signal is actually a distress signal until they physically deploy to the location and [[Direction finding|home in on]] the source (and sound) of the transmission.

The federal ELT law left the matter of alerting vague, although the initial idea was alerting by over flying aircraft which could receive an ELT's 75-milliwatt signal from 50 nautical miles away. The law set the compliance dates as one year after passage for newly manufactured or imported aircraft (December 30, 1971), and three years for existing aircraft (December 30, 1973). In response to the law, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) published on March 13, 1971, Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) 71\u20137 with the proposed amendments to the [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] (FAR).<ref>''Federal Register'', Volume 36, Number 50, March 13, 1971, pages 4,878-4,881</ref> After public comment, the final rules were published in the Federal Register on September 21, 1971.<ref>FR 36-183, September 21, 1971, pages 18,716-18,725</ref>\n* The disappearance of U.S. Congressmen [[Hale Boggs]] and [[Nick Begich]] in a general aviation aircraft on October 16, 1972 sparked the then largest ever search and rescue effort, which proved fruitless.

As such, instead of using an impact sensor to activate the beacon, they typically use a water-sensing device or a submerged-sensing device that activates and releases a floating beacon after it has been submerged in between 1 and 4 meters of water. In addition to the 406&nbsp;MHz signal mandated by C/S T.001, the IMO and ICAO require an auxiliary 121.5&nbsp;MHz at another frequency in order to support the large installed base of 121.5&nbsp;MHz direction finding equipment.\n\nThe [[RTCM]] (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services) maintains specifications specific to EPIRB devices. The alarm signal is defined as an AM signal (A3X and/or N0N emissions), containing a swept tone ranging from 1600&nbsp;Hz to 300&nbsp;Hz (either upwards or downwards), with 2-4 sweeps per second.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":12\"/>\n\nEPIRBs with an [[Automatic identification system|AIS]] transmitter are allocated [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity|MMSI]] numbers in the range 974yyzzzz.\n\n===EPIRB sub-classification===\nEmergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) are sub-classified as follows:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtEpirb|title=Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacon (EPIRB)|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Recognized categories:'''\n* Category I \u2013 406/121.5&nbsp;MHz. Float-free, automatically activated EPIRB. Detectable by satellite anywhere in the world. Recognized by GMDSS.\n* Category II \u2013 406/121.5&nbsp;MHz. Similar to Category I, except is manually activated. Some models are also water activated.\n\n'''Obsolete classes:'''\n* Class A \u2013 121.5/243&nbsp;MHz. Float-free, automatically activating. Due to limited signal coverage and possible lengthy delays in signal recognition, the U.S. Coast Guard no longer recommends use of this type. These devices have been phased out by the U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) and ''are no longer recognized''.\n* Class B \u2013 121.5/243&nbsp;MHz. Manually activated version of Class A. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and ''are no longer recognized''.\n* Class S \u2013 121.5/243&nbsp;MHz. Similar to Class B, except it floats, or is an integral part of a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|survival craft (lifeboat)]] or [[survival suit]]. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and ''are no longer recognized''. Their use is no longer recommended by the U.S. Coast Guard.\n* Class C \u2013 [[Marine VHF radio|Marine VHF]] ch15/16. Manually activated, these beacons operate on maritime channels only, and therefore are not detectable by satellite or normal aircraft. Designed for small crafts operating close to shore, this type was only recognized in the United States. Use of these units was phased out in 1999. These devices have been phased out by the FCC and ''are no longer recognized''.\n* [[Inmarsat-E]] \u2013 This entered service in 1997 and service ended 1 December 2006; all former users have switched to Category I or II 406&nbsp;MHz EPIRBs. These beacons were float-free, automatically activated EPIRBs operated on 1646&nbsp;MHz and were detectable by the Inmarsat geostationary satellite system, and were recognized by [[GMDSS]], but not by the United States. In September 2004, Inmarsat announced that it was terminating its ''Inmarsat E'' EPIRB service as of December 2006 due to a lack of interest in the maritime community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://maritime.inmarsat.com/news/00014622.aspx?language=EN&textonly=False|title=Inmarsat will withdraw epirb service in 2006 and promises new safety service on next generation I-4 satellites|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209092859/http://maritime.inmarsat.com/news/00014622.aspx?language=EN&textonly=False|archivedate=December 9, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n* Furthermore, the U.S. Coast Guard recommend that no EPIRB of any type manufactured before 1989 be used.\nEPIRBs are a component of the [[Global Maritime Distress and Safety System]] (GMDSS). Most commercial off-shore working vessels with passengers are required to carry a self-deploying EPIRB, while most in-shore and fresh-water craft are not.\n\nAs part of the United States efforts to prepare beacon users for the end of 121.5&nbsp;MHz frequency processing by satellites, the FCC has prohibited the use of 121.5&nbsp;MHz EPIRBs as of January 1, 2007 (47 CFR 80.1051). See [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s statement [http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/phaseout.html on the 121.5/243 phaseout].\n\n=== EPIRB activation ===\nAutomatic EPIRBs are water activated. Some EPIRBs also \"deploy\"; this means that they physically depart from their mounting bracket on the exterior of the vessel (usually by going into the water.)\n\nFor a marine EPIRB to begin transmitting a signal (or \"activate\") it first needs to come out of its bracket (or \"deploy\"). Deployment can happen either manually where someone must physically remove it from its bracket or automatically where water pressure will cause a [[hydrostatic]] release unit to separate the EPIRB from its bracket. If it does not come out of the bracket it will not activate. There is a magnet in the bracket which operates a [[reed switch|reed safety switch]] in the EPIRB. This prevents accidental activation if the unit gets wet from rain or shipped seas.\n\nOnce deployed, EPIRBs can be activated, depending on the circumstances, either manually (crewman flicks a switch) or automatically (when water contacts the unit's \"sea-switch\".) All modern EPIRBs provide both methods of activation and deployment, and thus are labelled \"Manual and Automatic Deployment and Activation.\"\n\n==== Automatic hydrostatic release unit ====\nA '''hydrostatic release unit''' or '''HRU''' is a pressure activated mechanism designed to automatically deploy when certain conditions are met. In the marine environment this occurs when submerged to a maximum depth of four meters. The pressure of the water against a diaphragm within the sealed casing causes a plastic pin to be cut thereby releasing the containment bracket casing, allowing the EPIRB to float free.\n[[File:Epirb hydrostatic release mechanism.jpg|thumb|EPIRB hydrostatic release mechanism]]\n\nSome common characteristics of HRUs are:\n* Water pressure sensitive at depths not to exceed four meters or less than two meters\n* Single use only, require replacement if activated\n* Cannot be serviced; only replaced\n* Waterproof; sealed against moisture and tampering\n* Must be labeled with expiration date\n* Expiration date is two years from month of installation applies to unit and rod\n\n== Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon ==\nA Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB) is an EPIRB that is approved for use on [[submarine]]s. Two are carried on board and can be fired from the [[submerged signal ejector]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.notmar.gc.ca/publications/annual-annuel/section-f/f34-en.php|title=Notice 34 Information Concerning Submarines|author=Canadian Coast Guard|date=2017}}</ref>\n\n== Ship Security Alert System ==\n{{Main|Ship Security Alert System}}\nA Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) is a special variety of an EPIRB designed to alert the ship's owner(s) of a possible piracy or terrorist attack. They thus have several distinguishing operational differences:\n* They are manually activated by hidden buttons or switches, much like the alarms bank tellers use.\n* They are prohibited from emitting a homing signal on 121.5&nbsp;MHz so as to make transmissions more covert.\n* The COSPAS-SARSAT system sends the distress message to the vessel's country of origin, regardless of the location of the vessel.\nAs with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for SSAS devices.\n\n== Personal Locator Beacon ==\n[[File:Micro personal locator beacon.jpg|thumb|Miniature Personal Locator Beacon <br> by Microwave Monolithics Incorporated <br> (image courtesy of NASA)]]Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) are designed for use by individuals who are hiking, kayaking, or conducting other activities on land or water where they are not in or associated with an aircraft or vessel that is equipped with its own ELT or EPIRB. As with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for PLB devices.\n\nPLBs vary in size from cigarette-packet to paperback book and weigh 200 g to 1&nbsp;kg (\u00bd to 2\u2155 lb). They can be purchased from marine suppliers, aircraft refitters, and (in Australia and the United States) hiking supply stores.

There are AIS PLBs that transmit on VHF 70.\n\nPersonal locator beacons operating on 406&nbsp;MHz must be [[#Registration|registered]]. PLBs should not be used in cases where normal emergency response (such as [[9-1-1]]) exists.\n\n====Obsolete PLBs====\n* U.S. Military forces at one time used 121.5/243.0&nbsp;MHz beacons such as the \"PRC-106,\" which had a built-in VHF radio. The military is replacing them with modern 406&nbsp;MHz PLBs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Beacon content==\nThe most important aspect of a beacon in classification is the mode of transmission. There are two valid transmission modes: digital and analog. Where digital usually has a longer range, analog is more reliable. Analog beacons are useful to search parties and SAR aircraft, though they are no longer monitored by satellite.\n\n===Analog 121.500 MHz homing signal===\n[[File:COSPAS-SARSAT Locator Beacon Sweep Down.ogg|thumb|The radiotelephony locator beacon sound made by ELTs and some EPIRBs.]]All ELTs, all PLBs, and most EPIRBs are required to have a low-power homing signal, that is identical to the original 121.500&nbsp;MHz VHF beacon signal. However, due to the extremely large number of false alarms that the old beacons generated, the transmit power was greatly reduced, and because the VHF transmitter typically uses the same antenna as the UHF beacon, the radiated signal is further reduced by the inherent inefficiencies of transmitting with an antenna not tuned to the transmitted signal.\n\n===Digital 406&nbsp;MHz beacons===\n406&nbsp;MHz UHF beacons transmit bursts of digital information to orbiting satellites, and may also contain a low-power integrated analog (121.500&nbsp;MHz) [[homing beacon]]. They can be uniquely identified (via [[GEOSAR]]). Advanced beacons encode a [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]] position into the signal. All beacons are located by Doppler triangulation to confirm the location. The digital data identifies the registered user. A phone call by authorities to the registered phone number often eliminates false alarms (false alarms are the typical case). If there is a problem, the beacon location data guides search and rescue efforts. No beacon is ignored. Anonymous beacons are confirmed by two Doppler tracks before beginning beacon location efforts.\n\nThe distress message transmitted by a 406 beacon contains the information such as:\n* Which country the beacon originates from.\n* A unique 15-digit hexadecimal beacon identification code (a \"15-hex ID\").\n* The encoded identification of the vessel or aircraft in distress, either as an [[MMSI]] value, or as, in the case of an ELT, either the aircraft's [[aircraft registration|registration]] or its [[ICAO 24-bit address]] (from its Mode-S transponder)''.''\n* When equipped, a GPS position.\n* Whether or not the beacon contains a 121.5&nbsp;MHz homing transmitter.\n\nThe digital distress message generated by the beacon varies according to the above factors and is encoded in 30 [[hexadecimal]] characters. The unique 15-character digital identity (the 15-hex ID) is hard-coded in the firmware of the beacon. The 406.025&nbsp;MHz carrier signal is modulated plus or minus 1.1 radians with the data encoded using [[Manchester code|Manchester encoding]], which ensures a net zero phase shift aiding Doppler location<ref>Albert Helfrick, Principles of Avionics, 5th Edition,\nAvionics Communications, 2009\n{{ISBN|1885544278}}, p 287</ref>\n\n====406 MHz beacon facts and transmission schedule====\n* 406&nbsp;MHz beacons transmit for a quarter of a second immediately when turned on, and then transmit a digital burst once every 50 seconds thereafter. Both [[GEOSAR]] and [[LEOSAR]] satellites monitor these signals.\n* The repetition period shall not be so stable that any two transmitters appear to be synchronized closer than a few seconds over a 5-minute period. The intent is that no two beacons will have all of their bursts coincident. The period shall be randomised around a mean value of 50 seconds, so that time intervals between transmission are randomly distributed on the interval 47.5 to 52.5 seconds. (specification for first-generation beacons)<ref>http://www.cospas-sarsat.int/images/stories/SystemDocs/Current/CS-T-001-Oct2014.pdf</ref>\n* Preliminary specification for second-generation beacons. From beacon activation a total of [6] initial transmissions shall be made separated by fixed [5s \u00b1 0.1s] intervals. The first transmission shall commence within [3] seconds of beacon activation.

Although sometimes defined in the same standards as the COSPAS-SARSAT beacons, MSLDs can not be detected by that satellite network, and are instead intended only for short-range [[Direction finding]] equipment mounted on the vessel on which the survivor was traveling.\n\n=== AIS SART ===\n{{Main|AIS-SART}}\nThese devices are distinct from traditional SAR radar transponders ([[Search and Rescue Transponder|SART]]), as they transmit AIS messages containing accurate GPS position information and include a [[GPS]] receiver and a transmitter on [[VHF]] [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] channels, so they show up on ship AIS receivers. They are lightweight and can be used to equip inflatable [[liferaft]]s.\n\nAIS-SART devices are allocated [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity|MMSI]] numbers in the range 970YYxxxx.\n\n=== SEND\u2014Satellite Emergency Notification Device ===\n{{Main|Satellite emergency notification device}}\nThese devices are commonly referred to as SEND (Satellite Emergency Notification Device), and examples include SPOT and inReach.\n\n===APRS===\n{{Main|Automatic Packet Reporting System}}\nAPRS is used by [[amateur radio operator]]s to track positions and send short messages. Most APRS packets contain a [[GPS]] latitude and longitude, so they can be used for both normal and emergency tracking. They also are routed to the Internet, where they are archived for some period of time, and viewable by others. There are several emergency packet types that can indicate distress. Since it is part of the amateur radio service, it costs nothing to transmit on and uses the extensive network, however, one must be a licensed amateur radio operator. There is also no guarantee that an APRS distress packet report would be seen or handled by [[emergency responder]]s. It would have to be seen by an amateur radio operator and forwarded on.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Transport|Aviation}}\n* {{annotated link|Emergency locator beacon}}\n* {{annotated link|1986 British International Helicopters Chinook crash}}\n* {{annotated link|1996 New Hampshire Learjet crash}}\n* {{annotated link|Acronyms and abbreviations in avionics}}\n* {{annotated link|Aircraft emergency frequency}}\n* {{annotated link|Search and rescue transponder}}\n* {{annotated link|Automatic identification system}}\n* {{annotated link|AIS-SART}}\n* {{annotated link|Avalanche transceiver}}\n* {{annotated link|RECCO}}\n* {{annotated link|Civil Air Patrol}}\n* {{annotated link|Electric beacon}}\n* {{annotated link|ENOS Rescue-System}}\n* {{annotated link|Global Maritime Distress and Safety System}}\n* {{annotated link|Satellite emergency notification device}}\n* {{annotated link|Search and rescue transponder}}\n* {{annotated link|Survival radio}}\n* {{annotated link|Varig Flight 254}}\n* {{annotated link|GPS aircraft tracking}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n* COSPAS-SARSAT, Document C/S T.001 October 1999\n* FCC, Part 80 and [[GMDSS]]\n* MED, 0735/2001\n* RTCM, Standard for 406&nbsp;MHz Satellite EPIRBs\n\n==External links==\n<!-- Do not put links to vendors of distress radiobeacons here.

In the event of an emergency, such as the ship sinking or an airplane crash, the transmitter is activated and begins transmitting a continuous radio signal which is used by search and rescue teams to quickly locate the emergency and render aid. The signal is detected by [[satellite]]s operated by an international consortium of rescue services, [[International Cospas-Sarsat Programme|COSPAS-SARSAT]]. The basic purpose of this system is to help rescuers find survivors within the so-called \"golden day\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20100209202108/http://www1.va.gov/emshg/apps/kml/docs/CERT_Manual.pdf Community Emergency Response Team Participant Handbook<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> (the first 24 hours following a traumatic event) during which the majority of survivors can usually be saved.  The feature distinguishing modern EPIRBs, often called GPIRBs, from other types of emergency beacon is that it contains a [[GPS receiver]] and broadcasts its position, usually accurate within 100 meters, to facilitate location.\n\nThe standard frequency of a modern EPIRB is 406&nbsp;MHz. It is an internationally-regulated [[mobile service | mobile radiocommunication service]] that aids [[search and rescue]] operations to detect and locate [[Emergency|distressed]] [[boat]]s, [[aircraft]], and people.<ref>ITU Radio Regulations, Section IV. Radio Stations and Systems \u2013 Article 1.93, definition: ''emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station''</ref> It is distinct from a [[Satellite emergency position-indicating radiobeacon station]]. \n\nThe first form of these beacons was the 121.500 MHz ELT, which was designed as an automatic locator beacon for crashed military aircraft. These beacons were first used in the 1950s by the U.S. military and were mandated for use on many types of commercial and general aviation aircraft beginning in the early 1970s.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/OConnors.pdf|title=Cospas-Sarsat System Overview|last=O\u2019Connors|first=Chris|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The frequency and signal format used by the ELT beacons was not designed for satellite detection, which resulted in a system with poor location detection abilities and with long delays in detection of activated beacons. The satellite detection network was built after the ELT beacons were already in general use, with the first satellite not being launched until 1982, and even then, the satellites only provided detection, with location accuracy being roughly 20 km.<ref name=\":4\" /> The technology was later expanded to cover use on vessels at sea (EPIRB), individual persons (PLB and, starting in 2016, MSLD).{{Citation needed|reason=Descriptions of and/or links to the listed programs, potentially with examples of devices and protocols used is needed.

'''COSPAS''' (\u041a\u041e\u0421\u041f\u0410\u0421) is an [[acronym and initialism|acronym]] for the Russian words \"'''Co'''smicheskaya '''S'''istema '''P'''oiska '''A'''variynyh '''S'''udov\" (\u041a\u043e\u0441\u043c\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0421\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u041f\u043e\u0438\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0410\u0432\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0439\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0421\u0443\u0434\u043e\u0432), which translates to \"Space System for the Search of Vessels in Distress\". A consortium of Russia, the U.S., Canada and France formed the organization in 1982. Since then, 29 others have joined.\n\nThe satellites used in the system include:\n* SARSAT (US/Canada/France LEO)\n* COSPAS (Russia LEO)\n* GOES (US geostationary)\n* MSG (European geostationary)\n* INSAT (Indian geostationary)\n* ELEKTRO/LUCH (Russia geostationary)\n\nCospas-Sarsat defines standards for beacons, auxiliary equipment to be mounted on conforming weather and communication satellites, ground stations, and communications methods. The satellites communicate the beacon data to their ground stations, which forward it to main control centers of each nation that can initiate a rescue effort.\n\n== Detection and location ==\n[[File:Radiogoniom\u00e9trie_VHF.JPG|thumb|VHF radio direction finding]]\nA transmission is typically detected and processed in this manner:\n# The transmitter is activated, either automatically in a crash or after sinking, or manually by survivors of an emergency situation.\n# At least one satellite picks up the beacon's transmission.\n# The satellites transfer the beacon's signal to their respective ground control stations.\n# The ground stations process the signals and forward the data, including approximate location, to a national authority.\n# The national authority forwards the data to a rescue authority\n# The rescue authority uses its own receiving equipment afterwards to locate the beacon and commence its own rescue or recovery operations.\n\nOnce the satellite data is received, it takes less than a minute to forward it to any signatory nation. The primary means of detection and location is by the COSPAS-SARSAT satellites. However, additional means of location are frequently used. For example, the FAA requires that all pilots monitor 121.500 MHz whenever possible, and the [[USCG]] has a network of direction finder sites along the coastlines.<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mdcap.org/userfiles/file/MDWG%20Conference%202008%20-%20406%20SARSAT%20(Rev-03).pdf|title=Civil Air Patrol, Maryland Wing Conference, Locating 121.5 & 406 MHz Emergency Beacons|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] maintains a near-real-time map that shows SARSAT U.S. Rescues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nesdis.noaa.gov/content/sarsat-us-rescues|title=SARSAT U.S. Rescues|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nThere are several systems in use, with beacons of varying expense, different types of satellites and varying performance.

EPIRB beacons with built-in GPS are usually called GPIRBs, for GPS position-indicating radio beacon or global position-indicating radio beacon.\n\nHowever, rescue cannot begin until a Doppler track is available. The COSPAS-SARSAT specifications say<ref>See COSPAS-SARSAT document A.001, 2005</ref> that a beacon location is not considered \"resolved\" unless at least two Doppler tracks match or a Doppler track confirms an encoded (GPS) track. One or more GPS tracks are not sufficient.\n\n====High-precision registered====\nAn intermediate technology 406&nbsp;MHz beacon (now mostly obsolete in favor of GPS enabled units) has worldwide coverage, locates within 2&nbsp;km (12.5&nbsp;km\u00b2 search area), notifies kin and rescuers in 2 hours maximum (46 min average), and has a serial number to look up phone numbers, etc. This can take up to two hours because it has to use moving weather satellites to locate the beacon. To help locate the beacon, the beacon's frequency is controlled to 2 parts per billion, and its power is five watts.\n\nBoth of the above types of beacons usually include an auxiliary 25 milliwatt beacon at [[distress frequency|121.5 MHz]] to guide rescue aircraft.\n\n====Traditional ELT, unregistered====\nThe oldest, cheapest beacons are aircraft emergency locator transmitters (ELTs) that send an anonymous warble on the aviation band [[distress frequency]] at 121.5&nbsp;MHz. The frequency is often routinely monitored by commercial aircraft, but has not been monitored by satellite since Feb. 1, 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/world/americas/11iht-fly.4.7466479.html|title=Aircraft beacon has become utterly outmoded, FAA says|first=Steve|last=Friess|date=September 11, 2007|via=NYTimes.com}}</ref>\n\nThese distress signals could be detected by satellite over only 60% of the earth, required up to 6 hours for notification, located within {{Convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} (search area of 1200&nbsp;km\u00b2), were anonymous, and couldn't be located well because their frequency is only accurate to 50 parts per million and the signals were broadcast using only 75\u2013100 milliwatts of power. Coverage was partial because the satellite had to be in view of both the beacon and a ground station at the same time \u2013 the satellites did not store and forward the beacon's position. Coverage in polar and south-hemisphere areas was poor.\n\nFalse alarms were common, as the beacon transmitted on the aviation emergency frequency, and there is interference from other electronic and electrical systems. To reduce false alarms, a beacon was confirmed by a second [[satellite pass]], which could easily slow confirmation of a 'case' of distress to up to about 4 hours (although in rare circumstances the satellites could be positioned such that immediate detection becomes possible.)\n\n====Location by Doppler (without GPS)====\nThe Cospas-Sarsat system was made possible by [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] processing. Local user terminals (LUTs) detecting non-geostationary satellites interpret the [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency shift heard by LEOSAR and MEOSAR satellites as they pass over a beacon transmitting at a fixed frequency. The interpretation determines both bearing and range. The range and bearing are measured from the rate of change of the heard frequency, which varies both according to the path of the satellite in space and the rotation of the earth. This [[triangulate]]s the position of the beacon. A faster change in the Doppler indicates that the beacon is closer to the satellite's [[orbit]]. If the beacon is moving toward or away from the satellite track due to the Earth's rotation, it is on one side or other of the satellite's path. Doppler shift is zero at the [[closest point of approach]] between the beacon and the orbit.\n\nIf the beacon's frequency is more precise, it can be located more precisely, saving search time, so modern 406&nbsp;MHz beacons are accurate to 2 parts per billion, giving a search area of only 2 square km, compared to the older beacons accurate to 50 parts per million that had 200 square kilometers of search area.\n\nIn order to increase the useful power, and handle multiple simultaneous beacons, modern 406&nbsp;MHz beacons transmit in bursts, and remain silent for about 50 seconds.\n\n[[Russia]] developed the original system, and its success drove the desire to develop the improved 406&nbsp;MHz system. The original system was a brilliant adaptation to the low quality beacons, originally designed to aid air searches. It used just a simple, lightweight transponder on the satellite, with no digital recorders or other complexities. Ground stations listened to each satellite as long as it was above the horizon. Doppler shift was used to locate the beacon(s). Multiple beacons were separated when a computer program analysed the signals with a [[fast fourier transform]]. Also, two satellite passes per beacon were used. This eliminated false alarms by using two measurements to verify the beacon's location from two different bearings. This prevented false alarms from VHF channels that affected a single satellite. Regrettably, the second satellite pass almost doubled the average time before notification of the rescuing authority. However, the notification time was much less than a day.\n\n===Satellites===\nReceivers are auxiliary systems mounted on several types of satellites. This substantially reduces the program's cost.\n\nThe weather satellites that carry the SARSAT receivers are in \"ball of yarn\" orbits, inclined at 99 degrees. The longest period that all satellites can be out of line-of-sight of a beacon is about two hours.\n\nThe first satellite constellation was launched in the early 1970s by the [[Soviet Union]], Canada, France and the United States.\n\nSome geosynchronous satellites have beacon receivers. Since the end of 2003, there are four such geostationary satellites (GEOSAR) that cover more than 80% of the surface of the earth. As with all geosynchronous satellites, they are located above the equator. The GEOSAR satellites do not cover the polar caps.\n\nSince they see the Earth as a whole, they see the beacon immediately, but have no motion, and thus no Doppler frequency shift to locate it. However, if the beacon transmits GPS data, the geosynchronous satellites give nearly instantaneous response.\n\n==Search and rescue response==\nEmergency beacons operating on 406&nbsp;MHz transmit a unique 15, 22, or 30 character serial number called a ''hex code''. When the beacon is purchased, the hex code should be registered with the relevant national (or international) authority. After one of the Mission Control Centers has detected the signal, this registration information is passed to the Rescue Coordination Center, which then provides the appropriate search and rescue agency with crucial information such as:\n* phone numbers to call,\n* a description of the vessel, aircraft, vehicle, or person (in the case of a PLB)\n* the home port of a vessel or aircraft\n* any additional information that may be useful to SAR agencies\n\nRegistration information allows SAR agencies to start a rescue more quickly. For example, if a shipboard telephone number listed in the registration is unreachable, it could be assumed that a real distress event is occurring. Conversely, the information provides a quick and easy way for the SAR agencies to check and eliminate false alarms (potentially sparing the beacon's owner from significant false alert fines.)\n\nAn unregistered 406 MHz beacon still carries some information, such as the manufacturer and serial number of the beacon, and in some cases, an [[MMSI]] or aircraft [[Aircraft registration|tail number]]/[[ICAO 24-bit address]]. Despite the clear benefits of registration, an unregistered 406 MHz beacon is very substantially better than a 121.5 MHz beacon; this is because the hex code received from a 406 MHz beacon confirms the authenticity of the signal as a real distress signal.\n\nBeacons operating on 121.5 MHz and 243.0&nbsp;MHz only simply transmit an anonymous siren tone, and thus carry no position or identity information to SAR agencies. Such beacons now rely solely on the terrestrial or aeronautical monitoring of the frequency.\n\n===Responsible agencies===\nRCC's are responsible for a geographic area, known as a \"search and rescue region of responsibility\" (SRR).  SRR's are designated by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO) and the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO).  RCC's are operated unilaterally by personnel of a single military service (e.g. an Air Force, or a Navy) or a single civilian service (e.g. a national Police force, or a Coast Guard).\n\n==== Americas ====\nThese international Search and Rescue Points Of Contact (SPOCs)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://international-maritime-rescue.org/196-lifeline-february-2017-english/2386-sar-points-of-contact|title=SAR Points of Contact|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> receive SAR alerts from the USMCC.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/RccMsgsVersion3_06.pdf|title=USMCC 406 MHz Alert and Support Messages for the LEOSAR/GEOSAR/MEOSAR (LGM) System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!SPOC\n!SRR Name\n!Geographic Coverage\n!SAR Agency\n|-\n|Bermuda [[Maritime Operations Centre]]\n|BERMUDASP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Central American Corporation for Navigation Area Services\n|COCESNA\n|\n|\n|-\n|Colombia\n|COLMSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Dominican Republic\n|DOMREPSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Ecuador\n|ECSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Guyana\n|GUYSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mexico\n|MEXISP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Mexico Telecommunications\n|MEXTEL\n|\n|\n|-\n|Netherlands Antilles\n|NANTSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Panama\n|PANSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Trinidad and Tobago\n|TTSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Venezuela\n|VZMCC\n|\n|\n|-\n|Bolivia\n|BOLSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Chile RCC\n|ChileRCC\n|\n|\n|-\n|Paraguay\n|PARSP\n|\n|\n|-\n|Uruguay\n|URSP\n|\n|\n|}\n\n===== United States =====\nThe U.S. NOAA operates the U.S. Mission Control Center (USMCC) in Suitland, Maryland.\n\nIt distributes beacon signal reports to one or more of these RCCs:<ref name=\":3\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+United States SPOCs\n!RCC\n!SRR Name\n!Geographic Coverage\n!SAR Agency\n!Phone Number\n|-\n|[[United States Air Force Rescue Coordination Center|Air Force Rescue Coordination Center]]\n|AFRCC\n|land-based emergency signals in the lower 48 states\n|United States Air Force Auxiliary [[Civil Air Patrol]]\n|\n|-\n|[[Alaska Air National Guard|Alaska Air national Guard]] operates the [[Alaska Rescue Coordination Center]]\n|AKRCC\n|Alaskan inland areas\n|On-shore beacons are investigated by local search-and-rescue services in Alaska.\n|\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dco.uscg.mil/Our-Organization/Assistant-Commandant-for-Response-Policy-CG-5R/Office-of-Incident-Management-Preparedness-CG-5RI/US-Coast-Guard-Office-of-Search-and-Rescue-CG-SAR/RCC-Numbers/|title=U.S. Coast Guard Rescue Coordination Centers (RCCs)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n|\n| colspan=\"2\" |The [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] investigates offshore beacons and rescues victims.\n|\n|-\n|Coast Guard Atlantic Area\n|LANTAREA\n|\n|\n|757-398-6700\n|-\n|District 1: Boston, MA\n(RCC Boston)\n|CGD01\n|\n|\n|'''(617)223-8555'''\n|-\n|District 5: Portsmouth, VA\n(RCC Norfolk)\n|CGD05\n|\n|\n|'''(757)398-6231'''\n|-\n|District 7: Miami, FL\n(RCC Miami)\n|CGD07\n|\n|\n|'''(305)415-6800'''\n|-\n|District 8: New Orleans, LA\n(RCC New Orleans)\n|CGD08\n|\n|\n|'''(504)589-6225'''\n|-\n|District 9: Cleveland, OH\n(RCC Cleveland)\n|CGD09\n|\n|\n|'''(216)902-6117'''\n|-\n|District 11: Alameda, CA\n(RCC Alameda and\n\nPacific SAR Coordinator)\n|PACAREA\n|\n|\n|'''(510)437-3701'''\n|-\n|District 13: Seattle, WA\n(RCC Seattle)\n|CGD13\n|\n|\n|'''(206)220-7001'''\n|-\n|District 14: Honolulu, HI\n(RCC Honolulu; operated as JRCC with DOD)\n|CGD14\n|\n|\n|'''(808)535-3333'''\n|-\n|District 17: Juneau, AK\n(RCC Juneau)\n|CGD17\n|\n|\n|'''(907)463-2000'''\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard Sector San Juan (RSC)\n(sub-sector of RCC Miami)\n|SANJN\n|\n|\n|'''(787)289-2042'''\n|-\n|U.S. Coast Guard Sector Guam (RSC) (coordinates SAR under RCC Honolulu)\n|MARSEC\n|\n|\n|'''(671)355-4824'''\n|}\n\nThe [[United States Coast Guard]] web page for EPIRBs states: \"You may be fined for false activation of an unregistered EPIRB.

Overflying commercial or private aircraft monitor 121.5&nbsp;MHz only if equipped with a suitable receiver, and if time/courtesy permits; monitoring 121.5&nbsp;MHz is not mandatory. SAR authorities have no way of knowing whether a 121.5 MHz/243.0&nbsp;MHz signal is actually a distress signal until they physically deploy to the location and [[Direction finding|home in on]] the source (and sound) of the transmission.

The federal ELT law left the matter of alerting vague, although the initial idea was alerting by over flying aircraft which could receive an ELT's 75-milliwatt signal from 50 nautical miles away. The law set the compliance dates as one year after passage for newly manufactured or imported aircraft (December 30, 1971), and three years for existing aircraft (December 30, 1973).

As such, instead of using an impact sensor to activate the beacon, they typically use a water-sensing device or a submerged-sensing device that activates and releases a floating beacon after it has been submerged in between 1 and 4 meters of water. In addition to the 406 MHz signal mandated by C/S T.001, the IMO and ICAO require an auxiliary 121.5 MHz at another frequency in order to support the large installed base of 121.5 MHz direction finding equipment.\n\nThe [[RTCM]] (Radio Technical Commission for Maritime Services) maintains specifications specific to EPIRB devices. The alarm signal is defined as an AM signal (A3X and/or N0N emissions), containing a swept tone ranging from 1600 Hz to 300 Hz (either upwards or downwards), with 2-4 sweeps per second.<ref name=\":11\"/><ref name=\":12\"/>\n\nEPIRBs with an [[Automatic identification system|AIS]] transmitter are allocated [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity|MMSI]] numbers in the range 974yyzzzz.\n\n===EPIRB sub-classification===\nEmergency position-indicating radio beacons (EPIRBs) are sub-classified as follows:<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.navcen.uscg.gov/?pageName=mtEpirb|title=Emergency Position Indicating Radiobeacon (EPIRB)|website=www.navcen.uscg.gov}}</ref>\n\n'''Recognized categories:'''\n* Category I \u2013 406/121.5&nbsp;MHz.

Most commercial off-shore working vessels with passengers are required to carry a self-deploying EPIRB, while most in-shore and fresh-water craft are not.\n\nAs part of the United States efforts to prepare beacon users for the end of 121.5&nbsp;MHz frequency processing by satellites, the FCC has prohibited the use of 121.5&nbsp;MHz EPIRBs as of January 1, 2007 (47 CFR 80.1051). See [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]]'s statement [http://www.sarsat.noaa.gov/phaseout.html on the 121.5/243 phaseout].\n\n=== EPIRB activation ===\nAutomatic EPIRBs are water activated. Some EPIRBs also \"deploy\"; this means that they physically depart from their mounting bracket on the exterior of the vessel (usually by going into the water.)\n\nFor a marine EPIRB to begin transmitting a signal (or \"activate\") it first needs to come out of its bracket (or \"deploy\"). Deployment can happen either manually where someone must physically remove it from its bracket or automatically where water pressure will cause a [[hydrostatic]] release unit to separate the EPIRB from its bracket. If it does not come out of the bracket it will not activate. There is a magnet in the bracket which operates a [[reed switch|reed safety switch]] in the EPIRB. This prevents accidental activation if the unit gets wet from rain or shipped seas.\n\nOnce deployed, EPIRBs can be activated, depending on the circumstances, either manually (crewman flicks a switch) or automatically (when water contacts the unit's \"sea-switch\".) All modern EPIRBs provide both methods of activation and deployment, and thus are labelled \"Manual and Automatic Deployment and Activation.\"\n\n==== Automatic hydrostatic release unit ====\nA '''hydrostatic release unit''' or '''HRU''' is a pressure activated mechanism designed to automatically deploy when certain conditions are met. In the marine environment this occurs when submerged to a maximum depth of four meters. The pressure of the water against a diaphragm within the sealed casing causes a plastic pin to be cut thereby releasing the containment bracket casing, allowing the EPIRB to float free.\n[[File:Epirb hydrostatic release mechanism.jpg|thumb|EPIRB hydrostatic release mechanism]]\n\nSome common characteristics of HRUs are:\n* Water pressure sensitive at depths not to exceed four meters or less than two meters\n* Single use only, require replacement if activated\n* Cannot be serviced; only replaced\n* Waterproof; sealed against moisture and tampering\n* Must be labeled with expiration date\n* Expiration date is two years from month of installation applies to unit and rod\n\n== Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon ==\nA Submarine Emergency Positioning Indicating Radio Beacon (SEPIRB) is an EPIRB that is approved for use on [[Submarine|submarines]].

They thus have several distinguishing operational differences:\n* They are manually activated by hidden buttons or switches, much like the alarms bank tellers use.\n* They are prohibited from emitting a homing signal on 121.5 MHz so as to make transmissions more covert.\n* The COSPAS-SARSAT system sends the distress message to the vessel's country of origin, regardless of the location of the vessel.\nAs with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for SSAS devices.\n== Personal Locator Beacon ==\n[[File:Micro personal locator beacon.jpg|thumb|Miniature Personal Locator Beacon <br> by Microwave Monolithics Incorporated <br> (image courtesy of NASA)]]Personal Locator Beacons (PLBs) are designed for use by individuals who are hiking, kayaking, or conducting other activities on land or water where they are not in or associated with an aircraft or vessel that is equipped with its own ELT or EPIRB. As with EPIRBs, the RTCM maintains specifications for PLB devices.\n\nPLBs vary in size from cigarette-packet to paperback book and weigh 200 g to 1&nbsp;kg (\u00bd to 2\u2155 lb).

There are AIS PLBs that transmit on VHF 70.\n\nPersonal locator beacons operating on 406&nbsp;MHz must be [[#Registration|registered]]. PLBs should not be used in cases where normal emergency response (such as [[9-1-1]]) exists.\n\n====Obsolete PLBs====\n* U.S. Military forces at one time used 121.5/243.0&nbsp;MHz beacons such as the \"PRC-106,\" which had a built-in VHF radio. The military is replacing them with modern 406&nbsp;MHz PLBs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==Beacon content==\nThe most important aspect of a beacon in classification is the mode of transmission. There are two valid transmission modes: digital and analog. Where digital usually has a longer range, analog is more reliable. Analog beacons are useful to search parties and SAR aircraft, though they are no longer monitored by satellite.\n\n===Analog 121.500 MHz homing signal===\n[[File:COSPAS-SARSAT Locator Beacon Sweep Down.ogg|thumb|The radiotelephony locator beacon sound made by ELTs and some EPIRBs.]]All ELTs, all PLBs, and most EPIRBs are required to have a low-power homing signal, that is identical to the original 121.500 MHz VHF beacon signal. However, due to the extremely large number of false alarms that the old beacons generated, the transmit power was greatly reduced, and because the VHF transmitter typically uses the same antenna as the UHF beacon, the radiated signal is further reduced by the inherent inefficiencies of transmitting with an antenna not tuned to the transmitted signal.\n\n===Digital 406&nbsp;MHz beacons===\n406&nbsp;MHz UHF beacons transmit bursts of digital information to orbiting satellites, and may also contain a low-power integrated analog (121.500&nbsp;MHz) [[homing beacon]]. They can be uniquely identified (via [[GEOSAR]]). Advanced beacons encode a [[GPS]] or [[GLONASS]] position into the signal. All beacons are located by Doppler triangulation to confirm the location. The digital data identifies the registered user. A phone call by authorities to the registered phone number often eliminates false alarms (false alarms are the typical case). If there is a problem, the beacon location data guides search and rescue efforts. No beacon is ignored. Anonymous beacons are confirmed by two Doppler tracks before beginning beacon location efforts.\n\nThe distress message transmitted by a 406 beacon contains the information such as:\n* Which country the beacon originates from.\n* A unique 15-digit hexadecimal beacon identification code (a \"15-hex ID\").\n* The encoded identification of the vessel or aircraft in distress, either as an [[MMSI]] value, or as, in the case of an ELT, either the aircraft's [[aircraft registration|registration]] or its [[ICAO 24-bit address]] (from its Mode-S transponder)''.''\n* When equipped, a GPS position.\n* Whether or not the beacon contains a 121.5&nbsp;MHz homing transmitter.\n\nThe digital distress message generated by the beacon varies according to the above factors and is encoded in 30 [[hexadecimal]] characters. The unique 15-character digital identity (the 15-hex ID) is hard-coded in the firmware of the beacon. The 406.025&nbsp;MHz carrier signal is modulated plus or minus 1.1 radians with the data encoded using [[Manchester code|Manchester encoding]], which ensures a net zero phase shift aiding Doppler location<ref>Albert Helfrick, Principles of Avionics, 5th Edition,\nAvionics Communications, 2009\n{{ISBN|1885544278}}, p 287</ref>\n\n====406 MHz beacon facts and transmission schedule====\n* 406&nbsp;MHz beacons transmit for a quarter of a second immediately when turned on, and then transmit a digital burst once every 50 seconds thereafter. Both [[GEOSAR]] and [[LEOSAR]] satellites monitor these signals.\n* The repetition period shall not be so stable that any two transmitters appear to be synchronized closer than a few seconds over a 5-minute period. The intent is that no two beacons will have all of their bursts coincident.

In the U.S., rules were established in 2016 in 47 C.F.R. Part 95\n\nMOB devices with [[Digital selective calling|DSC]] or [[Automatic identification system|AIS]] are allocated [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity|MMSI]] numbers in the range 972yyzzzz.\n\nA MSLD may transmit on '''121.500 MHz''', or one of these: 156.525 MHz, 156.750 MHz, 156.800 MHz, 156.850 MHz, '''161.975 MHz, 162.025 MHz''' (bold are Canadian-required frequencies). Although sometimes defined in the same standards as the COSPAS-SARSAT beacons, MSLDs can not be detected by that satellite network, and are instead intended only for short-range [[Direction finding]] equipment mounted on the vessel on which the survivor was traveling.\n\n=== AIS SART ===\n{{Main article|AIS-SART}}\nThese devices are distinct from traditional SAR radar transponders ([[Search and Rescue Transponder|SART]]), as they transmit AIS messages containing accurate GPS position information and include a [[GPS]] receiver and a transmitter on [[VHF]] [[Automatic Identification System|AIS]] channels, so they show up on ship AIS receivers. They are lightweight and can be used to equip inflatable [[liferaft]]s.\n\nAIS-SART devices are allocated [[Maritime Mobile Service Identity|MMSI]] numbers in the range 970YYxxxx.\n\n=== SEND\u2014Satellite Emergency Notification Device ===\n{{Main|Satellite emergency notification device}}\nThese devices are commonly referred to as SEND (Satellite Emergency Notification Device), and examples include SPOT and inReach.\n\n===APRS===\n{{Main|Automatic Packet Reporting System}}\nAPRS is used by [[amateur radio operator]]s to track positions and send short messages. Most APRS packets contain a [[GPS]] latitude and longitude, so they can be used for both normal and emergency tracking. They also are routed to the Internet, where they are archived for some period of time, and viewable by others. There are several emergency packet types that can indicate distress. Since it is part of the amateur radio service, it costs nothing to transmit on and uses the extensive network, however, one must be a licensed amateur radio operator. There is also no guarantee that an APRS distress packet report would be seen or handled by [[emergency responder]]s. It would have to be seen by an amateur radio operator and forwarded on.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal bar|Transport|Aviation}}\n* {{annotated link|Emergency locator beacon}}\n* {{annotated link|1986 British International Helicopters Chinook crash}}\n* {{annotated link|1996 New Hampshire Learjet crash}}\n* {{annotated link|Acronyms and abbreviations in avionics}}\n* {{annotated link|Aircraft emergency frequency}}\n* {{annotated link|Search and rescue transponder}}\n* {{annotated link|Automatic identification system}}\n* {{annotated link|AIS-SART}}\n* {{annotated link|Avalanche transceiver}}\n* {{annotated link|RECCO}}\n* {{annotated link|Civil Air Patrol}}\n* {{annotated link|Electric beacon}}\n* {{annotated link|ENOS Rescue-System}}\n* {{annotated link|Global Maritime Distress and Safety System}}\n* {{annotated link|Satellite emergency notification device}}\n* {{annotated link|Search and rescue transponder}}\n* {{annotated link|Survival radio}}\n* {{annotated link|Varig Flight 254}}\n* {{annotated link|GPS aircraft tracking}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n\n==References==\n* COSPAS-SARSAT, Document C/S T.001 October 1999\n* FCC, Part 80 and [[GMDSS]]\n* MED, 0735/2001\n* RTCM, Standard for 406&nbsp;MHz Satellite EPIRBs\n\n==External links==\n<!-- Do not put links to vendors of distress radiobeacons here.

However, due to an existing commitment by Channel 4 to cover the [[2019 British Grand Prix]], the coverage switched to their sister channel [[More4]] during the motor racing, returning to Channel 4 after the Grand Prix had finished.

They finished level on 11 points with Pakistan in the round-robin stage (five wins, three losses and one [[Result (cricket)#No result|no result]] after their match against India was interrupted by rain), but took fourth place by virtue of a better [[net run rate]] than Pakistan.\n\nIn the semi-finals, they were paired with India, who finished first in the round-robin stage. The match was played at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] in [[Manchester]] on 9 July. With New Zealand on 211/5 after 46.1 overs, Williamson having scored 67 and [[Ross Taylor]] on the same score at the time, the match was suspended by rain and ultimately play was pushed to the reserve day the next day. Eventually finishing on 239/8, Taylor eventually out for 74, they produced a spirited bowling and fielding performance to leave India 18 runs short. Man of the Match [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] took 3/37, including openers [[Rohit Sharma]] and [[K. L. Rahul]] caught for just one each and [[Dinesh Karthik]] spectacularly caught by [[James Neesham]] for 6. Meanwhile, fellow pace bowler [[Trent Boult]] had captain [[Virat Kohli]] trapped lbw for one and top scorer [[Ravindra Jadeja]] caught by Williamson for 77 when a seventh-wicket partnership looked to be swinging the match back in India's favour. Finally, Martin Guptill ran out World Cup-winning captain [[MS Dhoni]] for 50 with a direct hit to leave India with just their tail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48936573|title=New Zealand beat India to reach World Cup final|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Amy|last=Lofthouse|accessdate=15 July 2019|date=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nEngland, by contrast, entered as the top-ranked ODI team after director of cricket and former Ashes-winning captain [[Andrew Strauss]] helped orchestrate the national team's white-ball revamp following their bowing out in the group stage in 2015. Only a handful of the players who featured in 2019, including Irish-born captain [[Eoin Morgan]], Test captain [[Joe Root]], wicket-keeper Jos Buttler and bowling all-rounder [[Chris Woakes]], were holdovers from that team, though a good number played in the narrow defeat against the West Indies in the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20 Final|2016 World Twenty20 Final]]. Morgan was also the lone remaining member of England\u2019s [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]] champion team \u2013 England\u2019s only ICC world championship going into this final.\n\nTheir campaign was nearly derailed after a loss at Lord's to defending champions and arch-rivals Australia left them having to beat both India and New Zealand to guarantee their semi-final spot. They won both games and finished third in the round-robin stage with 12 points (six wins and three losses out of nine matches). They met group runners-up Australia in the second semi-final at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] on 11 July and soundly defeated them by 8 wickets to progress to the final. Key moments included Woakes having [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] caught for 9, [[Jofra Archer]] trapping captain [[Aaron Finch]] lbw for a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]], Buttler running out Australian top scorer and former captain [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] through his legs on 85 and [[Jason Roy]]'s 85 off 65 as England completed their chase with 107 balls to spare.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Rob |last1=Smyth |first2=Geoff |last2=Lemon |first3=Jim |last3=Waterson |title=England hammer Australia to reach final: Cricket World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/11/australia-v-england-cricket-world-cup-2019-semi-final-live |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 July 2019 |accessdate=15 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Match==\n===Match officials===\n[[File:Lords-Cricket-Ground-Pavilion-06-08-2017.jpg|thumb|[[Lord's]] hosted its fifth [[List of Cricket World Cup finals|Cricket World Cup Final]].]]\nOn 12 July 2019, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) named Sri Lankan Kumar Dharmasena and South African [[Marais Erasmus]] as the [[umpire (cricket)|on-field umpires]], with Australian [[Rod Tucker]] as the [[third umpire]], Pakistani [[Aleem Dar]] as the [[fourth umpire|reserve umpire]] and Sri Lankan [[Ranjan Madugalle]] named as [[match referee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/world_cup_2019/kumar_dharmasena_marais_erasmus_umpires_world_cup_final.html |title=Kumar Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus named as umpires for World Cup final|work=The Cricketer|accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Teams and toss===\nBoth teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches; New Zealand decided that the line-up that beat India against the odds would work in their favour in the final, while England's Jason Roy avoided suspension after his show of dissent in their semi-final match against Australia to open the batting for the hosts.<ref name=\"TossUn\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/14/new-zealand-v-england-cricket-world-cup-final-2019-live |title=England beat New Zealand in thrilling Cricket World Cup final \u2013 as it happened! |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 July 2019 |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |last2=De Lisle |first2=Tim |last3=Bleaney |first3=Rob |last4=Farrer |first4=Martin |last5=Smyth |first5=Rob }}</ref> \n\nSome early rain slightly delayed the [[toss (cricket)|toss]], with the match starting at 10:45, 15 minutes later than scheduled.

With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes hit a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket, bringing their score to 233/8.\n\nFrom the third-last ball of the final over, Stokes drove the ball into mid-wicket. Guptill fielded the ball and threw it back to the striker's end as Stokes was returning to complete a second run; however, as Stokes dived for the crease, the ball deflected off his bat and to the boundary behind the wicket, resulting in four runs being added to the two that Stokes had run. The final two deliveries went for a run each, but England lost their last two wickets going for a second run each time.\n\n===Super Over===\n[[File:Outsuperovertie.png|thumb|left|England finished with the same score as New Zealand, sending the game to a [[Super Over]].]]\n[[File:Cwc2019outwin.png|thumb|The England team celebrate after running out [[Martin Guptill]] in the Super Over.]]\nWith the scores tied at 241, the match went to a Super Over. Stokes and Buttler returned to the crease for England to face the bowling of Trent Boult; the pair scored 15 runs without loss, with both batsmen contributing a boundary four. For New Zealand, Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer, needing 16 runs to claim the title. Archer's over started badly, beginning with a [[Wide (cricket)|wide]], and a steady accumulation of runs, along with a six from Neesham off the third ball, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Facing his first ball of the Super Over and the last of the match, Guptill hit the ball to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one, and Guptill was run out well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs, the Super Over tied, but England's superior boundary count (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they won the World Cup title for the first time in four final appearances. Stokes earned Man of the Match honours with his unbeaten 84, plus eight runs in the Super Over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Recent Match Report \u2013 England vs New Zealand, World Cup, Final|website=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=100%\n|align=center\n|quote=This is the moment!

Despite playing in the second-highest number of finals in the World Cup after Australia, they were yet to win the trophy.<ref name=\"BBC13\"/> New Zealand played in their second final, and also their second in a row. They previously played in the [[2015 Cricket World Cup Final|2015 final]] but were beaten by Australia.<ref name=\"BBC13\"/>\n\nWhen England reached the final, demand increased greatly for it to be shown on a free-to-air television channel in the United Kingdom. Rights holders [[Sky Sports]] agreed to allow [[Channel 4]], who had the rights to broadcast evening highlights of the tournament, to carry the final in a simulcast (England cricket matches are not [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events|compulsory events requiring free-to-air broadcast]]). However, due to an existing commitment by Channel 4 to cover the [[2019 British Grand Prix]], the coverage switched to their sister channel [[More4]] during the motor racing, returning to Channel 4 after the Grand Prix had finished. It was the first time an England international match had been broadcast on free-to-air television in the UK since the [[2005 Ashes series]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.radiotimes.com/news/tv/2019-07-11/cricket-world-cup-final-channel-4-live-coverage-england-new-zealand/|title=Channel 4 to show live coverage of England's Cricket World Cup final|last=Jones|first=Paul|date=11 July 2019|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhichever team won the match would become the first new winner of the World Cup since Sri Lanka's victory in [[1996 Cricket World Cup Final|1996]].

They finished level on 11 points with Pakistan in the round-robin stage (five wins, three losses and one [[Result (cricket)#No result|no result]] after their match against India was interrupted by rain), but took fourth place by virtue of a better [[net run rate]] than Pakistan.\n\nIn the semi-finals, they were paired with India, who finished first in the round-robin stage. The match was played at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]] in [[Manchester]] on 9 July. With New Zealand on 211/5 after 46.1 overs, Williamson having scored 67 and [[Ross Taylor]] on the same score at the time, the match was suspended by rain and ultimately play was pushed to the reserve day the next day. Eventually finishing on 239/8, Taylor eventually out for 74, they produced a spirited bowling and fielding performance to leave India 18 runs short. Man of the Match [[Matt Henry (cricketer)|Matt Henry]] took 3/37, including openers [[Rohit Sharma]] and [[K. L. Rahul]] caught for just one each and [[Dinesh Karthik]] spectacularly caught by [[James Neesham]] for 6. Meanwhile, fellow pace bowler [[Trent Boult]] had captain [[Virat Kohli]] trapped lbw for one and top scorer [[Ravindra Jadeja]] caught by Williamson for 77 when a seventh-wicket partnership looked to be swinging the match back in India's favour. Finally, Martin Guptill ran out World Cup-winning captain [[MS Dhoni]] for 50 with a direct hit to leave India with just their tail.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/48936573|title=New Zealand beat India to reach World Cup final|publisher=BBC Sport|first=Amy|last=Lofthouse|accessdate=15 July 2019|date=10 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nEngland, by contrast, entered as the top-ranked ODI team after director of cricket and former Ashes-winning captain [[Andrew Strauss]] helped orchestrate the national team's white-ball revamp following their bowing out in the group stage in 2015. Only a handful of the players who featured in 2019, including Irish-born captain [[Eoin Morgan]], Test captain [[Joe Root]], wicket-keeper Jos Buttler and bowling all-rounder [[Chris Woakes]], were holdovers from that team, though a good number played in the narrow defeat against the West Indies in the [[2016 ICC World Twenty20 Final|2016 World Twenty20 Final]]. Morgan was also the lone remaining member of England\u2019s [[2010 ICC World Twenty20|2010 World Twenty20]] champion team \u2013 England\u2019s only ICC world championship going into this final.\n\nTheir campaign was nearly derailed after a loss at Lord's to defending champions and arch-rivals Australia left them having to beat both India and New Zealand to guarantee their semi-final spot. They won both games and finished third in the round-robin stage with 12 points (six wins and three losses out of nine matches). They met group runners-up Australia in the second semi-final at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] on 11 July and soundly defeated them by 8 wickets to progress to the final. Key moments included Woakes having [[David Warner (cricketer)|David Warner]] caught for 9, [[Jofra Archer]] trapping captain [[Aaron Finch]] lbw for a [[duck (cricket)|golden duck]], Buttler running out Australian top scorer and former captain [[Steve Smith (cricketer)|Steve Smith]] through his legs on 85 and [[Jason Roy]]'s 85 off 65 as England completed their chase with 107 balls to spare.<ref>{{cite news |first1=Rob |last1=Smyth |first2=Geoff |last2=Lemon |first3=Jim |last3=Waterson |title=England hammer Australia to reach final: Cricket World Cup 2019 \u2013 as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/11/australia-v-england-cricket-world-cup-2019-semi-final-live |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 July 2019 |accessdate=15 July 2019 }}</ref>\n\n==Match==\n===Match officials===\n[[File:Lords-Cricket-Ground-Pavilion-06-08-2017.jpg|thumb|[[Lord's]] hosted its fifth [[List of Cricket World Cup finals|Cricket World Cup Final]].]]\nOn 12 July 2019, the [[International Cricket Council]] (ICC) named Sri Lankan Kumar Dharmasena and South African [[Marais Erasmus]] as the [[umpire (cricket)|on-field umpires]], with Australian [[Rod Tucker]] as the [[third umpire]], Pakistani [[Aleem Dar]] as the [[fourth umpire|reserve umpire]] and Sri Lankan [[Ranjan Madugalle]] named as [[match referee]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thecricketer.com/Topics/world_cup_2019/kumar_dharmasena_marais_erasmus_umpires_world_cup_final.html |title=Kumar Dharmasena and Marais Erasmus named as umpires for World Cup final|work=The Cricketer|accessdate=12 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Teams and toss===\nBoth teams remained unchanged from their semi-final matches; New Zealand decided that the line-up that beat India against the odds would work in their favour in the final, while England's Jason Roy avoided suspension after his show of dissent in their semi-final match against Australia to open the batting for the hosts.<ref name=\"TossUn\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2019/jul/14/new-zealand-v-england-cricket-world-cup-final-2019-live |title=England beat New Zealand in thrilling Cricket World Cup final \u2013 as it happened! |newspaper=The Guardian |date=15 July 2019 |last1=Smyth |first1=Rob |last2=De Lisle |first2=Tim |last3=Bleaney |first3=Rob |last4=Farrer |first4=Martin |last5=Smyth |first5=Rob }}</ref> \n\nSome early rain slightly delayed the [[toss (cricket)|toss]], with the match starting at 10:45, 15 minutes later than scheduled.

With the loss of their top order, England fell to 86/4 in the 24th over; however, a century partnership between Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler for the fifth wicket got them back into the game before Buttler was caught. But with five overs to play, England still required another 46 runs and the bottom order were forced to bat more aggressively. Stokes managed to farm the strike and, more crucially, score runs, leaving England needing 15 to win from the final over, two wickets still in hand. After two dot balls, Stokes hit a six into the stands at deep mid-wicket, bringing their score to 233/8.\n\nFrom the third-last ball of the final over, Stokes drove the ball into mid-wicket. Guptill fielded the ball and threw it back to the striker's end as Stokes was returning to complete a second run; however, as Stokes dived for the crease, the ball deflected off his bat and to the boundary behind the wicket, resulting in four runs being added to the two that Stokes had run. The final two deliveries went for a run each, but England lost their last two wickets going for a second run each time.\n\n===Super Over===\n[[File:Outsuperovertie.png|thumb|left|England finished with the same score as New Zealand, sending the game to a [[Super Over]].]]\n[[File:Cwc2019outwin.png|thumb|The England team celebrate after running out [[Martin Guptill]] in the Super Over.]]\nWith the scores tied at 241, the match went to a Super Over. Stokes and Buttler returned to the crease for England to face the bowling of Trent Boult; the pair scored 15 runs without loss, with both batsmen contributing a boundary four. For New Zealand, Guptill and James Neesham went in to face Jofra Archer, needing 16 runs to claim the title. Archer's over started badly, beginning with a [[Wide (cricket)|wide]], and a steady accumulation of runs, along with a six from Neesham off the third ball, left New Zealand needing two from the final delivery. Facing his first ball of the Super Over and the last of the match, Guptill hit the ball to deep mid-wicket and tried to scamper back for the winning run, but Roy's throw in to Buttler was a good one, and Guptill was run out well short of his crease. New Zealand finished with 15 runs, the Super Over tied, but England's superior boundary count (26 to New Zealand's 17) meant they won the World Cup title for the first time in four final appearances. Stokes earned Man of the Match honours with his unbeaten 84, plus eight runs in the Super Over.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/8039/report/1144530/england-vs-new-zealand-final-icc-cricket-world-cup-2019|title=Recent Match Report \u2013 England vs New Zealand, World Cup, Final|website=ESPNcricinfo|access-date=15 July 2019}}</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n{{Quote box |quoted=true |bgcolor=#FFFFF0 |salign=center\n|width=100%\n|align=center\n|quote=This is the moment!

Casting agent Marvin Schwarz (Pacino) recommends he make [[Spaghetti Western]]s in Italy, which Dalton feels are beneath him.

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears the car and orders them to get off his street. [[Alternate history|Changing their plans]], the Manson Family members decide to instead kill Dalton after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has \"taught them to murder.\" Flower Child deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation. Sadie stumbles outside, alarming Dalton, who is in his pool listening to music on headphones, oblivious to the mayhem. Dalton retrieves a flamethrower that he had previously used in a movie and incinerates Sadie. After Booth is taken to the hospital to treat his injuries, Sebring engages Dalton in conversation outside and Dalton receives an invitation to have a drink with Tate and her friends at her house, which he accepts.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] as Rick Dalton\n* [[Brad Pitt]] as Cliff Booth\n* [[Margot Robbie]] as [[Sharon Tate]]\n* [[Emile Hirsch]] as [[Jay Sebring]]\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as \"Pussycat\"\n* [[Timothy Olyphant]] as [[James Stacy]]\n* [[Julia Butters]] as Trudi Fraser\n* [[Austin Butler]] as \"[[Tex Watson|Tex]]\"\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as \"[[Lynette Fromme|Squeaky]]\"\n* [[Bruce Dern]] as [[George Spahn]]\n* [[Mike Moh]] as [[Bruce Lee]]\n* [[Luke Perry]] as [[Wayne Maunder]]\n* [[Damian Lewis]] as [[Steve McQueen]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as Marvin Schwarz\n* [[Nicholas Hammond]] as [[Sam Wanamaker]]\n* [[Samantha Robinson (American actress)|Samantha Robinson]] as [[Abigail Folger]]\n* [[Rafa\u0142 Zawierucha]] as [[Roman Polanski]]\n* [[Lorenza Izzo]] as Francesca Capucci\n* [[Costa Ronin]] as [[Wojciech Frykowski]]\n* [[Damon Herriman]] as [[Charles Manson|Charlie]]\n* [[Lena Dunham]] as \"[[Catherine Share|Gypsy]]\"\n* [[Madisen Beaty]] as \"[[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]]\"\n* [[Mikey Madison]] as \"[[Susan Atkins|Sadie]]\"\n* James Landry H\u00e9bert as \"[[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan|Clem]]\"\n* [[Maya Hawke]] as \"[[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]]\"\n* [[Victoria Pedretti]] as \"[[Leslie Van Houten|Lulu]]\"\n* [[Sydney Sweeney]] as \"[[:de:Diane Lake|Snake]]\"\n* [[Harley Quinn Smith]] as \"Froggie\"\n* Dallas Jay Hunter as \"Delilah\"\n* [[Kansas Bowling]] as \"[[Sandra Good|Blue]]\"\n* Parker Love Bowling as \"Tadpole\"\n* Cassidy Vick Hice as \"Sundance\"\n* Ruby Rose Skotchdopole as \"Butterfly\"\n* [[Danielle Harris]] as \"Angel\"\n* Josephine Valentina Clark as \"Happy Cappy\"\n* [[Scoot McNairy]] as \"Business\" Bob Gilbert on ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]''\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Ernesto \"The Mexican\" Vaquero on ''Lancer''\n* [[Marco Rodr\u00edguez (actor)|Marco Rodr\u00edguez]] as the [[bartender]] on ''Lancer''\n* [[Ram\u00f3n Franco (actor)|Ram\u00f3n Franco]] as a Land Pirate on ''Lancer'' and Rub\u00e9n, the [[Bruin Theater]] manager\n* Raul Cardona as \"Bad Guy\" Delgado on ''Lancer''\n* Courtney Hoffman as Rebekka\n* [[Dreama Walker]] as [[Connie Stevens]]\n* Rachel Redleaf as [[Cass Elliot|Mama Cass]]\n* [[Rebecca Rittenhouse]] as [[Michelle Phillips]]\n* [[Rumer Willis]] as [[Joanna Pettet]]\n* [[Spencer Garrett]] as Allen Kincade\n* [[Clu Gulager]] as the Larry Edmunds Bookshop owner\n* [[Martin Kove]] as a ''Bounty Law'' Sheriff\n* [[Rebecca Gayheart]] as Billie Booth\n* [[Kurt Russell]] as Randy Miller and the narrator\n* [[Zo\u00eb Bell]] as Janet Miller\n* [[Michael Madsen]] as Sheriff Hackett on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Perla Haney-Jardine]] as a hippie drug dealer\n* [[James Remar]] as \"Ugly Owl\" Hoot on ''Bounty Law''\n* [[Monica Staggs]] as Connie\n* [[Omar Doom]] as Donnie\n* [[Kate Berlant]] as the Bruin Theater ticket booth attendant\n* [[Brenda Vaccaro]] as Mary Alice Schwarz\n* [[Daniella Pick]] as Daphna Ben-Cobo\n* Tom Hartig as [[Altamont Free Concert|Bill \"Sweet William\" Fritsch]]\n* [[David Steen (actor)|David Steen]] as Straight Satan David\n* [[Corey Burton]] as the ''Bounty Law'' promo announcer\n* [[Toni Basil]] as a dancer on the plane during the opening credits sequence<ref name=toni-basil>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |title=Quentin Tarantino's Goddess of Go-Go |first=Debra |last=Levine |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=August 6, 2019 |accessdate=August 6, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190806163003/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/06/arts/dance/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-tarantino-toni-basil.html |archive-date=August 6, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n* Rage Stewart as [[KHJ (AM)|Harvey \"Humble Harve\" Miller]]\n* [[Quentin Tarantino]] as the offscreen director of the Red Apple cigarettes TV commercial.

While he knew he wanted the work to be titled ''Once Upon a Time in Hollywood'', evoking the idea of a fairy tale set in 1960s Hollywood, he publicly referred to the project as ''Magnum Opus''.<ref name=\"esquire may2019\">{{cite magazine | url = https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a27458589/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-leonardo-dicaprio-brad-pitt-quentin-tarantino-interview/ | title = Quentin Tarantino, Brad Pitt, and Leonardo DiCaprio Take You Inside 'Once Upon a Time...In Hollywood' | first = Michael | last = Hainey | date = May 21, 2019 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | magazine = [[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] }}</ref> The life of the work for the first five years was as a novel,<ref name=\"esquire may2019\"/> which Tarantino considered to be an exploratory approach to the story he wanted to tell, not yet having decided if it would be a screenplay. Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows. Tarantino has expressed interest in turning these five scripts, as well as ideas for three more, into an actual ''Bounty Law'' television series in the future.<ref name=Tarantino-Deadline-Interview/>\n\n=== Pre-production ===\nOn July 11, 2017, it was announced that [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s next film would be about the [[Manson Family]] murders. [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] would be involved, but it was not known whether [[The Weinstein Company]] would distribute the film, as Tarantino sought to cast before sending out a package to studios.

When Butler auditioned, he did not know which character it was for. Tarantino told him it was for a villain or a hero on ''Lancer'', when in fact it was for [[Tex Watson|\"Tex\" Watson]]. To prepare for her audition, [[Maya Hawke]] practiced with her father, [[Ethan Hawke]]. She said the process was unlike any other except maybe auditioning for drama school, and during it they worked on the scene in many different ways, with different combinations of people. Willis auditioned for two roles, neither of which she got, then was offered the part of [[Joanna Pettet]].

While filming at [[Musso & Frank Grill]], the owners brought out the original plates.\n\nTo film at the Pussycat Theater, production designer Barbara Ling and her team covered the building's [[LED]] signage and reattached the theater's iconic logo, rebuilding the letters and neon. Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them.

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss their plans and the parts of the property which they wanted to use. After long negotiations the owner agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-Hollywood/>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill.

In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us...

Booth struggles to find stunt work in Hollywood because of rumors he murdered his wife. Actress [[Sharon Tate]] (Robbie) and her husband, director [[Roman Polanski]] (Zawierucha), have moved [[10050 Cielo Drive|next door to Dalton]]. He dreams of befriending them to revive his declining acting career. That night, Tate and Polanski attend a celebrity-filled party at the [[Playboy Mansion]].\n\nThe next day, while repairing Dalton's TV antenna, Booth reminisces about a [[sparring]] contest he had with [[Bruce Lee]] on the set of ''[[The Green Hornet (TV series)|The Green Hornet]]'' which resulted in Booth being fired. Meanwhile, [[Charles Manson]] (Herriman) stops by the Polanski residence looking for [[Record producer|music producer]] [[Terry Melcher]], who used to live there, but is turned away by [[Jay Sebring]] (Hirsch). Tate goes out for errands and stops at a movie theater to watch herself in the film ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]''.\n\nDalton is cast to play the villain in the pilot of ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'', and strikes up a conversation with his eight-year-old co-star, Trudi Fraser. Dalton struggles to remember his lines and later suffers a breakdown in his trailer. He subsequently delivers a performance that impresses Fraser and the director, [[Sam Wanamaker]], bolstering his confidence. \n\nWhile driving Dalton's car, Booth picks up a female hitchhiker named Pussycat, whom he takes to [[Spahn Ranch]], where Booth once worked on the set of ''Bounty Law.'' He takes notice of the many [[hippie]]s living there (the [[Manson Family]]). Suspecting they may be taking advantage of the ranch's owner, [[George Spahn]] (Dern), Booth insists on checking on him despite [[Lynette Fromme|\"Squeaky\" Fromme]]'s (Fanning) objections. Booth finally speaks with Spahn, who dismisses his concerns. Upon leaving, Booth discovers that [[Steve \"Clem\" Grogan]] has slashed a tire on Dalton's car; Booth beats him and forces him to change the tire. [[Tex Watson]] is summoned to deal with the situation but he arrives as Booth is driving away.\n\nAfter watching Dalton's guest performance on an episode of ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', Schwarz books him as the lead in [[Sergio Corbucci]]'s next Spaghetti Western, ''Nebraska Jim''. Dalton takes Booth with him for a six-month stint in Italy, during which he appears in two additional Westerns and a [[Eurospy film|Eurospy]] comedy, and marries Italian starlet Francesca Capucci. With a new wife, Dalton informs Booth he can no longer afford his services.\n\nOn the evening of August 8, 1969, their first day back in Los Angeles, Dalton and Booth go out for drinks to commemorate their time working together and then return to Dalton's house. Tate and Sebring go out for dinner with friends and then return to Tate's house. Booth smokes an [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]]-laced cigarette given to him by Pussycat and takes Brandy for a walk while Dalton prepares drinks. Manson Family members Tex, [[Susan Atkins|Sadie]], [[Linda Kasabian|Flower Child]], and [[Patricia Krenwinkel|Katie]] arrive outside in preparation to [[Tate\u2013LaBianca murders|murder everyone in Tate's house]]. Dalton hears the car and orders them to get off his street. [[Alternate history|Changing their plans]], the Manson Family members decide to instead kill Dalton after Sadie reasons that Hollywood has \"taught them to murder.\" Flower Child deserts the group, speeding off with their car. They break into Dalton's house and confront Capucci and Booth, who recognizes them from his visit to Spahn Ranch. Booth orders Brandy to attack, and together they kill Katie and Tex and injure Sadie, though Booth is stabbed and knocked unconscious in the altercation.

Tarantino tried other writing approaches: the early scene between DiCaprio's Dalton and Pacino's Marvin Schwarz was originally written as a one-act play as part of this exploratory work.<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\"/>\n\nTarantino discovered the centerpiece for the work in 2009 while filming a movie with an actor that had the same stunt double for 20 years. Even though there was nothing but a small bit for the stuntman to do, Tarantino was asked to use him, and he agreed. The relationship fascinated Tarantino and inspired him to make a film about Hollywood.<ref name=recut/> Tarantino said that while the stuntman may have been a perfect double for the actor years earlier, at the time he had come to meet them, \"this was maybe the last or second-to-last thing they'd be doing together\".<ref name=\"gamespot inspiration\">{{cite web | url = https://www.gamespot.com/articles/quentin-tarantino-reveals-inspiration-behind-once-/1100-6472880/ | title =Quentin Tarantino Reveals Inspiration Behind Once Upon A Time In Hollywood | first = James | last = O'Conner | date = January 19, 2020 | accessdate = January 19, 2020 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}</ref>\n\nTarantino first created Cliff Booth, giving him a massive backstory. Then, the actor Booth was the stunt double for Rick Dalton. Tarantino decided to have them be [[Sharon Tate]]'s next-door neighbors in 1969. The first plot point he developed was the ending, then moved backwards from there, this being the first time Tarantino had worked this way. He thought of doing an [[Elmore Leonard]]-type story, but realized he was confident enough in his characters to let them drive the film and let it be a day in the life of Booth, Dalton, and Tate. He would use sequences from Dalton's films for the action, inspired by [[Richard Rush (director)|Richard Rush]]'s ''[[The Stunt Man]]'', which used the scenes from the [[WWI]] movie they were making within the film as the action.<ref>{{cite podcast |last=Lattanzio |first=Ryan |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301 |title=Listen to Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson Talk 'Once Upon a Time in Hollywood' |website=[[IndieWire]] |access-date=September 5, 2019 |date=August 24, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190829013436/https://www.indiewire.com/2019/08/quentin-tarantino-paul-thomas-anderson-once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood-podcast-1202168301/ |archivedate=August 29, 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Further, to get his mind into the Dalton character, Tarantino wrote out five hypothetical episodes of the fictional television show ''Bounty Law'', in which Dalton had starred, having become fascinated with the amount of story crammed into half-hour episodes of 1950s western shows.

Ling said the lettering on every marquee in the film is historically accurate. To restore Larry Edmund's Bookshop, she reproduced the original storefront sign and tracked down period-appropriate merchandise, even recreating book covers. For the Bruin and Fox Village theaters Ling's team restored the theaters, their marquees, and the storefronts around them.

Tarantino and Ling met with the new owner to discuss their plans and the parts of the property which they wanted to use. After long negotiations the owner agreed, and Ling was able to dress the vacant mansion, front courtyard, and backyard for the party scene, evoking as much of the 1960s appearance of the mansion as possible.<ref name=recreating-hollywood>\n\nFor ''Bounty Law'', Ling went for a dusty, dirty, early ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' look. Ling's team found one of the last great living Italian artists to do two of the film's posters. Other posters used and the mugs, are part of Tarantino's personal collection. Movie poster artist [[Steven Chorney]] created the poster for the film, as a reference to ''[[The Mod Squad]]''. He also created the posters for ''Nebraska Jim'', ''Operation Dyn-O-Mite'', ''Uccidimi Subito Ringo Disse il Gringo'', ''Hell-Fire Texas'', and ''Comanche Uprising'', which was reprinted for Dalton's home parking spot. [[Mad (magazine)|''Mad'']] magazine caricaturist [[Tom Richmond (illustrator)|Tom Richmond]] created the covers of ''Mad'' and ''[[TV Guide]]'' featuring Dalton's Jake Cahill.

For ''Bounty Law'' they shot in black and white, and brief sequences in [[Super 8 film|Super 8]] and [[16mm]] [[Ektachrome]]. In the film, ''[[Lancer (TV series)|Lancer]]'' was shot on a retrofitted Western Street backlot at [[Universal Studios]], designed by Ling. Richardson crossed ''Lancer'' with ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'' for the retro-future look Tarantino wanted. The way they filmed ''Lancer'' was not possible in 1969, but Tarantino wanted his personal touch on it. Richardson said that filming the movie touched him personally, \"The film speaks to all of us... We are all fragile beings with a limited time to achieve whatever it is we desire... that at any moment that place will shift...
