The song was written by Stefani, [[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]], supposedly as a response to [[Courtney Love]]'s statement that Stefani was a \"[[cheerleader]]\" in an interview with ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://holefans2011.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6739338-rare-seventeen-magazine-interview-with-courtney-love |title=Rare Seventeen Magazine interview with Courtney Love |date=January 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 25, 2017 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125173832/http://holefans2011.webs.com/apps/blog/show/6739338-rare-seventeen-magazine-interview-with-courtney-love |archivedate=January 25, 2017}}</ref> The song was released as the album's third single on March 15, 2005, and was one of the year's most popular songs, peaking inside the top 10 of the majority of the charts it entered. It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first [[Music download|digital download]] to sell one million copies.\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]], but lost in both categories. \"Hollaback Girl\" divided pop [[music critics]], with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing; men's magazine ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' called it the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for four weeks and was ranked at number two on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2005|Year-End Hot 100]]. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified Platinum in United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and in Australia by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]].\n\nA [[music video]] representing Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]].

Stefani has performed \"Hollaback Girl\" on numerous occasions, including on all three of her concert tours, and on several televised appearances.\n\n==Writing and inspiration==\n[[Gwen Stefani]] had worked with [[The Neptunes]] ([[Pharrell Williams]] and [[Chad Hugo]]) during the early stages of writing songs, including \"Hollaback Girl\", for her debut solo album ''Love. Angel. Music.

Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired. I wanted to go home, but he was like, 'Don't leave yet.'\"<ref name=\"attitude\">{{cite web |last=Vineyard |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1497721/gwen-stefani-answers-no-doubt-fans-with-attitude-song/ |title=Gwen Stefani Answers No Doubt Fans With 'Attitude Song' |publisher=MTV News |date=March 3, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111034958/http://www.mtv.com/news/1497721/gwen-stefani-answers-no-doubt-fans-with-attitude-song/ |archivedate=January 11, 2016}}</ref> When she returned to the studio, Williams began to play Stefani his first solo album, and she became envious.<ref name=\"making\"/> Excited by his material, she decided to write another song with Williams, despite her opinion that the album already contained far too many tracks.<ref name=\"attitude\"/>\n\nTo search for inspiration, Stefani and Williams had a lengthy discussion in which Stefani said that she had yet to write a song about her intentions for pursuing a solo career. She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that [[grunge]] musician [[Courtney Love]] had made about her in an interview with ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school. But I'm not interested in being the cheerleader. I'm not interested in being Gwen Stefani.

She's going to ruin everything'.\"<ref name=\"making\"/> She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.<ref name=\"making\"/> On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"<ref name=\"attitude\"/>\n\nBecause Stefani never disclosed the song title's meaning, reviewers came up with various interpretations. In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, ''[[OC Weekly]]'' critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Stacy |first=Greg |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/this-shit-is-bananas-6399850 |title=This Shit Is Bananas |work=[[OC Weekly]] |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111034955/http://www.ocweekly.com/music/this-shit-is-bananas-6399850 |archivedate=January 11, 2016}}</ref> The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".<ref name=\"NationalReview\">{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Peter |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215282/b-n-n-s-peter-wood |title=B\u2014a\u2014N\u2014a\u2014N\u2014a\u2014S |work=[[National Review]] |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204205231/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215282/b-n-n-s-peter-wood |archivedate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen|filename=Stefani-2004-hollaback-girl.ogg|title=\"Hollaback Girl\"|description=Stefani sings in a chant during the chorus for \"Hollaback Girl\"|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\"Hollaback Girl\" is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] song<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=gwen+stefani+hollaback+girl#v=onepage |title=Reviews: Spotlights |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=117 |issue=28 |page=68 |date=July 9, 2005 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> that draws influence from [[1980s in music#Hip hop|1980s hip hop]] and [[dance music]].<ref name=\"Contact\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/gwenstefanix28x04x05 |title=Gwen Stefani \u2013 Hollaback Girl \u2013 Video Streams |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=April 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208002221/http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/gwenstefanix28x04x05 |archivedate=December 8, 2015}}</ref> It is a moderately fast song, with a [[tempo]] of 110 [[beats per minute]], and it is played in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D-sharp minor|D{{sharp}} minor]].<ref name=\"Digital Sheet Music, Gwen Stefani Hollaback Girl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0145251|title=Digital Sheet Music, Gwen Stefani 'Hollaback Girl'|url-access=subscription |publisher=Musicnotes.com|year=2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916202602/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0145251|archivedate=2016-09-16|df=}}</ref> Like the majority of [[pop music]], it is set in [[time signature|common time]].

It reached number one in Australia and the United States, where it became the first [[Music download|digital download]] to sell one million copies.\n\n\"Hollaback Girl\" received several award nominations, including [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] at the [[48th Grammy Awards]], but lost in both categories. \"Hollaback Girl\" divided pop [[music critics]], with some praising its minimalistic production and others declaring it embarrassing; men's magazine ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' called it the \"Most Annoying Song Ever\". In the United States, it topped the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] for four weeks and was ranked at number two on the [[Billboard Year-End Hot 100 singles of 2005|Year-End Hot 100]]. The single topped the charts in Australia and reached the top-ten in several other countries, including Ireland, Italy, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. It has since been certified Platinum in United States by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], and in Australia by [[Australian Recording Industry Association|ARIA]].\n\nA [[music video]] representing Stefani as a cheerleader at a California high school was released on March 21, 2005, and was directed by [[Paul Hunter (director)|Paul Hunter]].

Stefani flew to New York City to meet up with Williams, and after finishing two songs within a week, Stefani ended the session early and prepared to return home. A few minutes later, Williams called her back into the studio to write another song. Stefani said, \"I was tired.

She remarked how the album was missing an \"attitude song\", and she recalled a derogatory comment that [[grunge]] musician [[Courtney Love]] had made about her in an interview with ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine: \"Being famous is just like being in high school.

She's going to ruin everything'.\"<ref name=\"making\"/> She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became \"Hollaback Girl\". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right.<ref name=\"making\"/> On its creation, Stefani said, \"To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long.\" Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, \"Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style.\"<ref name=\"attitude\"/>\n\nBecause Stefani never disclosed the song title's meaning, reviewers came up with various interpretations. In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, ''[[OC Weekly]]'' critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that \"Gwen is apparently the captain of the cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Stacy |first=Greg |url=http://www.ocweekly.com/music/this-shit-is-bananas-6399850 |title=This Shit Is Bananas |work=[[OC Weekly]] |date=May 5, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111034955/http://www.ocweekly.com/music/this-shit-is-bananas-6399850 |archivedate=January 11, 2016}}</ref> The most commonly accepted meaning is that a \"hollaback girl\" responds positively to the \"catcalls\" or hollers of men, but it might mean to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and \"step it up\".<ref name=\"NationalReview\">{{cite web |last=Wood |first=Peter |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215282/b-n-n-s-peter-wood |title=B\u2014a\u2014N\u2014a\u2014N\u2014a\u2014S |work=[[National Review]] |date=August 30, 2005 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160204205231/http://www.nationalreview.com/article/215282/b-n-n-s-peter-wood |archivedate=February 4, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Composition==\n{{Listen|filename=Stefani-2004-hollaback-girl.ogg|title=\"Hollaback Girl\"|description=Stefani sings in a chant during the chorus for \"Hollaback Girl\"|format=[[Ogg]]}}\n\"Hollaback Girl\" is a [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] song<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Caulfield |first=Keith |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=whQEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA68&dq=gwen+stefani+hollaback+girl#v=onepage |title=Reviews: Spotlights |magazine=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |volume=117 |issue=28 |page=68 |date=July 9, 2005 |issn=0006-2510 |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref> that draws influence from [[1980s in music#Hip hop|1980s hip hop]] and [[dance music]].<ref name=\"Contact\">{{cite magazine |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/gwenstefanix28x04x05 |title=Gwen Stefani \u2013 Hollaback Girl \u2013 Video Streams |magazine=[[Contactmusic.com]] |date=April 28, 2005 |accessdate=January 10, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208002221/http://www.contactmusic.com/pages/gwenstefanix28x04x05 |archivedate=December 8, 2015}}</ref> It is a moderately fast song, with a [[tempo]] of 110 [[beats per minute]], and it is played in the [[key (music)|key]] of [[D-sharp minor|D{{sharp}} minor]].<ref name=\"Digital Sheet Music, Gwen Stefani Hollaback Girl\">{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0145251|title=Digital Sheet Music, Gwen Stefani 'Hollaback Girl'|url-access=subscription |publisher=Musicnotes.com|year=2005|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916202602/http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtd.asp?ppn=MN0145251|archivedate=2016-09-16|df=}}</ref> Like the majority of [[pop music]], it is set in [[time signature|common time]].

She was the first woman to become the head of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa|General Confederation of Workers of Peru]] ({{lang-es|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa (CGTP)}}). She has worked since the 1970s to improve the human and civil rights of Afro-Peruvians and working women. As a founder of the ''Casa de Refugio San Juan de Lurigancho'' she has worked to assist victims of domestic and sexual violence. She was recognized by the Ministry of Culture for her contributions with the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award in 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nDelia Rosa Zamudio Palacios was born in 1943, on the [[hacienda]] \u201cHoja Redonda\u201d in the [[Chincha Province]] of Peru to Victoria Palacios and Grimaldo Zamudio. In the 1950s, her mother migrated with her children to the [[La Victoria District, Lima|La Victoria District of Lima]] in search of employment. After completing the third grade, Zamudio stopped attending school to care for her younger siblings to enable her mother to work. At twelve, she began working as a domestic laborer and three years later began working at the Libertad Canning Factory in the [[R\u00edmac District]]. Simultaneously while working during the day, Zamudio returned to school and completed her primary education. In 1966, she was hired at a pharmaceutical factory and joined the union. Within three years, she was elected as the social assistance secretary of the factory union. Continuing her night studies, Zamudio completed her secondary education at the Escuela Mar\u00eda Parado de Bellido in R\u00edmac in 1971.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\n==Activism==\nZamudio's struggle for her education and to earn a livable wage, as a poor black woman in a predominantly [[Latin American culture|Latino culture]], led her into activism.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}} In 1970, she became a representative of the \"Federation of Laboratories, Drug Stores and Affiliates\" and began participating as a delegate in conventions. Openly critical of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]'s military regime, she attended the 1974 Convention of Industrial Communities to protest the government. Becoming a member of the [[Revolutionary Workers' Party (Peru)|Revolutionary Worker's Party (RWP)]], in 1975, she was selected as the secretary-general of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa|General Confederation of Workers of Peru]] ({{lang-es|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa (CGTP)}}). Her election was the first time a woman or Afro-Peruvian had headed a trade organization in Peru.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}{{sfn|Garay Rengifo|2015}} The CGTP is an umbrella organization of labor unions in Peru and during her tenure through 1980 as the head of the confederation, Zamudio fought for the rights of women workers. In 1977, the union held protests demanding social and political rights and Zamudio was one of those involved in the national strike. She was selected by RWP as a provisional candidate to the [[Constituent Assembly (Peru)|1978 Constituent Assembly]], but as a result of her activism, she was replaced by another candidate and lost her job.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\nIn 1981, Zamudio was a delegate to the Convention of Mexican Laborers and the following year became secretary for women's concerns in the CGTP. In addition to her labor activism, Zamudio attended women\u2019s rights conferences, like the Latin American Feminist Conferences held in Brazil and Mexico in 1986, as well as the 1990 Fifth Argentine Feminist Conference of Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}} Preferring to work in grassroots organizations because of the [[paternalistic]] attitude of more formal women's NGOs, Zamudio's activism focused on training and protection for working-class women.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}{{sfn|Intemann|Kaschinski|1997}} She worked with the Organizing Commission of Peruvian Women (COMUP), to evaluate problems facing women in the work force, looking at maternity rights and sexual harassment, though the proposals did not become law until the 1999 passage of Law 27240 concerning maternity and the 2003 adoption of Law 27942 regarding sexual harassment.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s, when the Peruvian economy became restricted, Zamudio again lost her job and worked from a small shop in her home.{{sfn|Intemann|Kaschinski|1997}} In 1995, a testimonial of her life ''Piel de mujer'' (Woman's Skin) was published, describing what it was like to grow up as a poor, black woman with limited opportunities and how through activism and helping others, she overcame the physical and emotional abuse, racism and discrimination she faced by helping others.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}}{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1995}} She founded a [[women's shelter]], the San Juan de Lurigancho House of Refuge ({{lang-es|Casa de Refugio San Juan de Lurigancho}}), to assist women and children fleeing domestic violence in her neighborhood.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}} Continuing her advocacy for Afro-Peruvians, she works with the Ministry of Women in the Afro-Peruvian Labor Bureau to address concerns of working women.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}} In 2014 on [[International Women's Day]], Zamudio was one of the honorees of the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award for her human rights work.{{sfn|Ministry of Culture|2014}} Her testimony was republished in 2016 by the LUNDU Center for the Afro-Peruvian Study and Promotion ({{lang-es|LUNDU Centro de Estudios y Promoci\u00f3n Afroperuanos}}) in a compilation which included forty case studies of violence against women of African descent in Peru.{{sfn|''SJL

She was the first woman to become the head of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa|General Confederation of Workers of Peru]] ({{lang-es|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa (CGTP)}}). She has worked since the 1970s to improve the human and civil rights of Afro-Peruvians and working women. As a founder of the ''Casa de Refugio San Juan de Lurigancho'' she has worked to assist victims of domestic and sexual violence. She was recognized by the Ministry of Culture for her contributions with the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award in 2014.\n\n==Early life==\nDelia Rosa Zamudio Palacios was born in 1943, on the [[hacienda]] \u201cHoja Redonda\u201d in the [[Chincha Province]] of Peru to Victoria Palacios and Grimaldo Zamudio. In the 1950s, her mother migrated with her children to the [[La Victoria District, Lima|La Victoria District of Lima]] in search of employment. After completing the third grade, Zamudio stopped attending school to care for her younger siblings to enable her mother to work. At twelve, she began working as a domestic laborer and three years later began working at the Libertad Canning Factory in the [[R\u00edmac District]]. Simultaneously while working during the day, Zamudio returned to school and completed her primary education. In 1966, she was hired at a pharmaceutical factory and joined the union. Within three years, she was elected as the social assistance secretary of the factory union. Continuing her night studies, Zamudio completed her secondary education at the Escuela Mar\u00eda Parado de Bellido in R\u00edmac in 1971.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\n==Activism==\nZamudio's struggle for her education and to earn a livable wage, as a poor black woman in a predominantly [[Latin American culture|Latino culture]], led her into activism.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}} In 1970, she became a representative of the \"Federation of Laboratories, Drug Stores and Affiliates\" and began participating as a delegate in conventions. Openly critical of President [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]'s military regime, she attended the 1974 Convention of Industrial Communities to protest the government. Becoming a member of the [[Revolutionary Workers' Party (Peru)|Revolutionary Worker's Party (RWP)]], in 1975, she was selected as the secretary-general of the [[Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa|General Confederation of Workers of Peru]] ({{lang-es|Confederaci\u00f3n General de Trabajadores del Per\u00fa (CGTP)}}). Her election was the first time a woman or Afro-Peruvian had headed a trade organization in Peru.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}{{sfn|Garay Rengifo|2015}} The CGTP is an umbrella organization of labor unions in Peru and during her tenure through 1980 as the head of the confederation, Zamudio fought for the rights of women workers. In 1977, the union held protests demanding social and political rights and Zamudio was one of those involved in the national strike. She was selected by RWP as a provisional candidate to the [[Constituent Assembly (Peru)|1978 Constituent Assembly]], but as a result of her activism, she was replaced by another candidate and lost her job.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\nIn 1981, Zamudio was a delegate to the Convention of Mexican Laborers and the following year became secretary for women's concerns in the CGTP. In addition to her labor activism, Zamudio attended women\u2019s rights conferences, like the Latin American Feminist Conferences held in Brazil and Mexico in 1986, as well as the 1990 Fifth Argentine Feminist Conference of Buenos Aires.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}} Preferring to work in grassroots organizations because of the [[paternalistic]] attitude of more formal women's NGOs, Zamudio's activism focused on training and protection for working-class women.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}{{sfn|Intemann|Kaschinski|1997}} She worked with the Organizing Commission of Peruvian Women (COMUP), to evaluate problems facing women in the work force, looking at maternity rights and sexual harassment, though the proposals did not become law until the 1999 passage of Law 27240 concerning maternity and the 2003 adoption of Law 27942 regarding sexual harassment.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}}\n\nIn the mid-1990s, when the Peruvian economy became restricted, Zamudio again lost her job and worked from a small shop in her home.{{sfn|Intemann|Kaschinski|1997}} In 1995, a testimonial of her life ''Piel de mujer'' (Woman's Skin) was published, describing what it was like to grow up as a poor, black woman with limited opportunities and how through activism and helping others, she overcame the physical and emotional abuse, racism and discrimination she faced by helping others.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}}{{sfn|Gonz\u00e1lez|1995}} She founded a [[women's shelter]], the San Juan de Lurigancho House of Refuge ({{lang-es|Casa de Refugio San Juan de Lurigancho}}), to assist women and children fleeing domestic violence in her neighborhood.{{sfn|Harris II|2011|p=282}} Continuing her advocacy for Afro-Peruvians, she works with the Ministry of Women in the Afro-Peruvian Labor Bureau to address concerns of working women.{{sfn|Arrelucea Barrantes|2016}} In 2014 on [[International Women's Day]], Zamudio was one of the honorees of the Meritorious Personality of Culture Award for her human rights work.{{sfn|Ministry of Culture|2014}} Her testimony was republished in 2016 by the Lundu Center for the Study and Promotion of Afro-Peruvians ({{lang-es|Centro Lund\u00fa de Estudios y Promoci\u00f3n de los Afroperuanos}}) in a compilation which included forty case studies of violence against women of African descent in Peru.{{sfn|''SJL

It may feature sadness, difficulty in thinking and concentration and a significant increase or decrease in appetite and time spent sleeping. People experiencing depression may have feelings of dejection, hopelessness and, sometimes, suicidal thoughts.

Both of these measures are psychological tests that ask personal questions of the participant, and have mostly been used to measure the severity of depression. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) is a self-report scale that helps a therapist identify the patterns of depression symptoms and monitor recovery. The responses on this scale can be discussed in therapy to devise interventions for the most distressing symptoms of depression.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several studies, however, have used these measures to also determine healthy individuals who are not suffering from depression as a mental disorder, but as an occasional mood disorder. This is substantiated by the fact that depression as an emotional disorder displays similar symptoms to minimal depression and low levels of mental disorders such as [[major depressive disorder]]; therefore, researchers were able to use the same measure interchangeably. In terms of the scale, participants scoring between 0-13 and 0-4 respectively were considered healthy individuals.<ref name=\"pmid29121529\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Geisner IM, Mallett K, Varvil-Weld L, Ackerman S, Trager BM, Turrisi R | title = An examination of heavy drinking, depressed mood, drinking related constructs, and consequences among high-risk college students using a person-centered approach | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 78 | issue =  | pages = 22\u201329 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29121529 | pmc = 5783735 | doi = 10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.10.022 }}</ref>\n\nAnother measure of depressed mood would be the IWP Multi-affect Indicator.<ref>{{Cite journal| vauthors = Warr P, Bindl UK, Parker SK, Inceoglu I |date=2014-05-04|title=Four-quadrant investigation of job-related affects and behaviours |journal=European Journal of Work and Organizational Psychology|volume=23|issue=3|pages=342\u2013363|doi=10.1080/1359432X.2012.744449|issn=1359-432X|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/53129/1/Bindl_Four-Quadrant%20Investigation_Accepted.pdf}}</ref> It is a psychological test that indicates various emotions, such as enthusiasm and depression, and asks for the degree of the emotions that the participants have felt in the past week.

The study used 4 latent, distinct profiles of different alcohol intake and level of depression; Mild or Moderate Depression, and Heavy or Severe Drinkers. Other indicators consisting of social factors and individual behaviors were also taken into consideration in the research. Results showed that the level of depression as an emotion negatively affected the amount of risky behavior and consequence from drinking, while having an inverse relationship with protective behavioral strategies, which are behavioral actions taken by oneself for protection from the relative harm of alcohol intake. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Geisner IM, Mallett K, Varvil-Weld L, Ackerman S, Trager BM, Turrisi R | title = An examination of heavy drinking, depressed mood, drinking related constructs, and consequences among high-risk college students using a person-centered approach | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 78 | pages = 22\u201329 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29121529 | pmc = 5783735 | doi = 10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.10.022 }}</ref>\n\n=== Bullying ===\nSocial abuse, such as bullying, are defined as actions of singling out and causing harm on vulnerable individuals. In order to capture a day-to-day observation of the relationship between the damaging effects of social abuse, the victim's [[mental health]] and depressive mood, a study was conducted on whether individuals would have a higher level of depressed mood when exposed to daily acts of negative behavior. The result concluded that being exposed daily to abusive behaviors such as bullying has a positive relationship to depressed mood on the same day.\n\nThe study has also gone beyond to compare the level of depressive mood between the victims and non-victims of the daily bullying. Although victims were predicted to have a higher level of depressive mood, the results have shown otherwise that exposure to negative acts has led to similar levels of depressive mood, regardless of the victim status. The results therefore have concluded that bystanders and non-victims feel as equally depressed as the victim when being exposed to acts such as social abuse.<ref name = \"Hoprekstad_2019\" />\n\n=== Creative thinking ===\nDivergent thinking is defined as a thought process that generates creativity in ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Having a depressed mood will significantly reduce the possibility of divergent thinking, as it reduces the fluency, variety and the extent of originality of the possible ideas generated.<ref name=\"M\u00e9lendez JC 2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e9lendez JC, Alfonso-Benlliure V, Mayordomo T | title = Idle minds are the devil's tools?

Upon identifying several studies and analyzing data involving individuals with high levels of creativity, Christa Taylor was able to conclude that there is a clear positive relationship between creativity and depressive mood. A possible reason is that having a low mood could lead to new ways of perceiving and learning from the world, but it is unable to account for certain depressive disorders. The direct relationship between creativity and depression remains unclear, but the research conducted on this correlation has shed light that individuals who are struggling with a depressive disorder may be having even higher levels of creativity than normal people, and would be a close topic to monitor depending on the future trends of how creativity will be perceived and demanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/03/heres-what-the-evidence-shows-about-the-links-between-creativity-and-depression/|title=Here's what the evidence shows about the links between creativity and depression|last=Fradera|first=Alex| name-list-format = vanc |date=2018|website=Research Digest|language=en|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress management techniques ===\nThere are empirical evidences of a connection between the type of stress management techniques and the level of daily depressive mood.<ref name=\"M\u00e9lendez JC 2017\"/>\n\nProblem-focused coping leads to lower level of depression. Focusing on the problem allows for the subjects to view the situation in an objective way, evaluating the severity of the threat in an unbiased way, thus it lowers the probability of having depressive responses. On the other hand, emotion-focused coping promotes a depressed mood in stressful situations. The person has been contaminated with too much irrelevant information and loses focus on the options for resolving the problem. They fail to consider the potential consequences and choose the option that minimizes stress and maximizes well-being.\n\n== Management ==\nDepressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a [[side effect]] of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that [[antidepressant]]s should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of '''mild''' depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation NICE guidelines, published October 2009].

This is substantiated by the fact that depression as an emotional disorder displays similar symptoms to minimal depression and low levels of mental disorders such as [[major depressive disorder]]; therefore, researchers were able to use the same measure interchangeably.

The study used 4 latent, distinct profiles of different alcohol intake and level of depression; Mild or Moderate Depression, and Heavy or Severe Drinkers. Other indicators consisting of social factors and individual behaviors were also taken into consideration in the research. Results showed that the level of depression as an emotion negatively affected the amount of risky behavior and consequence from drinking, while having an inverse relationship with protective behavioral strategies, which are behavioral actions taken by oneself for protection from the relative harm of alcohol intake. Having an elevated level of depressed mood does therefore lead to greater consequences from drinking.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Geisner IM, Mallett K, Varvil-Weld L, Ackerman S, Trager BM, Turrisi R | title = An examination of heavy drinking, depressed mood, drinking related constructs, and consequences among high-risk college students using a person-centered approach | journal = Addictive Behaviors | volume = 78 | pages = 22\u201329 | date = March 2018 | pmid = 29121529 | pmc = 5783735 | doi = 10.1016/j.addbeh.2017.10.022 }}</ref>\n\n=== Bullying ===\nSocial abuse, such as bullying, are defined as actions of singling out and causing harm on vulnerable individuals. In order to capture a day-to-day observation of the relationship between the damaging effects of social abuse, the victim's [[mental health]] and depressive mood, a study was conducted on whether individuals would have a higher level of depressed mood when exposed to daily acts of negative behavior. The result concluded that being exposed daily to abusive behaviors such as bullying has a positive relationship to depressed mood on the same day.\n\nThe study has also gone beyond to compare the level of depressive mood between the victims and non-victims of the daily bullying. Although victims were predicted to have a higher level of depressive mood, the results have shown otherwise that exposure to negative acts has led to similar levels of depressive mood, regardless of the victim status. The results therefore have concluded that bystanders and non-victims feel as equally depressed as the victim when being exposed to acts such as social abuse.<ref name = \"Hoprekstad_2019\" />\n\n=== Creative thinking ===\nDivergent thinking is defined as a thought process that generates creativity in ideas by exploring many possible solutions. Having a depressed mood will significantly reduce the possibility of divergent thinking, as it reduces the fluency, variety and the extent of originality of the possible ideas generated.<ref name=\"M\u00e9lendez JC 2017\">{{cite journal | vauthors = M\u00e9lendez JC, Alfonso-Benlliure V, Mayordomo T | title = Idle minds are the devil's tools?

Upon identifying several studies and analyzing data involving individuals with high levels of creativity, Christa Taylor was able to conclude that there is a clear positive relationship between creativity and depressive mood. A possible reason is that having a low mood could lead to new ways of perceiving and learning from the world, but it is unable to account for certain depressive disorders. The direct relationship between creativity and depression remains unclear, but the research conducted on this correlation has shed light that individuals who are struggling with a depressive disorder may be having even higher levels of creativity than normal people, and would be a close topic to monitor depending on the future trends of how creativity will be perceived and demanded.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/01/03/heres-what-the-evidence-shows-about-the-links-between-creativity-and-depression/|title=Here's what the evidence shows about the links between creativity and depression|last=Fradera|first=Alex| name-list-format = vanc |date=2018|website=Research Digest|language=en|access-date=2019-03-26}}</ref>\n\n=== Stress management techniques ===\nThere are empirical evidences of a connection between the type of stress management techniques and the level of daily depressive mood.<ref name=\"M\u00e9lendez JC 2017\"/>\n\nProblem-focused coping leads to lower level of depression. Focusing on the problem allows for the subjects to view the situation in an objective way, evaluating the severity of the threat in an unbiased way, thus it lowers the probability of having depressive responses. On the other hand, emotion-focused coping promotes a depressed mood in stressful situations. The person has been contaminated with too much irrelevant information and loses focus on the options for resolving the problem. They fail to consider the potential consequences and choose the option that minimizes stress and maximizes well-being.\n\n== Management ==\nDepressed mood may not require professional treatment, and may be a normal temporary reaction to life events, a symptom of some medical condition, or a [[side effect]] of some drugs or medical treatments. A prolonged depressed mood, especially in combination with other symptoms, may lead to a diagnosis of a psychiatric or medical condition which may benefit from treatment. The UK [[National Institute for Health and Care Excellence]] (NICE) 2009 guidelines indicate that [[antidepressant]]s should not be routinely used for the initial treatment of '''mild''' depression, because the risk-benefit ratio is poor.<ref>[http://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg90/chapter/key-priorities-for-implementation NICE guidelines, published October 2009].

She elected to render the images in extreme close-up, using vintage [[pornography]] stills as her source material. Rather than idealize the act of fornication, by having one body or the other exude dominance or beauty above the other, Tompkins equalizes both figures by showing only their [[genitalia]], in congress.<ref>Cicetti, ibid.</ref> Tompkins' first husband possessed a collection of pornographic magazines and images, amassed since the late 1950s (possession of these images was, at the time, illegal).<ref name=\":0\" /> The works were produced using hundreds of layers of spray paint, using a finely-calibrated [[airbrush]] to build from underdrawing to final image. These early works were made solely with black and white pigments, with extremely high contrasting tonality.\n\nSince returning to the series in 2003, Tompkins uses a base color combination to produce a more illuminated monochrome. She originally entitled the series ''Joined Forms'', as a more modest way of describing the imagery. She would later call the collective series ''Fuck Paintings''. Within this first series, until 1976, Tompkins produced a sub-set of works entitled ''Cow Cunt Paintings''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.flashartonline.com/article/betty-tompkins/|title=Betty Tompkins|last=Simmons|first=William J.|date=2015-10-28|work=|newspaper=Flash Art|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-08|via=}}</ref>\n\n;''Censored Grids (1974\u2013present)''\n\nIn 1974, Tompkins was scheduled to show her work in Paris. Once her painting had arrived, French customs officials had seized it, declaring it obscene and unfit for public exhibition. It would take Tompkins nearly a year to arrange for its return (by then, draining her financially and emotionally from the logistic and legal difficulties).<ref>Mason, ibid.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/betty-tompkins/|title=Betty Tompkins|last=Lark|first=Jasmine|date=|website=WideWalls|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> In response to this ordeal, Tompkins began to make paintings in the form of grids, where a set of white blocks with the word \"censored\" at the center, would block out all traces of genitalia or primary imagery in the composition. Tompkins has said she will continue to make these paintings, as there is seemingly no perceivable end to government/municipal [[censorship]] of visual art.\n\n;''WOMEN Words'' ''(2002 and 2013)''\n\nIn 2002 and 2013, Tompkins circulated the following email: \u201cI am considering doing another series of pieces using images of women {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} words.  I would appreciate your help in developing the vocabulary.  Please send me a list of words that describe women.

She elected to render the images in extreme close-up, using vintage [[pornography]] stills as her source material. Rather than idealize the act of fornication, by having one body or the other exude dominance or beauty above the other, Tompkins equalizes both figures by showing only their [[genitalia]], in congress.<ref>Cicetti, ibid.</ref> Tompkins' first husband possessed a collection of pornographic magazines and images, amassed since the late 1950s (possession of these images was, at the time, illegal).<ref name=\":0\" /> The works were produced using hundreds of layers of spray paint, using a finely-calibrated [[airbrush]] to build from underdrawing to final image. These early works were made solely with black and white pigments, with extremely high contrasting tonality.\n\nSince returning to the series in 2003, Tompkins uses a base color combination to produce a more illuminated monochrome. She originally entitled the series ''Joined Forms'', as a more modest way of describing the imagery. She would later call the collective series ''Fuck Paintings''. Within this first series, until 1976, Tompkins produced a sub-set of works entitled ''Cow Cunt Paintings''.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.flashartonline.com/article/betty-tompkins/|title=Betty Tompkins|last=Simmons|first=William J.|date=2015-10-28|work=|newspaper=Flash Art|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-08|via=}}</ref>\n\n;''Censored Grids (1974\u2013present)''\n\nIn 1974, Tompkins was scheduled to show her work in Paris. Once her painting had arrived, French customs officials had seized it, declaring it obscene and unfit for public exhibition. It would take Tompkins nearly a year to arrange for its return (by then, draining her financially and emotionally from the logistic and legal difficulties).<ref>Mason, ibid.</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.widewalls.ch/artist/betty-tompkins/|title=Betty Tompkins|last=Lark|first=Jasmine|date=|website=WideWalls|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref> In response to this ordeal, Tompkins began to make paintings in the form of grids, where a set of white blocks with the word \"censored\" at the center, would block out all traces of genitalia or primary imagery in the composition. Tompkins has said she will continue to make these paintings, as there is seemingly no perceivable end to government/municipal [[censorship]] of visual art.\n\n;''WOMEN Words'' ''(2002 and 2013)''\n\nIn 2002 and 2013, Tompkins circulated the following email: \u201cI am considering doing another series of pieces using images of women {{sic|comprised|hide=y| of}} words.  I would appreciate your help in developing the vocabulary.  Please send me a list of words that describe women.

Many, many thanks, Betty Tompkins.\u201d  Over 3,500 words and phrases were submitted in seven languages, equally split between men and women.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://flagartfoundation.org/exhibitions/women-words-phrases-and-stories/|title=WOMEN Words, Phrases, and Stories - The FLAG Art Foundation|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=|access-date=2016-10-08|language=en-US|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/la-et-cm-galleries-betty-tompkins-20160805-snap-story.html|title=How would you describe women?

Inspired by that performance, the artist then set out to create 1,000 individual word paintings, intending the series to be presented en masse once complete. On January 1, 2013, Tompkins created the first painting ''SLUT (#1)''. In an interview with [[Art in America]], Tompkins says, \"People sent stories, too. They made comments. It was very personal.

[[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] (233.474&nbsp;mph) turned the fastest lap during the morning practice session, the fastest single lap at the track since 1996. Three cars (Carlos Huertas, Ryan Hunter-Reay, and Scott Dixon) got out onto the track to begin qualifying, but it began to rain during Dixon's run. Dixon had just completed his first lap at 231.357&nbsp;mph. The rest of the day was washed out, and officials rescheduled time trials for Sunday. The three runs from Saturday were erased.\n\n*'''Weather''': {{convert|71|\u00b0F|0}}, overcast and rain\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=8|Saturday, May 16, 2015\n|-\n! {{abbr|Pos.|Position}} !! {{abbr|No.|Car Number}} !!

After the rainout on Saturday, originally, the schedule for Sunday was to include practice, first round qualifying, and the annual Fast Nine Shootout. However, during the morning practice session, Ed Carpenter suffered a serious crash in turn two. The car did a half spin and hit the outside wall at the exit of turn two. Sliding backwards, the car flipped over, and slid to a stop upside-down. It was the third blowover crash by a Chevrolet for the week. Series officials postponed qualifying, and huddled with participants to address safety concerns. After a lengthy delay, rules were tweaked for qualifying. Cars were required to qualify in race trim, and the increased turbocharger \"boost\" for qualifying was eliminated. Each car would get one attempt, and the Fast Nine Shootout was scrapped. Time permitting, there would be a final row \"shootout\" amongst the four slowest cars to determine positions 31-33, as well as the lone car to be bumped.\n\n[[Scott Dixon]], who had his Saturday attempt interrupted by rain, was the third car out to qualify. His speed of 226.760&nbsp;mph wound up being the fastest of the day. It held up all afternoon, as the rest of the field had to qualify in less-than-ideal track conditions. The entire qualifying line was completed without incident.\n\nDue to the last minute rule changes, championship points were not awarded for Indy 500 time trials results as planned. [[Tristan Vautier]] qualified the #19 car in substitution for [[James Davison]], a pre-planned arrangement. Davison was racing in the [[2015 Pirelli World Challenge season|Pirelli World Challenge]] event at [[Canadian Tire Motorsport Park]] the same weekend. Davison was set to take over the car on race day, and per series rules, the car would move to the rear of the field.\n\n*'''Weather''': {{convert|79|\u00b0F|0}}, overcast\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=8|Sunday, May 17, 2015\n|-\n!colspan=9|Locked-In Qualifiers: Positions 1\u201330\n|-\n! {{abbr|Pos.|Position}} !! {{abbr|No.|Car Number}} !!

[[Jack Hawksworth]] and KVSH Racing teammates [[Stefano Coletti]], and [[Bryan Clauson]] completed runs, filling the field. [[Buddy Lazier]], who was not able to make an attempt during the first round, was the only other car eligible. Because of INDYCAR rules, Lazier had limited practice laps for the month, and his first attempt was well short at 219.438&nbsp;mph. The team made some drastic wing adjustments, and scrambled to get the car to the qualifying line in the final minutes. His second attempt was faster, but still shy of bumping his way into the field.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n|-\n!colspan=9|Locked-In Qualifiers: Positions 31\u201333\n|-\n! {{abbr|Pos.|Position}} !! {{abbr|No.|Car Number}} !!

The practice was marred by a massive crash around 12:45&nbsp;p.m. involving [[James Hinchcliffe]]. Going into turn three, Hinchcliffe was drafting behind [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]. Suddenly the car suffered a right front suspension failure, and the car veered into the outside wall. The right side of the car was disintegrated, and the car slid through the north short chute, tilting up on one side, and coming to rest in turn four. Hinchcliffe was awake and alert, but was pinned in the cockpit and needed assistance from the car. One of the suspension pieces had penetrated the cockpit tub, and punctured Hinchcliffe's thigh, causing profuse bleeding.<ref name=\"racer\">{{cite news|url=http://www.racer.com/indycar/item/116939-indy-500-hinchcliffe-saved-from-serious-injuries|title=Quick safety team response key in critical Hinchcliffe crash|publisher=Racer.com|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235728/http://www.racer.com/indycar/item/116939-indy-500-hinchcliffe-saved-from-serious-injuries|archive-date=2015-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was taken to [[Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] for surgery to remove the debris from his thigh, and the quick response work by IndyCar safety crews was credited in likely saving his life.<ref name=\"racer\"/> The track was closed while series officials made repairs to the [[SAFER Barrier]], and investigated the cause of the crash.

Per race rules, the car, which had originally qualified for the 21st starting position, was moved to the rear of the field.\n\n:<sup>2</sup> [[James Hinchcliffe]] qualified the original #5 car in 24th, but was injured in the ensuing day's practice session.  Schmidt Peterson Motorsports named [[Ryan Briscoe]] to replace Hinchcliffe.  A backup car was utilized, and Briscoe was moved to the rear of the field.\n\n:<sup>3</sup> [[Carlos Huertas]] qualified the #18 car but was diagnosed with an ear infection and was not medically cleared to race. Tristan Vautier was named to replace Huertas, and was moved to the rear of the field.\n\n==Race==\nClear skies and warm temperatures were seen on race day. As the field pulled away for parade laps, [[Alex Tagliani]] remained stationary with issues getting the car into gear. The problem was eventually resolved and Tagliani resumed his spot in the starting lineup.\n\nAs the field continued the parade laps, fire erupted from underneath the car of [[Conor Daly]]. Daly pulled the car to a stop at the North short chute, his day was done before the race even began.\n\n===First half===\n\n====Start====\n[[Scott Dixon]] led the field into turn one. As the field rounded turn one, the first incident of the day occurred when [[Sage Karam]] squeezed [[Takuma Sato]] into the turn 1 wall. [[Ryan Briscoe]] also spun trying to avoid the incident. Karam was out of the race, while Sato and Briscoe were able to effect repairs and continue.\n\nUnder caution, behind the pace car, as the field came around for the restart on lap 7, [[Simona de Silvestro]] rear-ended [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], damaging de Silvestro's left-front wing and Montoya's right-rear bumper, which detached just before Montoya entered pit lane for repairs, causing an extended caution period to clear the debris. After two more restart attempts, the race finally went green on lap 13. The race became a three-way battle for the lead between [[Scott Dixon]], [[Tony Kanaan]], and [[Simon Pagenaud]], with the three swapping the lead regularly. The first round of green flag pit stops briefly promoted Montoya, who had refueled during his stop for repairs, into the lead. When he pitted, Dixon resumed the lead.\n\n====Second quarter====\nThe second caution of the race came on lap 64, when [[Bryan Clauson]] drifted wide in turn four and hit the outside barrier. During yellow flag pit stops, [[Simon Pagenaud]] was able to jump ahead of the [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] teammates and take the lead.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 71, and the battle between Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan continued from where it left off. Another round of green flag pit stops came, during which [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] briefly inherited the lead. When stops were cycled through, Pagenaud emerged the leader again.\n\n===Second half===\n\n====Halfway====\nThe third caution of the race came on lap 113, when [[Ed Carpenter (racing driver)|Ed Carpenter]] clipped [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]] and sent both into the wall in turn one. During this caution, an incident involving all three of the [[Dale Coyne Racing]] cars occurred on pit lane. [[James Davison]] was released just as his teammate [[Pippa Mann]] was passing his pit stall. The two made contact, and Davison slid into the car and crew of his other teammate, [[Tristan Vautier]]. Two crew members from Vautier's team were hit, and one suffered a broken ankle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalecoyneracing.com/news-releases/coyne-racing-news-05-24-15.html |title=Coyne Team Ready to Turn the Page After Tough Indy 500 |date=May 24, 2015 |publisher=[[Dale Coyne Racing]] |access-date=28 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527203241/http://www.dalecoyneracing.com/news-releases/coyne-racing-news-05-24-15.html |archive-date=2015-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both Vautier and Davison retired from the race due to the incident.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 122, with [[Will Power]] joining Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan in the battle for the lead.\n\n====Fourth quarter====\n[[File:JuanMontoya2015Indy500.JPG|thumb|Juan Pablo Montoya]]\nGreen flag pit stops again came with roughly 50 laps left in the race. As the pit stop cycle neared completion, the fourth caution of the race came on lap 153 as [[Tony Kanaan]], fresh off a wing adjustment, lost control of his car in turn three and crashed. [[Alex Tagliani]] briefly held the lead, but surrendered it to make his pit stop.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 160 with [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] joining the battle for the lead, having finally recovered from the early race mishap. 7 laps later, the fifth caution of the day came out for a piece of debris that had come off of the car of [[Takuma Sato]]. The leaders made their last stops of the race during this caution, with [[Will Power]] coming out in front. [[Andretti Autosport]] teammates [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] and [[Carlos Mu\u00f1oz (racing driver)|Carlos Mu\u00f1oz]] elected to stay out during this sequence, with Mu\u00f1oz inheriting the lead.\n\nThe race was restarted on lap 173, with Wilson and Mu\u00f1oz quickly shuffled back by cars with fresher tires. As the field worked around the Andretti Autosport drivers on lap 176, [[Simon Pagenaud]] clipped the rear of [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]], causing front wing damage to Pagenaud's car and causing him to drop rapidly through the field. Only three turns later, a three-car crash occurred in turn 4 when [[Jack Hawksworth]] lost control of his car and hit [[Sebasti\u00e1n Saavedra]] from behind. Saavedra's car continued sliding back across the track and into the path of [[Stefano Coletti]], who slammed into the front end of Saavedra's car. Saavedra needed assistance in climbing from his car and was later diagnosed with a [[Bruise|foot contusion]].\n\nThe race was restarted on lap 184 with Power in the lead. The last 13 laps saw the lead exchange hands four times between Dixon, Power and Montoya. With four laps remaining, Montoya slip-streamed around the outside of Power into turn one and took the lead. With clean air, Montoya was able to fend off Power for the remaining three laps and win the second Indianapolis 500 of his career.\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! {{abbr|Pos|Position}}\n! {{abbr|No.|Car Number}}\n!

After the rainout on Saturday, originally, the schedule for Sunday was to include practice, first round qualifying, and the annual Fast Nine Shootout. However, during the morning practice session, Ed Carpenter suffered a serious crash in turn two. The car did a half spin and hit the outside wall at the exit of turn two. Sliding backwards, the car flipped over, and slid to a stop upside-down. It was the third blowover crash by a Chevrolet for the week. Series officials postponed qualifying, and huddled with participants to address safety concerns. After a lengthy delay, rules were tweaked for qualifying. Cars were required to qualify in race trim, and the increased turbocharger \"boost\" for qualifying was eliminated. Each car would get one attempt, and the Fast Nine Shootout was scrapped. Time permitting, there would be a final row \"shootout\" amongst the four slowest cars to determine positions 31-33, as well as the lone car to be bumped.\n\n[[Scott Dixon]], who had his Saturday attempt interrupted by rain, was the third car out to qualify. His speed of 226.760&nbsp;mph wound up being the fastest of the day. It held up all afternoon, as the rest of the field had to qualify in less-than-ideal track conditions. The entire qualifying line was completed without incident.\n\nDue to the last minute rule changes, championship points were not awarded for Indy 500 time trials results as planned.

The practice was marred by a massive crash around 12:45&nbsp;p.m. involving [[James Hinchcliffe]]. Going into turn three, Hinchcliffe was drafting behind [[Juan Pablo Montoya]]. Suddenly the car suffered a right front suspension failure, and the car veered into the outside wall. The right side of the car was disintegrated, and the car slid through the north short chute, tilting up on one side, and coming to rest in turn four. Hinchcliffe was awake and alert, but was pinned in the cockpit and needed assistance from the car. One of the suspension pieces had penetrated the cockpit tub, and punctured Hinchcliffe's thigh, causing profuse bleeding.<ref name=\"racer\">{{cite news|url=http://www.racer.com/indycar/item/116939-indy-500-hinchcliffe-saved-from-serious-injuries|title=Quick safety team response key in critical Hinchcliffe crash|publisher=Racer.com|date=May 19, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150520235728/http://www.racer.com/indycar/item/116939-indy-500-hinchcliffe-saved-from-serious-injuries|archive-date=2015-05-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> He was taken to [[Indiana University Health Methodist Hospital|Methodist Hospital]] for surgery to remove the debris from his thigh, and the quick response work by IndyCar safety crews was credited in likely saving his life.<ref name=\"racer\"/> The track was closed while series officials made repairs to the [[SAFER Barrier]], and investigated the cause of the crash.

A backup car was utilized, and Briscoe was moved to the rear of the field.\n\n:<sup>3</sup> [[Carlos Huertas]] qualified the #18 car but was diagnosed with an ear infection and was not medically cleared to race. Tristan Vautier was named to replace Huertas, and was moved to the rear of the field.\n\n==Race==\nClear skies and warm temperatures were seen on race day. As the field pulled away for parade laps, [[Alex Tagliani]] remained stationary with issues getting the car into gear. The problem was eventually resolved and Tagliani resumed his spot in the starting lineup.\n\nAs the field continued the parade laps, fire erupted from underneath the car of [[Conor Daly]]. Daly pulled the car to a stop at the North short chute, his day was done before the race even began.\n\n===First half===\n\n====Start====\n[[Scott Dixon]] led the field into turn one. As the field rounded turn one, the first incident of the day occurred when [[Sage Karam]] squeezed [[Takuma Sato]] into the turn 1 wall. [[Ryan Briscoe]] also spun trying to avoid the incident. Karam was out of the race, while Sato and Briscoe were able to effect repairs and continue.\n\nUnder caution, behind the pace car, as the field came around for the restart on lap 7, [[Simona de Silvestro]] rear-ended [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], damaging de Silvestro's left-front wing and Montoya's right-rear bumper, which detached just before Montoya entered pit lane for repairs, causing an extended caution period to clear the debris. After two more restart attempts, the race finally went green on lap 13. The race became a three-way battle for the lead between [[Scott Dixon]], [[Tony Kanaan]], and [[Simon Pagenaud]], with the three swapping the lead regularly. The first round of green flag pit stops briefly promoted Montoya, who had refueled during his stop for repairs, into the lead. When he pitted, Dixon resumed the lead.\n\n====Second quarter====\nThe second caution of the race came on lap 64, when [[Bryan Clauson]] drifted wide in turn four and hit the outside barrier. During yellow flag pit stops, [[Simon Pagenaud]] was able to jump ahead of the [[Chip Ganassi Racing]] teammates and take the lead.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 71, and the battle between Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan continued from where it left off. Another round of green flag pit stops came, during which [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] briefly inherited the lead. When stops were cycled through, Pagenaud emerged the leader again.\n\n===Second half===\n\n====Halfway====\nThe third caution of the race came on lap 113, when [[Ed Carpenter (racing driver)|Ed Carpenter]] clipped [[Oriol Servi\u00e0]] and sent both into the wall in turn one. During this caution, an incident involving all three of the [[Dale Coyne Racing]] cars occurred on pit lane. [[James Davison]] was released just as his teammate [[Pippa Mann]] was passing his pit stall. The two made contact, and Davison slid into the car and crew of his other teammate, [[Tristan Vautier]]. Two crew members from Vautier's team were hit, and one suffered a broken ankle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dalecoyneracing.com/news-releases/coyne-racing-news-05-24-15.html |title=Coyne Team Ready to Turn the Page After Tough Indy 500 |date=May 24, 2015 |publisher=[[Dale Coyne Racing]] |access-date=28 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527203241/http://www.dalecoyneracing.com/news-releases/coyne-racing-news-05-24-15.html |archive-date=2015-05-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Both Vautier and Davison retired from the race due to the incident.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 122, with [[Will Power]] joining Pagenaud, Dixon, and Kanaan in the battle for the lead.\n\n====Fourth quarter====\n[[File:JuanMontoya2015Indy500.JPG|thumb|Juan Pablo Montoya]]\nGreen flag pit stops again came with roughly 50 laps left in the race. As the pit stop cycle neared completion, the fourth caution of the race came on lap 153 as [[Tony Kanaan]], fresh off a wing adjustment, lost control of his car in turn three and crashed. [[Alex Tagliani]] briefly held the lead, but surrendered it to make his pit stop.\n\nThe race restarted on lap 160 with [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] joining the battle for the lead, having finally recovered from the early race mishap. 7 laps later, the fifth caution of the day came out for a piece of debris that had come off of the car of [[Takuma Sato]]. The leaders made their last stops of the race during this caution, with [[Will Power]] coming out in front. [[Andretti Autosport]] teammates [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]] and [[Carlos Mu\u00f1oz (racing driver)|Carlos Mu\u00f1oz]] elected to stay out during this sequence, with Mu\u00f1oz inheriting the lead.\n\nThe race was restarted on lap 173, with Wilson and Mu\u00f1oz quickly shuffled back by cars with fresher tires. As the field worked around the Andretti Autosport drivers on lap 176, [[Simon Pagenaud]] clipped the rear of [[Justin Wilson (racing driver)|Justin Wilson]], causing front wing damage to Pagenaud's car and causing him to drop rapidly though the field. Only three turns later, a three-car crash occurred in turn 4 when [[Jack Hawksworth]] lost control of his car and hit [[Sebasti\u00e1n Saavedra]] from behind. Saavedra's car continued sliding back across the track and into the path of [[Stefano Coletti]], who slammed into the front end of Saavedra's car. Saavedra needed assistance in climbing from his car and was later diagnosed with a [[Bruise|foot contusion]].\n\nThe race was restarted on lap 184 with Power in the lead. The last 13 laps saw the lead exchange hands four times between Dixon, Power and Montoya. With four laps remaining, Montoya slip-streamed around the outside of Power into turn one and took the lead. With clean air, Montoya was able to fend off Power for the remaining three laps and win the second Indianapolis 500 of his career.\n\n==Box score==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;\"\n! {{abbr|Pos|Position}}\n! {{abbr|No.|Car Number}}\n!

Uploaded by Dr. [[Helen Wang]]. Retrieved: 11 May 2018.</ref> By the year 1938 several factors created the environment to make these token coins flourish, the occupying [[Japanese people|Japanese]] forces were seizing all copper coins for the production of weaponry, the international price of copper had risen substantially, and the Chinese resistance was hoarding copper and [[silver]] coins.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The companies that had produced these Chinese tokens were previously medal-makers and silversmiths and saw their businesses boom due to the demand for these low denomination bronze tokens.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> \n\nA vast number of token coins were brought into general circulation and these coins were made from a number of different materials including [[bone]], [[aluminium]], [[bronze]], [[lead]], and re-used bronze.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The most simple method of producing token coins was to take an old circulating coin, remove either all or only some of the coin's original design, and then stamp a new design on the coin.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/>\n\nOn 31 March 1941 the [[Wang Jingwei regime|Japanese puppet government]] in [[Nanjing]] had issued the \"Temporary Regulations about Punishment for Obstruction to the New Legal Currency\" this law affected Jiangsu, Zhejiang, [[Anhui]], and in the cities of Nanjing and [[Shanghai]].<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> There is no evidence that Chinese tokens were promoted by the Chinese resistance, but one of its issuers, [[Zhou Rongsheng]], was a Chinese resistance faction leader in [[Shizhuang]].<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The continued and illegal usage of these bronze token coins might have been a source of solidarity among the people of Jiangsu.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> \n\nAfter 1941 the Japanese puppet government over-issued paper money which lead to inflation and caused the smaller denomination token coins to disappear from circulation.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> \n\n=== Zheng Lu Bridge tokens ===\n\n'''Zheng Lu Bridge tokens''' ([[Traditional Chinese]]: \u912d\u9678\u6a4b\u9322; [[Simplified Chinese]]: \u90d1\u9646\u6865\u94b1; [[Pinyin]]: ''zh\u00e8ng l\u00f9 qi\u00e1o qi\u00e1n'') were a type of Chinese token that originated in the city of [[Changzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] from 1939 until 1941, these tokens were manufactured contemporary to other Chinese tokens and [[bamboo tallies]] in the same area as the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] invasion of China disrupted the local economy forcing locals to start issuing their own currencies in the form of [[exonumia]].<ref name=\"PrimaltrekZhengLuBridgeTokens\">{{cite web|url=

\u05d0\u05e9\u05db\u05e0\u05d6\u05d9 (Primaltrek \u2013 a journey through Chinese culture)|language=en}}</ref> Zheng Lu Bridge tokens were issued by a variety of local stores and others and had a very limited region of circulation.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekZhengLuBridgeTokens\"/> These tokens were issued due to various factors including a lack of small value currency, the profitability of accepting old Chinese copper coins to be exchanged for new local tokens, as well as the lack of confidence in the currencies issued by Japanese puppet banks.<ref name=\"PrimaltrekZhengLuBridgeTokens\"/> Zheng Lu Bridge tokens typically contain an image of the Zheng Lu Bridge which was a bridge built during the [[Ming dynasty]] in Changzhou where at one side of the bridge a lot of people had the surname [[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] and on the other side [[Lu (surname)|Lu]] and a man with the surname Zheng and a woman with the surname Lu fell in love with each other and as the family wished to arrange a wedding for them during the spring festival they had recommended against using a ferry so as both clans were affluent enough to pay for a bridge and the bridge was finished the day prior to their wedding, because of this association with love some Zheng Lu Bridge tokens contain images of hearts, and usually contained inscriptions indicating where these tokens were intended to circulate such as ''zh\u00e8ng l\u00f9 qi\u00e1o li\u00fa t\u014dng'' (\u912d\u9678\u6a4b\u6d41\u901a, \u201cCirculates in Zheng Lu Bridge\u201d).<ref name=\"PrimaltrekZhengLuBridgeTokens\"/> \n\n=== \"Xinsheng\" tokens === \n\nThe Xinsheng [Trust Abundant] company was a delicatessen-brewery located at the Ligang East Street in the [[Xixishu Village]], [[Ligang Town]], [[Jiangyin City]], [[Jiangsu]] owned by the Zhang family, in the year 1939 this company issued their own token coins which were known as \"Xinsheng tokens\".<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The brother of the owned of the Xinsheng [Trust Abundant] company owned a meat-store in the same street and concurrently issued his own token coins known as \"Chao Ji\" tokens.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> \n\nDuring this era issuing token coins was viewed as both a good way to increase a company's reputation as well as to promote their business.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The Zhang family issued a total of 3,000 token coins, the cost of producing a 1 ''jiao'' token was 1 ''fen'' in legal currency, so the company made a 9 ''fen'' profit on every token coin of 1 ''jiao'', which meant that the Zhang family made a profit of 270 ''[[Yuan (currency)|yuan]]''.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> Note that at this time a single ''dan'' (hectolitre) of [[rice]] cost 15 ''yuan'', which meant that the Xinsheng delicatessen-brewery and the Zhang family made a large profit from issuing these \"Xinsheng\" tokens.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/>\n\n== Chinese tokens in the collection of the British Museum == \n\nIn the years 1992 and 1993 the [[British Museum]] had acquired 66 token coins from 1930s [[Southeast China]].<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> Of these coins, 65 are round in shape, and most of these coins are circa 28 millimeters in diameter and weigh between 7 and 8 grams, making them similar in size and weight as the contemporary Chinese 10 ''[[Chinese cash (currency unit)|w\u00e9n]]'' coins.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The other token is long in shape.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> \n\nMost of the Chinese token coins in the collection of the British Museum have chops on their reverses and contain [[serial number]]s.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> Most of the Chinese tokens in the collection of the British Museum are from Southern Jiangsu with the majority being from [[Lingtai County]], Jiangsu.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/> The most common design having the place-name on the top, the [[English language|English]] inscription \"TEN CENTS\" at the bottom, and the Traditional Chinese inscription \"\u4e00\u89d2\" in their centre.<ref name=\"DrHelenWangBritishMuseum\"/>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Chinese

[[Zheng (surname)|Zheng]] and on the other side [[Lu (surname)|Lu]] and a man with the surname Zheng and a woman with the surname Lu fell in love with each other and as the family wished to arrange a wedding for them during the spring festival they had recommended against using a ferry so as both clans were affluent enough to pay for a bridge and the bridge was finished the day prior to their wedding, because of this association with love some Zheng Lu Bridge tokens contain images of hearts, and usually contained inscriptions indicating where these tokens were intended to circulate such as

They were married in 1582, when he was 18 and she was 26 years old. She outlived her husband by seven years. Very little is known about her beyond a few references in legal documents. Her personality and relationship to Shakespeare have been the subject of much speculation by many historians and creative writers.\n\n==Life==\nHathaway is believed to have grown up in [[Shottery]], a village just to the west of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], Warwickshire, England. She is assumed to have grown up in the farmhouse that was the Hathaway family home, which is located at Shottery and is now a major tourist attraction for the village. Her father, Richard Hathaway, was a [[yeoman]] farmer. He died in September 1581 and left his daughter the sum of ten [[mark (currency)#england and scotland|marks]] or \u00a36 13s 4d (six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence) to be paid \"at the day of her marriage\".<ref name=\"shakespeare1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/content/view/50/50/ |title=Anne Hathaway's Cottage & Gardens \u2013 Shakespeare Birthplace Trust |work=shakespeare.org.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510192302/http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/content/view/50/50/ |archivedate=10 May 2008 }}</ref> In her father's will, her name is listed as \"Agnes\", leading to some scholars believing that she should be referred to as \"Agnes Hathaway\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pogue|first1=Kate|title=Shakespeare's Family|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-275-99510-2|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w0oHBU6VBhwC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22Anne+Hathaway%22+Agnes+father%27s+will#v=onepage&q=%22Anne%20Hathaway%22%20Agnes%20father%27s%20will&f=false}}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Anne Hathaways Cottage and gardens 15g2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hathaway family cottage]] near Stratford]]\nHathaway married Shakespeare in November 1582 while already pregnant with the couple's first child, to whom she gave birth six months later. This age difference, added to Hathaway's [[antenuptial]] pregnancy, has been employed by some historians as evidence that it was a \"[[shotgun wedding]]\", forced on a somewhat reluctant Shakespeare by the Hathaway family. There is, however, no other evidence for this inference.\n\nFor a time it was believed that this view was supported by documents from the Episcopal Register at Worcester, which records in [[Latin]] the issuing of a wedding licence to \"William Shakespeare\" and one \"Anne Hathaway\" of [[Temple Grafton]]. The following day, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from Stratford, signed a [[surety]] of \u00a340 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of \"William Shagspere<!-- Please do not 'correct' the spelling of these names. This is the spelling used in the document --> and Anne Hathwey<!-- Please do not 'correct' the spelling of these names. This is the spelling used in the document -->\".<ref name=\"sana\">Stanley Wells, \"Hathaway, Anne\". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 185. Sandells had overseen the drawing up of Richard Hathaway's will and Richardson had been a witness.</ref> [[Frank Harris]], in ''The Man Shakespeare'' (1909), argued that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two women. He had chosen to marry one, [[Anne Whateley]], but when this became known he was immediately forced by Hathaway's family to marry their pregnant relative. Harris believed that \"Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless\" because of his entrapment by her and that this was the spur to his decision to leave Stratford and pursue a career in the theatre.<ref>Frank Harris, ''The Man Shakespeare'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2007, (reprint) p. 362.</ref>\n\nHowever, according to [[Stanley Wells]], writing in the ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', most modern scholars take the view that the name Whateley was \"almost certainly the result of clerical error\".<ref>Stanley Wells, \"Whateley, Anne\". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 185, 518. See also Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: a life'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 84.</ref>\n\n[[Germaine Greer]] argues that the age difference between Shakespeare and Hathaway is not evidence that he was forced to marry her, but that he was the one who pursued her. Women such as the orphaned Hathaway often stayed at home to care for younger siblings and married in their late twenties. As a husband Shakespeare offered few prospects; his family had fallen into financial ruin, while Hathaway, from a family in good standing both socially and financially, would have been considered a catch. Furthermore, a [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|\"handfast\" or probationary marriage]] and pregnancy were frequent precursors to legal marriage at the time. Examining the surviving records of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and nearby villages in the 1580s, Greer argues that two facts stand out quite prominently: first, that a large number of brides went to the altar already pregnant; and second, that autumn, not spring, was the most common time to get married. Shakespeare was bound to marry Hathaway, who had become pregnant by him, but there is no reason to assume that this had not always been his intention. It is nearly certain that the respective families of the bride and groom had known one another.<ref name=\"greer2007\">{{cite book\n  | last = Greer\n  | first = Germaine\n  | authorlink = Germaine Greer\n  | year = 2008\n  | title = Shakespeare's Wife\n  | publisher = Harper\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-06-153715-8\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/shakespeareswife00gree\n  }}</ref>\n\nThree children were born to Hathaway and her husband: [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]] in 1583 and the twins [[Hamnet Shakespeare|Hamnet]] and [[Judith Quiney|Judith]] in 1585. Hamnet died at 11 years old during one of the frequent outbreaks of the [[bubonic plague]] and was buried in Stratford upon Avon on 11 August 1596.\n\nApart from documents related to her marriage and the birth of her children, the only recorded reference to Hathaway in her lifetime is a curious bequest in the will of her father's shepherd, Thomas Whittington, who died in 1601. Whittington left 40 shillings to \"the poor of Stratford\", adding that the money was \"in the hand of Anne Shakespeare wife unto Master William Shakespeare, and is due debt unto me, being paid to mine executor by the said William Shakespeare or his assigns according to the true meaning of this my will.\" This passage has been interpreted in several different ways. One view is that Whittington may have lent Anne the money, presumably because she was short of cash while her husband was away. More likely, however, it may have been \"uncollected wages, or savings held in safekeeping\", since the will also lists debts owed to him from her brothers in the same amount.<ref name=\"Schoenbaum\" />\n\nIn 1607, Hathaway's daughter Susanna married the local doctor, [[John Hall (physician)|John Hall]], giving birth to Hathaway's and Shakespeare's granddaughter, [[Elizabeth Barnard|Elizabeth]]. The following year Judith married [[Thomas Quiney]], who was a vintner and tavern owner from a good family, in February 1616 when she was 31 and he was 27. Shakespeare may later have disapproved of this choice when it was discovered that Quiney had got another girl pregnant; also, Quiney had failed to obtain a special wedding licence needed during Lent, leading to Judith and Thomas being excommunicated on 12 March. Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit \u00a3300 in her own name, leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.<ref name=\"literarygenius.info\">{{cite web| url= http://www.literarygenius.info/children-william-shakespeare.htm| title=The Children of William Shakespeare |work=literarygenius.info}}</ref>\n\nIt has sometimes been inferred that Shakespeare came to dislike his wife, but there is no existing documentation or correspondence to support this supposition. For most of their married life, he lived in London, writing and performing his plays, while she remained in Stratford. However, according to [[John Aubrey]], he returned to Stratford for a period every year.<ref>Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett, William Montgomery, ''William Shakespeare, a textual companion'', W. W. Norton & Company, 1997, p. 90</ref> When he retired from the theatre in 1613, he chose to live in Stratford with his wife, rather than in London.\n\n=== Shakespeare's will ===\nIn his will Shakespeare famously made only one bequest to his wife, his \"second-best bed with the furniture\". There is no reference to the \"best\" bed, which would have been included in the main bequest to Susanna. This bequest to Anne has often been interpreted as a slight, implying that Anne was in some sense only the \"second best\" person in his intimate life.<ref name = \"garb\"/> A few explanations have been offered: first, it has been claimed that, according to law, Hathaway was entitled to receive one third of her husband's estate, regardless of his will,<ref>Best, Michael (2005) [http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/life/anne.html Anne's inheritance]. Internet Shakespeare Editions, University of Victoria, Canada.</ref> though this has been disputed.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> It has been speculated that Hathaway was to be supported by her children. Germaine Greer suggests that the bequests were the result of agreements made at the time of Susanna's marriage to Dr Hall: that she (and thus her husband) inherited the bulk of Shakespeare's estate. Shakespeare had business ventures with Dr Hall, and consequently appointed John and Susanna as executors of his will. Dr Hall and Susanna inherited and moved into New Place after Shakespeare's death.<ref name=\"literarygenius.info\"/> This would also explain other examples of Shakespeare's will being apparently ungenerous, as in its treatment of his younger daughter Judith.\n\nThere is indication that Hathaway may have been financially secure in her own right.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> The [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] states that \"beds and other pieces of household furniture were often the sole bequest to a wife\" and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=21 |publisher=The National Archives (UK government)|title= Shakespeare's will}}</ref> In Shakespeare's time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor as it might seem in modern times.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> In [[Elizabethan]] custom the best bed in the house was reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.\n\nHowever, the will as initially drafted did not mention Anne at all. It was only through a series of additions, made on 25 March 1616, slightly less than a month before Shakespeare died, that the bequest to his wife of his \"second best bed with the furniture\" was made. Author Stephen Greenblatt in ''Will in the World,'' suggests that as Shakespeare lay dying, \"he tried to forget his wife and then remembered her with the second-best bed. And when he thought of the afterlife, the last thing he wanted was to be mingled with the woman he married. There are four lines carved in [Shakespeare's] gravestone in the chancel of Stratford Church: ''Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare, To digg the dust encloased heare: Bleste be ye man y't spares thes stones, And curst be he y't moves my bones.'' [Shakespeare may have] feared that his bones would be dug up and thrown in the nearby charnel house ... but he may have feared still more that one day his grave would be opened to let in the body of Anne Shakespeare.\"<ref>Stephen Greenblatt, ''Will in the World, How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare'', W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 2004.</ref>\n\n=== Burial ===\n[[File:Anne Shakespeare tombstone.JPG|thumb|Inscribed brass on Anne Shakespeare's tombstone in the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]]]]\nA tradition recorded in 1693 is that Hathaway \"greatly desired\" to be buried with her husband.<ref name = \"garb\">Marjorie Garber, ''Profiling Shakespeare'', Routledge, 2008, pp. 170\u2013175.</ref> In fact she was interred in a separate grave next to him in the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]]. The inscription states, \"Here lyeth the body of Anne wife of William Shakespeare who departed this life the 6th day of August 1623 being of the age of 67 years.\" A Latin inscription followed which translates as \"Breasts, O mother, milk and life thou didst give.

It has also been suggested that the next words, \"And saved my life\", would have been indistinguishable in pronunciation from \"Anne saved my life\".<ref>[http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/145comm.htm ''Shakespeare-ssonnets.com'']. Retrieved 19 April 2007</ref> The sonnet differs from all the others in the length of the lines. Its fairly simple language and syntax have led to suggestions that it was written much earlier than the other, more mature, sonnets.\n\n{{quote\n|\nThose lips that Love's own hand did make <br />\nBreathed forth the sound that said 'I hate' <br />\nTo me that languish'd for her sake; <br />\nBut when she saw my woeful state <br />\nStraight in her heart did mercy come, <br />\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet <br />\nWas used in giving gentle doom, <br />\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet: <br />\n'I hate' she alter'd with an end, <br />\nThat follow'd it as gentle day <br />\nDoth follow night, who like a fiend <br />\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away; <br />\n'I hate' from '''hate away''' she threw, <br />\n'''And saved my life''', saying 'not you.'\n}}\n\n=== Other literature ===\nThe following poem about Anne has also been ascribed to Shakespeare, but its language and style are not typical of his verse.

Emma Severn's novel ''Anne Hathaway, or, Shakespeare in Love'' (1845) portrays an idealised romance and happy marriage in an idyllic rural Stratford.<ref>Watsaon, Nicola, \"Shakespeare on the Turist Trail\", Robert Shaughnessy (ed), ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare and Popular Culture'', Cambridge University Press, 2007, p. 211.</ref> She also appears in [[William Black (novelist)|William Black]]'s 1884 novel ''Judith Shakespeare'' about her daughter, portrayed as a conventional dutiful wife and concerned parent with a wayward daughter.<ref>Black, William, ''Judith Shakespeare, her Love Affairs and Other Adventures'', New York, 1884.</ref>\n\nBy the early 20th century a more negative image of Hathaway emerged, following the publication of [[Frank Harris]]'s books on Shakespeare's love life, and after the discovery that Anne was already pregnant when the couple married.

More recent literature has included more varied representations of her.

Anne is depicted as shrewish in the first play, and as spiteful towards her former rival in the latter.<ref>[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/anthology/good_men_do.pdf ''The Good Men Do''.]</ref> A frosty relationship is also portrayed in [[Edward Bond]]'s play ''[[Bingo (play)|Bingo: Scenes of Money and Death]]'' (1973), about Shakespeare's last days, and in the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]''.\n\n''The World's Wife'', a collection of poems by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], features a sonnet entitled \"[[Anne Hathaway (poem)|Anne Hathaway]]\", based on the passage from Shakespeare's will regarding his \"second-best bed\". Duffy chooses the view that this would be their marriage bed, and so a memento of their love, not a slight. Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of \"romance and drama\", unlike the \"prose\" written on the best bed used by guests, \"I hold him in the casket of my widow's head/ as he held me upon that next best bed\". In [[Robert Nye]]'s novel ''Mrs Shakespeare: the Complete Works'', which purports to be Anne's autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays. He refers to the bed he bequeaths her as \"the second best\" to remind her of the best bed of their memories. The novel was dramatised for BBC radio in 1998 with [[Maggie Steed]] playing Hathaway.\n\nThe [[Connie Willis]] short story \"Winter's Tale,\" which combines factual information about Anne Hathaway with a fictitious Shakespeare identity theory, also characterises the nature of the relationship as loving and the bequeath of the second-best bed as romantically significant.\n\nAnne Hathaway appears in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book section [[The Sandman: The Wake#\"The Tempest\"|\"The Tempest\"]], part of [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''The Sandman'']] series. She and Shakespeare share a tumultuous, yet affectionate, relationship.  Gaiman's interpretation suggests that Anne deliberately became pregnant to force her husband to marry her, but the context implies that neither of them ultimately regret their decision.\n\nThrough her long-running solo show ''Mrs Shakespeare, Will's first and last love'' (1989) American actress-writer Yvonne Hudson has had a long relationship with both the historical and dramatic Anne Hathaway. She depicts Anne and Will as maintaining a friendship despite the challenges inherent to their long separations and tragedies. Mining early and recent scholarship and the complete works, Hudson concurs that evidence of the couple's mutual respect is indeed evident in the plays and sonnets, along with support for the writer's infatuations and possibly adulterous relationships. Hudson also chooses the positive view of the bed bequest, sharing that \"it may have been only here that I possessed William.\" ''Mrs Shakespeare'' explores the realities of keeping house without a husband while applying some dramatic licence. This allows Anne to have at least a country wife's understanding of her educated spouse's work as she quotes sonnets and soliloquies to convey her feelings. The 2005 play ''[[Shakespeare's Will (play)|Shakespeare's Will]]'' by Canadian playwright [[Vern Thiessen]] is similar in form to Hudson's show. It is a one-woman piece that focuses on Anne Hathaway on the day of her husband's funeral. Avril Rowland's ''Mrs Shakespeare'' (2005) depicts Anne as a multi-tasking \"[[Superwoman (sociology)|superwoman]]\" who runs the home efficiently while also writing her husband's plays in a businesslike partnership with him as her promoter/performer.<ref name = \"kat\"/>\n\n[[File:Falstaff.jpg|thumb|''Falstaff'': part of the sculpture park in the cottage garden]]\nThe [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' provides an example of the negative view, depicting the marriage as a cold and loveless bond that Shakespeare must escape to find love in London. The same situation occurs in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s alternate-history novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' (2002), in which Shakespeare seeks and actually wins a divorce from Hathaway to marry his new girlfriend. A similarly loveless relationship is depicted in the film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' (2005).\n\n''The Secret Confessions of Anne Shakespeare'' (2010), a novel by [[Arliss Ryan]], also proposes Anne Hathaway as the true author of many of the Shakespeare plays (a claim originally made in 1938<ref>R. C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, p. 54. Churchill refers to an article entitled \"The Plays of Mrs. Shakespeare\" by [[J. P. de Fonseka]] in ''G.K's Weekly'', 3 March 1938.</ref>). In the novel, Anne follows Will to London to support his acting career. As he finds his true calling in writing, Anne's own literary skills flower, leading to a secret collaboration that makes William Shakespeare the foremost playwright in Elizabethan England.\n\nShe is portrayed by [[Liza Tarbuck]] in the [[BBC Two]] comedy series ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', which follows the writing and preparation to stage ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' after William has gained some early career notoriety for his poetry, ''[[Henry VI (play)|Henry VI]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.\n\nAnne Hathaway is portrayed by [[Judi Dench]] in the 2018 historical film ''[[All Is True]]''.\n\nAnne is portrayed by actress [[Cassidy Janson]] in the musical ''[[& Juliet]]''. The show opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on November 20, 2019.\n\n== Anne Hathaway's Cottage ==\n{{main|Anne Hathaway's Cottage}}\nAnne Hathaway's childhood was spent in a house near Stratford-upon-Avon in [[Warwickshire]], England. Although it is often called a [[cottage]], it is, in fact, a spacious twelve-roomed farmhouse, with several bedrooms, now set in extensive gardens. It was known as Newlands Farm in Shakespeare's day and had more than {{convert|90|acre|hectare}} of land attached to it. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible [[timber framing]], a trademark of vernacular [[Tudor style architecture]].\n\nAfter the death of Anne's father, the cottage was owned by Anne's brother Bartholomew, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems forced them to sell it. It is now owned and managed by the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]], and is open to public visitors as a museum.<ref name=\"shakespeare1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway}}\n* [https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/exhibition/document/shakespeare-marriage-bond Hathaway and Shakespeare's marriage bond]\n* [http://www.britishtours.com/360/anne-hathaways-cottage Virtual Tour of Anne Hathaway's home]\n\n{{Family tree of William Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hathaway, Anne}}\n[[Category:1556 births]]\n[[Category:1623 deaths]]\n[[Category:Shakespeare family]]\n[[Category:People from Stratford-upon-Avon]]\n[[Category:Women of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English people]]\n[[Category:16th-century English women]]\n[[Category:17th-century English women]]\n[[Category:Burials in Warwickshire]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the wife of William Shakespeare|the actress|Anne Hathaway}}\n\n{{short description|Wife of William Shakespeare}}\n{{EngvarB|date=December 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=December 2019}}\n{{Infobox person\n| name       = Anne Hathaway\n| image      = AnneHathaway CUL Page4DetailB.jpg\n| imagesize  =\n| caption    = [[Portrait of Anne Hathaway|This drawing]] by Sir [[Sir Nathaniel Curzon, 4th Baronet|Nathaniel Curzon]], dated 1708, purportedly depicts Anne Hathaway.

They were married in 1582, when he was 18 and she was 26 years old. She outlived her husband by seven years. Very little is known about her beyond a few references in legal documents, but her personality and relationship to Shakespeare have been the subject of much speculation by many historians and creative writers.\n\n==Life==\nHathaway is believed to have grown up in [[Shottery]], a village just to the west of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], Warwickshire, England. She is assumed to have grown up in the farmhouse that was the Hathaway family home, which is located at Shottery and is now a major tourist attraction for the village. Her father, Richard Hathaway, was a [[yeoman]] farmer. He died in September 1581 and left his daughter the sum of ten [[mark (currency)#england and scotland|marks]] or \u00a36 13s 4d (six pounds, thirteen shillings and fourpence) to be paid \"at the day of her marriage\".<ref name=\"shakespeare1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/content/view/50/50/ |title=Anne Hathaway's Cottage & Gardens \u2013 Shakespeare Birthplace Trust |work=shakespeare.org.uk |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510192302/http://www.shakespeare.org.uk/content/view/50/50/ |archivedate=10 May 2008 }}</ref> In her father's will, her name is listed as \"Agnes\", leading to some scholars believing that she should be referred to as \"Agnes Hathaway\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pogue|first1=Kate|title=Shakespeare's Family|date=2008|publisher=Greenwood|isbn=978-0-275-99510-2|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/?id=w0oHBU6VBhwC&pg=PA58&lpg=PA58&dq=%22Anne+Hathaway%22+Agnes+father%27s+will#v=onepage&q=%22Anne%20Hathaway%22%20Agnes%20father%27s%20will&f=false}}</ref>\n\n=== Marriage ===\n[[File:Anne Hathaways Cottage and gardens 15g2006.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hathaway family cottage]] near Stratford]]\nHathaway married Shakespeare in November 1582 while already pregnant with the couple's first child, to whom she gave birth six months later. This age difference, added to Hathaway's [[antenuptial]] pregnancy, has been employed by some historians as evidence that it was a \"[[shotgun wedding]]\", forced on a somewhat reluctant Shakespeare by the Hathaway family. There is, however, no other evidence for this inference.\n\nFor a time it was believed that this view was supported by documents from the Episcopal Register at Worcester, which records in [[Latin]] the issuing of a wedding licence to \"William Shakespeare\" and one \"Anne Hathaway\" of [[Temple Grafton]]. The following day, Fulk Sandells and John Richardson, friends of the Hathaway family from Stratford, signed a [[surety]] of \u00a340 as a financial guarantee for the wedding of \"William Shagspere<!-- Please do not 'correct' the spelling of these names. This is the spelling used in the document --> and Anne Hathwey<!-- Please do not 'correct' the spelling of these names. This is the spelling used in the document -->\".<ref name=\"sana\">Stanley Wells, \"Hathaway, Anne\". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 185. Sandells had overseen the drawing up of Richard Hathaway's will and Richardson had been a witness.</ref> [[Frank Harris]], in ''The Man Shakespeare'' (1909), argued that these documents are evidence that Shakespeare was involved with two women. He had chosen to marry one, [[Anne Whateley]], but when this became known he was immediately forced by Hathaway's family to marry their pregnant relative. Harris believed that \"Shakespeare's loathing for his wife was measureless\" because of his entrapment by her and that this was the spur to his decision to leave Stratford and pursue a career in the theatre.<ref>Frank Harris, ''The Man Shakespeare'', BiblioBazaar, LLC, 2007, (reprint) p. 362.</ref>\n\nHowever, according to [[Stanley Wells]], writing in the ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', most modern scholars take the view that the name Whateley was \"almost certainly the result of clerical error\".<ref>Stanley Wells, \"Whateley, Anne\". ''Oxford Companion to Shakespeare'', Oxford University Press, 2005, pp. 185, 518. See also Park Honan, ''Shakespeare: a life'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 84.</ref>\n\n[[Germaine Greer]] argues that the age difference between Shakespeare and Hathaway is not evidence that he was forced to marry her, but that he was the one who pursued her. Women such as the orphaned Hathaway often stayed at home to care for younger siblings and married in their late twenties. As a husband Shakespeare offered few prospects; his family had fallen into financial ruin, while Hathaway, from a family in good standing both socially and financially, would have been considered a catch. Furthermore, a [[History of marriage in Great Britain and Ireland|\"handfast\" or probationary marriage]] and pregnancy were frequent precursors to legal marriage at the time. Examining the surviving records of [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] and nearby villages in the 1580s, Greer argues that two facts stand out quite prominently: first, that a large number of brides went to the altar already pregnant; and second, that autumn, not spring, was the most common time to get married. Shakespeare was bound to marry Hathaway, who had become pregnant by him, but there is no reason to assume that this had not always been his intention. It is nearly certain that the respective families of the bride and groom had known one another.<ref name=\"greer2007\">{{cite book\n  | last = Greer\n  | first = Germaine\n  | authorlink = Germaine Greer\n  | year = 2008\n  | title = Shakespeare's Wife\n  | publisher = Harper\n  | location = New York\n  | isbn = 978-0-06-153715-8\n  | url-access = registration\n  | url = https://archive.org/details/shakespeareswife00gree\n  }}</ref>\n\nThree children were born to Hathaway and her husband: [[Susanna Hall|Susanna]] in 1583 and the twins [[Hamnet Shakespeare|Hamnet]] and [[Judith Quiney|Judith]] in 1585. Hamnet died at 11 years old during one of the frequent outbreaks of the [[bubonic plague]] and was buried in Stratford upon Avon on 11 August 1596.\n\nApart from documents related to her marriage and the birth of her children, the only recorded reference to Hathaway in her lifetime is a curious bequest in the will of her father's shepherd, Thomas Whittington, who died in 1601. Whittington left 40 shillings to \"the poor of Stratford\", adding that the money was \"in the hand of Anne Shakespeare wife unto Master William Shakespeare, and is due debt unto me, being paid to mine executor by the said William Shakespeare or his assigns according to the true meaning of this my will.\" This passage has been interpreted in several different ways. One view is that Whittington may have lent Anne the money, presumably because she was short of cash while her husband was away. More likely, however, it may have been \"uncollected wages, or savings held in safekeeping\", since the will also lists debts owed to him from her brothers in the same amount.<ref name=\"Schoenbaum\" />\n\nIn 1607, Hathaway's daughter Susanna married the local doctor, [[John Hall (physician)|John Hall]], giving birth to Hathaway's and Shakespeare's granddaughter, [[Elizabeth Barnard|Elizabeth]]. The following year Judith married [[Thomas Quiney]], who was a vintner and tavern owner from a good family, in February 1616 when she was 31 and he was 27. Shakespeare may later have disapproved of this choice when it was discovered that Quiney had got another girl pregnant; also, Quiney had failed to obtain a special wedding licence needed during Lent, leading to Judith and Thomas being excommunicated on 12 March. Soon afterwards, on 25 March 1616, Shakespeare modified his will for Judith to inherit \u00a3300 in her own name, leaving Quiney out of the will and giving most of his property to Susanna and her husband.<ref name=\"literarygenius.info\">{{cite web| url= http://www.literarygenius.info/children-william-shakespeare.htm| title=The Children of William Shakespeare |work=literarygenius.info}}</ref>\n\nIt has sometimes been inferred that Shakespeare came to dislike his wife, but there is no existing documentation or correspondence to support this supposition. For most of their married life, he lived in London, writing and performing his plays, while she remained in Stratford. However, according to [[John Aubrey]], he returned to Stratford for a period every year.<ref>Stanley Wells, Gary Taylor, John Jowett, William Montgomery, ''William Shakespeare, a textual companion'', W. W. Norton & Company, 1997, p. 90</ref> When he retired from the theatre in 1613, he chose to live in Stratford with his wife, rather than in London.\n\n=== Shakespeare's will ===\nIn his will Shakespeare famously made only one bequest to his wife, his \"second-best bed with the furniture\". There is no reference to the \"best\" bed, which would have been included in the main bequest to Susanna. This bequest to Anne has often been interpreted as a slight, implying that Anne was in some sense only the \"second best\" person in his intimate life.<ref name = \"garb\"/> A few explanations have been offered: first, it has been claimed that, according to law, Hathaway was entitled to receive one third of her husband's estate, regardless of his will,<ref>Best, Michael (2005) [http://internetshakespeare.uvic.ca/Library/SLT/life/anne.html Anne's inheritance]. Internet Shakespeare Editions, University of Victoria, Canada.</ref> though this has been disputed.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> It has been speculated that Hathaway was to be supported by her children. Germaine Greer suggests that the bequests were the result of agreements made at the time of Susanna's marriage to Dr Hall: that she (and thus her husband) inherited the bulk of Shakespeare's estate. Shakespeare had business ventures with Dr Hall, and consequently appointed John and Susanna as executors of his will. Dr Hall and Susanna inherited and moved into New Place after Shakespeare's death.<ref name=\"literarygenius.info\"/> This would also explain other examples of Shakespeare's will being apparently ungenerous, as in its treatment of his younger daughter Judith.\n\nThere is indication that Hathaway may have been financially secure in her own right.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> The [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] states that \"beds and other pieces of household furniture were often the sole bequest to a wife\" and that, customarily, the children would receive the best items and the widow the second-best.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/museum/item.asp?item_id=21 |publisher=The National Archives (UK government)|title= Shakespeare's will}}</ref> In Shakespeare's time, the beds of prosperous citizens were expensive affairs, sometimes equivalent in value to a small house. The bequest was thus not as minor as it might seem in modern times.<ref name=\"greer2007\" /> In [[Elizabethan]] custom the best bed in the house was reserved for guests. If so, then the bed that Shakespeare bequeathed to Anne could have been their marital bed, and thus not intended to insult her.\n\nHowever, the will as initially drafted did not mention Anne at all. It was only through a series of additions, made on 25 March 1616, slightly less than a month before Shakespeare died, that the bequest to his wife of his \"second best bed with the furniture\" was made. Author Stephen Greenblatt in ''Will in the World,'' suggests that as Shakespeare lay dying, \"he tried to forget his wife and then remembered her with the second-best bed. And when he thought of the afterlife, the last thing he wanted was to be mingled with the woman he married. There are four lines carved in [Shakespeare's] gravestone in the chancel of Stratford Church: ''Good friend for Jesus sake forbeare, To digg the dust encloased heare: Bleste be ye man y't spares thes stones, And curst be he y't moves my bones.'' [Shakespeare may have] feared that his bones would be dug up and thrown in the nearby charnel house ... but he may have feared still more that one day his grave would be opened to let in the body of Anne Shakespeare.\"<ref>Stephen Greenblatt, ''Will in the World, How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare'', W. W. Norton & Company, New York, 2004.</ref>\n\n=== Burial ===\n[[File:Anne Shakespeare tombstone.JPG|thumb|Inscribed brass on Anne Shakespeare's tombstone in the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]]]]\nA tradition recorded in 1693 is that Hathaway \"greatly desired\" to be buried with her husband.<ref name = \"garb\">Marjorie Garber, ''Profiling Shakespeare'', Routledge, 2008, pp. 170\u2013175.</ref> In fact she was interred in a separate grave next to him in the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon]].

It has also been suggested that the next words, \"And saved my life\", would have been indistinguishable in pronunciation from \"Anne saved my life\".<ref>[http://www.shakespeares-sonnets.com/145comm.htm ''Shakespeare-ssonnets.com'']. Retrieved 19 April 2007</ref> The sonnet differs from all the others in the length of the lines. Its fairly simple language and syntax have led to suggestions that it was written much earlier than the other, more mature, sonnets.\n\n{{quote\n|\nThose lips that Love's own hand did make <br />\nBreathed forth the sound that said 'I hate' <br />\nTo me that languish'd for her sake; <br />\nBut when she saw my woeful state <br />\nStraight in her heart did mercy come, <br />\nChiding that tongue that ever sweet <br />\nWas used in giving gentle doom, <br />\nAnd taught it thus anew to greet: <br />\n'I hate' she alter'd with an end, <br />\nThat follow'd it as gentle day <br />\nDoth follow night, who like a fiend <br />\nFrom heaven to hell is flown away; <br />\n'I hate' from '''hate away''' she threw, <br />\n'''And saved my life''', saying 'not you.'\n}}\n\n=== Other literature ===\nThe following poem about Anne has also been ascribed to Shakespeare, but its language and style are not typical of his verse.

Retrieved 19 April 2007</ref> Anne also appears in [[Hubert Osborne]]'s ''The Shakespeare Play'' (c. 1911) and its sequel ''The Good Men Do'' (1917), which dramatises a meeting between the newly widowed Anne and her supposed old rival for William's love \"Anne Whateley\". Anne is depicted as shrewish in the first play, and as spiteful towards her former rival in the latter.<ref>[http://www.canadianshakespeares.ca/anthology/good_men_do.pdf ''The Good Men Do''.]</ref> A frosty relationship is also portrayed in [[Edward Bond]]'s play ''[[Bingo (play)|Bingo: Scenes of Money and Death]]'' (1973), about Shakespeare's last days, and in the 1978 TV series ''[[Will Shakespeare (TV series)|Will Shakespeare]]''.\n\n''The World's Wife'', a collection of poems by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], features a sonnet entitled \"[[Anne Hathaway (poem)|Anne Hathaway]]\", based on the passage from Shakespeare's will regarding his \"second-best bed\". Duffy chooses the view that this would be their marriage bed, and so a memento of their love, not a slight. Anne remembers their lovemaking as a form of \"romance and drama\", unlike the \"prose\" written on the best bed used by guests, \"I hold him in the casket of my widow's head/ as he held me upon that next best bed\". In [[Robert Nye]]'s novel ''Mrs Shakespeare: the Complete Works'', which purports to be Anne's autobiographical reminiscences, Shakespeare buys the best bed with money given to him by the Earl of Southampton. When Anne comes to London, the couple use the bed for wild sexual adventures, in which they engage in role-playing fantasies based on his plays. He refers to the bed he bequeaths her as \"the second best\" to remind her of the best bed of their memories. The novel was dramatised for BBC radio in 1998 with [[Maggie Steed]] playing Hathaway.\n\nThe [[Connie Willis]] short story \"Winter's Tale,\" which combines factual information about Anne Hathaway with a fictitious Shakespeare identity theory, also characterises the nature of the relationship as loving and the bequeath of the second-best bed as romantically significant.\n\nAnne Hathaway appears in [[Neil Gaiman]]'s comic book section [[The Sandman: The Wake#\"The Tempest\"|\"The Tempest\"]], part of [[The Sandman (Vertigo)|''The Sandman'']] series. She and Shakespeare share a tumultuous, yet affectionate, relationship.  Gaiman's interpretation suggests that Anne deliberately became pregnant to force her husband to marry her, but the context implies that neither of them ultimately regret their decision.\n\nThrough her long-running solo show ''Mrs Shakespeare, Will's first and last love'' (1989) American actress-writer Yvonne Hudson has had a long relationship with both the historical and dramatic Anne Hathaway. She depicts Anne and Will as maintaining a friendship despite the challenges inherent to their long separations and tragedies. Mining early and recent scholarship and the complete works, Hudson concurs that evidence of the couple's mutual respect is indeed evident in the plays and sonnets, along with support for the writer's infatuations and possibly adulterous relationships. Hudson also chooses the positive view of the bed bequest, sharing that \"it may have been only here that I possessed William.\" ''Mrs Shakespeare'' explores the realities of keeping house without a husband while applying some dramatic licence. This allows Anne to have at least a country wife's understanding of her educated spouse's work as she quotes sonnets and soliloquies to convey her feelings. The 2005 play ''[[Shakespeare's Will (play)|Shakespeare's Will]]'' by Canadian playwright [[Vern Thiessen]] is similar in form to Hudson's show. It is a one-woman piece that focuses on Anne Hathaway on the day of her husband's funeral. Avril Rowland's ''Mrs Shakespeare'' (2005) depicts Anne as a multi-tasking \"[[Superwoman (sociology)|superwoman]]\" who runs the home efficiently while also writing her husband's plays in a businesslike partnership with him as her promoter/performer.<ref name = \"kat\"/>\n\n[[File:Falstaff.jpg|thumb|''Falstaff'': part of the sculpture park in the cottage garden]]\nThe [[romantic comedy]] film ''[[Shakespeare in Love]]'' provides an example of the negative view, depicting the marriage as a cold and loveless bond that Shakespeare must escape to find love in London. The same situation occurs in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s alternate-history novel ''[[Ruled Britannia]]'' (2002), in which Shakespeare seeks and actually wins a divorce from Hathaway to marry his new girlfriend. A similarly loveless relationship is depicted in the film ''[[A Waste of Shame]]'' (2005).\n\n''The Secret Confessions of Anne Shakespeare'' (2010), a novel by [[Arliss Ryan]], also proposes Anne Hathaway as the true author of many of the Shakespeare plays (a claim originally made in 1938<ref>R. C. Churchill, ''Shakespeare and His Betters: A History and a Criticism of the Attempts Which Have Been Made to Prove That Shakespeare's Works Were Written by Others'', Max Reinhardt, London, 1958, p. 54. Churchill refers to an article entitled \"The Plays of Mrs. Shakespeare\" by [[J. P. de Fonseka]] in ''G.K's Weekly'', 3 March 1938.</ref>). In the novel, Anne follows Will to London to support his acting career. As he finds his true calling in writing, Anne's own literary skills flower, leading to a secret collaboration that makes William Shakespeare the foremost playwright in Elizabethan England.\n\nShe is portrayed by [[Liza Tarbuck]] in the [[BBC Two]] comedy series ''[[Upstart Crow]]'', which follows the writing and preparation to stage ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' after William has gained some early career notoriety for his poetry, ''[[Henry VI (play)|Henry VI]]'' and ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''.\n\nAnne Hathaway is portrayed by [[Judi Dench]] in the 2018 historical film ''[[All Is True]]''.\n\nAnne is portrayed by actress [[Cassidy Janson]] in the musical ''[[& Juliet]]''. The show opened in the [[West End theatre|West End]] on November 20, 2019.\n\n== Anne Hathaway's Cottage ==\n{{main|Anne Hathaway's Cottage}}\nAnne Hathaway's childhood was spent in a house near Stratford-upon-Avon in [[Warwickshire]], England. Although it is often called a [[cottage]], it is, in fact, a spacious twelve-roomed farmhouse, with several bedrooms, now set in extensive gardens. It was known as Newlands Farm in Shakespeare's day and had more than {{convert|90|acre|hectare}} of land attached to it. As in many houses of the period, it has multiple chimneys to spread the heat evenly throughout the house during winter. The largest chimney was used for cooking. It also has visible [[timber framing]], a trademark of vernacular [[Tudor style architecture]].\n\nAfter the death of Anne's father, the cottage was owned by Anne's brother Bartholomew, and was passed down the Hathaway family until 1846, when financial problems forced them to sell it. It is now owned and managed by the [[Shakespeare Birthplace Trust]], and is open to public visitors as a museum.<ref name=\"shakespeare1\" />\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commons category|Anne Hathaway (Shakespeare's wife)|Anne Hathaway}}\n* [https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/exhibition/document/shakespeare-marriage-bond Hathaway and Shakespeare's marriage bond]\n* [http://www.britishtours.com/360/anne-hathaways-cottage Virtual Tour of Anne Hathaway's home]\n\n{{Family tree of William Shakespeare}}\n{{Shakespeare}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hathaway, Anne}}\n[[Category:1556 births]]\n[[Category:1623 deaths]]\n[[Category:Shakespeare family]]\n[[Category:People from Stratford-upon-Avon]]\n[[Category:Women of the Tudor period]]\n[[Category:16th-century English people]]\n[[Category:16th-century English women]]\n[[Category:17th-century English women]]\n[[Category:Burials in Warwickshire]]\n", "name_user": "Atkinson 291", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Removed editorializing tone", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_Hathaway_(wife_of_Shakespeare)"}
