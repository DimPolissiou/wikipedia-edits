[[Vassar Clements]] originally wrote the basic [[melody]] an [[octave]] lower, in a tune called \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album on which Charlie Daniels played guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., [[recitation song|recitation]]), and tell the story of a young man named Johnny, in a variant on the classic [[deal with the Devil]]. The performances of [[Satan]] and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], prevented from further chart movement by \"[[After The Love Has Gone]]\" by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]].<ref>Whitburn, Joel: \"The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\", p. 92, {{ISBN|0-8230-7518-4}}</ref> \n\nIt is featured in the 1980 film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', whose choreographer, [[Patsy Swayze]], claims that she set the song's tempo. \"How fast can you dance it?\" Daniels asked. \"How fast can you play it?\" Swayze replied, but considering that the song was recorded in December 1978 and ''Urban Cowboy'' was filmed in 1979, it would have been impossible for Swayze to set the recorded song's tempo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandnote.com/people.php?scode=btimelines&keyword=Epic+Records&sorting=DESC&page=46|title=RolandNote.com: The Ultimate Country Music Database|website=www.rolandnote.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}\nThe song is an uptempo [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song about the [[Devil]]'s failed attempt to gain a young man's [[soul]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} through a [[fiddle]]-playing contest that involves enticing the young man's participation with a worldly prize. The song begins as a disappointed Devil arrives in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], apparently \"way behind\" on stealing [[soul]]s, when he comes upon a fiddle-playing young man named Johnny. At that moment, Johnny happens to be playing his fiddle impressively \"hot.\" Out of desperation, the Devil, who as it turns out also plays the fiddle, offers Johnny the [[Gamble|wager]] which involves challenging the young man to a fiddle-playing contest. The Devil offers to give Johnny a [[gold]]en fiddle if the young man plays better than he does; otherwise, the Devil will gain Johnny's soul. Although Johnny believes taking the Devil's bet might be a [[sin]], he wagers his soul without fear, confidently boasting that he is \"the best that's ever been.\"\n\nThe Devil plays his fiddle first, to a contemporary [[rock music]] theme with the backing of [[demon]] musicians. When the Devil's performance ends, Johnny compliments him and takes his own turn, making reference to four songs. Two are traditional songs of [[Appalachia]] -- \"Fire on the Mountain\" (also the name of Daniels' 1974 album) and \"Granny Does Your Dog Bite?\" (the latter traditionally known as \"Granny Will Your Dog Bite?\"). The third is an unnamed [[square dance]] melody that includes the [[patter]], \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough.\" (The country music standard \"[[Ida Red]]\", as most famously recorded by [[Bob Wills|Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys]], includes the lyric \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough / Granny will your dog bite, no child no.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com/idaredlyricschords.html|title=Ida Red lyrics chords {{!}} Bob Wills|website=www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>) The last is a traditional American southern [[folk song]] \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]].\" The four songs are not performed but are only mentioned by reference. The Devil is impressed, admits defeat, and lays the golden fiddle at Johnny's feet. Johnny repeats his claim to be the best player ever and dares the Devil to a rematch in the future.\n\nJohnny's final boast, as originally recorded for the ''[[Million Mile Reflections]]'' album, goes ''\"I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' To accommodate radio airplay (both Country and Top 40 formats), the 45 RPM single release [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] that portion of the lyric as ''\"'Cause I told you once, '''you son of a gun,''' I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' (The uncensored album version appears on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Urban Cowboy#Soundtrack|Urban Cowboy]]'',<ref name=\"billboard\"/> and it is this version that has been used on numerous music compilations since then.)

The devil is convinced that Johnny's [[Hubris|sinful pride]] will be his undoing, so he takes back the golden fiddle he lost to Johnny, now married and with an infant son, and forces him to practice with his old fiddle before their rematch. \n \nThough the lyrics of the song state that \"Johnny's the best that's ever been\", reiterating his bold claim in the original song, the sequel's lyrics do not reveal who won the rematch.

[[Vassar Clements]] originally wrote the basic [[melody]] an [[octave]] lower, in a tune called \"Lonesome Fiddle Blues\" released on Clements' self-titled 1975 album on which Charlie Daniels played guitar. The Charlie Daniels Band moved it up an octave and put words to it. The song's verses are closer to being spoken rather than sung (i.e., [[recitation song|recitation]]), and tell the story of a young man named Johnny, in a variant on the classic [[deal with the Devil]]. The performances of [[Satan]] and Johnny are played as instrumental bridges. The song was the band's biggest hit, reaching number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], prevented from further chart movement by \"[[After The Love Has Gone]]\" by [[Earth, Wind and Fire]] and \"[[My Sharona]]\" by [[The Knack]].<ref>Whitburn, Joel: \"The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits\", p. 92, {{ISBN|0-8230-7518-4}}</ref> \n\nIt is featured in the 1980 film ''[[Urban Cowboy]]'', whose choreographer, [[Patsy Swayze]], claims that she set the song's tempo. \"How fast can you dance it?\" Daniels asked. \"How fast can you play it?\" Swayze replied, but considering that the song was recorded in December 1978 and ''Urban Cowboy'' was filmed in 1979, it would have been impossible for Swayze to set the recorded song's tempo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandnote.com/people.php?scode=btimelines&keyword=Epic+Records&sorting=DESC&page=46|title=RolandNote.com: The Ultimate Country Music Database|website=www.rolandnote.com|access-date=2017-08-29}}</ref>\n\n==Content==\n{{Original research section|date=July 2016}}\nThe song is an uptempo [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] song about the [[Devil]]'s failed attempt to gain a young man's [[soul]]{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} through a [[fiddle]]-playing contest that involves enticing the young man's participation with a worldly prize. The song begins as a disappointed Devil arrives in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], apparently \"way behind\" on stealing [[soul]]s, when he comes upon a fiddle-playing young man named Johnny. At that moment, Johnny happens to be playing his fiddle impressively \"hot.\" Out of desperation, the Devil, who as it turns out also plays the fiddle, offers Johnny the [[Gamble|wager]] which involves challenging the young man to a fiddle-playing contest. The Devil offers to give Johnny a [[gold]]en fiddle if the young man plays better than he does; otherwise, the Devil will gain Johnny's soul. Although Johnny believes taking the Devil's bet might be a [[sin]], he wagers his soul without fear, confidently boasting that he is \"the best that's ever been.\"\n\nThe Devil plays his fiddle first, to a contemporary [[rock music]] theme with the backing of [[demon]] musicians. When the Devil's performance ends, Johnny compliments him and takes his own turn, making reference to four songs. Two are traditional songs of [[Appalachia]] -- \"Fire on the Mountain\" (also the name of Daniels' 1974 album) and \"Granny Does Your Dog Bite?\" (the latter traditionally known as \"Granny Will Your Dog Bite?\"). The third is an unnamed [[square dance]] melody that includes the [[patter]], \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough.\" (The country music standard \"[[Ida Red]]\", as most famously recorded by [[Bob Wills|Bob Wills & His Texas Playboys]], includes the lyric \"Chicken in the bread pan pickin' out dough / Granny will your dog bite, no child no.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com/idaredlyricschords.html|title=Ida Red lyrics chords {{!}} Bob Wills|website=www.classic-country-song-lyrics.com|access-date=2017-01-20}}</ref>) The last is a traditional American southern [[folk song]] \"[[The House of the Rising Sun]].\" The four songs are not performed but are only mentioned by reference. The Devil is impressed, admits defeat, and lays the golden fiddle at Johnny's feet. Johnny repeats his claim to be the best player ever and dares the Devil to a rematch in the future.\n\nJohnny's final boast, as originally recorded for the ''[[Million Mile Reflections]]'' album, goes ''\"I done told you once, you son of a bitch, I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' To accommodate radio airplay (both Country and Top 40 formats), the 45 RPM single release [[Overdubbing|overdubbed]] that portion of the lyric as ''\"'Cause I told you once, '''you son of a gun,''' I'm the best that's ever been.\"'' (The uncensored album version appears on the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Urban Cowboy#Soundtrack|Urban Cowboy]]'',<ref name=\"billboard\"/> and it is this version that has been used on numerous music compilations since then.) Thus, Johnny maintains his [[virtue]], keeping his soul from the Devil by displaying his musical [[Virtuoso|virtuosity]] in performing traditional songs of [[American South|America's South]].\n\n==Musical references==\nThe [[ballad]]'s story is a derivative of the traditional [[deal with the Devil]] motif.

The song can be found on Mark O'Connor's album, [[Heroes (1993 album)|''Heroes'']].\n\nIn the sequel, the devil, his anger still unabated ten years after his defeat at young Johnny's hands, decides to take up the boy's challenge to \"c'mon back if you ever wanna try again\".  The devil is convinced that Johnny's [[Hubris|sinful pride]] will be his undoing, so he takes back the golden fiddle he lost to Johnny, now married and with an infant son, and forces him to practice with his old fiddle before their rematch. \n \nThough the lyrics of the song state that \"Johnny's the best that's ever been\", reiterating his bold claim in the original song, the sequel's lyrics do not reveal who won the rematch. However, the music video shows that Johnny again prevails.\n\n==See also==\n* \"[[Cross Road Blues]]\"\n* [[Faust]]\n* \"[[The Devil and Daniel Webster]]\"\n* \"[[The Devil and Tom Walker]]\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{MetroLyrics song|charlie-daniels-band|the-devil-went-down-to-georgia}}<!-- Licensed lyrics provider -->\n* {{YouTube|i_XGnxTi-fE|Listen to \"The Devil Went Down to Georgia\"}}\n\n{{Charlie Daniels}}\n{{Faust navbox}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Devil Went Down To Georgia, The}}\n[[Category:1979 singles]]\n[[Category:1979 songs]]\n[[Category:Charlie Daniels songs]]\n[[Category:Billboard Hot Country Songs number-one singles]]\n[[Category:RPM Country Tracks number-one singles]]\n[[Category:Epic Records singles]]\n[[Category:Songs written by Charlie Daniels]]\n[[Category:Song recordings produced by John Boylan (record producer)]]\n[[Category:Songs about Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Songs about the American South]]\n[[Category:Songs about the Devil]]\n[[Category:Music based on the Faust legend]]\n", "name_user": "Bob Ratchit", "label": "safe", "comment": "Inclusion of reference.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Went_Down_to_Georgia"}
