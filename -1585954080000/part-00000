The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.</ref> In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.\n\nSome governments also include military assistance in the notion \"foreign aid\", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.\n\nOfficial development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

It was designed to boost European economies shattered by [[World War II|war]] and prevent the growth of [[communism|communist]] influence.]]\nThe beginning of modern development aid is rooted in the context of Post-[[World War&nbsp;II]] and the [[Cold War]]. Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]].

Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.\"<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].\n\nThe volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called \"[[Third World]]\" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection. Faye and Niehaus discovered that the greater the degree of alignment the recipient party has with the donor entity, the more aid it receives on average during an election year.<ref name=\":1\" /> In an analysis of the 3 biggest donor nations (Japan, France, and the US), Alesina and Dollar (2000) discovered that each has its own distortions to the aid it gives out.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Alesina|first=Alberto|last2=Dollar|first2=David|date=2000|title=Who Gives Foreign Aid to Whom and Why?|jstor=40216022|journal=Journal of Economic Growth|volume=5|issue=1|pages=33\u201363|doi=10.1023/A:1009874203400|url=http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:4553020}}</ref> Japan appears to prioritize giving aid nations that exercise similar voting preferences in the United Nations, France mostly sends aid to its former colonies, and the U.S. disproportionately provides aid to Israel and Egypt.<ref name=\":3\" /> These allocations are often powerful tools for maintaining the strategic interests of the donor country in the recipient country.\n\nThe [[Development Assistance Committee]] was established in 1960 by the [[OECD|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] to coordinate development aid amongst the rich nations. A 1961 resolution decreed that:\n\n{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}\n\n=== Critiques of development aid ===\n[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries. This cartoon, from an organization critical of the true motives of international aid, calls attention to what it perceives as a contradiction.]]Development aid is often provided by means of supporting local development aid projects. In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.\n\n== Extent of aid ==\n{{Development economics sidebar}}\nMost [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&nbsp;billion in 2013.

Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\n[[Albert O. Hirschman]]\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual in a chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's Exit-Voice-Loyalty model [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf] and applies it to political developments inside a nation. When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.\n\n=== Effects of Foreign Aid in Africa. ===\nWhile most economists like [[Jeffery Sachs]] hold the view of aid as the driver for economic growth and development, others argue that aid has rather led to increasing poverty and decreasing economic growth of poor countries.<ref name=\":42\">Moyo, D.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are two organizations that Sachs argues are currently instrumental in advising and directing foreign aid; however, he argues that these two organizations focus too much on \"institutional reforms\"[https://learn-us-east-1-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/5deff46c33361/9189058?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Sachs%2520-%2520The%2520Geography%2520of%2520Poverty%2520and%2520Wealth.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200209T215933Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZH6WM4PLTYPZRQMY%2F20200209%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=3f2df4ddaece1b0f9416e0e81123668913ec06d14b83dc2331b527605305aa58].  Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al.

Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}</ref> essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|issue=6|pages=1630\u20131666}}</ref> have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]].

It suggests Development organisations need to change the way they work to manage better the multiple partnerships that the Accra Agenda for Action recognises is at the core of the aid business. In relation to this specific inquiry, Dr Eyben outlined the following points:<ref>[http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness 'Putting Relationships First for Aid Effectiveness'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604103939/http://www.ids.ac.uk/go/news/putting-relationships-first-for-aid-effectiveness |date=2011-06-04 }} Evidence Submission to the APPG Inquiry on Aid Effectiveness, Institute of Development Studies (IDS)</ref>\n\n* Achieving impact requires investing in relationships, development organisations need to support their staff to do this. At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)\n\nThe views above are of Eyben. There were many other submissions to the All Party Parliamentary Group for Debt, Aid and Trade's inquiry into Aid Effectiveness. The final report gathered a vast amount of information from a wide range of sources to ensure a balanced perspective on the issues of aid effectiveness.

The calculation is Net Private Grants / ODA.</ref> In addition, remittances received from migrants working or living in diaspora form a significant amount of international transfer.\n\nSome governments also include military assistance in the notion \"foreign aid\", although many [[NGO]]s tend to disapprove of this.\n\nOfficial development assistance is a measure of government-contributed aid, compiled by the [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) since 1969. The DAC consists of 34 of the largest aid-donating countries.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nThe concept of development aid goes back to the [[colonial era]] at the turn of the twentieth century, in particular to the British policy of colonial development that emerged during that period. The traditional government policy had tended to favor [[laissez-faire]] style economics, with the free market for capital and goods dictating the economic role that colonies played in the [[British Empire]].\n\n[[Image:British Political Personalities 1936-1945 CH4432.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]], as [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] presided over a Development Committee for the colonies. He is pictured entertaining [[Jamaica]]n recruits for the [[RAF]].]]\nChanges in attitudes towards the moral purpose of the Empire, and the role that government could play in the promotion of welfare slowly led to a more proactive policy of economic and developmental assistance towards poor colonies. The first challenge to Britain was the economic crisis that occurred after World War I. Prior to the passage of the 1929 Colonial Development Act, the doctrine that governed Britain (and other European colonizers) with their territories was that of financial self-sufficiency. What this simply meant was that the colonies were responsible for themselves.<ref>Joseph Hodge, Gerald Hodl, & Martin Kopf (edi) Developing Africa: Concepts and Practices in Twentieth-Century Colonialism, Manchester: Manchester University Press, 2014, p.12.</ref>\n\nBritain was not going to use the money that belongs to the metropole to pay for things in the colonies. The colonies did not only have to pay for infrastructural development but they also were responsible for the salaries of British officials that worked in the colonies. The colonies generated the revenues to pay for these through different forms of taxations. The standard taxation was the import and export taxes. Goods going out of the colonies were taxed and those coming in were also taxed. These generate significant revenues. Apart from these taxes, the colonizers introduced two other forms of taxes: hut tax and labor tax. The hut tax is akin to a property tax today. Every grown up adult male had their own hut. Each of these had to pay a tax. Labor tax was the work that the people had to do without any remunerations or with meager stipends.<ref>Bekeh Utietiang, Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and the Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967 (Ph.D Thesis), West Virginia University, Morgantown, 2014, p. 38.</ref> As the economic crisis widened and had significant impact on the colonies, revenues generated from taxes continued to decline, having a significant impact on the colonies. While this was going on, Britain experienced major unemployment rates. Parliament began to discuss ways in which they could deal with Britain's unemployment rates and at the same time respond to some of the urgent needs of the colonies.<ref>[[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Stephen Constantine]], ''The Making of British Colonial Development Policy, 1914-1940'', London: Frank Cass, 1984, p.183.</ref> This process culminated in the passage of the Colonial Development Act in 1929, which established a Colonial Development Advisory Committee under the authority of the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]], then [[Sidney Webb, 1st Baron Passfield|Lord Passfield]]. Its initial annual budget of \u00a31 million was spent on schemes designed to develop the [[infrastructure]] of [[transport]], [[electrical power]] and [[water supply]] in colonies and [[dominion]]s abroad for the furtherance of imperial trade.<ref name=\"Kanbur\">{{Citation | last1 = Kanbur | first1 = Ravi | author-link1 = Ravi Kanbur | contribution = The economics of international aid | editor-last1 = Kolm | editor-first1 = Serge-Christophe | editor-last2 = Ythier | editor-first2 = Jean Mercier | editor-link1 = Serge-Christophe Kolm | title = Handbook of the economics of giving, altruism and reciprocity: foundations, volume 1 | publisher = Elsevier | location = Amsterdam London | year = 2006 | isbn = 9780444506979  | ref = harv | postscript = .}}</ref> The 1929 Act, though meager in the resources it made available for development, was a significant Act because it opened the door for Britain to make future investments in the colonies. It was a major shift in colonial development. The doctrine of financial self-sufficiency was abandoned and Britain could now use metropolitan funds to develop the colonies.\n\nBy the late 1930s, especially after the [[British West Indian labour unrest of 1934\u20131939]], it was clear that this initial scheme was far too limited in scope. A [[Royal Commission]] under [[Walter Guinness, 1st Baron Moyne|Lord Moyne]] was sent to investigate the living conditions in the [[British West Indies]] and it published its [[Report of West India Royal Commission (Moyne Report)|Report]] in 1940 which exposed the horrendous living conditions there.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fraser|first=Cary|title=The Twilight of Colonial Rule in the British West Indies: Nationalist Assertion vs. Imperial Hubris in the 1930s|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1996|volume=30|issue=1/2|page=2|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?vid=10&hid=107&sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=hia&AN=45526514}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Basdeo|first=Sahadeo|title=Walter Citrine and the British Caribbean Worker's Movement during the Commission Hearing|journal=Journal of Caribbean History|year=1983|volume=18|issue=2|page=46|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/results?sid=2784e56a-6ebf-4f20-9439-1158ddf4d76c%40sessionmgr4&vid=11&hid=28&bquery=(AU+(basdeo))+AND+(citrine)&bdata=JmRiPWFobCZkYj1oaWEmdHlwZT0xJnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d}}{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nAmidst increasing criticism of Britain's colonial policies from abroad and at home,<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|page=229}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Kelvin|title=Race and Class Struggles in a Colonial State|year=1994|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Calgary|page=186 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iWAYAAAAYAAJ|isbn=9781895176438}}</ref> the commission was a performance to showcase Britain's \"benevolent\" attitude towards its colonial subjects.<ref name=Thomas267>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Roy Darrow, ed.|title=The Trinidad Labour Riots of 1937|year=1987|publisher=University of West Indies Press|location=St. Augustine|page=267|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Re3TAAAAMAAJ}}</ref> The Commission's recommendations urged health and education initiatives along with increased sugar subsidies to stave off a complete and total economic meltdown.<ref>{{cite book|last=Parker|page=23}}</ref> The [[Colonial Office]], eager to prevent instability while the country was at [[World War II|war]], began funneling large sums of cash into the region.<ref name=Thomas283>{{cite book|last=Thomas|pages=283}}</ref>\n\nThe Colonial Development and Welfare Act was passed in 1940 to organize and allocate a sum of \u00a35 million per year to the British West Indies for the purpose of long-term development.

Launched as a large-scale aid program by the United States in 1948, the European Recovery Program, or [[Marshall Plan]], was concerned with strengthening the ties to the [[West Europe]]an states to contain the influence of the [[USSR]].

Their poverty is a handicap and a threat both to them and to more prosperous areas. For the first time in history, humanity possesses the knowledge and skill to relieve the suffering of these people.\"<ref>[http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres53.html Transcript of the speech]</ref>\n\nIn 1951, the Technical Cooperation Administration (TCA) was established within the Department of State to run the Point Four program. Development aid was aimed at offering technical solutions to social problems without altering basic [[social structure]]s. The United States was often fiercely opposed to even moderate changes in social structures, for example the [[land reform]] in [[Guatemala]] in the early 1950s.\n\nIn 1953 at the end of the [[Korean War]], the incoming [[Eisenhower Administration]] established the Foreign Operations Administration (FOA) as an independent government agency outside the Department of State to consolidate economic and technical assistance. In 1955, foreign aid was brought back under the administrative control of the Department of State and FOA was renamed the International Cooperation Administration (ICA).\n\nIn 1956, the Senate conducted a study of foreign aid with the help of a number of independent experts.  The result, stated in a 1959 amendment to the Mutual Security Act, declared that development in low-income regions was a U.S. objective along with and additional to other foreign-policy interests, attempting thus to clarify development assistance's relationship with the effort to contain Communism. In 1961, the Congress approved the [[Foreign Assistance Act]] of 1961 with President [[J.F. Kennedy]]'s support, which retained the 1959 policy of international development as an independent U.S. objective and set up a new Agency for International Development, [[USAID]].\n\nThe volume of international aid to [[Developing country|developing countries]] (called \"[[Third World]]\" at the time) grew dramatically from the 1960s. This aid came mainly from the US and [[Western Europe]]an countries, but there were also significant contributions from the [[Soviet Union]] in exchange for overseas political influence in the context of the heightened global tensions of the [[Cold War]].\n\nThe practice of extending aid to politically aligned parties in recipient nations continues today; Faye and Niehaus (2012) are able to establish a causal relationship between politics and aid in recipient nations.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Faye|first=Michael|last2=Niehaus|first2=Paul|date=2012-12-01|title=Political Aid Cycles|journal=American Economic Review|language=en|volume=102|issue=7|pages=3516\u20133530|doi=10.1257/aer.102.7.3516|issn=0002-8282|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/120bb48b574483be2faedcae4e7830ad810e13d5}}</ref> In their analysis of the competitive 2006 Palestinian elections, they note that USAID provided funding for development programs in Palestine to support the Palestinian Authority, the US backed entity running for reelection.

A 1961 resolution decreed that:\n\n{{Quotation|The Committee will continue to consult on the methods for making national resources available for assisting countries and areas in the process of economic development and for expanding and improving the flow of long-term funds and other development assistance to them.|Development Assistance Committee|Mandate (1961)}}\n\n=== Critiques of development aid ===\n[[File:Cartoon, Warren Buffett wants African children to have more Coke - and healthier teeth.gif|thumb|Warren Buffett is considered one of the world's leading philanthropists, yet he is also the biggest investor in Coca-Cola, which aggressively seeks to expand into poorer countries.

In these projects, it sometimes occurs that no strict code of conduct is in force. In some projects, the development aid workers do not respect the local [[code of conduct]]. For example, the local [[dress code]] as well as [[Human communication|social interaction]]. In developing countries, these matters are regarded highly important and not respecting it may cause severe offense, and thus significant problems and delay of the projects.\n\nThere is also much debate about evaluating the quality of development aid, rather than simply the quantity.  For instance, [[tied aid]] is often criticized as the aid given must be spent in the donor country or in a group of selected countries. Tied aid can increase development aid project costs by up to 20 or 30 percent.<ref name=\":18\">[http://www.oecd.org/LongAbstract/0,3425,en_2649_33959_29412506_119699_1_1_1,00.html OECD The Typing of Aid]</ref>\n\nThere is also criticism because donors may give with one hand, through large amounts of development aid, yet take away with the other, through strict trade or migration policies, or by getting a foothold for foreign corporations.  The [[Commitment to Development Index]] measures the overall policies of donors and evaluates the quality of their development aid, instead of just comparing the quantity of [[official development assistance]] given.\n\n== Extent of Aid ==\n{{Development economics sidebar}}\nMost [[official development assistance]] (ODA) comes from the 28 members of the [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC), or about $135&nbsp;billion in 2013.

Clark et al.\u2019s formalization of the model to politics shows the effect that developmental aid can have on the receiving country's development and highlights that the aid can potentially harm that country.\n\n[[Albert O. Hirschman]]\u2019s EVL model is based on the foundation that \u201cunder any economic, social, or political system, individuals, business firms, and organizations, in general, are subject to lapses from efficient, rational, law-abiding, virtuous, or otherwise functional behavior\u201d [[Exit, Voice, and Loyalty]]. The customer who is affected by the lapse in the system (a fall in the quality of a product they are consuming) has two ways to answer to this- \u201cexit\u201d or \u201cvoice\u201d. If the individual in a chooses the former, they simply stop buying the product and inflict a revenue drop that forces the firm to either correct their mistake or cease to exist. If the individual chooses the \u201cvoice\u201d option, then they will express their dissatisfaction to either the firm or something that has authority over it. This will force the firm to fix their lapse, but it will not suffer a decline in revenue. Lastly, Hirschman introduces the \u201cloyalty\u201d option, which occurs when the consumer cannot \u201cexit\u201d and the firm does not care about the effect that \u201cvoice\u201d will have on their revenue, and the consumers who chose it continues to consume the lapsed good.\n\nClark et al.\u2019s paper takes Hirschman's Exit-Voice-Loyalty model [https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/pegroup/files/clark_golder.pdf] and applies it to political developments inside a nation. When a government changes a policy that now has a negative effect on the welfare of some citizens, or is already being unresponsive to a deleterious situation, the citizens have the same 3 choices of response as before. Here, \u201cexit\u201d can take the form of citizens leaving the country [[The Art of Not Being Governed]] and hence depriving the state of their taxes or simply rearranging their capital and goods so they are not taxed by the government, as seen with British merchants threatening to move capital to the Netherlands if not given representation after the [[Glorious Revolution]]. \u201cVoice\u201d takes the form of non-violent civil disobedience, as seen with Gandhi's [[Salt March]] and the [[Black Lives Matter]] protests in Ferguson, a violent demonstration, as seen with [[Luddite]] breaking weaving machinery to protest the lack of protectionist policies by the English government, or even \u201ceveryday resistance\u201d [http://abahlali.org/files/Scotts-Weapons.pdf] where small, non-cooperation and false create high costs for the state. \u201cLoyalty\u201d entails that the citizens simply accept the situation and continue their lives before.\n\nHow foreign aid enters this equation in weak states is by changing the citizens\u2019 power of \u201cvoice\u201d and \u201cexit\u201d and weakening the state's dependence on their citizens and hence becoming less responsive to their needs. If the state receives international aid, it is less dependent on the tax revenue that it collects from its constituents. A higher level of fiscal independence on the part of the state decreases the bargaining power of the citizens. The government is threatened less by the citizens\u2019 \u201cexit\u201d option, and less hurt if it is implemented, hence this takes away a credible threat to use at the negotiation table in order for the citizens to request improvement to their current condition. At the same time, the lack of dependence for revenue decreases the \u201cvoice\u201d action of the citizen by weakening the effect a violent demonstration or everyday resistance has on impacting the state's decision-making.\n\nAs long as the government of a nation receiving international aid knows that it will keep receiving it, and there will be no repercussion on the side of the donors for failing to address its constituents\u2019 issues, it stays optimal for that government to keep ignoring the weakened demands of its citizens. With weakened bargaining power and a less responsive state, there can be no bargaining between citizen and state that will, in the long, run lead to economic and/or development within the nation. Although international has done far-reaching things with respect to increasing access to improved medical care, improving education, and decreasing poverty and hunger,  only in 1997 did the [[World Bank]] began to rethink its aid policy structure and begin using parts of it specifically for building up the state capability of the aid-receiving nations [https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5980]. Even more recently, the [[Millennium Challenge Corporation]], a US-based aid agency, started working with developing nation to provide them with strictly development aid as they set and implement goals for national development.\n\n=== Effects of Foreign Aid in Africa. ===\nWhile most economists like [[Jeffery Sachs]] hold the view of aid as the driver for economic growth and development, others argue that aid has rather led to increasing poverty and decreasing economic growth of poor countries.<ref name=\":42\">Moyo, D.

The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are two organizations that Sachs argues are currently instrumental in advising and directing foreign aid; however, he argues that these two organizations focus too much on \"institutional reforms\"[https://learn-us-east-1-prod-fleet01-xythos.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/5deff46c33361/9189058?response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27Sachs%2520-%2520The%2520Geography%2520of%2520Poverty%2520and%2520Wealth.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200209T215933Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=AKIAZH6WM4PLTYPZRQMY%2F20200209%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=3f2df4ddaece1b0f9416e0e81123668913ec06d14b83dc2331b527605305aa58].  Foreign aid is especially multifaceted in countries within Sub-Saharan Africa due to geographic barriers. Most macro foreign aid efforts fail to recognize these issues and, as Sachs argues, cause insufficient international aid and policy improvement. Sachs argues that unless foreign aid provides mechanisms that overcome geographic barriers, pandemics such as HIV and AIDS that cause traumatic casualties within regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa will continue to care millions of fatalities. \n\nFor aid to be effective and beneficial to economic development, there must be some support systems or \u2018[[wiktionary:traction|traction]]\u2019 that, will enable foreign aid to spur economic growth.<ref name=\":52\">Rahnama, M. & Fawaz, F. & Gittings, K.

Dissident economists such as [[Peter Thomas Bauer|Peter Bauer]] and [[Milton Friedman]] argued in the 1960s that aid is ineffective:<ref>{{Cite web| title = The sad loss of Lord Bauer| url =http://www.la-articles.org.uk/bauer.htm| accessdate = }}</ref>\n\n{{Quote | ... an excellent method for transferring money from poor people in rich countries to rich people in poor countries. | Peter Bauer}}\n\nIn economics, there are two competing positions on aid. A view pro aid, supported by Jeffrey Sachs and the United Nations, which argues that foreign aid will give the big push to break the low-income [[poverty trap]] poorer countries are trapped in. From this perspective, aid serves to finance  \u201cthe core inputs to development \u2013 teachers, health centers, roads, wells, medicine, to name a few...\u201d (United Nations 2004).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|title=Making Progress on Foreign Aid|journal = Annual Review of Economics|volume = 7|pages = 277\u2013308|last=Qian|first=Nancy|date=2015-08-03|language=en|doi=10.1146/annurev-economics-080614-115553}}</ref> And a view that is skeptic about the impacts of aid, supported by William Easterly, that points out that aid has not proven to work after 40 years of large investments in Africa.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAmerican political scientist and professor [[Nicolas van de Walle]] has also argued that despite more than two decades of donor-supported reform in Africa, the continent continues to be plagued by economic crises due to the combination of state generated factors and to the counter productivity of international development aid to Africa. Van de Walle first attributes the failure to implement economic policy reform to factors within the African state:\n\n# Neopatrimonial tendencies of state elites that serve to preserve and centralize power, maintain limited access orders, and create political obstacles to reform.\n# Ideological obstacles that have been biased by two decades of failed economic policy reform and in turn, create a hostile environment for reform.\n# Low state capacity that reinforces and that in turn, is reinforced by the neopatrimonial tendencies of the state.\n\nVan de Walle later argues that these state generated factors that have obstructed the effective implementation of economic policy reform are further exacerbated by foreign aid. Aid, therefore, makes policy reform less likely, rather than more likely. Van de Walle posits that international aid has sustained economic stagnation in Africa by:\n\n# Pacifying Africa's neopatrimonial tendencies, thereby lessening the incentives for state elites to undertake reform and preserving the status quo.\n# Sustaining poorly managed bureaucratic structures and policies that would be otherwise rectified by market forces.\n# Allowing state capacities to deteriorate through externalizing many state functions and responsibilities.\n\nIn order for aid to be productive and for economic policy reform to be successfully implemented in Africa, the relationship between donors and governments must change. Van de Walle argues that aid must be made more conditional and selective to incentivize states to take on reform and to generate the much needed accountability and capacity in African governments.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Democratic Reform in Africa: The Quality of Progress|last=Van de Walle|first=Nicolas|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.|year=2004|isbn=1588262464|editor-last=Gyimah-Boadi|editor-first=Emmanuel|location=1800 30th Street, Boulder, Colorado 80301|pages=29\u201363|chapter=Economic Reform: Patterns and Constraints}}</ref>\n\nAdditionally, information asymmetries often hinder the appropriate allocation of aid; Blum et al. (2016) note that both South Sudan and Liberia struggle tremendously with paying employees and controlling the flow of money - South Sudan had a significant number of ghosts on its payroll, while Liberia's Civil Service Agency could not adequately pay civil servants because there was minimal communication from the Ministries of Health and Education regarding their respective payrolls.<ref>Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. \u201cPublic Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.\u201d World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.\n</ref>\n\nMany [[econometric]] studies in recent years have supported the view that development aid has no effect on the speed with which countries develop. Negative side effects of aid can include an unbalanced [[Currency appreciation and depreciation|appreciation]] of the recipient's currency (known as [[Dutch Disease]]), increasing corruption, and adverse political effects such as postponements of necessary economic and democratic reforms.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\">[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx Aid Effectiveness and Governance: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009071531/http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2009/0317_aid_governance_kaufmann.aspx |date=2009-10-09 }}</ref>\n\nIt has been argued{{By whom|date=September 2010}} that much government-to-government aid was ineffective because it was merely a way to support strategically important leaders (Alesino and Dollar, 2000). A good example of this is the former dictator of [[Zaire]], [[Mobuto Sese Seko]], who lost support from the West after the Cold War had ended. Mobuto, at the time of his death, had a sufficient personal fortune (particularly in Swiss banks) to pay off the entire external debt of Zaire.<ref name=\"brookings.edu\" />\n\nBesides some instances that only the president (and/or his close entourage) receives the money resulting from development aid, the money obtained is often badly spent as well. For example, in Chad, the [http://www.esso.com/Chad-English/PA/Files/suppvol1ch1.pdf Chad Export Project], an oil production project supported by the World Bank, was set up. The earnings of this project (6.5 million dollars per year and rising) were used to obtain arms. The government defended this purchase by stating that \"development was not possible without safety\". However, the [[Military of Chad]] is notorious for severe misconduct against the population (abuse, rape, claiming of supplies and cars) and did not even defend the population in distress (e.g. in the [[War in Darfur|Darfur conflict]]). In 2008, the World Bank retreated from the project that thus increased environmental pollution and human suffering.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\">Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen</ref>\n\nAnother criticism has been that Western countries often project their own needs and solutions onto other societies and cultures. In response, western help in some cases has become more 'endogenous', which means that needs as well as solutions are being devised in accordance with local cultures.<ref>[http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html The Future of The Anti-Corruption Movement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409153824/http://commons.globalintegrity.org/2008/12/future-of-anti-corruption-movement.html |date=2009-04-09 }}, Nathaniel Heller, Global Integrity</ref> For example, sometimes projects are set up which wish to make several [[ethnic group]]s cooperate. While this is a noble goal, most of these projects fail because of this intent.<ref name=\"Tsjaad by Dorrit van Dalen\" />Additionally, although the goal in utility to provide a larger social benefit may be justified as worthy, a more ethically sourced incentive would be projects not looking for an opportunity to impose a social hierarchy through cooperation, but more-so for the sake of truly assisting recipients. The intent of cooperation is not necessarily a reason for failure, but the very nature of different aspirations towards defining virtues which exist in direct context with respective societies. In this way a disconnect may be perceived among those imposing their virtues onto ethnic groups interpreting them.\n\nThe [https://www.cgdev.org/ Center for Global Development] have published a review<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moss, Petterson and van de Walle|date=January 2006|title=An Aid-Institutions Paradox? A Review Essay on Aid Dependency and State Building in Sub-Saharan Africa|url=http://www.cgdev.org|journal=Center for Global Development|volume=Working Paper Number 74|pages=}}</ref> essay of the existing literature studying the relationship between Aid and public institutions. In this review,  they concluded that a large and sustained Aid can have a negative effect in the development of good public institutions in low income countries. They also mention some of the arguments exhibited in this article as possible mechanism for this negative effect, for instance, they considered the [[Dutch Disease]], the discourage of revenue collections and the effect on the state capacity among others.\n\nFurthermore, the effect of Aid on conflict intensity and onset have been proved to have different impacts in different countries and situations. For instance, for the case of Colombia Dube and Naidu (2015)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dube and Naidu|date=January 6, 2015|title=Bases, Bullets, and Ballots: The Effect of US Military Aid on Political Conflict in Colombia|journal=The Journal of Politics|volume= 77| issue = 1|pages=249\u2013267|doi=10.1086/679021|url=http://www.cgdev.org/content/publications/detail/1423498}}</ref> showed that Aid from the US seems to have been diverted to paramilitary groups, increasing political violence. Moreover, Nunn and Qian (2014)<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Nunn and Qian|date=June 2014|title=US Food Aid and Civil Conflict|jstor=42920861|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1630-1666|issue=6|pages=1630\u20131666}}</ref> have found that an increase in U.S. food aid increases conflict intensity; they claim that the main mechanism driving this result is predation of the aid by the rebel groups. In fact, they note that aid can have the unintentional consequence of actually improving rebel groups' ability to continue conflict, as vehicles and communications equipment usually accompany the aid that is stolen.<ref name=\":2\" /> These tools improve the ability of rebel groups to organize and give them assets to trade for arms, possibly increasing the length of the fighting. Finally, Crost, Felter and Johnston (2014)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Crost, Felter and Johnston|date=June 2014|title=Aid Under Fire: Development Projects and Civil Conflict|journal=American Economic Review|volume=1833\u20131856|issue=6|pages=1833\u20131856|doi=10.1257/aer.104.6.1833}}</ref> have showed that a development program in the Philippines have had the unintended effect of increasing conflict because of an strategic retaliation from the rebel group, on where they tried to prevent that the development program increases support to the government.\n\nIt has also been argued that help based on direct donation creates dependency and corruption, and has an adverse effect on local production. As a result, a shift has taken place towards aid based on activation of local assets and stimulation measures such as [[microcredit]].\n\nAid has also been ineffective in young recipient countries in which ethnic tensions are strong: sometimes ethnic conflicts have prevented efficient delivery of aid.\n\nIn some cases, western surpluses that resulted from faulty agriculture- or other policies have been dumped in poor countries, thus wiping out local production and increasing dependency.\n\nIn several instances, loans that were considered irretrievable (for instance because funds had been embezzled by a dictator who has already died or disappeared), have been written off by donor countries, who subsequently booked this as development aid.\n\nIn many cases, Western governments placed orders with Western companies as a form of subsidizing them, and later shipped these goods to poor countries who often had no use for them. These projects are sometimes called '[[white elephant]]s'.\n\nAccording to [[James Ferguson (anthropologist)|James Ferguson]], these issues might be caused by deficient diagnostics of the development agencies. In his book [[The Anti-Politics Machine]], Ferguson uses the example of the [[Thaba-Tseka District|Thaba-Tseka]] project in [[Lesotho]] to illustrate how a bad diagnostic on the economic activity of the population and the desire to stay away from local politics, caused a livestock project to fail.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=James|date=1994|title=The anti-politics machine: 'development' and bureaucratic power in Lesotho|url=http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|journal=The Ecologist|volume=24|issue=5|pages=|access-date=2017-04-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170129094236/http://www.colorado.edu/geography/class_homepages/geog_3682_f08/Articles/Ferguson%20-%20The%20Anti%20Politics%20Machine.pdf|archive-date=2017-01-29|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Martijn Nitzsche, another problem is the way on how development projects are sometimes constructed and how they are maintained by the local population. Often, projects are made with technology that is hard to understand and too difficult to repair, resulting in unavoidable failure over time. Also, in some cases the local population is not very interested in seeing the project to succeed and may revert to disassembling it to retain valuable source materials. Finally, villagers do not always maintain a project as they believe the original development workers or others in the surroundings will repair it when it fails (which is not always so).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\">[http://www.momentum-media.nl/files/_articles/31/Gestrand_Ontwikkelingswerk.pdf Kijk magazine; oktober 2008, Gestrand Ontwikkelingswerk]</ref>\n\nA common criticism in recent years is that rich countries have put so many conditions on aid that it has reduced aid effectiveness. In the example of [[tied aid]], donor countries often require the recipient to purchase goods and services from the donor, even if these are cheaper elsewhere. Other conditions include opening up the country to foreign investment, even if it might not be ready to do so.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalissues.org/TradeRelated/Debt/USAid.asp|title=US and Foreign Aid Assistance|publisher=Global Issues|year=2007|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Development Aid in Congo Wasted.jpeg|thumb|250px|In [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], an abandoned ferry as a relic of a development project is rusting next to the boats people use today.]]\nAll of these problems have made that a very large part of the spend money on development aid is simply wasted uselessly. According to Gerbert van der Aa, for the Netherlands, only 33% of the development aid is successful, another 33% fails and of the remaining 33% the effect is unclear. This means that for example for the Netherlands, 1.33 to 2.66 billion is lost as it spends 4 billion in total of development aid (or 0,8% of the gross national product).<ref name=\"momentum-media.nl\" />\n\nFor the Italian development aid for instance, we find that one of their successful projects (the Keita project) was constructed at the cost of 2/3 of 1 F-22 fighter jet (100 million $), and was able to reforest {{convert|1876|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of broken, barren earth, hereby increasing the socio-economic wellbeing of the area.<ref>[http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf Keita project increasing socio-economic wellbeing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311112921/http://www.case.ibimet.cnr.it/keita/data/docs/Viterbo_06.pdf |date=2012-03-11 }}</ref> However -like the Dutch development aid- again we find that, the Italian development aid too is still not performing up to standards.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |title=Italian aid not up to standard overall |access-date=2009-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216102713/http://www.eurodad.org/whatsnew/reports.aspx?id=1514 |archive-date=2008-02-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This makes clear that there are great differences between the success of the projects and that budgetary follow-up may not be so strictly checked by independent third parties.\n\nAn excerpt from [[Thomas Dichter]]'s recently published book ''[[Despite Good Intentions]]: Why Development Assistance to the Third World Has Failed'' reads: \"This industry has become one in which the benefits of what is spent are increasingly in inverse proportion to the amount spent - a case of more gets you less. As donors are attracted on the basis of appeals emphasizing \"product\", results, and accountability...the tendency to engage in project-based, direct-action development becomes inevitable. Because funding for development is increasingly finite, this situation is very much a zero-sum game. What gets lost in the shuffle is the far more challenging long-term process of development.\"\n\nEffectiveness of development aid can be argued to be uncoordinated and unsustainable.  Development aid tends to be put towards specific diseases with high death rates and simple treatments, rather than funding health basics and infrastructure.  Though a lot of NGO's and funding have come forth, little sustainable outcomes have been made.  This is due to the fact that the money doesn't go towards developing a sustainable medical basis.  Money is given to specific diseases to show short-term results, reflecting the donor's best interests rather than the citizens' necessities.  It is evident that many development aid projects are not helping with basic and sustainable health care due to the generally high numbers of deaths due to preventable diseases.  Development aid could do more justice if used to generate general public health with infrastructure and trained personnel rather than pin-pointing specific diseases and reaching for quick fixes.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Garrett|first=Laurie|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal=Foreign Affairs|year=2007|volume=86|issue=1|pages=14\u201338}}</ref>\n\nResearch has shown that developed nations are more likely to give aid to nations who have the worst economic situations and policies (Burnside, C., Dollar, D., 2000). They give money to these nations so that they can become developed and begin to turn these policies around. It has also been found that aid relates to the population of a nation as well, and that the smaller a nation is, the more likely it is to receive funds from donor agencies. The harsh reality of this is that it is very unlikely that a developing nation with a lack of resources, policies, and good governance will be able to utilize incoming aid money in order to get on their feet and begin to turn the damaged economy around. It is more likely that a nation with good economic policies and good governance will be able to utilize aid money to help the country establish itself with an existing foundation and be able to rise from there with the help of the international community. But research shows that it is the low-income nations that will receive aid more so, and the better off a nation is, the less aid money it will be granted. On the other hand, Alesina and Dollar (2000) note that private foreign investment often responds positively to more substantive economic policy and better protections under the law.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is increased private foreign investment in developing nations with these attributes, especially in the higher income ones, perhaps due to being larger and possibly more profitable markets.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== MIT based study ===\n[[File:DBP 1981 1103 Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.jpg|thumb|250px|Development aid, German stamp (1981).]]\n\nThe [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]'s Abhijit Banerjee and Ruimin He have undertaken a rigorous study of the relatively few independent evaluations of aid program successes and failures.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410233354/http://www.econ.nyu.edu/cvstarr/conferences/ForeignAid/papers/Banerjee.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-10|title=Making aid work|year=2003|accessdate=2008-02-21}}</ref> They suggest the following interventions are usually highly effective forms of aid in normal circumstances:\n\n* subsidies given directly to families to be spent on children's education and health\n* education vouchers for school uniforms and textbooks\n* teaching selected illiterate adults to read and write\n* deworming drugs and vitamin/nutritional supplements\n* vaccination and [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] prevention programs\n* indoor sprays against [[malaria]], anti-[[mosquito]] bed netting\n* suitable fertilizers\n* clean [[water supply|water supplies]]\n\n=== UK Parliamentary study ===\n\nAn inquiry into aid effectiveness by the UK All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Debt, Aid and Trade featured evidence from Rosalind Eyben, a Fellow at the [[Institute of Development Studies]].

At the moment, the opposite is happening.\n* In multiple sets of relationships there will be different ideas about what is success and how to achieve it and this should be reflected in methodologies for defining and assessing the impact of aid.\n* Helpful procedural harmonisation should not mean assuming there is only a single diagnosis and solution to any complex problem.\n* In addition to measuring results, donors need to assess the quality of relations at project/programme, country and international levels against indicators agreed with partners.\n* Decisions on aid need to be made on a case by case basis on the advice of well-informed country offices.\n* Accountable states depend on empowered citizens\n* Development organisations also need to be more accountable to UK citizens through encouraging conversations as to the real challenges and limitations of aid. (Point made in relation to UK as evidence for UK parliamentary inquiry)\n\nThe views above are of Eyben.

In the 1995 Human Development Report the [[United Nations Development Programme|United Nations Development Program]] introduced the [[Gender Development Index]] and [[Gender Empowerment Measure]].<ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&paper_id=66&file_type=slides|title=Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries?

The Gender Development Index uses the Human Development Index and corrects its results in life expectancy, income, and education for gender imbalances.<ref name=\":10\" /> Due to criticisms of these two indexes the United Nations Development Program in its 2010 Human Development Report introduced the [[Gender Inequality Index]]. The Gender Inequality Index uses more metrics and attempts to show the losses from gender inequality.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\nEven with these indexes, Ranjula Swain of the [[Stockholm School of Economics]] and Supriya Garikipati of the [[University of Liverpool]] found that, compared to the effectiveness of health, economic, and education targeted aid, foreign aid for gender equality remains understudied.<ref name=\":10\" /> Swain and Garikipati found in an analysis of Gender Equality Aid that on a country and region-wide level gender equality aid was not significant in its effect. Swain and Garikipati blame this on the relative lack of aid with gender equality as a primary motivation.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://editorialexpress.com/cgi-bin/conference/download.cgi?db_name=IAFFE2016&paper_id=66&file_type=slides|title=Does Foreign Aid Improve Gender Performance of Recipient Countries?

''Sociological Forum''. '''29''' (3): 578.</ref> By breaking down gender equality programs into two categories, gender mainstreamed programs and gender-focused programs which do not mainstream gender, Jones and Swiss found that female leaders of governmental aid organizations provided more financial support to gender mainstreamed programs and slightly more support to gender aware programs overall.<ref>Jones, Robert; Swiss, Liam (September 2014). \"Gendered Leadership: The Effects of Female Development Agency Leaders on Foreign Aid Spending\".

Scott soon became tired with the revenue of the websites being split when he was operating the websites by himself, and made the decision to break away from TESSource in 2007 and founded his own website under the name of TESNexus.

This appearance features many notable pilots, including Biggs Darklighter (\"Red Three\"), Jek Porkins (\"Red Six\"), [[Wedge Antilles]] (\"Red Two\"), and [[Luke Skywalker]] (\"Red Five\"). The squadron went on to appear in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' at the Battle of Hoth and in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' during the attack on the second Death Star. However, the squadron was never a prominent feature of these films, and was rarely referred to as \"Rogue Squadron\" (rather, the \"Red Squadron\" designation is used).\n\nIn the films' plot, Red Squadron is essential to the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, where they engaged in a [[dogfight]] against [[Darth Vader]]. They use [[X-wing]] for the assault. Jek Porkins, Biggs Darklighter, and most of the Squadron dies. Wedge leaves too damaged to continue. Luke would have died, had not being saved by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] piloting the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and giving Luke time to deliver the shot that destroyed the Death Star. Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles are the only members of Red Squadron to survive the assault.\n\nThe Rogue Squadron on the ice planet [[Hoth]], during ''The Empire Strikes Back'', has the burden of defending [[Echo Base]] with new pilots added to their roster, like Derek Klivian and Tycho Celchu. During the Battle of Hoth. The twelve [[snowspeeder]]s of the Rogues gave the Rebels enough time to evacuate Echo Base and were destroyed later in the battle. Luke and Wedge survive.\nAfter the evacuation of Hoth, Antilles took command during the absence of Skywalker while he trained with [[Yoda]] at [[Dagobah]]. After the events of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Skywalker and Antilles formed a squadron of twelve units around the core group and the Rogue Squadron was formed. Antilles often commanded the squadron when Luke had important off-flight missions.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Endor]] on ''Return of the Jedi'', Rogue Squadron was dissolved and absorbed into the general fleet and Antilles took the role of Red Leader, in memory of the Battle of Yavin. Luke is busy helping on the ground as a Jedi, and Wedge destroys the [[second Death Star]] with the aid of [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[Nien Numb]], who pilot the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nThe anthology film ''[[Rogue One]]'', set shortly before ''A New Hope'', features many of the pilots who fought on the Death Star fighting on the battle of Scarif, where [[Jyn Erso]] leads a group of Rebels called Rogue One, in an on-foot mission to steal the plans of the original Death Star. Unable to leave the planet, team Rogue One beams the plans to [[Leia]]'s ship. Minutes later, all Rogue One members are killed by the Death Star. Since the release of the prequel, the Rogue Squadron has been hinted and later revealed to have named itself in the memory of the Rogue One team.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Joe |first1=Joe |title=Is Rogue Group/Rogue Squadron named after Rogue One (in-universe)?

After his destruction of the Death Star, he founded Rogue Squadron with Wedge's help using the Rebels' best X-wing pilots as shown in the video game ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron|Rogue Squadron]]'' and proceeded to have a long and distinguished flying career with the group. By the time of ''Return of the Jedi'', Luke was focusing on his training as a Jedi Knight and had thus handed command of Rogue Squadron to Wedge.\n\nThe last mission of ''Rogue Squadron'' takes place six years after the Battle of Endor, during ''[[Dark Empire]]''.\n\n===Wedge Antilles===\n{{main|Wedge Antilles}}\n\nAlthough Luke Skywalker was the first commander of Rogue Squadron, Antilles is often considered the \"face\" of the squadron due to his tenure as its leader. He appears in the films ''A New Hope'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return of the Jedi'', in which he commands the squadron. When seeing the Death Star for the first time in ''A New Hope'', Wedge utters the line \"Look at the size of that thing!\"\n\nWedge has a unique situation casting-wise. Colin Higgins portrays him during the Rebel briefing for the Battle of Yavin, where he expresses his doubt that even a computer could shoot a proton torpedo down the Death Star's thermal exhaust port; however, in every other scene, [[Denis Lawson]] portrays Wedge. Wedge appears in season 3 of ''[[Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he is voiced by [[Nathan Kress]].\n\n===Biggs Darklighter===\n[[Image:Biggsdarklighter.jpg|thumb|[[Garrick Hagon]] as Biggs Darklighter in ''Star Wars: A New Hope'']]\nBiggs Darklighter briefly appeared in ''A New Hope'' played by [[Garrick Hagon]]. Biggs was in the Battle of Yavin scene, where he joined his childhood friend Luke Skywalker and Luke's other wingman, Wedge, in their attack run on the first Death Star.\n\nBiggs had a larger role in earlier drafts of the script for the movie and several of the additional scenes appeared in the novelization. His additional scenes include a conversation with Luke on [[Tatooine]] where Biggs tells Luke of his secret desire to join the Rebel Alliance despite his training at the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial Academy]]. This scene was deleted from ''A New Hope'', but the book ''Inside the Worlds of the Star Wars Trilogy'' depicts the missing scene at Tosche Station, and it can be seen in its entirety on the encyclopedic ''Star Wars: Behind the Magic'' CD-ROM and on the Blu-ray release of ''A New Hope''. Biggs also shows up on Yavin 4 in the Rebel base hangar where he is reunited with his childhood best friend Luke and helped convince Red Squadron to allow Luke to join the squadron about to depart towards the Battle of Yavin. Biggs assures Red Squadron leader Garvin Dreis that Luke can handle the X-wing, calling him the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim. This [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#Biggs Darklighter on Yavin 4|scene was reintroduced]] in the [[1997 in film|1997]] re-release of the film. However, a line in which Dreis referred to Luke's father Anakin and said that \"if he had his skill he would do fine\" remained on the cutting room floor. While flanking Luke's X-wing on its decisive attack run, Biggs was shot down and killed by Darth Vader.\n\nBiggs has a larger role in the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline. In the [[Star Wars (radio)#Star Wars|radio version]], [[Kale Browne]] provided the voice of Biggs. According to a [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] four-issue comic series in ''Star Wars: Empire'' spotlighting Biggs entitled ''Darklighter'', Biggs was a longtime friend of Luke's on Tatooine. Biggs left Tatooine to be trained as an Imperial pilot, and during this training, he heard rumors of the Death Star from fellow trainees. After several months training, he was assigned as first mate on the Imperial starship ''Rand Ecliptic'', with an old enemy named [[Derek Klivian]] (nicknamed ''Hobbie'') as second mate. He came back to visit Tatooine to tell his friends and family of his new assignment but only tells Luke and his family of his hope to join the Rebel Alliance. During the events of ''A New Hope'', Biggs is planning a mutiny of the ''Rand Ecliptic'', not realizing that several mutinies are being planned by several different groups. He joins forces with Hobbie, one of the leaders, and the two go [[AWOL]] to Yavin 4. Biggs becomes a part of the Alliance's missions to steal their first R2 units and X-wings, which they receive just days before the Battle of Yavin. Before going to battle, Biggs saves Hobbie's life by finding medicine for a strange disease Hobbie caught on Yavin 4, which the Rebellion did not have a cure for. The [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]] later named a military base on Coruscant in Biggs's honor.\n\n===Jek \"Piggy\" Porkins===\nJek Tono Porkins is a famously overweight Red Squadron pilot whose death is depicted in ''A New Hope'' (played by [[William Hootkins]]) when his X-wing is destroyed after being hit by a piece of a broken laser battery crashing into the star fighter's frame.\n\nPorkins gained prominence in the ''Legends'' non-canonical literature, most notably Stackpole's ''X-wing'' series. He has also been occasionally parodied in popular media, most notably in the ''[[Family Guy Star Wars]]'' spoof ''[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]'', in which he is depicted as being too fat to fit in his fighter and crashes.\n\n===Wes Janson===\nA minor character in the original films, Janson only appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in the role of Wedge Antilles' gunner at the Battle of Hoth. He manages to take out the first [[AT-AT]], emphasized by a terse \"Cable detached!\" (preceded by \"Cable out, let her go!\", and Wedge's \"Detach cable!\"), his only speaking role in the films.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical literature, Janson was stranded with Wedge in the 1983 [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel ''Star Wars'' comic]] \"Hoth Stuff!\" some time after the Battle of Hoth. He was then killed by scavengers, and Wedge used one of their ships to escape the planet.\n\nJanson is featured as a major character in Michael A. Stackpole's X-Wing comic book series as alternately Wedge and Hobbie's wingman and an integral member of the squadron. Aaron Allston included the character in his installments in the ''X-wing'' novel series which followed from the comics, although Janson in those novels is prominent as a member of [[Wraith Squadron]], not Rogue Squadron. Janson also fought against the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] during the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series of novels, and kept an eye on Han Solo after the death of Chewbacca. He was known as a skilled pilot and an expert shot, and personality-wise is known to be a joker.  In his early days as part of the Rebel Alliance was mainly a gunner in the two seated version of the [[Y-wing]] because of his shooting ability. His first combat kill was New Republic pilot Kell Tainer's father during a botched mission where Doran was about to stray into an Imperial [[radar]] scan. Despite repeated attempts to get him to change course, Janson was forced to shoot him down to save the rest of the squadron. In the Wraith Squadron Series he was the first to implement the saying \"Yub Yub Commander.\" as a joke to Wedge after fooling him during the pilot interviews. The rest of the squadron soon followed and Wedge was hounded by it for many years to come.\n\n===Tycho Celchu===\nCelchu never appears by name in the original film series, although he is attributed as the [[A-wing]] pilot that acts as a decoy for Lando Calrissian during the attack run on the second Death Star.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline Celchu, however, plays a major role in Stackpole's ''X-wing'' series, and also appears in numerous other novels, all of which give him a rich character background. Celchu was an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[TIE fighter]] pilot that defected to the [[Rebel Alliance]] after his homeworld, [[Alderaan]] (also the homeworld of Princess Leia), was destroyed by the first Death Star, killing all of his immediate family and his fianc\u00e9e. Celchu's Imperial past drives much of the plot of Stackpole's ''X-wing'' novels, as he is continually suspected of being an undercover Imperial [[Mole (espionage)|agent]]. After the battle of Coruscant, Celchu was put on trial for treason and the murder of Corran Horn, but the prosecution dropped the case when Horn returned from the ''Lusankya''. Celchu also holds the noteworthy distinction of being one of very few Rebel pilots to have flown in the Hoth, Endor and Bakura campaigns. This is a very rare accomplishment, and one that is matched by longtime wingman and friend Wedge Antillies.\n\n===Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian===\nKlivian flies as Luke Skywalker's wingman during the Battle of Hoth. Originally doomed to die when his snowspeeder crashes into General Veers' walker, his life was spared after that scene from the fourth draft was cut.<ref>[http://www.guerrestellari.net/athenaeum/saga_menuevoluzione_menuscript_esb_4.html Star Wars Athenaeum - Saga - Evoluzione creativa - Empire fourth draft<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/hobbie/?id=bts Star Wars: Databank | Klivian, Derek \"Hobbie\" (Rogue Four)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"blueharvest\">{{cite web |title=BlueHarvest.net - The Empire Strikes Back script |year=2000 |publisher=BlueHarvest.net |url=http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/esb-script.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116133136/http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/esb-script.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}</ref> <!-- BlueHarvest.net shut down in April 2014 --> His first film appearance, however, was in Leia's briefing before the battle, when he questions the plan by rhetorically asking, \"Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?\". Hobbie appears in season 3 of ''Rebels'', where he is voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].\n\nIn the non-canonical ''Legends'' literature and the ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (series)|Rogue Squadron]]'' video game series, it is said Hobbie is not only the most reckless pilot, he's also the luckiest, having crashed more fighters than all of Rogue Squadron and coming away from each of them unscathed. He's generally the most dour of all the pilots, having a bleak outlook on life. Despite this, Hobbie has a close camaraderie and friendship with Wes Janson, and often becomes involved in Janson's elaborate pranks and jokes at the expense of other pilots (especially Wedge). Hobbie's sense of humor is extremely dry and sardonic, making for a good counterpoint to Janson's flamboyant and often silly wit.\n\n===Dak Ralter===\nDak Ralter is depicted in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' as Luke Skywalker's gunner. He was killed in battle by a flak explosion from an AT-AT's heavy guns during the Battle of Hoth.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, he is featured on the video game ''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'', with Luke Skywalker saying that Dak \"reminded him of a younger version of himself.\" He was the son of political prisoners.\n\n===Zev Senesca===\nZev Senesca appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and is the pilot who locates Han Solo and Luke Skywalker after they get lost on Hoth at the beginning of the film. In ''Rogue Squadron'', he had been fighting longer than any other Rogues and had quite a few stories to tell. Like Dak, he joined the rebellion for personal and political reasons. He is killed when his speeder is shot down by Imperial walkers during the Battle of Hoth.\n\n==''Legends''==\nWith the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared [[Star Wars canon|non-canon to the franchise]] in April 2014.<ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, the [[Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron (comics)|''X-wing'' comic series]], written by [[Michael A. Stackpole]] and published by Dark Horse Comics, were the first works of ''Star Wars'' literature to focus on the adventures and exploits of the squadron. The comic series picked up with the reformation of the squadron after the Battle of Endor. Stackpole went on to novelize the squadron's tale in his [[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|''X-wing'' book series]], which initially spanned four volumes. Stackpole is credited as the creator of the character Corran Horn, who later starred in his own first-person novel, ''[[I, Jedi]]'', also written by Stackpole. Horn later became a popular character in the Expanded Universe, playing a major part in several ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' novels. By the time of the events of ''The New Jedi Order'', Horn was a [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] and no longer a member of the squadron, but the Rogues are still a vital fighting force and command a presence in several of the ''New Jedi Order'' novels as well. The squadron is also the focus of the ''Rogue Squadron'' video game series.\n\nAfter ''A New Hope'', the squadron is operated as two groups. The first was the Renegade Flight under Commander Narra, the squadron leader, and the second was the Rogue Flight under [[Luke Skywalker]]. As the Rogues became more autonomous, they became a group with no standing orders, ready any time or place for urgent missions that would arise. Their core was Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, Zev Senesca, and Wes Janson. The Renegade Flight is eventually destroyed before ''The Empire Strikes Back'' on an escort mission with a convoy carrying supplies for the Rebel Base. The Rogues on Hoth had now the burden to defend Echo Base alone although new pilots were already added to their roster, like Derek Klivian and Tycho Celchu. During the Battle of Hoth, the Rogues had to add many \"guest\" members into their squadron.  The twelve snowspeeders of the Rogues gave the Rebels enough time to evacuate Echo Base and were destroyed later in the battle. Before ''Return of the Jedi'', one of Luke's last missions was the [[Battle of Gall]] against the Empire, in an attempt to capture the bounty hunters who had abducted Han Solo. After ''Return of the Jedi'', the squadron was hastily and temporarily reformed by Antilles with the best rebel pilots in order to defend the planet Bakura. Rogue Squadron was now a lean team of six units: Antilles, Janson, Klivian, Celchu, Plourr Ilo and Dllr Nep.  One of the important missions during the New Republic's creation was the failed rescue mission of Sate Pestage, which bolstered the fame of New Republic.\n\nSince Janson and Klivian moved on to train new pilots and squadrons, Antilles had to reinvent Rogue Squadron, now with pilots from a wide variety of planets, clearly for political reasons. This \"new\" Rogue Squadron destroyed some of the Imperial forces led by [[Ysanne Isard]] and contributed heavily to the retaking of [[Coruscant]].  After resigning from the Alliance military, the squadron fought in the Bacta War to retake the world of [[Thyferra]] from Isard. During that time, Klivian led a temporary Rogue Squadron in the absence of the \"true\" Rogue Squadron.  Upon their return from Thyferra, Antilles turned command over to Tycho Celchu and founded [[Wraith Squadron]].  Antilles commanded both squadrons against [[Warlord Zsinj]] and after that he returned to his command as Rogue Leader to battle against [[Grand Admiral Thrawn|Thrawn]], Krennel, [[Palpatine]]'s clones and lead the team to other battles.\n\nThe squadron played a role in the Battle for Mon Calamari during Admiral Daala's campaign against the New Republic.  Around this time, former squadron leader Luke Skywalker was teaching his first class of Jedi Knights, including Rogue Squadron member Corran Horn. The squadron was led by Tycho Celchu after the campaign against Krennel, and was then led by Gavin Darklighter during the Yuuzhan Vong War.  Later on during a brewing civil war within the Republic, the squadron would temporarily be led by [[Jaina Solo]].\n\n===Notable pilots===\nThe following characters are featured within the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, but have not appeared on the canon. They are featured along the pilots featured on the canon.\n\n====Gavin Darklighter====\nGavin Darklighter, Biggs' cousin,<ref>[http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/biggsdarklighter/ Star Wars: Databank | Darklighter, Biggs (Red Three)]</ref> joined Rogue Squadron at 16 years old and quickly proved to be a more than capable pilot. He became fast friends with Corran Horn, who helped him out of a situation where he was the \"worst\" pilot in the squadron. Darklighter was wounded during the Imperial invasion of Talasea in the Morobe system.  During the [[Battle of Coruscant]], Gavin became emotionally involved with Asyr Sei'Lar, a [[Bothan]] who would later join Rogue Squadron.  Gavin was promoted to the rank of captain after the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn, and was promoted to Colonel and given command of Rogue Squadron at an unspecified date before the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Gavin would continue to move up the ranks during the Second Galactic Civil War and beyond, at one point leading the Galactic Alliance Marines.\n\n====Corran Horn====\nCorran Horn was invented by writer [[Michael Stackpole]] for the [[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|''X-wing'' series]]. However, Horn eventually became a major character in the Expanded Universe, starring in the novel ''[[I, Jedi]]'', as well as several ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' novels (in which he is a Jedi Knight, not a Rogue Squadron pilot). Horn hails from Corellia, and originally worked as a security officer for CorSec before fleeing from the pursuit of [[Kirtan Loor]], an Imperial intelligence officer. Horn became an accomplished pilot, and remained with the Rogues for some time after discovering his Force-sensitive heritage.  He later trained to become a Jedi Knight after his wife was kidnapped in ''I, Jedi''.  During the events of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Horn was promoted to Jedi Master and eventually went on to serve on the Jedi Council as one of the most powerful and prominent Jedi of his time.\nHe is also notable for carrying one of only a few \"dual-phase\" lightsabers known to exist. The weapon was crafted by Horn during the time line of the I, Jedi novel based on designs given to him by Rostek Horn. These were possibly the same plans that his great-grandfather, Keiran Halcyon, had created for his own dual-phase lightsaber.\n\n====Kasan Moor====\nKasan Moor appears in ''Rogue Squadron'', originally as a formidable opponent of the squadron. She is a decorated Imperial TIE Interceptor pilot and leader of the famous 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron, but despite her record, like Tycho, her faith in the Imperial cause has been severely shaken after the Death Star's destruction of her homeworld of Alderaan.

The unit is depicted as consisting of \"the best pilots and the best fighters\".<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sansweet | first=Stephen J. | encyclopedia=The Star Wars Encyclopedia | title=Rogue Squadron | year=1998 | publisher=Del Rey | location=New York | isbn=0-345-40227-8 | pages=[https://archive.org/details/starwarsencyclop00sans/page/252 252] | url-access=registration | url=https://archive.org/details/starwarsencyclop00sans/page/252 }}</ref>\n\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==Depiction in film==\nRed Squadron, the forerunner of Rogue Squadron, is first featured as a [[Rebel Alliance]] division in ''[[Star Wars (film)|A New Hope]]'' (1977) during the attack on the first [[Death Star]]. This appearance features many notable pilots, including Biggs Darklighter (\"Red Three\"), Jek Porkins (\"Red Six\"), [[Wedge Antilles]] (\"Red Two\"), and [[Luke Skywalker]] (\"Red Five\"). The squadron went on to appear in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' at the Battle of Hoth and in ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'' during the attack on the second Death Star. However, the squadron was never a prominent feature of these films, and was rarely referred to as \"Rogue Squadron\" (rather, the \"Red Squadron\" designation is used).\n\nIn the films' plot, Red Squadron is essential to the destruction of the Death Star at the Battle of Yavin, where they engaged in a [[dogfight]] against [[Darth Vader]]. They use [[X-wing]] for the assault. Jek Porkins, Biggs Darklighter, and most of the Squadron dies. Wedge leaves too damaged to continue. Luke would have died, had not being saved by [[Han Solo]] and [[Chewbacca]] piloting the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]'', and giving Luke time to deliver the shot that destroyed the Death Star. Luke Skywalker and Wedge Antilles are the only members of Red Squadron to survive the assault.\n\nThe Rogue Squadron on the ice planet [[Hoth]], during ''The Empire Strikes Back'', has the burden of defending [[Echo Base]] with new pilots added to their roster, like Derek Klivian and Tycho Celchu. During the Battle of Hoth. The twelve [[snowspeeder]]s of the Rogues gave the Rebels enough time to evacuate Echo Base and were destroyed later in the battle. Luke and Wedge survive.\nAfter the evacuation of Hoth, Antilles took command during the absence of Skywalker while he trained with [[Yoda]] at [[Dagobah]]. After the events of ''The Empire Strikes Back'', Skywalker and Antilles formed a squadron of twelve units around the core group and the Rogue Squadron was formed. Antilles often commanded the squadron when Luke had important off-flight missions.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Endor]] on ''Return of the Jedi'', Rogue Squadron was dissolved and absorbed into the general fleet and Antilles took the role of Red Leader, in memory of the Battle of Yavin. Luke is busy helping on the ground as a Jedi, and Wedge destroys the [[second Death Star]] with the aid of [[Lando Calrissian]] and [[Nien Numb]], who pilot the ''Millennium Falcon''.\n\nThe anthology film ''[[Rogue One]]'', set shortly before ''A New Hope'', features many of the pilots who fought on the Death Star fighting on the battle of Scarif, where [[Jyn Erso]] leads a group of Rebels called Rogue One, in an on-foot mission to steal the plans of the original Death Star. Unable to leave the planet, team Rogue One beams the plans to [[Leia]]'s ship. Minutes later, all Rogue One members are killed by the Death Star. Since the release of the prequel, the Rogue Squadron has been hinted and later revealed to have named itself in the memory of the Rogue One team.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Joe |first1=Joe |title=Is Rogue Group/Rogue Squadron named after Rogue One (in-universe)?

After his destruction of the Death Star, he founded Rogue Squadron with Wedge's help using the Rebels' best X-wing pilots as shown in the video game ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron|Rogue Squadron]]'' and proceeded to have a long and distinguished flying career with the group. By the time of ''Return of the Jedi'', Luke was focusing on his training as a Jedi Knight and had thus handed command of Rogue Squadron to Wedge.\n\nThe last mission of ''Rogue Squadron'' takes place six years after the Battle of Endor, during ''[[Dark Empire]]''.\n\n===Wedge Antilles===\n{{main|Wedge Antilles}}\n\nAlthough Luke Skywalker was the first commander of Rogue Squadron, Antilles is often considered the \"face\" of the squadron due to his tenure as its leader. He appears in the films ''A New Hope'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return of the Jedi'', in which he commands the squadron. When seeing the Death Star for the first time in ''A New Hope'', Wedge utters the line \"Look at the size of that thing!\"\n\nWedge has a unique situation casting-wise. Colin Higgins portrays him during the Rebel briefing for the Battle of Yavin, where he expresses his doubt that even a computer could shoot a proton torpedo down the Death Star's thermal exhaust port; however, in every other scene, [[Denis Lawson]] portrays Wedge. Wedge appears in season 3 of ''[[Star Wars: Rebels]]'', where he is voiced by [[Nathan Kress]].\n\n===Biggs Darklighter===\n[[Image:Biggsdarklighter.jpg|thumb|[[Garrick Hagon]] as Biggs Darklighter in ''Star Wars: A New Hope'']]\nBiggs Darklighter briefly appeared in ''A New Hope'' played by [[Garrick Hagon]]. Biggs was in the Battle of Yavin scene, where he joined his childhood friend Luke Skywalker and Luke's other wingman, Wedge, in their attack run on the first Death Star.\n\nBiggs had a larger role in earlier drafts of the script for the movie and several of the additional scenes appeared in the novelization. His additional scenes include a conversation with Luke on [[Tatooine]] where Biggs tells Luke of his secret desire to join the Rebel Alliance despite his training at the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial Academy]]. This scene was deleted from ''A New Hope'', but the book ''Inside the Worlds of the Star Wars Trilogy'' depicts the missing scene at Tosche Station, and it can be seen in its entirety on the encyclopedic ''Star Wars: Behind the Magic'' CD-ROM and on the Blu-ray release of ''A New Hope''. Biggs also shows up on Yavin 4 in the Rebel base hangar where he is reunited with his childhood best friend Luke and helped convince Red Squadron to allow Luke to join the squadron about to depart towards the Battle of Yavin. Biggs assures Red Squadron leader Garvin Dreis that Luke can handle the X-wing, calling him the best bush pilot in the Outer Rim. This [[Changes in Star Wars re-releases#Biggs Darklighter on Yavin 4|scene was reintroduced]] in the [[1997 in film|1997]] re-release of the film. However, a line in which Dreis referred to Luke's father Anakin and said that \"if he had his skill he would do fine\" remained on the cutting room floor. While flanking Luke's X-wing on its decisive attack run, Biggs was shot down and killed by Darth Vader.\n\nBiggs has a larger role in the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline. In the [[Star Wars (radio)#Star Wars|radio version]], [[Kale Browne]] provided the voice of Biggs. According to a [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] four-issue comic series in ''Star Wars: Empire'' spotlighting Biggs entitled ''Darklighter'', Biggs was a longtime friend of Luke's on Tatooine. Biggs left Tatooine to be trained as an Imperial pilot, and during this training, he heard rumors of the Death Star from fellow trainees. After several months training, he was assigned as first mate on the Imperial starship ''Rand Ecliptic'', with an old enemy named [[Derek Klivian]] (nicknamed ''Hobbie'') as second mate. He came back to visit Tatooine to tell his friends and family of his new assignment but only tells Luke and his family of his hope to join the Rebel Alliance. During the events of ''A New Hope'', Biggs is planning a mutiny of the ''Rand Ecliptic'', not realizing that several mutinies are being planned by several different groups. He joins forces with Hobbie, one of the leaders, and the two go [[AWOL]] to Yavin 4. Biggs becomes a part of the Alliance's missions to steal their first R2 units and X-wings, which they receive just days before the Battle of Yavin. Before going to battle, Biggs saves Hobbie's life by finding medicine for a strange disease Hobbie caught on Yavin 4, which the Rebellion did not have a cure for. The [[New Republic (Star Wars)#Legends|New Republic]] later named a military base on Coruscant in Biggs's honor.\n\n===Jek \"Piggy\" Porkins===\nJek Tono Porkins is a famously overweight Red Squadron pilot whose death is depicted in ''A New Hope'' (played by [[William Hootkins]]) when his X-wing is destroyed after being hit by a piece of a broken laser battery crashing into the star fighter's frame.\n\nPorkins gained prominence in the ''Legends'' non-canonical literature, most notably Stackpole's ''X-wing'' series. He has also been occasionally parodied in popular media, most notably in the ''[[Family Guy Star Wars]]'' spoof ''[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]'', in which he is depicted as being too fat to fit in his fighter and crashes.\n\n===Wes Janson===\nA minor character in the original films, Janson only appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' in the role of Wedge Antilles' gunner at the Battle of Hoth. He manages to kill the first [[AT-AT]], emphasized by a terse \"Cable detached!\" (preceded by \"Cable out, let her go!\", and Wedge's \"Detach cable!\"), his only speaking role in the films.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical literature, Janson was stranded with Wedge in the 1983 [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|Marvel ''Star Wars'' comic]] \"Hoth Stuff!\" some time after the Battle of Hoth. He was then killed by scavengers, and Wedge used one of their ships to escape the planet.\n\nJanson is featured as a major character in Michael A. Stackpole's X-Wing comic book series as alternately Wedge and Hobbie's wingman and an integral member of the squadron. Aaron Allston included the character in his installments in the ''X-wing'' novel series which followed from the comics, although Janson in those novels is prominent as a member of [[Wraith Squadron]], not Rogue Squadron. Janson also fought against the [[Yuuzhan Vong]] during the ''[[New Jedi Order]]'' series of novels, and kept an eye on Han Solo after the death of Chewbacca. He was known as a skilled pilot and an expert shot, and personality-wise is known to be a joker.  In his early days as part of the Rebel Alliance was mainly a gunner in the two seated version of the [[Y-wing]] because of his shooting ability. His first combat kill was New Republic pilot Kell Tainer's father during a botched mission where Doran was about to stray into an Imperial [[radar]] scan. Despite repeated attempts to get him to change course, Janson was forced to shoot him down to save the rest of the squadron. In the Wraith Squadron Series he was the first to implement the saying \"Yub Yub Commander.\" as a joke to Wedge after fooling him during the pilot interviews. The rest of the squadron soon followed and Wedge was hounded by it for many years to come.\n\n===Tycho Celchu===\nCelchu never appears by name in the original film series, although he is attributed as the [[A-wing]] pilot that acts as a decoy for Lando Calrissian during the attack run on the second Death Star.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline Celchu, however, plays a major role in Stackpole's ''X-wing'' series, and also appears in numerous other novels, all of which give him a rich character background. Celchu was an [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Imperial]] [[TIE fighter]] pilot that defected to the [[Rebel Alliance]] after his homeworld, [[Alderaan]] (also the homeworld of Princess Leia), was destroyed by the first Death Star, killing all of his immediate family and his fianc\u00e9e. Celchu's Imperial past drives much of the plot of Stackpole's ''X-wing'' novels, as he is continually suspected of being an undercover Imperial [[Mole (espionage)|agent]]. After the battle of Coruscant, Celchu was put on trial for treason and the murder of Corran Horn, but the prosecution dropped the case when Horn returned from the ''Lusankya''. Celchu also holds the noteworthy distinction of being one of very few Rebel pilots to have flown in the Hoth, Endor and Bakura campaigns. This is a very rare accomplishment, and one that is matched by longtime wingman and friend Wedge Antillies.\n\n===Derek \"Hobbie\" Klivian===\nKlivian flies as Luke Skywalker's wingman during the Battle of Hoth. Originally doomed to die when his snowspeeder crashes into General Veers' walker, his life was spared after that scene from the fourth draft was cut.<ref>[http://www.guerrestellari.net/athenaeum/saga_menuevoluzione_menuscript_esb_4.html Star Wars Athenaeum - Saga - Evoluzione creativa - Empire fourth draft<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/hobbie/?id=bts Star Wars: Databank | Klivian, Derek \"Hobbie\" (Rogue Four)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"blueharvest\">{{cite web |title=BlueHarvest.net - The Empire Strikes Back script |year=2000 |publisher=BlueHarvest.net |url=http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/esb-script.shtml |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116133136/http://www.blueharvest.net/scoops/esb-script.shtml |archivedate=2014-01-16 |accessdate=2014-01-16}}</ref> <!-- BlueHarvest.net shut down in April 2014 --> His first film appearance, however, was in Leia's briefing before the battle, when he questions the plan by rhetorically asking, \"Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?\". Hobbie appears in season 3 of ''Rebels'', where he is voiced by [[Trevor Devall]].\n\nIn the non-canonical ''Legends'' literature and the ''[[Star Wars: Rogue Squadron (series)|Rogue Squadron]]'' video game series, it is said Hobbie is not only the most reckless pilot, he's also the luckiest, having crashed more fighters than all of Rogue Squadron and coming away from each of them unscathed. He's generally the most dour of all the pilots, having a bleak outlook on life. Despite this, Hobbie has a close camaraderie and friendship with Wes Janson, and often becomes involved in Janson's elaborate pranks and jokes at the expense of other pilots (especially Wedge). Hobbie's sense of humor is extremely dry and sardonic, making for a good counterpoint to Janson's flamboyant and often silly wit.\n\n===Dak Ralter===\nDak Ralter is depicted in ''The Empire Strikes Back'' as Luke Skywalker's gunner. He was killed in battle by a flak explosion from an AT-AT's heavy guns during the Battle of Hoth.\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, he is featured on the video game ''Star Wars: Rogue Squadron'', with Luke Skywalker saying that Dak \"reminded him of a younger version of himself.\" He was the son of political prisoners.\n\n===Zev Senesca===\nZev Senesca appears in ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and is the pilot who locates Han Solo and Luke Skywalker after they get lost on Hoth at the beginning of the film. In ''Rogue Squadron'', he had been fighting longer than any other Rogues and had quite a few stories to tell. Like Dak, he joined the rebellion for personal and political reasons. He is killed when his speeder is shot down by Imperial walkers during the Battle of Hoth.\n\n==''Legends''==\nWith the 2012 acquisition of [[Lucasfilm]] by [[The Walt Disney Company]], most of the licensed ''Star Wars'' novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film were rebranded as ''Star Wars Legends'' and declared [[Star Wars canon|non-canon to the franchise]] in April 2014.<ref name=\"SW Adult\">{{cite web|url=https://www.starwars.com/news/disney-publishing-worldwide-and-random-house-announce-relaunch-of-star-wars-adult-fiction-line |title=Disney and Random House announce relaunch of ''Star Wars'' Adult Fiction line |publisher=StarWars.com |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"THR Legends\">{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lucasfilm-unveils-new-plans-star-698973 |last=McMilian |first=Graeme |title=Lucasfilm Unveils New Plans for ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"SW Legends\">{{cite web|url=http://www.starwars.com/news/the-legendary-star-wars-expanded-universe-turns-a-new-page |title=The Legendary ''Star Wars'' Expanded Universe Turns a New Page |publisher=[[StarWars.com]] |date=April 25, 2014 |accessdate=May 26, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, the [[Star Wars: X-wing Rogue Squadron (comics)|''X-wing'' comic series]], written by [[Michael A. Stackpole]] and published by Dark Horse Comics, were the first works of ''Star Wars'' literature to focus on the adventures and exploits of the squadron. The comic series picked up with the reformation of the squadron after the Battle of Endor. Stackpole went on to novelize the squadron's tale in his [[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|''X-wing'' book series]], which initially spanned four volumes. Stackpole is credited as the creator of the character Corran Horn, who later starred in his own first-person novel, ''[[I, Jedi]]'', also written by Stackpole. Horn later became a popular character in the Expanded Universe, playing a major part in several ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' novels. By the time of the events of ''The New Jedi Order'', Horn was a [[Jedi|Jedi Knight]] and no longer a member of the squadron, but the Rogues are still a vital fighting force and command a presence in several of the ''New Jedi Order'' novels as well. The squadron is also the focus of the ''Rogue Squadron'' video game series.\n\nAfter ''A New Hope'', the squadron is operated as two groups. The first was the Renegade Flight under Commander Narra, the squadron leader, and the second was the Rogue Flight under [[Luke Skywalker]]. As the Rogues became more autonomous, they became a group with no standing orders, ready any time or place for urgent missions that would arise. Their core was Luke Skywalker, Wedge Antilles, Zev Senesca, and Wes Janson. The Renegade Flight is eventually destroyed before ''The Empire Strikes Back'' on an escort mission with a convoy carrying supplies for the Rebel Base. The Rogues on Hoth had now the burden to defend Echo Base alone although new pilots were already added to their roster, like Derek Klivian and Tycho Celchu. During the Battle of Hoth, the Rogues had to add many \"guest\" members into their squadron.  The twelve snowspeeders of the Rogues gave the Rebels enough time to evacuate Echo Base and were destroyed later in the battle. Before ''Return of the Jedi'', one of Luke's last missions was the [[Battle of Gall]] against the Empire, in an attempt to capture the bounty hunters who had abducted Han Solo. After ''Return of the Jedi'', the squadron was hastily and temporarily reformed by Antilles with the best rebel pilots in order to defend the planet Bakura. Rogue Squadron was now a lean team of six units: Antilles, Janson, Klivian, Celchu, Plourr Ilo and Dllr Nep.  One of the important missions during the New Republic's creation was the failed rescue mission of Sate Pestage, which bolstered the fame of New Republic.\n\nSince Janson and Klivian moved on to train new pilots and squadrons, Antilles had to reinvent Rogue Squadron, now with pilots from a wide variety of planets, clearly for political reasons. This \"new\" Rogue Squadron destroyed some of the Imperial forces led by [[Ysanne Isard]] and contributed heavily to the retaking of [[Coruscant]].  After resigning from the Alliance military, the squadron fought in the Bacta War to retake the world of [[Thyferra]] from Isard. During that time, Klivian led a temporary Rogue Squadron in the absence of the \"true\" Rogue Squadron.  Upon their return from Thyferra, Antilles turned command over to Tycho Celchu and founded [[Wraith Squadron]].  Antilles commanded both squadrons against [[Warlord Zsinj]] and after that he returned to his command as Rogue Leader to battle against [[Grand Admiral Thrawn|Thrawn]], Krennel, [[Palpatine]]'s clones and lead the team to other battles.\n\nThe squadron played a role in the Battle for Mon Calamari during Admiral Daala's campaign against the New Republic.  Around this time, former squadron leader Luke Skywalker was teaching his first class of Jedi Knights, including Rogue Squadron member Corran Horn. The squadron was led by Tycho Celchu after the campaign against Krennel, and was then led by Gavin Darklighter during the Yuuzhan Vong War.  Later on during a brewing civil war within the Republic, the squadron would temporarily be led by [[Jaina Solo]].\n\n===Notable pilots===\nThe following characters are featured within the ''Legends'' non-canonical storyline, but have not appeared on the canon. They are featured along the pilots featured on the canon.\n\n====Gavin Darklighter====\nGavin Darklighter, Biggs' cousin,<ref>[http://www.starwars.com/databank/character/biggsdarklighter/ Star Wars: Databank | Darklighter, Biggs (Red Three)]</ref> joined Rogue Squadron at 16 years old and quickly proved to be a more than capable pilot. He became fast friends with Corran Horn, who helped him out of a situation where he was the \"worst\" pilot in the squadron. Darklighter was wounded during the Imperial invasion of Talasea in the Morobe system.  During the [[Battle of Coruscant]], Gavin became emotionally involved with Asyr Sei'Lar, a [[Bothan]] who would later join Rogue Squadron.  Gavin was promoted to the rank of captain after the death of Grand Admiral Thrawn, and was promoted to Colonel and given command of Rogue Squadron at an unspecified date before the Yuuzhan Vong invasion. Gavin would continue to move up the ranks during the Second Galactic Civil War and beyond, at one point leading the Galactic Alliance Marines.\n\n====Corran Horn====\nCorran Horn was invented by writer [[Michael Stackpole]] for the [[Star Wars: X-wing (book series)|''X-wing'' series]]. However, Horn eventually became a major character in the Expanded Universe, starring in the novel ''[[I, Jedi]]'', as well as several ''[[The New Jedi Order|New Jedi Order]]'' novels (in which he is a Jedi Knight, not a Rogue Squadron pilot). Horn hails from Corellia, and originally worked as a security officer for CorSec before fleeing from the pursuit of [[Kirtan Loor]], an Imperial intelligence officer. Horn became an accomplished pilot, and remained with the Rogues for some time after discovering his Force-sensitive heritage.  He later trained to become a Jedi Knight after his wife was kidnapped in ''I, Jedi''.  During the events of the Yuuzhan Vong War, Horn was promoted to Jedi Master and eventually went on to serve on the Jedi Council as one of the most powerful and prominent Jedi of his time.\nHe is also notable for carrying one of only a few \"dual-phase\" lightsabers known to exist. The weapon was crafted by Horn during the time line of the I, Jedi novel based on designs given to him by Rostek Horn. These were possibly the same plans that his great-grandfather, Keiran Halcyon, had created for his own dual-phase lightsaber.\n\n====Kasan Moor====\nKasan Moor appears in ''Rogue Squadron'', originally as a formidable opponent of the squadron. She is a decorated Imperial TIE Interceptor pilot and leader of the famous 128th TIE Interceptor Squadron, but despite her record, like Tycho, her faith in the Imperial cause has been severely shaken after the Death Star's destruction of her homeworld of Alderaan.

Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase. After [[Kashta]] (\"the Kushite\") invaded Egypt in the 8th century BC, the [[List of monarchs of Kush|monarchs of Kush]] were also the [[pharaoh]]s of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]], until they were defeated by the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] under the rule of [[Ashurbanipal]] a century later and finally expelled from Egypt by [[Psamtik I]].\n\nDuring [[classical antiquity]], the Kushite imperial capital was located at [[Mero\u00eb]]. In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]]. Afterwards the [[Nubians]] established the three, eventually [[Christianity|Christianized]], kingdoms of [[Nobatia]], [[Makuria]] and [[Alodia]].\n\n== name ==\n{{infobox hieroglyphs\n|title=''Kush''\n|name = <hiero>k-G1-S:N25</hiero>.\n|name transcription = k3\u0161\n|name explanation = ''Ku'sh''\n}}\nThe native name of the Kingdom was recorded in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as ''{{lang|egy|k3\u0161}}'', likely pronounced {{IPA-all|ku\u026bu\u0283|}} or {{IPA-all|ku\u0294u\u0283|}} in [[Middle Egyptian language|Middle Egyptian]], when the term was first used for Nubia, based on the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]-era [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] transliteration as the genitive ''k\u016bsi''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldenberg|first=David M.|chapter=|title=The Curse of Ham: Race and Slavery in Early Judaism, Christianity, and Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iTyJ3HiNOAsC&pg=PA144#v=onepage&q=burnt%20swarthy%20black&f=false |year=2005|edition=New|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691123707|page=17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|url = |title = Esarhaddon and Egypt: An Analysis of the First Invasion of Egypt|last = Spalinger|first = Anthony|date = 1974|journal = Orientalia, NOVA SERIES, Vol. 43 Pp. 295-326, XI|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ancient Egyptian Language: An Historical Study|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Gd6aAAAAQBAJ&dq=ancient+egyptian+allen|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2013-07-11|access-date = 2015-04-15|isbn = 9781107032460|first = James P.|last = Allen|page = 53}}</ref>\n\nIt is also an ethnic term for the native population who initiated the kingdom of Kush.

The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]].

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars.

It is not well understood due to the scarcity of [[bilingual]] texts. The earliest inscription in Meroitic writing dates from between 180\u2013170 BC.

Kush was centered at [[Napata]] (now modern [[Karima, Sudan]]) during its early phase.

In early Greek geography, the Meroitic kingdom was known as [[Aethiopia]]. The Kingdom of Kush with its capital at Meroe persisted until the 4th century AD, when it weakened and disintegrated due to internal rebellion. The seat was eventually captured and burnt to the ground by the [[Kingdom of Aksum]].

The latter polity began to emerge around 1000 BC, 500 years after the end of the Kingdom of Kerma. By 1200 BC, Egyptian involvement in the [[Dongola Reach]] was nonexistent. By the 8th century BC, the new Kushite kingdom emerged from the Napata region of the upper [[Dongola Reach]]. The first Napatan king, Alara, dedicated his sister to the cult of [[Amun]] at the rebuilt [[Kawa (Sudan)|Kawa]] temple, while temples were also rebuilt at Barkal and Kerma. A Kashta [[stele]] at [[Elephantine]], places the Kushites on the Egyptian frontier by the mid-eighteenth century. This first period of the kingdom's history, the 'Napatan', was succeeded by the 'Meroitic', when the royal cemeteries relocated to Mero\u00eb around 300 BC.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Edwards |first1=David |title=The Nubian Past |date=2004 |publisher=Routledge |location=Oxon |isbn=9780415369886 |pages=2,75,112,114\u2013117,120}}</ref>\n\nThe Kushites buried their monarchs along with all their courtiers in mass graves.

With the worshiping of these gods, the Kushites began to take some of the names of the gods as their throne names.<ref name=\"Van 2011\"/>\n\nThe Kush rulers were regarded as guardians of the state religion and were responsible for maintaining the houses of the gods. Some scholars{{who|date=December 2013}} believe the economy in the Kingdom of Kush was a redistributive system. The state would collect taxes in the form of surplus produce and would redistribute to the people. Others believe that most of the society worked on the land and required nothing from the state and did not contribute to the state. Northern Kush seems to have been more productive and wealthier than the Southern area.<ref name=\"Welsby, Derek A 1998\">Welsby, Derek A. The Kingdom of Kush: the Napatan and Meroitic Empires.

In the Napatan Period Egyptian hieroglyphs were used: at this time writing seems to have been restricted to the court and temples. From the 2nd century BC there was a separate Meroitic writing system. This was an alphabetic script with 23 signs used in a hieroglyphic form (mainly on monumental art) and in a cursive form. The latter was widely used; so far some 1278 texts using this version are known (Leclant 2000). The script was deciphered by Griffith, but the language behind it is still a problem, with only a few words understood by modern scholars.

Edwards<ref name=\"edwards 1998\"/> has suggested that study of the region could benefit from increased recognition of Kush as a state in its own right, with distinct cultural conditions, rather than merely as a secondary state on the periphery of Egypt.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Kerma culture]]\n* [[List of monarchs of Kush]]\n* [[Merowe Dam]]\n* [[Nubian pyramids]]\n* [[Nubiology]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |author=Edwards, David N. |title=The Nubian Past |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=2004 |pages=348 Pages |isbn=0-415-36987-8}}\n* {{cite book |editor1-last=Fisher | editor1-first=Marjorie M. | editor2-last=Lacovara |editor2-first=Peter |editor3-last=Ikram |editor3-first=Salima |editor3-link=Salima Ikram |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=D'Auria |editor4-first=Sue |title=Ancient Nubia: African Kingdoms on the Nile |publisher=The American University in Cairo Press | year=2012 | isbn= 978-977-416-478-1 }}\n* {{cite book |author=Leclant, Jean |title=The empire of Kush: Napata and Meroe |publisher=UNESCO |location=London |year=2004 |pages=1912 Pages |isbn=1-57958-245-1}}\n* {{cite book |author=Oliver, Roland |title=The Cambridge history of Africa.

{"title_page": "Gershon Henoch Leiner", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=June 2016}}\n'''Grand Rabbi Gershon Chanoch Henech Leiner of Radzyn''' (1839 \u2013 December 15, 1890) was a [[rebbe]] of the [[Izhbitza \u2013 Radzin (Hasidic dynasty)|Izhbitza \u2013 Radzin dynasty]], and the first to be known as \"the Radzyner Rebbe\".\n\n==Biography==\nHe was the son of ''Beis Yaakov''.\n\nHe died 4 Teves 5651 (December 15, 1890) and was buried in Radzyn.\n\n==Scholarship==\nHe was the author of ''Orchos Chayim'', ''Sod Y'sharim'', ''Tiferes Hachanochi'', and ''Dalsos Shaar Ha'ir'', among many other seforim.\n\nHe is referred to by Radzyner Chasidim as the ''Orchos Chayim'', based on his phenomenal work on the ''Tzava'ah'' (will) of R' [[Eliezer ben Hurcanus|Eliezer HaGadol]]. He wrote this work in only 12 days, nearly without access to any books, during his trial on a libel fabricated against him by his adversaries. When the Rebbe published this work, he commented to his chasidim that he's happy that he got to print his Tzava'ah.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, the Rebbe had already formulated a spectacular idea: he would compose a \"gemara\" of a sort on the [[Mishnah|mishnayos]] of Seder [[Tohorot|Taharos]], as there is no [[Talmud|Talmud Bavli]] on those tractates. In order to accomplish this, he gathered all the relevant material from the whole Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, and all other [[Baraita|Braysos]] etc., and presented them in chronological order in a sefer he called ''Sidrei Taharos'' on Maseches [[Keilim]]. He later did the same with all the other tractates of Seder Taharos. However, only his works on Keilim and [[Oholot]] were published, as ''Sidrei Taharot''. (The other tractates were lost during the [[Holocaust]].) The task took him ten years to complete.\n\n===Tekhelet===\n\nThe Rebbe was reputed to be brilliant in both the revealed and the hidden Torah. He was also extremely knowledgeable in several scientific fields, like [[chemistry]], [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. He spoke several [[language]]s fluently, and used them frequently while prescribing medicines in [[Latin]] to the countless people who turned to him for help.\n\nHe worked tirelessly for the restoration of the [[Tekhelet|techeiles]] of the [[Tzitzit|tzitzis]]. He made use of his vast knowledge to research the topic, and traveled to [[Italy]] four times to conduct his study. While there he visited what was then the largest [[aquarium]] in the world (in [[Naples]]), and after studying the different sea creatures, concluded that the original blue color for the Techeiles was extracted from the secretion of the [[common cuttlefish]] ([[Sepia officinalis]]; [[Hebrew]]: \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05df). Legend has it that on one of his visits to [[Rome]], he succeeded in persuading the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to allow him a quick glimpse of the Holy Vessels of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beis HaMikdosh]], to match his findings with the techeiles on the priestly garments.\n\nHe published several books on the topic, such as ''S'funei T'munei Chol'', [[Tekhelet|''P'sil T'cheles'']], and ''Ein HaT'cheles'', and succeeded in influencing many [[Gadol|Gedolim]] with his work. At the same time, there were Gedolim who opposed to the Rebbe's opinion and did not agree with his findings.

He wrote this work in only 12 days, nearly without access to any books, during his trial on a libel fabricated against him by his adversaries. When the Rebbe published this work, he commented to his chasidim that he's happy that he got to print his Tzava'ah.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, the Rebbe had already formulated a spectacular idea: he would compose a \"gemara\" of a sort on the [[Mishnah|mishnayos]] of Seder [[Tohorot|Taharos]], as there is no [[Talmud|Talmud Bavli]] on those tractates. In order to accomplish this, he gathered all the relevant material from the whole Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi, and all other [[Baraita|Braysos]] etc., and presented them in chronological order in a sefer he called ''Sidrei Taharos'' on Maseches [[Keilim]]. He later did the same with all the other tractates of Seder Taharos. However, only his works on Keilim and [[Oholot]] were published, as ''Sidrei Taharot''. (The other tractates were lost during the [[Holocaust]].) The task took him ten years to complete.\n\n===Tekhelet===\n\nThe Rebbe was reputed to be brilliant in both the revealed and the hidden Torah. He was also extremely knowledgeable in several scientific fields, like [[chemistry]], [[engineering]] and [[medicine]]. He spoke several [[language]]s fluently, and used them frequently while prescribing medicines in [[Latin]] to the countless people who turned to him for help.\n\nHe worked tirelessly for the restoration of the [[Tekhelet|techeiles]] of the [[Tzitzit|tzitzis]]. He made use of his vast knowledge to research the topic, and traveled to [[Italy]] four times to conduct his study. While there he visited what was then the largest [[aquarium]] in the world (in [[Naples]]), and after studying the different sea creatures, concluded that the original blue color for the Techeiles was extracted from the secretion of the [[common cuttlefish]] ([[Sepia officinalis]]; [[Hebrew]]: \u05d3\u05b0\u05bc\u05d9\u05d5\u05b9\u05e0\u05d5\u05bc\u05df). Legend has it that on one of his visits to [[Rome]], he succeeded in persuading the [[Holy See|Vatican]] to allow him a quick glimpse of the Holy Vessels of the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Beis HaMikdosh]], to match his findings with the techeiles on the priestly garments.\n\nHe published several books on the topic, such as ''S'funei T'munei Chol'', [[Tekhelet|''P'sil T'cheles'']], and ''Ein HaT'cheles'', and succeeded in influencing many [[Gadol|Gedolim]] with his work. At the same time, there were Gedolim who opposed to the Rebbe's opinion and did not agree with his findings. There was, however, a small number of Gedolei Yisrael who would practice the rediscovered [[mitzvah]] of techeiles, like Rabbi [[Sholom Mordechai Schwadron]] (known as the Maharsham of [[Berezhany|Berzan]]) who possessed a [[tallit|tallis]] with techeiles fringes.

New York''''', 268 U.S. 652 (1925), was a decision by the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] holding that the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]] had extended the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]'s provisions protecting [[freedom of speech]] and [[freedom of the press]] to apply to the governments of [[U.S. state]]s. Along with ''[[Chicago, Burlington & Quincy Railroad Co. v. City of Chicago]]'' (1897), it was one of the first major cases involving the [[incorporation of the Bill of Rights]]. It was also one of a series of Supreme Court cases that defined the scope of the First Amendment's protection of free speech and established the standard to which a state or the federal government would be held when it criminalized speech or writing.\n\nThe case arose from the conviction under New York state law of [[Socialist Party of America|Socialist]] politician and journalist [[Benjamin Gitlow]] for the publication of a \"left wing manifesto\" in 1919. In a majority opinion joined by six other justices, Associate Justice [[Edward Terry Sanford]] upheld the conviction under the [[bad tendency]] test, writing that government may suppress or punish speech that directly advocates the unlawful overthrow of the government. Associate Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.]] dissented, arguing that state and federal governments should only be permitted to limit free speech under the \"[[clear and present danger]]\" test that he had previously laid out in ''[[Schenck v. United States]]'' (1919).\n\nIn his majority opinion, Sanford laid out the grounds for incorporation of freedom of speech and freedom of the press, holding that they were among the rights protected by the [[Due Process Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment. Later Supreme Court cases such as ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'' (1937) would incorporate other provisions of the Bill of Rights on the same basis as ''Gitlow''.\n\n==Background==\nNew York's Criminal Anarchy Law was passed in 1902 following the assassination of President [[William McKinley]] by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York, in September 1901.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whipple|first=Leon|title=The Story of Civil Liberty in the United States|date=1927|publisher=Vanguard Press|location=New York|page=307}}</ref> Under the Criminal Anarchy Law, people seen as activists for the destruction of American government through means of revolution could be arrested in an attempt to prevent American Bolsheviks from gaining a national following.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Lendler|first=Marc|date=12 April 2011|title=The Time to Kill a Snake: Gitlow v.

[[Benjamin Gitlow]], a member of the [[Socialist Party of America]], who had served in the [[New York State Assembly]], was charged with [[criminal anarchy]] under New York's Criminal Anarchy Law of 1902 for publishing in July 1919 a document called \"[[Left Wing Manifesto#\"Left Wing Manifesto\" issued by the Left Wing National Council|Left Wing Manifesto]]\" in ''The Revolutionary Age'', a newspaper for which he served as business manager. His trial lasted from January 22 to February 5, 1920.\n\nHis defense contended that the Manifesto represented historical analysis rather than advocacy. Moreover, he claimed that he should not be arrested for his writing since the manifesto's distribution was not the inciting incident for any actions against the government.<ref name=\":1\" /> The prosecution refuted Gitlow's claim, stating, \"Prosecutions have been for the use of words or printed arguments urging actions which if carried out by the reader or hearer would have resulted in the commission of a crime.\" The prosecution claimed that the Manifesto's intent was to convince American readers to commit crimes, and that in itself should be punishable by law. It took the jury three hours to convict Gitlow on February 11, 1920 and sentenced to 5 to 10 years in prison.<ref name=\":0\" /> He served more than two years at [[Sing Sing]] prison before his motion to appeal was granted and he was released on bail.

Joined by Brandeis, he argued that Gitlow presented no present danger because only a small minority of people shared the views presented in the manifesto and because it directed an uprising at some \"indefinite time in the future.\" Moreover, he responded to Sanford's kindling metaphor by refuting the claim that the Manifesto is an example of \"incitement.\" Holmes states, \"Every idea is an incitement. It offers itself for belief and if believed it is acted on unless some other belief outweighs it or some failure of energy stifles the movement at its birth. The only difference between an expression of opinion and an incitement in the narrower sense is the speaker's enthusiasm for the result.

The Supreme Court now holds that almost every provision of the Bill of Rights applies to both the federal government and the states.\n\nThe Supreme Court relied on the \"[[due process]] clause\" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which prohibits a state from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Court stated that \"For present purposes we may and do assume that\" the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press were \"among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the states\".\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nOn November 9, 1925, Gitlow surrendered to New York Authorities for transportation back to [[Sing Sing Prison]] to finish his sentence.<ref name=back /> On December 11, 1925, New York Gov. [[Al Smith]] pardoned him, saying that while Gitlow had been \"properly and legally convicted\", he needed to consider \"whether or not he has been sufficiently punished for a political crime.\" He concluded that \"no additional punishment would act as a deterrent to those who would preach an erroneous doctrine of Government.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/12/12/archives/gitlow-is-pardoned-by-governor-smith-as-punished-enough-executive.html |title=Gitlow is Pardoned by Governor Smith as Punished Enough |date=12 December 1925}}</ref> Gitlow was later briefly elected General Secretary of the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] in 1929.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe Court used the doctrine first enunciated in ''Gitlow'' in other cases, such as ''[[De Jonge v.

Constitutional scholars refer to this as the \"[[incorporation doctrine]],\" meaning that the Supreme Court has identified rights specified in the Bill of Rights and ''incorporated'' them into the liberties covered by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled in [[McDonald v. City of Chicago|''McDonald v.

United States]]''.<ref>{{ussc|name=Schenck v. United States|volume=249|page=47|pin=|year=1919}}.</ref> He embraced \"the [[bad tendency (legal)|bad tendency]] test\" found in ''[[Shaffer v. United States]]'',  which held that a \"State may punish utterances endangering the foundations of government and threatening its overthrow by unlawful means\" because such speech clearly \"present[s] a sufficient danger to the public peace and to the security of the State.\"<ref>{{cite court |litigants=Shaffer v. United States |vol=255 |reporter=F. |opinion=886 |pinpoint= |court=[[9th Cir.]] |date=1919 |url=https://cite.case.law/f/255/886/ |accessdate=2020-01-20 |quote=}}</ref> According to Sanford, a \"single revolutionary spark may kindle a fire that, smoldering for a time, may burst into a sweeping and destructive conflagration.\" He said the Manifesto contained \"the language of direct incitement\" and was not \"the expression of philosophical abstraction.\"<ref name=loses />\n\nIn his dissent, Holmes, the author of ''Schenck'''s clear and present danger test, wrote that he believed it was still the appropriate test to employ in judging the limits of freedom of expression. Joined by Brandeis, he argued that Gitlow presented no present danger because only a small minority of people shared the views presented in the manifesto and because it directed an uprising at some \"indefinite time in the future.\" He responded to Sanford's kindling metaphor that \"eloquence may set fire to reason, but, whatever may be thought of the redundant discourse before us, it had no chance of starting a present conflagration.\"<ref name=loses />\n\n===Incorporation===\n\nThe Supreme Court previously held, in ''[[Barron v. Baltimore]]'', that the Constitution's [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] applied only to the [[Federal Government of the United States|federal government]], that states were free to enforce statutes that restricted the rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights, and that the federal courts could not interfere with the enforcement of such statutes.<ref>{{ussc|name=Barron v. Baltimore|volume=32|page=243|pin=|year=1833|reporter=Pet.|reporter-volume=7}}.</ref> ''Gitlow v. New York'' partly reversed that [[precedent]] and began a trend toward its nearly complete reversal. The Supreme Court now holds that almost every provision of the Bill of Rights applies to both the federal government and the states.\n\nThe Supreme Court relied on the \"[[due process]] clause\" of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], which prohibits a state from depriving \"any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\" The Court stated that \"For present purposes we may and do assume that\" the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the press were \"among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the states\".\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nOn November 9, 1925, Gitlow surrendered to New York Authorities for transportation back to [[Sing Sing Prison]] to finish his sentence.<ref name=back /> On December 11, 1925, New York Gov. [[Al Smith]] pardoned him, saying that while Gitlow had been \"properly and legally convicted\", he needed to consider \"whether or not he has been sufficiently punished for a political crime.\" He concluded that \"no additional punishment would act as a deterrent to those who would preach an erroneous doctrine of Government.\"<ref>{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1925/12/12/archives/gitlow-is-pardoned-by-governor-smith-as-punished-enough-executive.html |title=Gitlow is Pardoned by Governor Smith as Punished Enough |date=12 December 1925}}</ref>\n\nThe Court used the doctrine first enunciated in ''Gitlow'' in other cases, such as ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=De Jonge v. Oregon|volume=299|page=353|year=1937}}.</ref> ''[[Wolf v. Colorado]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Wolf v. Colorado|volume=338|page=25|pin=|year=1949}}.</ref> and ''[[Gideon v. Wainwright]]'',<ref>{{ussc|name=Gideon v. Wainwright|volume=372|page=335|year=1963}}.</ref> to extend the reach of the Bill of Rights. Constitutional scholars refer to this as the \"[[incorporation doctrine]],\" meaning that the Supreme Court has identified rights specified in the Bill of Rights and ''incorporated'' them into the liberties covered by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Recently, the Supreme Court ruled in [[McDonald v. City of Chicago|''McDonald v. Chicago'']] that the 2nd Amendment Right to \"...keep and bear arms,\" for lawful purposes such as self-defense is both a fundamental and individual right of all law-abiding Citizens over 21 years of age and of sound mind as self-defense is the \"central component\" of the 2nd Amendment, and these Rights are \"fully applicable\" in all of the 50 States.<ref>{{ussc|name=McDonald v.
