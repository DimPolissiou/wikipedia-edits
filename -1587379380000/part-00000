{"title_page": "International Accreditation Forum", "text_new": "{{Unreferenced|date=January 2019}}{{Short description|International organization providing accreditations}}The '''International Accreditation Forum, Inc. (IAF)''' is the world association of [[Conformance testing|Conformity Assessment]] [[Accreditation]] bodies and other bodies interested in conformity assessment in the fields of [[Management system|management systems]], [[Product (business)|products]], [[Service (business)|services]], [[Employment|personnel]] and other similar programs of conformity assessment. Its primary function is to develop a single worldwide program of conformity assessment which reduces [[Business risks|risk for business]] and its [[Customer|customers]] by assuring them that accredited [[wikt:certificate|certificate]]s may be relied upon.\n\nIAF members accredit certification or registration bodies that issue certificates attesting that an organization's management, products or personnel comply with a specified [[wikt:standard|standard]].\n\nAccreditation is an essential ingredient for competitiveness, access to new markets, productivity improvement, innovation of new products and environmental protection, as well as the health and safety of populations. An efficient and effective quality and standards infrastructure, underpinned by accreditation, is key to a country\u2019s growth, as well as being essential in creating a safer, cleaner, and more equitable and well-integrated world.\nAccreditation provides confidence in the quality, safety, and environmental credentials of goods, services, and processes. It is required for the effective operation of domestic markets, and its international recognition is important to enable access to foreign markets. Accreditation is a critical element in promoting and sustaining economic development as well as environmental and social well-being, as it provides confidence in metrology, standardization, and conformity assessment (which comprises testing, calibration, inspection, and certification).\n\nIAF has prepared an informative [http://www.compad.com.au/cms/iaf/workstation/upFiles/292851.IAF__Screen-ready_2009-02_Rev.pdf brochure] which provides general information about IAF, its activities, membership and programs.\n\n==Role of the IAF==\n\nThe primary purpose of IAF is two-fold. Firstly, to ensure that its accreditation body members only accredit bodies that are competent to do the work they undertake and are not subject to [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]]. The second purpose of the IAF is to establish [[Mutual recognition agreement|mutual recognition arrangements]] (MRAs), known as [[Multilateral Recognition Arrangement]]s (MLAs), between its accreditation body members which reduces risk to business and its customers by ensuring that an accredited certificate may be relied upon anywhere in the world. The MLA contributes to the freedom of world trade by eliminating technical barriers to trade. IAF works to find the most effective way of achieving a single system that will allow companies with an accredited conformity assessment certificate in one part of the world, to have that certificate recognized else where in the world. The objective of the MLA is that it will cover all accreditation bodies in all [[Country|countries]] in the world, thus eliminating the need for [[Supply chain|suppliers]] of products or services to be certified in each country where they sell their products or services.\n\nAccording to [http://pubdocs.worldbank.org/en/516141538488797114/Why-is-QI-important.pdf the World Bank], accreditation and the wider quality infrastructure, serve the needs of governments, businesses, and consumers. For governments, it provides a mechanism to support relevant trade and industrial policies and ensures enforcement of mandatory technical regulations. Further information can be found on [http://www.publicsectorassurance.org/ Public Sector Assurance]. For businesses, it helps limit the cost of production, by increasing productivity and enabling firms to be more competitive in domestic and foreign markets. More information can be found on [http://www.business-benefits.org/ Business Benefits]. For consumers, it ensures public health and safety as well as environmental and consumer protection. \nAccreditation is closely linked to the United Nations goals of promotion of sustainable development, to protection of human rights, and advancing economic prosperity. The work of ILAC and IAF is strongly aligned to key projects of [https://www.unido.org/sites/default/files/2016-10/SDG_ACCREDITATION_BROCHURE__2__0.pdf UNIDO] and [http://www.unece.org/trade/wp6/welcome.html UNECE], which promote the adoption of accreditation to facilitate trade, provide employment opportunities, and to facilitate exports and foreign direct investment.\nMaintaining strategic partnerships and technical cooperation, together with the use of standards and compliance related activities, forms an important part of UNIDO\u2019s approach. The relationship between UNIDO, the IAF and ILAC aims to enhance the impact of industrial development on economic growth and achieving the SDGs.\n\n==IAF CertSearch==\n\nIAF launched [https://www.iafcertsearch.org/ IAF CertSearch] so accredited certifications from around the world can be validated. IAF CertSearch is a global database where users can search and validate the status of accredited certification issued by a Certification Body which has been accredited by an IAF signatory member Accreditation Body.\nIAF CertSearch also provides organisations with information about the accredited network, which includes a list of all Accreditation Bodies and Certification Bodies across the globe.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to become certified can browse a list of accredited Certification Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking accreditation can browse a list of Accreditation Bodies here.\n\u2022\tOrganisations seeking to trade with a certified company can browse companies on the voluntary trade marketplace here. \n\n\n==Structure of the IAF==\n\nThe highest level of authority in IAF is the Members in a General Meeting. General Meetings make decisions and lay down [[policy]] in the name of the members. The Board is responsible for legal actions to be carried out on behalf of the members, for developing broad policy directions for IAF and for ensuring that the day-to-day work of the IAF is carried out in accordance with policies approved by members. The terms of reference, tasks and duties as defined by the Bylaws and the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) remain unchanged for the members at a General Meeting, the Board of Directors and the Secretary. The Executive Committee is responsible to the Board of Directors for the day-to-day work of IAF on the basis of decisions made by the Members and directions by the Board of Directors.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent Time Trial catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\", Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

Shortly after he was born the family moved to Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and then settled in the UK in Hampshire, England in 1974.\nAfter leaving school at 16 he spent two formative years studying art at [[Basingstoke College of Technology]], after which he undertook A Levels at evening classes and eventually found his way to [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]], reading philosophy and graduating in 1994.\nAfter several years of developing his work in relative isolation he returned to art school and in 2001 he completed an MA in Fine Art at Wimbledon School of Art. He has worked for the past twenty years from a rural setting in his studio in Oxfordshire<ref>\"Eric Butcher: Richness in Rightness\", p.22.

The combination of painted surface and exaggerated depth of the support made the works deliberately and obviously three-dimensional objects \u2013 an \u2018attempt to deny the viewer the desire to see the surface as anything other than surface\u2019.<ref>(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.11. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> This composed physical presence was inherent in even the most restrained of Butcher's works, as William Packer would go on to say in his introduction to Butcher's 2005 catalogue, Carbon Candy, \u2018even when hung conventionally, flat to the wall, they remain obviously and directly physical\u2019.<ref>\u201dCarbon Candy\u201d, p.4. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-12-9}}.</ref> Although characterised by their appearance \u2013 an abstract \u2018accretion of paint, resin and various other fluids\u2019<ref name=\"Arcs\">(2003). \u201cArcs + Surfaces, A Conversation with Eric Butcher\u201d, p.12. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-08-0}}.</ref> - their manufacture was faithful to the rules that govern Butcher's creative process.<ref>Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/ \"statement\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> Butcher has said of his practice that \u2018the application or subtraction of paint as a set of processes is achieved through a variety of continually evolving techniques which draw attention to the physical properties of my materials\u2019,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\">Eric Butcher [http://www.ericbutcher.com/statement/\"statement\u201d] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824131126/http://ericbutcher.com/statement/ |date=2013-08-24 }}.</ref> a result that would be most clearly manifest in his subsequent metal works. The introduction of metal as a support revolutionised Butcher's creative output and his approach to the act of painting, \u2018it may just be a flat piece of metal\u2026 But they all have little nicks, edges and imperfections\u2026 the end result is an accumulation of what I have learnt about that surface\u2019.<ref name=\"Arcs\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, ER.358.jpg|thumb|left|alt=ER.358.|ER.358 Oil and resin on extruded aluminium box sections.]]\n===Philosophy and approach to painting===\n\u2018The application or subtraction of paint\u2019 in Butcher's practice is executed through the use of \u2018a metal blade drawn across the painting\u2019s surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\">\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.7. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> pulling a thin transparent monochrome of oil and resin over the metal support, \u2018this procedure is then repeated and repeated, building up a surface of accumulated residues'.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> The outcome of each painting is determined by \u2018variations in colour modulation\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> and largely \u2018by the physical characteristics of the support\u2019.<ref>Eric Butcher [https://www.ericbutcher.com/statement\u201dstatement\u201d]</ref> 'Paint is registered in vertical and horizontal bands across the surface of the metal plane, with areas of metal left unpainted and its polished face exposed to the viewer. the colour is omitted and the bare aluminium emerges. As a result two rhythms arise; on the one hand the colour fields are interrupted by sections of contrasting colour, and on the other hand we have the various degrees of paint application, which range from impasto to diaphanous. They completely cover the aluminium, yet also let it shimmer through'.<ref>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.23. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref> \n\nAlthough Butcher has a uniform approach to each work,<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> they nevertheless differ vastly from one another as the artist may encounter subtle material differences in the surface of each extrusion; burrs in the metal itself or unexpected variations in the applied paint wash.<ref>Sheldon, Julie (2007). \u201cUnderground\u201d, p.32. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9552820-6-5}}.</ref> Almost every piece will seek to preserve some element of the metal as well, \u2018the aluminium asserts itself as the artwork\u2019s true substance\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> As Butcher seeks to articulate the surfaces of aluminium structures,<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> he does so not only through the repetitive layers of colour application, but also through the preservation of the support's original condition (before his intervention) \u2013 both make for an overall representation of that particular structure's history.\n\nFor the Material Witness exhibition at Toomey Tourell gallery in 2010, Butcher exhibited fourteen of his painted aluminium extrusions.<ref name=\"Baker\">Baker, Kenneth (March 13, 2010). \u201cButcher Shines at Toomey Tourell\u201d. San Francisco Chronicle, p.E-1.</ref> Hung vertically and spaced asymmetrically with a measured and careful distance between one another,<ref name=\"Baker\" /> the display articulated Butcher's increasing awareness of, and preoccupation with, \u2018installation\u2019 in creating a total cohesive experience rather than an isolated object.<ref name=\"ericbutcher\" /> As Kenneth Baker, in his [[San Francisco Chronicle]] review, wrote of the work's interaction with the space it occupied, \u2018to walk this piece is to compose and recompose it through observation. Its geometry and built-in illusionism dictate that it cannot be seen whole\u2019.<ref name=\"Baker\" /> This can also be said of Butcher's curatorial practice, where, as in the Definite Article exhibition curated by the artist himself,<ref>\u201dDefinite Article, Objects and Surfaces, Eric Butcher\u201d, p.3. Vertigo Gallery, London, {{ISBN|1-903771-13-7}}.</ref> he deals with the scale and arrangement of works by Roger Ackling, [[Marc Vaux]] and Cathy Wade, as well as his own. Butcher's attempts within his own works in that exhibition to, \u2018engage the space around the painted surface\u2019<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" /> were similarly factors that he encountered in his curation of the exhibition as a whole, \u2018each of the artists\u2026 employs a range of techniques to encourage the viewer to engage with the work physically\u2019.<ref name=\"DefiniteArticle\" />\n[[File:Eric Butcher, GR.578.jpg|thumb|right|alt=GR.578.|GR.578 Blind embossed paper with cutouts.]]\n\n===Site-specific Installations===\nEric Butcher's site-specific installations are interventions in space. Like the intimate relationship between painted surface and objects that distinguish his work, they become 'a pause in the act or a mistake in the material'<ref name=Bildwerke>Kr\u00e4mer, Harald (2013). \"Bildwerke\", p.27. Galerie Robert Drees.</ref>, 'subtle and stunning, installed in space dispersed over corners, corridors or in staircases they become architecture in motion'.<ref name=TimeTrial16>Heide, Patrick (2019). 'Time Trial', p.16. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> This methodology can be seen in the lengths, or fragments, of aluminium that 'seem to cling to the wall [in his installations]. In part driven by chance, and yet still composed according to a strict order'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> The context of these installations have become increasingly important, 'determined by aspects of its context; both its physical environment and psychological purpose'<ref name=TimeTrial>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.89. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> as Butcher says in his recent catalogue, Time Trial. 'As soon as I started to consider the intersections between surfaces and the wall, I was naturally, logically led to a consideration of the whole environmental context of the work and hence to site-specificity.'<ref name=TimeTrial /> This mirrors his approach to the objects he works with, the 'relationship between the painted surface and the object (upon which one surface has been singled out for preferential treatment), between 'surface' and 'objectness'.<ref name=TimeTrial68>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.68. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref> \n\nAlthough the components of these installations appear to 'cling to the wall'<ref name=Bildwerke />, the evidence of their fixings are increasingly integral to the installation, 'how a piece fixes to the wall, its method of construction, the way in which the work is joined together and adhered to its backing; I want this to be clear and evident. Bolts and fixings are used which in some cases pierce the painted surfaces'.<ref name=TimeTrial65>Butcher, Eric (2019). 'Time Trial', p.65. Galerie Robert Drees, Patrick Heide Contemporary Art and Eric Butcher.</ref>\n\n===Paperworks===\nAs a consequence of this preoccupation with installation, some of Butcher's most recent pieces, his works on paper, experiment diagrammatically with possible arrangements for his large-scale installations of aluminium pieces, 'they repeat\nthe principle of the aluminium works in their own specific way'<ref name=Bildwerke /> introducing elements of chance.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\">\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 77. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> In these paper works, impressions of metal plates are embossed into sheets of saturated paper by running it through a printing press.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 80. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref> Some sections of the plates\u2019 impressions are then highlighted by ink, whereas some sections are cut out altogether \u2013 some left purely as a trace.<ref name=\"ConversationWith\" /> 'These interventions take place separated from one another, yet may also intertwine. Through these perforations, the wall which is behind the deckle edged paper becomes a component of the work and takes on a bigger or smaller role depending on the size and quantity of perforations'.<ref name=Bildwerke /> Butcher refers to this register of trace in his paper works as speaking, metaphorically, of loss and absence.<ref>\u201dA Conversation With Jagjit Chuhan\u201d, p. 81. Centre for Art International Research, Liverpool, {{ISBN|978-0-9557360-4-9}}.</ref>\n\nIt is also apparent that the artist is re-evaluating his own resources in his use of paper, taking environmental concerns into the work itself. As he says in his recent 'Time Trial' catalogue, '[in] trying to consume less, tread more lightly on the planet, it would be curiously contradictory not to impose the same logic of questioning on my work. Aluminium production is an energy intensive business, so I am increasingly using recycled and reused materials'.<ref>\"Time Trial\", Butcher, Eric, p.124.

A Machine Aesthetic (co-curated with Sim\u00f3n Granell), was a major national touring exhibition presenting the work of 11 contemporary British artists whose creative practices engaged with the concept of mechanisation. The exhibition explored the various manifestations, uses and influences of different aspects of mechanisation within the practices of an otherwise diverse group of artists (with [[Andrew Bracey]], Eric Butcher, David Connearn, Rob Currie, Paul Goodfellow, Sim\u00f3n Granell, [[Emma Hart (artist)]], Dan Hays, Natasha Kidd, Tim Knowles, Michael Roberts). In conjunction with the exhibition, the curators guest edited an edition of the arts and culture magazine Garageland (issue XVI: Machines)<ref>[https://www.transitiongallery.co.uk/htmlpages/editions/GL16/intro.htm \"Garageland: issue XVI: Machines\" {{ISSN|1749-9267}}.</ref>, which was themed to coincide with the show.\n\n\n==Further reading==\n*Butcher Shines at Toomey Tourell, Kenneth Baker, San Francisco Chronicle, pg.

The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost mass-production using [[Through-hole technology|through-hole techniques]] where the post walls consists of [[via fence]]s. SIW is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent [[guide wavelength]].\n\nSince the emergence of new communication technologies in the 1990s, there has been an increasing need for high-performance millimeter-wave systems. These need to be reliable, low-cost, compact, and compatible with high-frequencies. Unfortunately, above 10&nbsp;GHz, the well known [[microstrip]] and [[coplanar waveguide|coplanar lines]] technologies cannot be used because they have high insertion and radiation losses at these frequencies. The [[Waveguide (radio frequency)|rectangular waveguide]] topology can overcome these issues as it offers an excellent immunity against radiation losses and presents low insertion losses.

The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them.]]\n\n== Principles of SIW ==\n\n[[File:SIW horizontal.png|alt=Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide.|thumb|Horizontal cross-section of a classical substrate integrated waveguide. The propagating electromagnetic waves are confined inside the substrate because of the two metallic layers on the two faces of the substrate and the two rows of metallic vias connecting them. The center-to-center distance of two successive vias is <math>s</math>, their diameter is <math>d</math> and the center-to-center distance between the two rows of vias is <math>a</math>. The effective width <math>a_e</math>, computed from <math>a</math>, <math>d</math> and <math>s</math>,with is also presented.]]\n\n=== Geometry ===\n\nA classical SIW is composed of a thin dielectric substrate covered on both faces by a metallic layer. The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure).

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition.

However, for [[Rectangular waveguide|rectangular waveguides]], the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic fields]]. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses.

The substrate embeds two parallel rows of metallic [[via (electronics)|via-holes]] delimiting the wave propagation area. The organization of the vias and the geometric parameters are described in the attached figure.\n\nThe width of a SIW is the distance <math>a</math> between its two vias rows, which is defined from center-to-center. An [[#Effective width|effective width]] <math>a_e</math> may be used to characterize more precisely the wave propagation. The distance between two successive vias of the same row is <math>s</math>, and the vias diameter is denoted by <math>d</math>.\n\n=== Transverse magnetic propagation modes ===\n\nIn classical rectangular waveguide, the general formulation of propagation involves a superposition of [[Transverse mode|transverse electric]] (TE) and [[Transverse mode|transverse magnetic]] (TM) modes. Each of these is associated with particular fields and currents. In the case of TM modes, the current in the vertical walls is longitudinal, i.e. parallel to the propagation axis, usually denoted as <math>z</math>. Then, given the vertical geometry of the vias, it is impossible for such modes to appear in SIW's: the electrical current cannot propagate from via to via. Only TE modes are able to propagate through SIW.\n\nEach mode appears above a precise cut-off frequency determined by the waveguide dimensions and the filling medium. For TM modes, decreasing the waveguide thickness (usually denoted as <math>b</math>) increases the cut-off frequency with <math>1/b</math>. In the case of SIW, the thickness is so low that the cut-off frequency of TM modes is much higher than the dominant mode.\n\n=== Effective width ===\n\nOne of the objectives of the SIW geometry is to reproduce the characteristic propagation modes of rectangular waveguides inside a thin template. The width <math>a</math> of the waveguide is an essential parameter of those modes. In the typical SIW geometry, <math>a</math> is the distance between the two vias rows from center-to-center (see figure). Due to the vias geometry, this distance cannot be utilized directly; because of the space between successive vias and their circular shape, the signal inside the guide does not behave exactly as it would in a perfectly rectangular waveguide of the same width.\n\nTo apply waveguide theory to SIWs, an effective width <math>a_\\text{eff}</math>can be used.

The goal of such transitions between two different topologies of TL is to excite the correct transmission mode in the SIW cavity with the minimum loss of power and on the broadest possible frequency range.\n\nRapidly after the presentation of the concept of SIW by [[Ke Wu]], two different transitions were mainly used<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":2\" />. First, the tapered transition allowing to convert a microstrip line into a SIW and secondly a transition between a coplanar line and a SIW (see attached figure). The tapered transition from microstrip to SIW is useful for thin substrates. In this case, the radiation losses associated with microstrip lines are not too significant. This transition is massively used and different optimizing process have been proposed.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rayas-Sanchez|first=Jose E.|last2=Gutierrez-Ayala|first2=Vladimir|date=2008|title=A general EM-based design procedure for single-layer substrate integrated waveguide interconnects with microstrip transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4632999/|journal=2008 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=983\u2013986|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2008.4632999}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deslandes|first=Dominic|date=2010|title=Design equations for tapered microstrip-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide transitions|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5517884/|journal=2010 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium|pages=704\u2013707|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2010.5517884}}</ref> But this is not applicable to thick substrates where leakages are important. In that situation, a coplanar excitation of the SIW is recommended. The drawback of the coplanar transition is the narrower bandwidth.\n\nThese two kinds of transitions involve lines that are embedded in the same substrate, which is not the case for coaxial lines. There exists no direct transition between a coaxial line and a SIW: an other planar line have to be used to convert properly the coaxial TEM propagation modes to the TE modes in SIW.\n\nSeveral studies have been carried out to optimize the transition between topologies without being able to determine a universal rule making it possible to draw the absolute transition. The architecture, the frequency range, the used materials, etc. are examples of parameters that make specific the design procedure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Georgiadis|first2=A.|last3=Wu|first3=K.|date=2011|title=Review of substrate-integrated waveguide circuits and antennas|url=https://digital-library.theiet.org/content/journals/10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463|journal=IET Microwaves, Antennas & Propagation|language=en|volume=5|issue=8|pages=909|doi=10.1049/iet-map.2010.0463}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xiao-Ping|last2=Wu|first2=Ke|date=2009|title=Low-loss ultra-wideband transition between conductor-backed coplanar waveguide and substrate integrated waveguide|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5165705/|journal=2009 IEEE MTT-S International Microwave Symposium Digest|pages=349\u2013352|doi=10.1109/MWSYM.2009.5165705}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sunho|last2=Jung|first2=Sangwoon|last3=Lee|first3=Hai-Young|date=2008|title=Ultra-Wideband CPW-to-Substrate Integrated Waveguide Transition Using an Elevated-CPW Section|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4666756/|journal=IEEE Microwave and Wireless Components Letters|volume=18|issue=11|pages=746\u2013748|doi=10.1109/LMWC.2008.2005230|issn=1531-1309}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taringou|first=Farzaneh|last2=Bornemann|first2=Jens|date=2011|title=New substrate-integrated to coplanar waveguide transition|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6101767/|journal=2011 41st European Microwave Conference|pages=428\u2013431|doi=10.23919/EuMC.2011.6101767}}</ref>\n\n{{multiple image\n| align    = center   \n| direction = horizontal\n| image1   = SIW tapered transition.svg\n| caption1 = Transition from microstrip to SIW\n| width1   = 200\n| image2   = SIW transition CPWG.svg\n| caption2 = Transition from a coplanar line to a SIW\n| width2   = 200\n| footer   = Examples of transitions from coplanar and microstrip lines to SIW.

This loss is generated by different phenomena and each of them is represented by a term <math>\\alpha</math>. The most common terms are the following:<ref name=\":3\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.microwaves101.com/encyclopedias/waveguide-loss|title=Microwaves101 {{!}} Waveguide Loss|website=www.microwaves101.com|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n*<math>\\alpha_C</math> : the loss due to the external metal conductivity\n*<math>\\alpha_D\n</math> : the loss due to loss tangent of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_G</math> : the loss due to conductivity of the dielectric medium filling the waveguide\n*<math>\\alpha_R</math> : the loss due to radiation.\n\nThis decomposition is valid for all kind of [[Transmission line|transmission lines]]. However, for [[Rectangular waveguide|rectangular waveguides]], the attenuation due to radiations and substrate [[Electrical conductivity|conductivity]] is negligible. Indeed, usually, the substrate is an insulator such that <math>\\alpha_G \\simeq 0</math>. In the same way, if the wall thickness is much thicker than the skin depth of the signal, no radiation will appear. This is in fact one of the advantages of closed waveguides compared to open lines such as microstrips.\n\nThe SIWs show comparable or lower losses compared the other traditional planar structures like microstrip or coplanar lines especially at high frequencies.<ref name=\":4\" /> If the substrate is thick enough, the losses are dominated by the dielectric behavior of the substrate.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\n=== Attenuation due to conduction currents ===\nPart of the signal attenuation is due to the [[Current density|surface current density]] flowing through the metallic walls of the waveguide. These currents are induced by the propagating [[Electromagnetic field|electromagnetic fields]]. These losses may also be named ohmic losses for obvious reasons. They are linked to the finite conductivity of the metals: the better the conduction, the lower the losses. The power lost per unit length <math>P_l</math> can be calculated by integrating the current densities <math>J_s</math> on a path <math>C</math> enclosing the waveguide walls : <ref name=\":3\" /> \n\n<math display=\"block\">P_l = \\frac{1}{2} R_s \\int_C |{J_s}|^2 dl.</math>\n\nIt can be shown that in a classical rectangular waveguide, the attenuation of the dominant mode <math>\\text{TE}_{10}</math> due to conduction currents is given, in [[Neper|Nepers]] per [[Metre|meter]], by<math display=\"block\" id=\"alpha_c_expression\">\\alpha_C = \\frac{R_s}{a^3 b \\beta k \\eta}  \\left( 2 b \\pi^2 + a^3 k^2 \\right) =  \\frac{R_s}{\\beta k \\eta} \\left( \\frac{2 \\pi^2}{a^3 } + \\frac{k^2}{b} \\right)</math>where\n\n* <math>a</math> is the width of the waveguide\n* <math>b</math> its height\n* <math>\\eta = \\sqrt{\\mu / \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave impedance]] \n* <math>k = \\omega \\sqrt{\\mu \\epsilon}</math> the [[wave vector]]\n* <math>\\delta = 1 / \\sqrt{\\pi f \\mu \\sigma}</math> the [[Skin Depth|skin depth]] in the conductor \n* <math>R_s = \\frac{1}{\\delta \\sigma} = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\omega \\mu}{2 \\sigma}}</math> is the [[sheet resistance]] (of surface impedance).\n\nIt is noticeable that <math>\\alpha_C</math> is directly linked to the substrate thickness <math>b</math>: the thinner the substrate, the higher the conduction losses. This can be explained keeping in mind that this ohmic losses are determined by integrating the current density on a path enclosing the waveguide walls. \n\nOn the top and bottom horizontal metallic plates, the current is scaled with <math>1/b</math>, due to the modification of the field intensity on these plates: when <math>b</math> increases, the field intensity decreases as well as the currents. In the vertical walls, this variation of <math>J_s^2</math> is compensated by the lengthening of the integration path <math>C</math>. As a result, the contribution of the vertical vias to the conductor losses is unchanged with <math>b</math>.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=Bozzi|first=M.|last2=Perregrini|first2=L.|last3=Ke Wu|date=2008|title=Modeling of Conductor, Dielectric, and Radiation Losses in Substrate Integrated Waveguide by the Boundary Integral-Resonant Mode Expansion Method|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4682637/|journal=IEEE Transactions on Microwave Theory and Techniques|volume=56|issue=12|pages=3153\u20133161|doi=10.1109/TMTT.2008.2007140|issn=0018-9480}}</ref> That is the reason why there is two terms in the expression of <math>\\alpha_C</math>: the first is independent of <math>b</math> while the second one varies with <math>1/b</math>.\n\nAnother key point of the conduction losses experienced by the SIWs is linked to the [[Surface roughness|roughness]] of the surfaces that may appear due to the synthesis processes. This roughness decreases the effective conductivity of the metallic walls and subsequently increases the losses. This observation is of crucial importance for the design of SIWs as they are integrated on very thin substrates.

Before the use of [[chopsticks]] became widespread, in the [[Nara period]], rice was often rolled into a small ball so that it could be easily picked up. In the [[Heian period]], rice was also made into small rectangular shapes known as ''tonjiki'' so that they could be piled onto a plate and easily eaten.\n\nFrom the [[Kamakura period]] to the early [[Edo period]], onigiri was used as a quick meal. This made sense as cooks simply had to think about making enough onigiri and did not have to concern themselves with serving. These onigiri were simply balls of rice flavored with [[salt]]. [[Nori]] did not become widely available until the [[Genroku|Genroku era]] in the mid-Edo period, when the farming of nori and fashioning it into sheets became widespread.\n\n==Mass manufacturing==\nIn the 1980s, a machine that made triangular onigiri was devised. Rather than rolling the filling inside, the flavoring was put into a hole in the onigiri and the hole was hidden by nori. Since the onigiri made by this machine came with nori already applied to the rice ball, over time the nori became moist and sticky, clinging to the rice. \n\nA packaging improvement allowed the nori to be stored separately from the rice. Before eating, the diner could open the packet of nori and wrap the onigiri. The use of a hole for filling the onigiri made new flavors of onigiri easier to produce as this cooking process did not require changes from ingredient to ingredient. Modern mechanically wrapped onigiri are specially folded so that the plastic wrapping is between the nori and rice to act as a moisture barrier. When the packaging is pulled open at both ends, the nori and rice come into contact and is eaten together. This packaging is commonly found for both triangular onigiri and rolls (\u7d30\u5dfb\u304d).\n\n==Rice==\nUsually, onigiri is made with [[steamed rice|boiled white rice]], though it is sometimes made with different varieties of cooked rice, such as:\n\n*[[Okowa|O-kowa]] or kowa-meshi (sekihan): glutinous rice cooked or steamed with vegetables (red beans)\n* Maze-gohan (lit. \"mixed rice\"): cooked rice mixed with preferred ingredients\n* [[Fried rice]]\n[[File:Onigiri in Kyoto for sale March 16 2020 01-54PM.jpeg|thumb|Various flavors in a shop only selling onigiri in [[Kyoto prefecture|Kyoto]]]]\n==Fillings==\n[[Umeboshi]], [[katsuobushi|okaka]], or [[tsukudani]] have long been frequently used as fillings for onigiri.
