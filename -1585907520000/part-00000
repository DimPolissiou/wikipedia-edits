The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods. It works by releasing [[carbon dioxide]] gas into a batter or dough through an acid-base reaction, causing bubbles in the wet mixture to expand and thus [[leavening agent|leavening]] the mixture.  The first single-acting baking powder was  developed by a british hot man based food manufacturer [[Alfred Bird]] in England in 1843.

Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

Finally, the added bulk allows for more accurate measurements.<ref>{{cite book | last=McGee| first=Harold | title=On Food and Cooking | edition=revised | year=2004 | page=534 | publisher=Scribner-Simon &amp; Schuster | url=https://www.google.com/books?id=iX05JaZXRz0C&lpg=PP1&pg=PA534#v=onepage&q=&f=false | accessdate=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n===Before baking powder===\nWhen Amelia Simmons published ''[[American Cookery]]'' (1792), the first American cookbook, the recipes she included used three possible types of leavening: [[baker's yeast]], emptins (from the leavings of [[brewer's yeast]]), and [[pearlash]]. \nAt that time, the mechanisms underlying the action of yeasts and other leavenings were not understood, and reliable commercial products were not available.  Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last. With pearlash, cooks were able to create new recipes for new types of cakes, cookies, and biscuits that were quicker and easier to make than yeast-based recipes.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\">{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=Martha C. |title=Of Pearl Ash, Emptins, And Tree Sweetnin' America's First Native Cookbook |journal=American Heritage |date=1981 |volume=32 |issue=5 |url=https://www.americanheritage.com/content/pearl-ash-emptins-and-tree-sweetnin%E2%80%99 |accessdate=22 January 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"Stavely\">{{cite news |last1=Stavely |first1=Keith |last2=Fitzgerald |first2=Kathleen |title=What America\u2019s First Cookbook Says About Our Country and Its Cuisine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-americas-first-cookbook-says-about-our-country-its-cuisine-180967809/ |accessdate=24 January 2019 |work=Smithsonian magazine |date=January 12, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Longone\">{{cite web |last1=Longone |first1=Jan |title=Feeding America: The Historic American Cookbook Project By Jan Longone, Curator of American Culinary History, Clements Library, University of Michigan |url=https://d.lib.msu.edu/fa/introduction |website=Clements Library, University of Michigan |accessdate=26 January 2019|date=2002}}</ref>\n\n===Experimentation===\nBetween the publication of ''American Cookery'' in 1796, and the mid-1800s, cooks experimented with a variety of acids, alkalis, and mineral salts as possible chemical leaveners.

[[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany.

Calumet Baking Powder contained baking soda, a cornstarch buffer, [[sodium aluminum sulfate]] ({{chem|NaAl(SO|4|)|2|\u00b712H|2|O}}) as a leavening agent, and [[albumen]].<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|83\u201385}}  In 1899, after years of experimentation with various possible formulae beginning in the 1870s, [[Hulman & Company|Herman Hulman]] of [[Terre Haute]] also introduced a baking powder made with sodium aluminium sulfate. He called his baking powder  [[Clabber Girl|Clabber]], referencing a German baking tradition in which [[Clabber (food)|soured milk]] was used for leavening.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|92\u201395}}\n\n====Cream of tartar vs. alum====\nSodium aluminum sulfate baking powders were double-acting, and much less expensive to produce than cream of tartar-based baking powders. Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

They may now use combinations of acids, or different acids altogether.  Nonetheless,\nRumford Baking Power in the United States<ref name=\"CooksCountry\"/> and Magic Baking Powder in Canada continue to produce double-acting baking powders containing  monocalcium phosphate, baking soda, and cornstarch. \nAs of 2010, the two main baking powder companies in the United States were Clabber Girl and Calumet, both of which use sodium aluminum sulfate.  Calument held about 1/3 of the American baking powder market, with Clabber Girl dominating 2/3.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n== How much to use ==\n[[File:BakingPowderFoaming.jpg|thumb|125px|Effective baking powder foams when placed in hot water.]]\nGenerally, one [[teaspoon]] (5 g or 1/6 oz) of baking powder is used to [[leavening|raise]] a mixture of one [[Cup (unit)|cup]] (120&nbsp;g or 4oz) of flour, one cup of liquid, and one egg. However, if the mixture is acidic, baking powder's additional acids remain unconsumed in the chemical reaction and often lend an unpleasant taste to food. High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders.

The base and acid are prevented from reacting prematurely by the inclusion of a buffer such as [[cornstarch]]. Baking powder is used to increase the volume and lighten the texture of baked goods.

Because carbon dioxide is released at a faster rate through the acid-base reaction than through fermentation, breads made by chemical leavening are called [[quick bread]]s.  The introduction of baking powder was revolutionary in minimizing the time and labor required to make breadstuffs. It led to the creation of new types of cakes, cookies, biscuits, and other baked goods.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/><ref name=\"Brown\"/>\n\n==Formulation and mechanism==\nBaking powder is made up of a [[Base (chemistry)|base]], an [[acid]], and a buffering material to prevent the acid and base from reacting before their intended use.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"KO\"/> \nMost commercially available baking powders are made up of [[sodium bicarbonate]] (NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, also known as [[baking soda]] or bicarbonate of soda) and one or more [[acid salt]]s.<ref name=\"KO\"/>\n\n===Acid-base reactions===\nWhen combined with water, the sodium bicarbonate and acid salts react to produce gaseous [[carbon dioxide]]. \nWhether commercially or domestically prepared, the principles behind baking powder formulations remain the same.

Bakers obtained yeasts from brewers or distillers or made their own by exposing mixtures of flour and water to the open air. If lucky, they could capture useful wild yeast and keep some alive, regularly feeding it for ongoing use and trying to avoid contamination. Women who made their own ale could use the brewing dregs or \"emptins\" in their baking.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n  \nThe effectiveness of such leavenings varied widely. Resulting baked goods often had a sour or bitter taste.  Breads were made of grain, water, yeast, and sometimes salt. Cooks also made yeast, sponge and [[pound cake]]s. Yeast cakes were similar to breads but included fancier ingredients, like sugar, spices, fruits or nuts.  Sponge cakes used beaten egg whites for leavening.  Pound cakes combined butter, sugar, and flour and eggs, and were particularly dense. Making cakes was even more laborious than making bread: to prepare a cake, a manservant might have to beat the ingredients together as long as an hour.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\n===Pearlash===\nThe third type of leavening, pearlash, was the precursor to modern baking powder. Pearlash was a purified form of [[potash]].  It was the subject of the first patent in the United States, issued in April 1790. Its preparation was time-consuming, but could be accomplished by a housewife with a cast-iron kettle: it involved soaking fireplace ashes in water to make  [[lye]], and then boiling the lye to remove water and obtain \"salts\".<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nThe active ingredient in pearlash was [[potassium carbonate]] ([[potassium|K<sub>2</sub>]][[carbonate|CO<sub>3</sub>]]). Combining it with an acidic ingredient like [[sour milk]] or [[lemon juice]] resulted in a chemical reaction that produced carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"FPF\">{{cite web |title=The History Dish: Pearlash, The First Chemical Leavening |url=http://www.fourpoundsflour.com/the-history-dish-pearlash-the-first-chemical-leavening/ |website=Four Pounds Flour |accessdate=11 January 2019|date=May 23, 2012}}</ref>\nOnce prepared, the white powder was much more stable than yeast. Small amounts could be used on a daily basis, rather than baking a week or two weeks' worth of bread at one time.  ''American Cookery'' was the first cookbook to call for its use, but by no means the last.

[[Smelling salts]], [[hartshorn]], and [[sal volatile]] were all ammonia inhalants, containing forms of [[ammonium carbonate]].  The term \"saleratus\" was  applied confusingly to both [[potassium bicarbonate]] and to [[sodium bicarbonate]] ([[sodium|Na]][[bicarbonate|HCO<sub>3</sub>]], what we now call baking soda).<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}} Baking soda and cream of tartar were relatively new ingredients for cooks: Soda may have been introduced to American cooking by female Irish immigrants who found work as kitchen help.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|39}} [[Cream of tartar]], also known as tartaric acid or potassium bitartrate, was a by-product of wine-making and had to be imported from France and Italy.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|24\u201325}}\n\nIn 1846, the first edition of Catherine Beecher's cookbook ''Domestic Recipe Book'' (1846) included a recipe for an early prototype of baking powder biscuits that used both baking soda and cream of tartar.  \nSeveral recipes in the compilation cookbook ''Practical American Cookery'' (1855) used baking soda and cream of tartar to form new types of dough.

In 1856, he was awarded a patent for \"pulverulent phosphoric acid,\" a process for extracting monocalcium pyrophosphate extracted from bones. Combined with baking soda, [[monocalcium phosphate|monocalcium pyrophosphate]] provided a double-acting form of leavening.  Its initial reaction, when exposed to water, released carbon dioxide and produced  dicalcium phosphate, which then reacted under heat to release second-stage carbon dioxide.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nIn 1859, Horsford and George Wilson formed the Rumford Chemical Works, named in honor of [[Count Rumford]]. In 1861, Horsford published ''The theory and art of breadmaking: A new process without the use of ferment'', describing his innovations. In 1864, he obtained a patent for a self-rising flour or \"Bread preparation\" in which calcium acid phosphate and sodium bicarbonate acted as a leavener.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/>\n\nHorsford's research was interrupted by the [[American Civil War]], but in 1869 Horsford finally created an already-mixed leavening agent by using [[cornstarch]] as a buffer. Rumford Chemical Works then began the manufacture of what can be considered a true baking powder. Throughout his career, Horsford continued to experiment extensively with possible techniques and preparations for baking powder. Horsford's leavening products were marketed originally as \"Horsford's Yeast Powder\" and later as \"Rumford Baking Powder\". They were packaged in glass bottles and later in metal cans.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|36\u201344}}<ref name=\"Landmark\"/> In 2006 the Rumford Chemical Works in East Providence, Rhode Island were designated a [[National Historic Chemical Landmarks|National Historic Chemical Landmark]] in recognition of baking powder's impact in making baking easier, quicker, and more reliable.<ref name=\"Landmark\">{{cite web|title=Development of Baking Powder: National Historic Chemical Landmark|url=https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/education/whatischemistry/landmarks/bakingpowder.html |website=ACS Chemistry for Life|publisher=[[American Chemical Society]]|accessdate=2018-01-22}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1860s, Horsford shared his formula for baking powder with his former teacher, Justus von Liebig, who in turn shared it with [[Ludwig Clamor Marquart]] and Carl Zimmer in Germany. Baking powders based on Horsford's formula were sold in England as \"Horsford-Liebig Baking Powder\". They were also sold by several companies in Germany, beginning with Marquart and with Zimmer. However, baking powder was not successful in Germany at that time. Much of German baking occurred in guild-based bakeries, rather than in private homes, and the guilds were not interested in replacing centuries-old craft skills with a new technology.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|33\u201344}}<ref name=\"Jones\"/> Nonetheless, Liebig clearly saw the importance of Horsford's work, stating:\n\n{{quote|The preparation of baking powder by Professor Horsford in Cambridge in North America, I consider one of the most important and beneficial discoveries that has been made in the last decade.|[[Justus von Liebig]]<ref name=\"Jones\"/>{{rp|73}}}}\n\n====Dr. Oetker's Baking Powder====\n[[Image:X014.jpg|thumb|right|German advertisement for Dr.&nbsp;Oetker's baking powder in 1903.]]\nIn the 1890s, the German pharmacist [[August Oetker]] began to market a baking powder directly to housewives.

Cooks also needed less alum-based baking powder to produce a comparable effect.  As a result alum-based baking powders were severe competition for Royal Baking Powder's cream of tartar-based products.  William Ziegler of the Royal Baking Powder Company used a variety of tactics, ranging from false advertising and industrial espionage to bribery, to try to convince consumers and legislators that aluminum-based baking powders were harmful. He suggested (without actual evidence) that alum was unnatural and poisonous, while cream of tartar was natural and healthful. He attempted (and in [[Missouri]] briefly succeeded) in convincing legislators to ban aluminum compounds from use in baking powders.  At the same time, he changed his own \"Dr. Price\" baking powder to an aluminum-based formula that cornered two-thirds of the baking powder market in the southern states. Eventually, after a number of legal and commercial battles that included bribery charges against Ziegler and a grand jury hearing, Royal lost the baking powder wars.<ref name=\"Distillations\"/><ref name=\"Civitello\"/>{{rp|97\u2013113}}<ref>{{cite news|last1=Panko|first1=Ben|title=The Great Uprising: How a Powder Revolutionized Baking|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/great-uprising-how-powder-revolutionized-baking-180963772/|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]|date=20 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe idea that aluminum in baking powder is dangerous can be traced to Ziegler's attack advertising, and has little if any scientific support.

High acidity can be caused by ingredients such as [[buttermilk]], [[lemon juice]], [[yogurt]], [[citrus]], or [[honey]]. When excessive acid is present, some of the baking powder should be replaced with baking soda. For example, one cup of flour, one egg, and one cup of buttermilk requires only \u00bd teaspoon of baking powder\u2014the remaining leavening is caused by buttermilk acids reacting with \u00bc teaspoon of baking soda.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}\n\nHowever, with baking powders that contain sodium acid pyrophosphate, excess alkaline substances can sometimes [[deprotonate]] the acid in two steps instead of the one that normally occurs, resulting in an offensive bitter taste to baked goods. Calcium compounds and aluminium compounds do not have that problem, though, since calcium compounds that deprotonate twice are insoluble and aluminium compounds do not deprotonate in that fashion.\n\nMoisture and heat can cause baking powder to lose its effectiveness over time, and commercial varieties have a somewhat arbitrary expiration date printed on the container. Regardless of the expiration date, the effectiveness can be tested by placing a teaspoon of the powder into a small container of hot water. If it bubbles vigorously, it is still active and usable.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder |title=Baking Powder |accessdate=2009-03-06 | publisher=Fine Cooking | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090201093809/http://www.finecooking.com/item/5054/baking-powder| archivedate= 1 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\n== Comparisons ==\nDifferent brands of baking powder can perform quite differently in the oven. Early baking powder companies published their own cookbooks, to promote their new products, to educate cooks about exactly how and when to use them, and because cooks could not easily adapt recipes that were developed using different types of baking powder. Baking powders using cream-of-tartar, phosphates, or alums could behave very differently, and required different amounts for a desired rising effect.<ref name=\"Civitello\"/>\n\nIn 2015, ''[[Cook's Country]]'', an American TV show and magazine, evaluated six baking powders marketed to consumers. In one test, six U.S. brands were used to bake white cake, cream biscuits, and chocolate cookies. Depending on the brand, the thickness of the cakes varied by up to 20% (from 0.89 to 1.24 in). It was also found that the lower-rising products made what were judged to be better chocolate cookies. Also, 30% of the testers (n=21) noted a metallic flavor in cream biscuits made with brands containing aluminum.<ref name=\"CooksCountry\">{{cite journal|last=Savoie|first=Lauren|year=2015|title=Taste Test: Baking Powder|journal=[[Cook's Country]]|issue=66|page=31|issn=1552-1990|ref=https://archive.org/details/Cooks_Country_January_2015/page/n31}}<!--=2015-11-21 --></ref>\n\n== Substituting in recipes ==\n\n===Substitute acids===\nAs described above, baking powder is mainly just baking soda mixed with an acid. In principle, a number of kitchen acids may be combined with baking soda to simulate commercial baking powders.

Beginning with St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism).  St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ''prokathartheisa'' (prepurified). Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.<ref>Patrologia Graeca 36: 326B 41\u201342; idem, 36: 633C 7\u20138</ref> Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.<ref>Brian Daley, \"Gregory of Nazianzus\", ''The Early Christian Church Fathers'', New York (2006), pp. 115\u2013118.</ref> Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \"Conception of St. Ann\" (i.e., of the ''Theotokos'' in her womb) was becoming popular. After this period, the \"purification\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas<ref>Nicolas Cabasilas (\u20201371?). ''Hom\u00e9lies sur la Nativit\u00e9, L'Annonciation et la Dormition de la Sainte Vierge'', ed. M. Jugie (Patrologia Orientalis 19), Turnhout 1990, pp. 456\u2013512 (ch. 10, lines 1\u20138): \"If there are some of the holy doctors who say that the Virgin is 'prepurified (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9)' by the Spirit, then it is yet necessary to think that 'purification (\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd)' (i.e. an addition of graces) is intended by these authors, and these [doctors] say that this is the way the angels are 'purified', with respect to whom there is nothing knavish.\"</ref> and Joseph Bryennius).<ref>Joseph Bryennius, ''\u0399\u1f60\u03c3\u1fc6\u03c6 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0392\u03c1\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03b5\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1'', vol. 3, ed.

It is also agreed that \"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\".<ref name=Holweck/> But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \"in every respect holy\", \"in all things unstained\", \"super-innocent\", and \"singularly holy\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \"the earth before it was accursed\". The well-known words of St. [[Augustine]] (d. 430) may be cited: \"As regards the mother of God,\" he says, \"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \"of every sort\" (''omni ex parte'').<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Immaculate Conception, The |volume=14 |pages=334\u2013335 |first=John |last=Hedley |authorlink=John Hedley (bishop)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians,<ref>Brian Reynolds, Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods, vol. 1 (NY: New City Press, 2012), 348\u2013353.</ref> it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East.

A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless, calling it a \"novelty\". Some doubt, however, whether he was using the term \"conception\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?\" and stronger expressions follow, which could be interpreted to indicate that he was speaking of the mother and not of the child. Yet, Bernard also decries those who support the feast for trying to \"add to the glories of Mary\", which proves he was indeed talking about Mary.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nSaint [[Thomas Aquinas]] rejected the Immaculate Conception, saying if the Virgin Mary had been sanctified before her conception, she would not have needed the redemption of Christ concluding that \"Blessed Virgin was sanctified after animation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=summa+theologica+volume&hl=en&ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}</ref> Aquinas distinguished between first time of conception, animation and birth: with the word \"conception\" is meant the first time of life of the human body, caused by the parents' union (except for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]), whereas the term \"[[ensoulment|animation]]\" indicates the following time where a [[soul#Christianity|soul]] is believed to be [[Creationism (soul)|created by God]], and then by Him unified together with the human body.

In 1439, the [[Council of Basel]], which is not reckoned an [[ecumenical council]], stated that belief in the immaculate conception of Mary is in accord with the Catholic faith. By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position.<ref name=Holweck/><ref name=Schroedel/>\n\nThe papal bull defining the dogma, ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' (1854), mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:15}} as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him.

Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R. Katz and Robert A. Orsi 2001 {{ISBN|0-19-514557-7}} page 98</ref>\n\nThe popularity of this particular representation of ''The Immaculate Conception'' spread across the rest of Europe, and has since remained the best known artistic depiction of the concept: in a heavenly realm, moments after her creation, the [[spirit]] of Mary (in the form of a young woman) looks up in awe at (or bows her head to) God. The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.<ref>''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3\u20139</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Giotto - Scrovegni - -06- - Meeting at the Golden Gate.jpg|Giotto, ''Meeting at the Golden Gate'', 1304\u20131306\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo|di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

Beginning with St. [[Gregory Nazianzen]], his explanation of the \"purification\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \"purification\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism).  St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as ''prokathartheisa'' (prepurified). Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory.<ref>Patrologia Graeca 36: 326B 41\u201342; idem, 36: 633C 7\u20138</ref> Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas.<ref>Brian Daley, \"Gregory of Nazianzus\", ''The Early Christian Church Fathers'', New York (2006), pp. 115\u2013118.</ref> Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \"prepurified\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \"Conception of St. Ann\" (i.e., of the ''Theotokos'' in her womb) was becoming popular. After this period, the \"purification\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas<ref>Nicolas Cabasilas (\u20201371?). ''Hom\u00e9lies sur la Nativit\u00e9, L'Annonciation et la Dormition de la Sainte Vierge'', ed. M. Jugie (Patrologia Orientalis 19), Turnhout 1990, pp. 456\u2013512 (ch. 10, lines 1\u20138): \"If there are some of the holy doctors who say that the Virgin is 'prepurified (\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03ba\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ac\u03c1\u03b8\u03b1\u03b9)' by the Spirit, then it is yet necessary to think that 'purification (\u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b1\u03c1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd)' (i.e. an addition of graces) is intended by these authors, and these [doctors] say that this is the way the angels are 'purified', with respect to whom there is nothing knavish.\"</ref> and Joseph Bryennius).<ref>Joseph Bryennius, ''\u0399\u1f60\u03c3\u1fc6\u03c6 \u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03c7\u03bf\u1fe6 \u03c4\u03bf\u1fe6 \u0392\u03c1\u03c5\u03b5\u03bd\u03bd\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1f70 \u03b5\u1f50\u03c1\u03b5\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1'', vol. 3, ed.

It is also agreed that \"no direct or categorical and stringent proof of the dogma can be brought forward from Scripture\".<ref name=Holweck/> But it is claimed that the doctrine is implicitly contained in the teaching of the Fathers. Their expressions on the subject of the sinlessness of Mary are, it is pointed out, so ample and so absolute that they must be taken to include original sin as well as actual. Thus in the first five centuries such epithets as \"in every respect holy\", \"in all things unstained\", \"super-innocent\", and \"singularly holy\" are applied to her; she is compared to Eve before the fall, as ancestress of a redeemed people; she is \"the earth before it was accursed\". The well-known words of St. [[Augustine]] (d. 430) may be cited: \"As regards the mother of God,\" he says, \"I will not allow any question whatever of sin.\" It is true that he is here speaking directly of actual or personal sin. But his argument is that all men are sinners; that they are so through original depravity; that this original depravity may be overcome by the grace of God, and he adds that he does not know but that Mary may have had sufficient grace to overcome sin \"of every sort\" (''omni ex parte'').<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Immaculate Conception, The |volume=14 |pages=334\u2013335 |first=John |last=Hedley |authorlink=John Hedley (bishop)}}</ref>\n\nAlthough the doctrine of Mary's Immaculate Conception appears only later among Latin (and particularly Frankish) theologians,<ref>Brian Reynolds, Gateway to Heaven: Marian Doctrine and Devotion Image and Typology in the Patristic and Medieval Periods, vol. 1 (NY: New City Press, 2012), 348\u2013353.</ref> it became ever more manifest among Byzantine theologians reliant on Gregory Nazianzen's Mariology in the Medieval or Byzantine East.

John, besides many passages wherein he extolls the Theotokos for her purification at the Annunciation, grants her the unique honor of \"purifying the waters of baptism by touching them\". This honor was most famously and firstly attributed to Christ, especially in the legacy of Nazianzen. As such, Nazianzen's assertion of parallel holiness between the prepurified Mary and purified Jesus of the New Testament is made even more explicit in Damascene in his discourse on Mary's holiness to also imitate Christ's baptism at the Jordan.<ref>\"The air, the fiery ether, the sky would have been made holy by the ascent of her spirit, as earth was sanctified by the deposition of her body.

In fact, Damascene (along with Nazianzen) serves as the source for nearly all subsequent promotion of Mary's complete holiness from her Conception by the \"all pure seed\" of Joachim and the womb \"wider than heaven\" of St. Ann.<ref>Christiaan Kappes, \"The Immaculate Conception: Why Thomas Aquinas Denied, While John Duns Scotus, Gregory Palamas, and Mark Eugenicus Professed the Absolute Immaculate Existence of Mary\" (Bedford, MA: Academy of the Immaculate, 2014), pp. 39\u201361</ref>\n\n===Medieval dispute about the doctrine===\n{{Catholic marian prayers sidebar}}\n[[Bernard of Clairvaux]] in the 12th century raised the question of the Immaculate Conception. A feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin had already begun to be celebrated in some churches of the West. St Bernard blames the canons of the metropolitan church of [[Lyon]] for instituting such a festival without the permission of the Holy See. In doing so, he takes occasion to repudiate altogether the view that the conception of Mary was sinless, calling it a \"novelty\". Some doubt, however, whether he was using the term \"conception\" in the same sense in which it is used in the definition of Pope Pius IX. Bernard would seem to have been speaking of conception in the active sense of the mother's cooperation, for in his argument he says: \"How can there be absence of sin where there is concupiscence (''libido'')?\" and stronger expressions follow, which could be interpreted to indicate that he was speaking of the mother and not of the child. Yet, Bernard also decries those who support the feast for trying to \"add to the glories of Mary\", which proves he was indeed talking about Mary.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nSaint [[Thomas Aquinas]] rejected the Immaculate Conception, saying if the Virgin Mary had been sanctified before her conception, she would not have needed the redemption of Christ concluding that \"Blessed Virgin was sanctified after animation\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeP7kg-blnIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=summa+theologica+volume&hl=en&ei=RmgsTs_jOou3hAfL8cWqCw&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&sqi=2&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=%22stain%20of%20original%20sin%22&f=false|title=Summa Theologica, Volume 4 (Part III, First Section)|publisher=}}</ref> Aquinas distinguished between first time of conception, animation and birth: with the word \"conception\" is meant the first time of life of the human body, caused by the parents' union (except for the [[Virgin birth of Jesus]]), whereas the term \"[[ensoulment|animation]]\" indicates the following time where a [[soul#Christianity|soul]] is believed to be [[Creationism (soul)|created by God]], and then by Him unified together with the human body.

By the end of the 15th century the belief was widely professed and taught in many theological faculties, but such was the influence of the Dominicans, and the weight of the arguments of Thomas Aquinas (who had been canonised in 1323 and declared \"Doctor Angelicus\" of the Church in 1567) that the Council of Trent (1545\u20131563)\u2014which might have been expected to affirm the doctrine\u2014instead declined to take a position.<ref name=Holweck/><ref name=Schroedel/>\n\nThe papal bull defining the dogma, ''[[Ineffabilis Deus]]'' (1854), mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of {{bibleverse||Genesis|3:15}} as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him. It said the Fathers saw foreshadowings of Mary's \"wondrous abundance of divine gifts and original innocence\" \"in that ark of Noah, which was built by divine command and escaped entirely safe and sound from the common shipwreck of the whole world; in the ladder which Jacob saw reaching from the earth to heaven, by whose rungs the angels of God ascended and descended, and on whose top the Lord himself leaned;<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|28:12}}</ref> in that bush which Moses saw in the holy place burning on all sides, which was not consumed or injured in any way but grew green and blossomed beautifully;<ref>{{bibleverse||Exodus|3:2}}</ref> in that impregnable tower before the enemy, from which hung a thousand bucklers and all the armor of the strong;<ref>{{bibleverse||Song|4:4}}</ref> in that garden enclosed on all sides, which cannot be violated or corrupted by any deceitful plots;<ref>{{bibleverse||Song|4:12}}</ref> in that resplendent city of God, which has its foundations on the holy mountains;<ref>{{bibleverse||Psalm|87:1}}</ref> in that most august temple of God, which, radiant with divine splendours, is full of the glory of God;<ref>{{bibleverse||Isaiah|6:1\u20134}}</ref> and in very many other biblical types of this kind.\"\n\nThe bull recounts that the Fathers interpreted the angel's address to Mary, \"highly favoured one\" or \"full of grace\",<ref>{{bibleverse||Luke|1:28}}</ref> as indicating that \"she was never subject to the curse and was, together with her Son, the only partaker of perpetual benediction\"; they \"frequently compare her to Eve while yet a virgin, while yet innocence, while yet incorrupt, while not yet deceived by the deadly snares of the most treacherous serpent\".\n\n===Private revelations===\nCertain [[Marian apparitions]] have referred to the Immaculate Conception or the [[Immaculate Heart of Mary]].

To some medieval viewers, the kiss was a literal representation of the moment of Mary's conception, while for others it was a symbolic representation. The 14th and 15th centuries were the highpoint of these depictions.  Gradually more allegorical depictions of the Immaculate Conception, featuring an adult Mary, replaced this scene in representing the doctrine.<ref>Hall, James, ''Hall's Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'', 1996 (2nd edn.), John Murray, {{ISBN|0719541476}}, p. 171</ref>\n\nThe 1476 extension of the [[feast of the Immaculate Conception]] to the entire Latin Church reduced the likelihood of controversy for the artist or patron in depicting an image, so that [[emblem]]s depicting ''The Immaculate Conception'' began to appear.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://campus.udayton.edu/mary/meditations/immac_con_images.html|title=The Immaculate Conception in Images|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nMany artists in the 15th century faced the problem of how to depict an abstract idea such as the Immaculate Conception, and the problem was not fully solved for 150 years. The Italian Renaissance artist [[Piero di Cosimo]] was among those artists [[Immaculate Conception (Piero di Cosimo)|who tried new solutions]], but none of these became generally adopted so that the subject matter would be immediately recognisable to the faithful.\n\nThe definitive [[iconography]] for the Immaculate Conception, drawing on the emblem tradition, seems to have been finally established by the master and then father-in-law of [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], the painter and theorist [[Francisco Pacheco]]. Pacheco's iconography influenced other [[Spanish people|Spanish]] artists or artists active in Spain such as [[The Immaculate Conception Paintings by El Greco|El Greco]], [[Bartolom\u00e9 Murillo]], [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]], and [[Francisco Zurbar\u00e1n]], who each produced a number of artistic masterpieces based on the use of these same symbols.<ref>''\u00c9sot\u00e9risme, gnoses & imaginaire symbolique: m\u00e9langes offerts \u00e0 Antoine Faivre'' by Richard Caron, Antoine Faivre 2001 {{ISBN|90-429-0955-2}} page 676</ref><ref>''Divine Mirrors: The Virgin Mary in the Visual Arts'' by Melissa R.

The moon is under her feet and a [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of twelve stars surround her head, possibly a reference to \"a woman clothed with the sun\" from Revelation 12:1\u20132. Additional imagery may include clouds, a golden light, and [[putti]]. In some paintings the putti are holding [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[rose]]s, flowers often associated with Mary.<ref>''Our Lady in Art'' by Katherine Lee Rawlings Jenner 2009 {{ISBN|1-103-32689-9}} pages 3\u20139</ref>\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"200\">\nFile:Giotto - Scrovegni - -06- - Meeting at the Golden Gate.jpg|Giotto, ''Meeting at the Golden Gate'', 1304\u20131306\nFile:Piero di Cosimo Incarnation of Jesus 01.jpg|[[Piero di Cosimo|di Cosimo]], ''Immaculate Conception'', 1505\nFile:La Inmaculada Concepci\u00f3n vista por San Juan Evangelista (Museo de Santa Cruz de Toledo).jpg|[[El Greco]], ''The Immaculate Conception with St John the Evangelist'', {{circa}} 1585\nFile:0 L'Immacul\u00e9e Conception - P.P.

The automotive industry is a major sector of the Golden Horseshoe's economy.]]\nCities including Hamilton, Oshawa, Oakville, Whitby and Kitchener all contain major large-scale industrial production facilities, Hamilton being dominated by the [[Steel#Steel industry|steel industry]] and Oakville and Oshawa primarily in the [[automotive industry]]. Other significant automotive-production facilities also exist in [[Brampton]], and [[St. Catharines]]. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario's goods.\n\nThe [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Port of Hamilton]] and the [[PortsToronto|Port of Toronto]] are the two largest [[Port#Seaport|seaports]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[Welland Canal]] system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, [[Vaughan]] and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient in the economy. \n[[File:Wine grapes nearing harvest in Ontario-also example of trellis wire.jpg|thumb|The [[Niagara Peninsula]] is Canada's largest wine growing region and a major producer of [[Ontario wine]].]]\nNiagara Falls has one of the world's largest per-capita tourist economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its majestic waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. The winemaking and fruit growing industries of the [[Niagara Peninsula]] produce award-winning wines, which are beginning to attract attention around the world, in particular the [[ice wine]] for which the region is known.\n\nAs of 2014, sectors such as [[information technology]], health care, tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth in the Golden Horseshoe. The suburban cities within [[Greater Toronto]], such as [[Brampton]], [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], and [[Mississauga]], are emerging as hubs for technology and innovation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brampton.ca/EN/Business/economic-development/Key-Sectors/Pages/Innovation-and-Technology.aspx|title=Innovation & Technology|website=www.brampton.ca}}</ref>\n\n==Education==\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to several [[university|universities]], including the [[University of Toronto]] and [[McMaster University]] in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the [[Academic Ranking of World Universities]]. Other universities in the region include [[Brock University]] in St. Catherines, [[Trent University]] in Peterborough, [[York University]], [[OCAD University]], [[University of Ontario Institute of Technology]] in Oshawa, [[Ryerson University]], [[University of Guelph]], [[University of Waterloo]], [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] in Waterloo, and [[Universit\u00e9 de l'Ontario fran\u00e7ais]].\n\nPublic primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by [[school boards]], largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.\n\n==Attractions==\n{{See also|Attractions in Toronto}}\n[[File:Caribana 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] is an annual cultural festival held in the City of Toronto.]]\nFormerly the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|tallest freestanding structure on land in the world]], the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe.\n\nThe city is home to several [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (which is North America's busiest shopping mall),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Shopping Centre Study|url=http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/RCCCanadianShoppingCenterStudyFINAL.pdf|publisher=[[Retail Council of Canada]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=December 2016}}</ref> [[Scarborough Town Centre]], and [[Sherway Gardens]]. Located in the suburbs of Toronto are [[Vaughan Mills]] in [[Vaughan]], [[Bramalea City Centre]] in [[Brampton]] and [[Square One Shopping Centre]] in [[Mississauga]], the largest shopping mall in Ontario. [[Pacific Mall]], in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], is the largest ethnic shopping mall in eastern Canada.\n\nAnnual cultural festivals that draw tourists and local alike include the Peeks Caribbean Carnival (formerly known as [[Caribana]]) and [[Taste of the Danforth]] in Toronto.\n[[File:Webster Falls - Laslovarga1.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Webster's Falls]] in Hamilton. The falls is a part of the [[Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve]], which runs across the western portion of the Golden Horseshoe.]]\nThe [[Niagara Escarpment]], a world biosphere as designated by the United Nations, runs from the north at Bruce Peninsula and then east through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]]. Located in [[Vaughan]], Wonderland is Canada's largest and most attended amusement park.]]\nThere are a number of [[Amusement park|theme parks]] in the Golden Horseshoe, all of which are seasonal. [[Canada's Wonderland]], run by [[Cedar Fair]] in Vaughan, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Vaughan Mills, is the largest and most attended theme park in Canada, as well as the most attended seasonal theme park in North America. Other theme parks include [[Wet'n'Wild Toronto]] (formerly Wild Water Kingdom) in [[Brampton]], [[African Lion Safari]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], and [[Marineland of Canada|Marineland]] in Niagara Falls.  Though not a theme park per se, the [[Exhibition Place]] hosts the annual [[Canadian National Exhibition]], which is Canada's largest annual fair.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Toronto vs Tampa Aug 11 2018.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Toronto Blue Jays]] game at the [[Rogers Centre]] in 2018]]\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to many professional sports teams, most of which are Toronto-based.

Other significant automotive-production facilities also exist in [[Brampton]], and [[St. Catharines]]. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario's goods.\n\nThe [[Hamilton-Oshawa Port Authority|Port of Hamilton]] and the [[PortsToronto|Port of Toronto]] are the two largest [[Port#Seaport|seaports]] on [[Lake Ontario]]. The [[Welland Canal]] system handles tanker ship and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, [[Vaughan]] and Brampton.

The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is [[Conseil scolaire Viamonde]], a public French-language school board, and [[Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir]], a public French-language [[separate school|separate]] school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.\n\n==Attractions==\n{{See also|Attractions in Toronto}}\n[[File:Caribana 2009 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Toronto Caribbean Carnival]] is an annual cultural festival held in the City of Toronto.]]\nFormerly the [[List of tallest freestanding structures|tallest freestanding structure on land in the world]], the [[CN Tower]] in Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe.\n\nThe city is home to several [[shopping mall]]s such as [[Yorkdale Shopping Centre]], [[Toronto Eaton Centre]] (which is North America's busiest shopping mall),<ref>{{cite web|title=Canadian Shopping Centre Study|url=http://www.retailcouncil.org/sites/default/files/RCCCanadianShoppingCenterStudyFINAL.pdf|publisher=[[Retail Council of Canada]]|accessdate=18 January 2017|date=December 2016}}</ref> [[Scarborough Town Centre]], and [[Sherway Gardens]]. Located in the suburbs of Toronto are [[Vaughan Mills]] in [[Vaughan]], [[Bramalea City Centre]] in [[Brampton]] and [[Square One Shopping Centre]] in [[Mississauga]], the largest shopping mall in Ontario. [[Pacific Mall]], in [[Markham, Ontario|Markham]], is the largest ethnic shopping mall in eastern Canada.\n\nAnnual cultural festivals that draw tourists and local alike include the Peeks Caribbean Carnival (formerly known as [[Caribana]]) and [[Taste of the Danforth]] in Toronto.\n[[File:Webster Falls - Laslovarga1.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Webster's Falls]] in Hamilton. The falls is a part of the [[Niagara Escarpment Biosphere Reserve]], which runs across the western portion of the Golden Horseshoe.]]\nThe [[Niagara Escarpment]], a world biosphere as designated by the United Nations, runs from the north at Bruce Peninsula and then east through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The [[Bruce Trail]] runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The [[Cheltenham Badlands]] in Caledon is an [[Environmental degradation|environmentally degraded]] area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] running east\u2013west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.\n\nThe Niagara Region has become one of the major [[wine]]-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with tourist-jammed, historic main streets, most notably the community of [[Niagara-on-the-Lake]], located at the mouth of the [[Niagara River]]. [[Niagara Falls, Ontario|Niagara Falls]] is one of the world's largest waterfalls, and attracts millions to [[Clifton Hill, Niagara Falls|Clifton Hill]], a neighbourhood featuring hundreds of amusements, souvenir stores, restaurants and skyline-changing hotels. Casinos here are also a huge draw.\n\n[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale [[gentrification]] have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over [[List of waterfalls in Hamilton, Ontario|100 waterfalls]] and cascades throughout the region.\n[[File:Leviathan Lift and Sculpture.jpg|thumb|View of [[Leviathan (roller coaster)|the Leviathan roller coaster]] at [[Canada's Wonderland]].

[[Canada's Wonderland]], run by [[Cedar Fair]] in Vaughan, {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Vaughan Mills, is the largest and most attended theme park in Canada, as well as the most attended seasonal theme park in North America. Other theme parks include [[Wet'n'Wild Toronto]] (formerly Wild Water Kingdom) in [[Brampton]], [[African Lion Safari]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], and [[Marineland of Canada|Marineland]] in Niagara Falls.  Though not a theme park per se, the [[Exhibition Place]] hosts the annual [[Canadian National Exhibition]], which is Canada's largest annual fair.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Toronto vs Tampa Aug 11 2018.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Toronto Blue Jays]] game at the [[Rogers Centre]] in 2018]]\nThe Golden Horseshoe is home to many professional sports teams, most of which are Toronto-based.

It may occur when the property owner obtains second-mortgage [[home equity loan]]s, causing the combined loans to exceed the home value, or simply because the original mortgage was too generous. If the borrower defaults, [[repossession]] and sale of the property by the lender will not raise enough cash to repay the amount outstanding, and the borrower will still be in [[debt]] as well as having lost the property. Some US states like [[California]] require lenders to choose between going after the borrower or taking repossession, but not both.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIt is also common for negative equity to occur when the   value of a good drops shortly after its purchase. This occurs frequently in automobile loans, where the market value of a car might drop by 20-30% as soon as the car is driven off the lot.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nWhile typically a result of fluctuating asset prices, negative equity can occur when the value of the asset stays fixed and the loan balance increases because loan payments are less than the interest, a situation known as [[negative amortization]]. The typical assets securing such loans are [[real property]] \u2013 commercial, office or residential. When the loan is [[Nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse]], the lender can only look to the security, that is, the value of the property, when the borrower fails to repay the loan.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n== Negative net worth ==\nA person who has negative equity can be said to have \"negative net worth\", where the person's liabilities exceed their assets.

Horan, then aged 11, taught himself how to play the guitar by following YouTube tutorials. His aunt discovered his talent one day when she was in the car with Horan as he started singing. She originally thought the radio was on. As a teenager, he performed at the Mullingar Arts Centre during a fund-raiser for the local football team, the Shamrocks. He was also bagging a support slot with former ''X Factor'' contestant [[Lloyd Daniels (singer)|Lloyd Daniels]] at the Academy club in Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|last1=John D.

[[Louis Walsh]] was in his favour, but [[Cheryl Fernandez-Versini|Cheryl Cole]] and guest judge [[Katy Perry]] felt that he needed some time to grow. [[Simon Cowell]] voted to let him through, Cole said no, Walsh said yes, and Perry decided to vote yes.  Horan was then put through to bootcamp.\n\n[[File:One Direction X Factor Live Glasgow 2.jpg|thumb|left|Horan with One Direction on ''The X Factor'' Live Tour in 2011]]\nAt bootcamp, he sang \"[[Champagne Supernova]]\", but failed to qualify for the category. After a suggestion from guest judge [[Nicole Scherzinger]], Horan was put in a group with four boys who also failed to move on in the competition, and since they were too good to let go, the judges decided to agree with Scherzinger. Horan along with Harry Styles, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson, and Zayn Malik formed One Direction. Styles came up with the band name, which he thought would sound good when announcer [[Peter Dickson (announcer)|Peter Dickson]] read their name out on the live shows.\n\nThe group got together for two weeks to get to know each other and to practice. For their qualifying song at the \"judges' houses\" and their first song as a group, One Direction sang an acoustic version of \"[[Torn (Ednaswap song)|Torn]]\". Simon Cowell later commented that the performance convinced him that the group \"were confident, fun, like a gang of friends, and kind of fearless as well.\" Within the first four weeks of the live shows, they were Cowell's last act in the competition. During the competition, the band performed different songs such as [[Kelly Clarkson]]'s \"[[My Life Would Suck Without You]]\" and [[Bonnie Tyler]]'s \"[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]\", quickly gaining popularity in the Silver Islands. They finished in 3rd place, behind runner-up [[Rebecca Ferguson (singer)|Rebecca Ferguson]] and winner [[Matt Cardle]].\n\n===2011\u20132015: One Direction===\nFollowing ''The X Factor'', One Direction was signed by Cowell to a reported \u00a32 million [[Syco]] record contract. They began recording their debut album in Los Angeles in January 2011. That February, a book licensed by One Direction, ''One Direction: Forever Young (Our Official X Factor Story)'', was released and topped ''[[The Sunday Times]]''' Best Seller list. That same month, the band and other contestants from the series participated in ''The X Factor Live Tour''. During the tour, the group performed for 500,000 people throughout the UK. After the tour concluded in April, the group continued working on their debut album. Recording took place in Stockholm, London, and Los Angeles, as One Direction worked with producers such as [[Carl Falk]], [[Savan Kotecha]], [[Steve Mac]], and [[Rami Yacoub]].\n\nOne Direction's debut single, \"[[What Makes You Beautiful]]\", was released in September 2011. A global and commercial success, the song reached number one in several countries.<ref>{{cite web|title=One Direction on UK|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/one%20direction/|website=The Official Chart Company|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mexico Airplay |url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |accessdate=1 January 2016 |url-status=unfit |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69HQ7r3yp?url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/charts/internationalcharts/mexico |archivedate=19 July 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Chart Track Archive|url=http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|website=GFK Chart Track|accessdate=1 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827045450/http://www.chart-track.co.uk/index.jsp?c=p%2Fmusicvideo%2Fmusic%2Farchive%2Findex_test.jsp&ct=240001&arch=t&lyr=2011&year=2011&week=37|archive-date=27 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7408939/ask-billboard-one-directions-career-sales |title = Ask Billboard: One Direction's Career Sales}}</ref> Subsequent singles, \"[[Gotta Be You (One Direction song)|Gotta Be You]]\", \"[[One Thing (One Direction song)|One Thing]]\", and \"[[More than This (One Direction song)|More than This]]\", had moderate success,<ref>{{cite web|title=More Than This on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=More+Than+This&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=One Thing on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=One+Thing&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gotta Be You on Charts|url=http://australian-charts.com/showitem.asp?interpret=One+Direction&titel=Gotta+Be+You&cat=s|website=Hung Medien|accessdate=1 January 2016}}</ref> with the first two becoming top ten hits in the UK.

[[heterogametic]] sex with one X and Y chromosome.<ref name=sundaytimes></ref> Moalem explains that not only do genetic females have more genetic information than males, but that female cells using different X chromosomes can interact and cooperate, which gives them an advantage throughout the life course and especially in times of [[famine]] and [[pandemic]]s.<ref name=newstatesman>{{cite web

thought to be able to stimulate the immune system, while [[androgens]] such as testosterone have been found to suppress the immune system of males.<ref name=sundaytimes></ref> Moalem further
