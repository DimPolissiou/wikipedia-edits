Cook and his landing party were set upon by a group of local men, and in the scuffle that followed, several of Cook's men were injured and a number of Erromangans killed. Following this incident, Cook gave the name 'Traitor's head' to the peninsula adjacent to Potnarvin.<ref>Cook 1890, p. 503.</ref>\n\nWhaling vessels were among the early regular visitors to the island on the nineteenth century. The first such vessel known to have visited was the ''Rose'' in 1804 and the last on record was the American vessel ''John & Winthrop'' in 1887.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984) ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.190. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\n===The sandalwood trade===\nIn 1825, trader and adventurer [[Peter Dillon]] discovered the island's large reserves of [[sandalwood]] (''Santalum austrocaledonicum''), valued in China for its aromatic oil and as a carving wood. Dillon found that his trade goods were not sufficient to entice Erromangans to cut the timber for him, so he left without gathering any sandalwood. News of his discovery brought other outsiders to Erromango to exploit the resource, and this caused conflict between the Erromangans and the traders.<ref>Dillon, letter to the editor, ''Bengal Herkaru'', 14 October 1826, cited in Dorothy Shineberg, ''They Came for Sandalwood'', Ch. 2 Beginnings of the Trade, University of Queensland Press 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1830, [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] sent two ships with 479 Hawaiians on board to seize control of Erromango and its sandalwood, under the command of [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]], ruler-designate of Erromango. Their arrival in Cook's Bay coincided with the arrival of two other groups of traders intent on exploiting the sandalwood; two ships, the ''Dhaule'' and the ''Sophia'', both crewed by 330 [[Rotuma]]n labourers and another ship, the ''Snapper'', with a crew of 113 [[Tonga]]n labourers on board, had all arrived just before the Hawaiian vessels. The Erromangans resisted the Hawaiians' takeover attempt, and the Hawaiians' hostile intent turned the Erromangans against the other interlopers and their Polynesian crews. Fever killed most of the Tongan and Hawaiian labourers, and just 20 Hawaiians returned to Hawaii to tell the story of their failed occupation. A crash in the price of sandalwood shortly after deterred most traders until the mid-1840s, but even when prices rose again, the combined risks of attack on shore, uncharted reefs, storms and hurricanes meant that sandalwood trading was a highly speculative venture. Some traders such as [[Robert Towns]] and James Paddon established stations on Erromango or nearby islands such as [[Aneityum]] and [[Isle of Pines (New Caledonia)|\u00cele des Pins]] in [[New Caledonia]] to reduce their costs. By 1865 though, Erromango's sandalwood resource was exhausted.<ref>Shineberg 1967, Ch. 11.</ref>\n\n===Introduced diseases and depopulation===\nErromango's population prior to European contact is estimated at approximately 5,000,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lightner|first1=Sara|last2=Naupa|first2=Anna|title=Histri Blong Yumi Long Vanuatu: an educational resource|date=2005|publisher=Vanuatu National Cultural Council|volume=2|location=Port Vila|isbn=982-9032-07-8|page=91|chapter=4.

European visitors brought diseases such as influenza, smallpox and measles to which the local population had no immunity. Sixty percent of Erromangans died during a smallpox outbreak in 1853 and a measles epidemic in 1861.<ref>Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.90.</ref>\n\nContemporary accounts by missionaries blamed the sandalwood traders for the outbreaks. Erromangans sought reprisal by killing European and Polynesian missionaries (e.g. [[George N. Gordon]]), their converts and other visitors.<ref>Shineberg 1967, pp. 175-176.</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/thelastmartyrsof00gorduoft/page/n13 The last martyrs of Eromanga : being a memoir of the Rev.

Another 10,000 went to work in nickel mines in New Caledonia and on plantations in [[Fiji]], [[Samoa]] and Hawaii.<ref>Lighter & Naupa 2005, p. 41</ref> Many of the islanders recruited were duped into taking part, some were coerced and some volunteered.

Robertson, resident on Erromango from 1872\u20131913, succeeded in missionising the island's population. This changed the traditional society of the island. His attempts at missionisation were effective because he carefully studied the beliefs and material culture in order to target the most powerful symbols of traditional society.

[[James Gordon (missionary)|James A. Gordon]], had spread the belief amongst Erromangans that the Christian God had sent the 1861 measles epidemic to punish them for the killing of Rev. Williams and the other missionaries. Gordon saw this as a means of gaining converts, though some of his contemporaries disapproved of this tactic.<ref>Shineberg 1967, ch. 16.</ref> This tactic backfired on Gordon, as he and his wife were killed in reprisal for the epidemic, which continued unabated despite their deaths. Over time, Gordon's myth grew into a collective belief amongst Erromangans that the island had been cursed by the Presbyterian Church. This caused the abandonment of forms of cultural expression not sanctioned by the church.<ref>Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.91.</ref> Belief in this 'curse' endured until the 2009 reconciliation ceremony, which initiated a re-examination of Erromango's history and culture from an Erromangan point of view.

Following this incident, Cook gave the name 'Traitor's head' to the peninsula adjacent to Potnarvin.<ref>Cook 1890, p. 503.</ref>\n\nWhaling vessels were among the early regular visitors to the island on the nineteenth century. The first such vessel known to have visited was the ''Rose'' in 1804 and the last on record was the American vessel ''John & Winthrop'' in 1887.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984) ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.190. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref>\n\n===The sandalwood trade===\nIn 1825, trader and adventurer [[Peter Dillon]] discovered the island's large reserves of [[sandalwood]] (''Santalum austrocaledonicum''), valued in China for its aromatic oil and as a carving wood. Dillon found that his trade goods were not sufficient to entice Erromangans to cut the timber for him, so he left without gathering any sandalwood. News of his discovery brought other outsiders to Erromango to exploit the resource, and this caused conflict between the Erromangans and the traders.<ref>Dillon, letter to the editor, ''Bengal Herkaru'', 14 October 1826, cited in Dorothy Shineberg, ''They Came for Sandalwood'', Ch. 2 Beginnings of the Trade, University of Queensland Press 1967.</ref>\n\nIn 1830, [[Kamehameha III|King Kamehameha III]] of [[Kingdom of Hawaii|Hawaii]] sent two ships with 479 Hawaiians on board to seize control of Erromango and its sandalwood, under the command of [[Boki (Hawaiian chief)|Boki]], ruler-designate of Erromango. Their arrival in Cook's Bay coincided with the arrival of two other groups of traders intent on exploiting the sandalwood; two ships, the ''Dhaule'' and the ''Sophia'', both crewed by 330 [[Rotuma]]n labourers and another ship, the ''Snapper'', with a crew of 113 [[Tonga]]n labourers on board, had all arrived just before the Hawaiian vessels. The Erromangans resisted the Hawaiians' takeover attempt, and the Hawaiians' hostile intent turned the Erromangans against the other interlopers and their Polynesian crews. Fever killed most of the Tongan and Hawaiian labourers, and just 20 Hawaiians returned to Hawaii to tell the story of their failed occupation. A crash in the price of sandalwood shortly after deterred most traders until the mid-1840s, but even when prices rose again, the combined risks of attack on shore, uncharted reefs, storms and hurricanes meant that sandalwood trading was a highly speculative venture. Some traders such as [[Robert Towns]] and James Paddon established stations on Erromango or nearby islands such as [[Aneityum]] and [[Isle of Pines (New Caledonia)|\u00cele des Pins]] in [[New Caledonia]] to reduce their costs. By 1865 though, Erromango's sandalwood resource was exhausted.<ref>Shineberg 1967, Ch. 11.</ref>\n\n===Introduced diseases and depopulation===\nErromango's population prior to European contact is estimated at approximately 5,000,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Lightner|first1=Sara|last2=Naupa|first2=Anna|title=Histri Blong Yumi Long Vanuatu: an educational resource|date=2005|publisher=Vanuatu National Cultural Council|volume=2|location=Port Vila|isbn=982-9032-07-8|page=91|chapter=4.

Robertson, resident on Erromango from 1872-1913, succeeded in missionising the island's population. This changed the traditional society of the island.

[[James Gordon (missionary)|James A. Gordon]], had spread the belief amongst Erromangans that the Christian God had sent the 1861 measles epidemic to punish them for the killing of Rev. Williams and the other missionaries. Gordon saw this as a means of gaining converts, though some of his contemporaries disapproved of this tactic.<ref>Shineberg 1967, ch. 16.</ref> This tactic backfired on Gordon, as he and his wife were killed in reprisal for the epidemic, which continued unabated despite their deaths. Over time, Gordon's myth grew into a collective belief amongst Erromangans that the island had been cursed by the Presbyterian Church. This caused the abandonment of forms of cultural expression not sanctioned by the church.<ref>Carillo-Huffman & Nemban 2010, p.91.</ref> Belief in this 'curse' endured until the 2009 reconciliation ceremony, which initiated a re-examination of Erromango's history and culture from an Erromangan point of view. According to a participant, \"the reconciliation has freed us up to embrace our customs and traditions, which we couldn't do before because of the guilt attached to Erromango's history and the tendency to view traditional culture as the antithesis of Christianity\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Mayer|first1=Carol E.|last2=Naupa|first2=Anna|last3=Warri|first3=Vanessa|title=No Longer Captives of the Past : the story of a reconciliation on Erromango|date=2013|publisher=Erromango Cultural Association/Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia|location=Port Vila/Vancouver|isbn=9780888650566|page=103}}</ref>\n\n===Later history===\nErromango and nearby Tanna were devastated by [[cyclone Pam]] in mid-March 2015, with reports from Tanna of an unknown number of deaths, complete destruction of the island\u2019s infrastructure and permanent shelters, no drinking water.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/15/cyclone-pam-vanuatu-more-deaths-water-shortages-storm The Guardian:Cyclone Pam: more deaths and water shortages to follow storm, 15 March 2015]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\nThe total area of Erromango is 891.9&nbsp;km\u00b2.

{"title_page": "Algebraic number field", "text_new": "In [[mathematics]], an '''algebraic number field''' (or simply '''number field''') ''F'' is a finite [[Degree of a field extension|degree]] (and hence [[algebraic extension|algebraic]]) [[field extension]] of the [[field (mathematics)|field]] of [[rational number]]s '''Q'''.  Thus ''F'' is a field that contains '''Q''' and has finite [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] when considered as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''.\n\nThe study of algebraic number fields, and, more generally, of algebraic extensions of the field of rational numbers, is the central topic of [[algebraic number theory]].\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Prerequisites===\n\n{{Main|Field (mathematics)|l1=Field|Vector space}}\nThe notion of algebraic number field relies on the concept of a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A field consists of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of elements together with two operations, namely [[addition]], and [[multiplication]], and some distributivity assumptions. A prominent example of a field is the field of [[rational number]]s, commonly denoted '''Q''', together with its usual operations of addition and multiplication.\n\nAnother notion needed to define algebraic number fields is [[vector space]]s. To the extent needed here, vector spaces can be thought of as consisting of sequences (or [[tuple]]s)\n:(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...)\nwhose entries are elements of a fixed field, such as the field '''Q'''. Any two such sequences can be added by adding the entries one per one. Furthermore, any sequence can be multiplied by a single element ''c'' of the fixed field. These two operations known as [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]] satisfy a number of properties that serve to define vector spaces abstractly. Vector spaces are allowed to be \"infinite-dimensional\", that is to say that the sequences constituting the vector spaces are of infinite length. If, however, the vector space consists of ''finite'' sequences\n:(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>),\nthe vector space is said to be of finite [[Hamel dimension|dimension]], ''n''.\n\n===<span id=\"degreeofanumberfield\"></span> Definition ===\n\nAn '''algebraic number field''' (or simply '''number field''') is a finite-[[degree of a field extension|degree]] [[field extension]] of the field of rational numbers. Here '''degree''' means the dimension of the field as a vector space over '''Q'''.\n\n==Examples==\n\n* The smallest and most basic number field is the field '''Q''' of rational numbers. Many properties of general number fields are modeled after the properties of '''Q'''.\n* The [[Gaussian rational]]s, denoted '''Q'''(''i'') (read as \"'''Q''' [[Adjunction (field theory)|adjoined]] ''i''\"), form the first nontrivial example of a number field. Its elements are expressions of the form\n\n::''a''+''bi''\n\n: where both ''a'' and ''b'' are rational numbers and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. Such expressions may be added, subtracted, and multiplied according to the usual rules of arithmetic and then simplified using the identity\n\n::''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121.\n\n: Explicitly,\n\n:: (''a'' + ''bi'') + (''c'' + ''di'') = (''a'' + ''c'') + (''b'' + ''d'')''i'',\n:: (''a'' + ''bi'') (''c'' + ''di'') = (''ac'' \u2212 ''bd'') + (''ad'' + ''bc'')''i''.\n\n: Non-zero Gaussian rational numbers are [[invertible]], which can be seen from the identity\n\n::<math>(a+bi)\\left(\\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}-\\frac{b}{a^2+b^2}i\\right)=\\frac{(a+bi)(a-bi)}{a^2+b^2}=1.</math>\n\n: It follows that the Gaussian rationals form a number field which is two-dimensional as a vector space over '''Q'''.\n\n* More generally, for any [[square-free]] integer ''d'', the [[quadratic field]]\n\n:: '''Q'''(\u221a{{overline|''d''}})\n\n: is a number field obtained by adjoining the square root of ''d'' to the field of rational numbers. Arithmetic operations in this field are defined in analogy with the case of gaussian rational numbers, ''d'' = \u2212 1.\n\n* [[Cyclotomic field]]\n\n:: '''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>), &nbsp; \u03b6<sub>''n''</sub> = exp (2\u03c0''i'' / ''n'')\n\n: is a number field obtained from '''Q''' by adjoining a primitive ''n''th root of unity ''\u03b6''<sub>''n''</sub>. This field contains all complex ''n''th roots of unity and its dimension over '''Q''' is equal to ''\u03c6''(''n''), where ''\u03c6'' is the [[Euler totient function]].\n\n* The [[real number]]s, '''R''', and the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', are fields which have infinite dimension as '''Q'''-vector spaces, hence, they are ''not'' number fields. This follows from the [[uncountable|uncountability]] of '''R''' and '''C''' as sets, whereas every number field is necessarily [[countable]].\n* The set '''Q'''<sup>2</sup> of [[ordered pair]]s of rational numbers, with the entrywise addition and multiplication is a two-dimensional commutative algebra over '''Q'''. However, it is not a field, since it has [[zero divisor]]s:\n\n:(1, 0) \u00b7 (0, 1) = (1 \u00b7 0, 0 \u00b7 1) = (0, 0).\n\n==Algebraicity and ring of integers==\nGenerally, in [[abstract algebra]], a field extension ''F'' / ''E'' is [[algebraic field extension|algebraic]] if every element ''f'' of the bigger field ''F'' is the zero of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients ''e''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub> in ''E'':\n:''p''(''f'') = ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>''f''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''m''\u22121</sub>''f''<sup>''m''\u22121</sup>  + ... + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''f'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0.\nEvery field extension '''of finite degree''' is algebraic (Proof: for ''x'' in ''F'', simply consider 1, ''x'', ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>3</sup>, ... \u2013 we get a linear dependence, i.e. a polynomial that ''x'' is a root of.) because of the finite degree. In particular this applies to algebraic number fields, so any element ''f'' of an algebraic number field ''F'' can be written as a zero of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Therefore, elements of ''F'' are also referred to as ''[[algebraic numbers]]''. Given a polynomial ''p'' such that ''p''(''f'') = 0, it can be arranged such that the leading coefficient ''e''<sub>''m''</sub> is one, by dividing all coefficients by it, if necessary. A polynomial with this property is known as a [[monic polynomial]]. In general it will have rational coefficients. If, however, its coefficients are actually all integers, ''f'' is called an ''[[algebraic integer]]''. Any (usual) integer ''z'' \u2208 '''Z''' is an algebraic integer, as it is the zero of the linear monic polynomial:\n:''p''(''t'') = ''t'' \u2212 ''z''.\nIt can be shown that any algebraic integer that is also a rational number must actually be an integer, hence the name \"algebraic integer\". Again using abstract algebra, specifically the notion of a [[finitely generated module]], it can be shown that the sum and the product of any two algebraic integers is still an algebraic integer.  It follows that the algebraic integers in ''F'' form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] denoted ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> called the '''[[ring of integers]]''' of ''F''. It is a [[subring]] of (that is, a ring contained in) ''F''. A field contains no [[zero divisors]] and this property is inherited by any subring. Therefore, the ring of integers of ''F'' is an [[integral domain]]. The field ''F'' is the [[field of fractions]] of the integral domain ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>.  This way one can get back and forth between the algebraic number field ''F'' and its ring of integers ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. Rings of algebraic integers have three distinctive properties: firstly, ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is an integral domain that is [[integrally closed domain|integrally closed]] in its field of fractions ''F''. Secondly, ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is a [[Noetherian ring]]. Finally, every nonzero [[prime ideal]] of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is [[maximal ideal|maximal]] or, equivalently, the [[Krull dimension]] of this ring is one. An abstract commutative ring with these three properties is called a ''[[Dedekind ring]]'' (or ''Dedekind domain''), in honor of [[Richard Dedekind]], who undertook a deep study of rings of algebraic integers.\n\n===Unique factorization===\nFor general [[Dedekind ring]]s, in particular rings of integers, there is a unique factorization of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] into a product of [[prime ideal]]s. For example, the ideal (6) in '''Z'''[{{radic|\u22125}}] factors into prime ideals as\n: (6) = (2, 1 + {{radic|\u22125}})(2,1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}})(3, 1 + {{radic|\u22125}})(3, 1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}}).\nHowever, unlike '''Z''' as the ring of integers of '''Q''', the ring of integers of a proper extension of '''Q''' need not admit [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization]] of numbers into a product of prime numbers or, more precisely, [[prime element]]s. This happens already for [[quadratic integer]]s, for example in {{nowrap|1=''O''<sub>'''Q'''({{radic|\u22125}})</sub> = '''Z'''[{{radic|\u22125}}]}}, the uniqueness of the factorization fails:\n: 6 = 2 \u22c5 3 = (1 + {{radic|\u22125}}) \u22c5 (1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}}).\nUsing the [[field norm|norm]] it can be shown that these two factorization are actually inequivalent in the sense that the factors do not just differ by a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ''O''<sub>'''Q'''({{radic|\u22125}})</sub>. [[Euclidean domain]]s are unique factorization domains; for example '''Z'''[''i''], the ring of [[Gaussian integer]]s, and '''Z'''[''\u03c9''], the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s, where ''\u03c9'' is a cube root of unity (unequal to 1), have this property.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Ireland | first1=Kenneth | author1-link=Kenneth Ireland | last2=Rosen | first2=Michael | title=A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-97329-6 | year=1998}}, Ch. 1.4</ref>\n\n===\u03b6-functions, ''L''-functions and class number formula===\nThe failure of unique factorization is measured by the [[Class number (number theory)|class number]], commonly denoted ''h'', the cardinality of the so-called [[ideal class group]]. This group is always finite. The ring of integers ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> possesses unique factorization if and only if it is a principal ring or, equivalently, if ''F'' has [[List of number fields with class number one|class number 1]]. Given a number field, the class number is often difficult to compute. The [[class number problem]], going back to [[Gauss]], is concerned with the existence of imaginary quadratic number fields (i.e., '''Q'''(\u221a{{overline|\u2212''d''}}), ''d'' \u2265 1) with prescribed class number. The [[class number formula]] relates ''h'' to other fundamental invariants of ''F''. It involves the [[Dedekind zeta function]] \u03b6<sub>''F''</sub>(s), a function in a complex variable ''s'', defined by\n:<math>\\zeta_F(s) := \\prod_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\frac{1}{1-N(\\mathfrak{p})^{-s}}</math>.\n(The product is over all prime ideals of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, <math>N(\\mathfrak p)</math> denotes the norm of the prime ideal or, equivalently, the (finite) number of elements in the [[residue field]] <math>O_F / \\mathfrak p</math>. The infinite product converges only for [[Real part|Re]](''s'') > 1, in general [[analytic continuation]] and the [[functional equation]] for the zeta-function are needed to define the function for all ''s'').\nThe Dedekind zeta-function generalizes the [[Riemann zeta-function]] in that \u03b6<sub>'''Q'''</sub>(''s'') = \u03b6(''s'').\n\nThe class number formula states that \u03b6<sub>''F''</sub>(''s'') has a [[simple pole]] at ''s'' = 1 and at this point the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]] is given by\n:<math> \\frac{2^{r_1}\\cdot(2\\pi)^{r_2}\\cdot h\\cdot \\operatorname{Reg}}{w \\cdot \\sqrt{|D|}}.</math>\n\nHere ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> classically denote the number of [[real and complex embeddings|real embeddings]] and pairs of [[real and complex embeddings|complex embeddings]] of ''F'', respectively. Moreover, Reg is the [[regulator (mathematics)|regulator]] of ''F'', ''w'' the number of [[root of unity|roots of unity]] in ''F'' and ''D'' is the discriminant of ''F''.\n\n[[Dirichlet L-function]]s ''L''(\u03c7, ''s'') are a more refined variant of \u03b6(''s''). Both types of functions encode the arithmetic behavior of '''Q''' and ''F'', respectively. For example, [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] asserts that in any [[arithmetic progression]]\n:''a'', ''a'' + ''m'', ''a'' + 2''m'', ...\nwith [[coprime]] ''a'' and ''m'', there are infinitely many prime numbers. This theorem is implied by the fact that the Dirichlet ''L''-function is nonzero at ''s'' = 1. Using much more advanced techniques including [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[Tamagawa measure]]s, modern number theory deals with a description, if largely conjectural (see [[Tamagawa number conjecture]]), of values of more general [[L-function]]s.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Bloch | first1=Spencer | last2=Kato | first2=Kazuya | author2-link=Kazuya Kato | title=The Grothendieck Festschrift, Vol. I | publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston | location=Boston, MA | series=Progr.

It is then also the case that any element of ''F'' can be written uniquely as\n:''m''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''m<sub>n</sub>b<sub>n</sub>'',\nwhere now the ''m<sub>i</sub>'' are rational numbers. The algebraic integers of ''F'' are then precisely those elements of ''F'' where the ''m<sub>i</sub>'' are all integers.\n\nWorking [[local ring|locally]] and using tools such as the [[Frobenius map]], it is always possible to explicitly compute such a basis, and it is now standard for [[computer algebra system]]s to have built-in programs to do this.\n\n===Power basis===\n\nLet ''F'' be a number field of degree ''n''. Among all possible bases of ''F'' (seen as a '''Q'''-vector space), there are particular ones known as [[power basis|power bases]], that are bases of the form\n:''B<sub>x</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{1, ''x'', ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}\nfor some element ''x'' \u2208 ''F''. By the [[primitive element theorem]], there exists such an ''x'', called a [[primitive element (field theory)|primitive element]]. If ''x'' can be chosen in ''O<sub>F</sub>'' and such that ''B<sub>x</sub>'' is a basis of ''O<sub>F</sub>'' as a free '''Z'''-module, then ''B<sub>x</sub>'' is called a [[power integral basis]], and the field ''F'' is called a [[monogenic field]]. An example of a number field that is not monogenic was first given by Dedekind. His example is the field obtained by adjoining a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''x'' \u2212 8}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Narkiewicz|2004|loc=\u00a72.2.6}}</ref>\n\n==Regular representation, trace and determinant==\nUsing the multiplication in ''F'', the elements of the field ''F'' may be represented by ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (math)|matrices]]\n:''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''(''x'')=(''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>1 \u2264 ''i'', ''j'' \u2264 ''n''</sub>,\nby requiring\n:<math>x e_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} e_j, \\quad a_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{Q}.</math>\nHere ''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub> is a fixed basis for ''F'', viewed as a '''Q'''-vector space. The rational numbers ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> are uniquely determined by ''x'' and the choice of a basis since any element of ''F'' can be uniquely represented as a [[linear combination]] of the basis elements. This way of associating a matrix to any element of the field ''F'' is called the ''[[regular representation]]''. The square matrix ''A'' represents the effect of multiplication by ''x'' in the given basis. It follows that if the element ''y'' of ''F'' is represented by a matrix ''B'', then the product ''xy'' is represented by the [[matrix product]] ''BA''. [[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariant]]s of matrices, such as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]], [[determinant]], and [[characteristic polynomial]], depend solely on the field element ''x'' and not on the basis. In particular, the trace of the matrix ''A''(''x'') is called the ''[[field trace|trace]]'' of the field element ''x'' and denoted Tr(''x''), and the determinant is called the ''[[field norm|norm]]'' of ''x'' and denoted N(''x'').\n\nBy definition, standard properties of traces and determinants of matrices carry over to Tr and N: Tr(''x'') is a [[linear function]] of ''x'', as expressed by {{nowrap|Tr(''x'' + ''y'') {{=}} Tr(''x'') + Tr(''y'')}}, {{nowrap|Tr(''\u03bbx'') {{=}} ''\u03bb'' Tr(''x'')}}, and the norm is a multiplicative [[homogeneous function]] of degree ''n'': {{nowrap|N(''xy'') {{=}} N(''x'') N(''y'')}}, {{nowrap|N(''\u03bbx'') {{=}} ''\u03bb''<sup>''n''</sup> N(''x'')}}. Here ''\u03bb'' is a rational number, and ''x'', ''y'' are any two elements of ''F''.\n\nThe ''[[trace form]]'' derives is a [[bilinear form]] defined by means of the trace, as Tr(''x'' ''y''). The ''integral trace form'', an integer-valued [[symmetric matrix]] is defined as ''t''<sub>ij</sub> = Tr(''b''<sub>i</sub>''b''<sub>j</sub>), where ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>n</sub> is an integral basis for ''F''. The [[discriminant of an algebraic number field|''discriminant'']] of ''F'' is defined as det(''t''). It is an integer, and is an invariant property of the field ''F'', not depending on the choice of integral basis.\n\nThe matrix associated to an element ''x'' of ''F'' can also be used to give other, equivalent descriptions of algebraic integers. An element ''x'' of ''F'' is an algebraic integer if and only if the characteristic polynomial ''p''<sub>''A''</sub> of the matrix ''A'' associated to ''x'' is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.  Suppose that the matrix ''A'' that represents an element ''x'' has integer entries in some basis ''e''. By the [[Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem]], ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''A'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and it follows that ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, so that ''x'' is an algebraic integer. Conversely, if ''x'' is an element of ''F'' which is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients then the same property holds for the corresponding matrix ''A''. In this case it can be proven that ''A'' is an [[integer matrix]] in a suitable basis of ''F''. The property of being an algebraic integer is ''defined'' in a way that is independent of a choice of a basis in ''F''.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider ''F'' = '''Q'''(''x''), where ''x'' satisfies ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;11''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 = 0. Then an integral basis is [1, ''x'', 1/2(''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)], and the corresponding integral trace form is\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 11 & 61 \\\\\n11 & 119 & 653 \\\\\n61 & 653 & 3589\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe \"3\" in the upper left hand corner of this matrix is the trace of the matrix of the map defined by the first basis element (1) in the regular representation of F on F. This basis element induces the identity map on the 3-dimensional vector space, F. The trace of the matrix of the identity map on a 3-dimensional vector space is 3.\n\nThe determinant of this is {{nowrap|1304 {{=}} 2<sup>3</sup>\u00b7163}}, the field discriminant; in comparison the [[discriminant|root discriminant]], or discriminant of the polynomial, is {{nowrap|5216 {{=}} 2<sup>5</sup>\u00b7163}}.\n\n==Places==\n\nMathematicians of the nineteenth century assumed that algebraic numbers were a type of complex number.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Kleiner | first = Israel\n | doi = 10.2307/2589500\n | issue = 7\n | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly\n | mr = 1720431\n | pages = 677\u2013684\n | quote = To Dedekind, then, fields were subsets of the complex numbers.\n | title = Field theory: from equations to axiomatization.

Essentially, an absolute value is a notion to measure the size of elements ''f'' of ''F''. Two such absolute values are considered equivalent if they give rise to the same notion of smallness (or proximity). In general, they fall into three regimes. Firstly (and mostly irrelevant), the trivial absolute value | |<sub>0</sub>, which takes the value 1 on all non-zero ''f'' in ''F''. The second and third classes are Archimedean places and non-Archimedean (or ultrametric) places. The completion of ''F'' with respect to a place is given in both cases by taking [[Cauchy sequence]]s in ''F'' and dividing out [[null sequence]]s, that is, sequences (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2208 '''N'''</sub> such that |''x''<sub>''n''</sub>| tends to zero when ''n'' tends to infinity. This can be shown to be a field again, the so-called completion of ''F'' at the given place.\n\nFor ''F'' = '''Q''', the following non-trivial norms occur ([[Ostrowski's theorem]]): the (usual) [[absolute value]], which gives rise to the complete [[topological field]] of the real numbers '''R'''. On the other hand, for any prime number ''p'', the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] absolute values is defined by\n:|''q''|<sub>''p''</sub> = ''p''<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>, where ''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> ''a''/''b'' and ''a'' and ''b'' are integers not divisible by ''p''.\nIn contrast to the usual absolute value, the ''p''-adic norm gets ''smaller'' when ''q'' is multiplied by ''p'', leading to quite different behavior of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> vis-\u00e0-vis '''R'''.\n\n===Archimedean places===\n\nThe standard notation ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> for the number of real and complex embeddings is used, respectively (see below).\n\nCalculating the archimedean places of ''F'' is done as follows: let ''x'' be a primitive element of ''F'', with minimal polynomial ''f'' (over '''Q'''). Over '''R''', ''f'' will generally no longer be irreducible, but its irreducible (real) factors are either of degree one or two. Since there are no repeated roots, there are no repeated factors. The roots ''r'' of factors of degree one are necessarily real, and replacing ''x'' by ''r'' gives an embedding of ''F'' into '''R'''; the number of such embeddings is equal to the number of real roots of ''f''. Restricting the standard absolute value on '''R''' to ''F'' gives an archimedean absolute value on ''F''; such an absolute value is also referred to as a ''real place'' of ''F''.  On the other hand, the roots of factors of degree two are pairs of [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] complex numbers, which allows for two conjugate embeddings into '''C'''. Either one of this pair of embeddings can be used to define an absolute value on ''F'', which is the same for both embeddings since they are conjugate. This absolute value is called a ''complex place'' of ''F''.<ref>Cohn, Chapter 11 \u00a7C p.&nbsp;108</ref><ref>Conrad</ref>\n\nIf all roots of ''f'' above are real (respectively, complex) or, equivalently, any possible embedding ''F'' \u2282 '''C''' is actually forced to be inside '''R''' (resp. '''C'''), ''F'' is called [[Totally real number field|totally real]] (resp. [[Totally complex number field|totally complex]]).<ref>Cohn, Chapter 11 \u00a7C p.&nbsp;108</ref><ref>Conrad</ref>\n\n===Non-Archimedean or ultrametric places===\nTo find the non-Archimedean places, let again ''f'' and ''x'' be as above. In '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, ''f'' splits in factors of various degrees, none of which are repeated, and the degrees of which add up to ''n'', the degree of ''f''. For each of these ''p''-adically irreducible factors ''t'', we may suppose that ''x'' satisfies ''t'' and obtain an embedding of ''F'' into an algebraic extension of finite degree over '''Q'''<sub>p</sub>. Such a [[local field]] behaves in many ways like a number field, and the ''p''-adic numbers may similarly play the role of the rationals; in particular, we can define the norm and trace in exactly the same way, now giving functions mapping to '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>. By using this ''p''-adic norm map '''N'''<sub>''t''</sub> for the place ''t'', we may define an absolute value corresponding to a given ''p''-adically irreducible factor ''t'' of degree ''m'' by |\u03b8|<sub>''t''</sub> = |'''N'''<sub>''t''</sub>(\u03b8)|<sub>''p''</sub><sup>1/''m''</sup>.  Such an absolute value is called an [[ultrametric]], non-Archimedean or ''p''-adic place of ''F''.\n\nFor any ultrametric place ''v'' we have that |''x''|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 1 for any ''x'' in ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, since the minimal polynomial for ''x'' has integer factors, and hence its ''p''-adic factorization has factors in '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>.  Consequently, the norm term (constant term) for each factor is a ''p''-adic integer, and one of these is the integer used for defining the absolute value for ''v''.\n\n===Prime ideals in ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>===\nFor an ultrametric place ''v'', the subset of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> defined by |''x''|<sub>''v''</sub> < 1 is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''P'' of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. This relies on the ultrametricity of ''v'': given ''x'' and ''y'' in ''P'', then\n:|''x'' + ''y''|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 max (|''x''|<sub>''v''</sub>, |y|<sub>''v''</sub>) < 1.\nActually, ''P'' is even a [[prime ideal]].\n\nConversely, given a prime ideal ''P'' of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, a [[discrete valuation]] can be defined by setting v<sub>''P''</sub>(''x'') = ''n'' where ''n'' is the biggest integer such that ''x'' \u2208 ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>, the ''n''-fold power of the ideal. This valuation can be turned into an ultrametric place. Under this correspondence, (equivalence classes) of ultrametric places of ''F'' correspond to prime ideals of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. For '''F''' = '''Q''', this gives back Ostrowski's theorem: any prime ideal in '''Z''' (which is necessarily by a single prime number) corresponds to a non-Archimedean place and vice versa. However, for more general number fields, the situation becomes more involved, as will be explained below.\n\nYet another, equivalent way of describing ultrametric places is by means of [[localization of a ring|localizations]] of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. Given an ultrametric place ''v'' on a number field ''F'', the corresponding localization is the subring ''T'' of ''F'' of all elements ''x'' such that |\u2009''x''\u2009|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 1. By the ultrametric property ''T'' is a ring. Moreover, it contains ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. For every element ''x'' of ''F'', at least one of ''x'' or ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> is contained in ''T''.  Actually, since ''F''<sup>\u00d7</sup>/''T''<sup>\u00d7</sup> can be shown to be isomorphic to the integers, ''T'' is a [[discrete valuation ring]], in particular a [[local ring]]. Actually, ''T'' is just the localization of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> at the prime ideal ''P''. Conversely, ''P'' is the maximal ideal of ''T''.\n\nAltogether, there is a three-way equivalence between ultrametric absolute values, prime ideals, and localizations on a number field.\n\n==Ramification==\n[[Image:Schematic depiction of ramification.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schematic depiction of ramification: the fibers of almost all points in ''Y'' below consist of three points, except for two points in ''Y'' marked with dots, where the fibers consist of one and two points (marked in black), respectively. The map ''f'' is said to be ramified in these points of ''Y''.]]\n[[Ramification (mathematics)|Ramification]], generally speaking, describes a geometric phenomenon that can occur with finite-to-one maps (that is, maps ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' such that the [[preimage]]s of all points ''y'' in ''Y'' consist only of finitely many points): the cardinality of the [[fiber (mathematics)|fibers]] ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''y'') will generally have the same number of points, but it occurs that, in special points ''y'', this number drops. For example, the map\n:'''C''' \u2192 '''C''', ''z'' \u21a6 ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>\nhas ''n'' points in each fiber over ''t'', namely the ''n'' (complex) roots of ''t'', except in t = ''0'', where the fiber consists of only one element, ''z'' = 0. One says that the map is \"ramified\" in zero. This is an example of a [[branched covering]] of [[Riemann surface]]s. This intuition also serves to define [[splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|ramification in algebraic number theory]]. Given a (necessarily finite) extension of number fields ''F'' / ''E'', a prime ideal ''p'' of ''O''<sub>''E''</sub> generates the ideal ''pO''<sub>''F''</sub> of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. This ideal may or may not be a prime ideal, but, according to the Lasker\u2013Noether theorem (see above), always is given by\n:''pO''<sub>''F''</sub> = ''q''<sub>1</sub><sup>''e''<sub>1</sub></sup> ''q''<sub>2</sub><sup>''e''<sub>2</sub></sup> ... ''q''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>''e''<sub>''m''</sub></sup>\nwith uniquely determined prime ideals ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> and numbers (called ramification indices) ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>. Whenever one ramification index is bigger than one, the prime ''p'' is said to ramify in ''F''.\n\nThe connection between this definition and the geometric situation is delivered by the map of [[spectrum of a ring|spectra]] of rings Spec ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> \u2192 Spec ''O''<sub>''E''</sub>. In fact, [[unramified morphism]]s of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s in [[algebraic geometry]] are a direct generalization of unramified extensions of number fields.\n\nRamification is a purely local property, i.e., depends only on the completions around the primes ''p'' and ''q''<sub>''i''</sub>. The [[inertia group]] measures the difference between the local Galois groups at some place and the Galois groups of the involved finite residue fields.\n\n===An example===\n\nThe following example illustrates the notions introduced above. In order to compute the ramification index of '''Q'''(''x''), where\n\n:''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1 = 0,\n\nat 23, it suffices to consider the field extension '''Q'''<sub>23</sub>(''x'') / '''Q'''<sub>23</sub>. Up to 529 = 23<sup>2</sup> (i.e., [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 529) ''f'' can be factored as\n:''f''(''x'') = (''x'' + 181)(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 181''x'' \u2212 38) = ''gh''.\n\nSubstituting {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''y'' + 10}} in the first factor ''g'' modulo 529 yields ''y'' + 191, so the valuation |\u2009''y''\u2009|<sub>''g''</sub> for ''y'' given by ''g'' is |\u2009\u2212191\u2009|<sub>23</sub> = 1. On the other hand, the same substitution in ''h'' yields {{nowrap|''y''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 161''y'' \u2212 161 modulo 529.}} Since 161 = 7\u2009\u00d7\u200923,\n\n:|''y''|<sub>''h''</sub> = \u221a{{overline|\u2223161\u2223<sub>23</sub>}} = 1 / \u221a{{overline|23}}.\n\nSince possible values for the absolute value of the place defined by the factor ''h'' are not confined to integer powers of 23, but instead are integer powers of the square root of 23, the ramification index of the field extension at 23 is two.\n\nThe valuations of any element of ''F'' can be computed in this way using [[resultant]]s. If, for example ''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1, using the resultant to eliminate ''x'' between this relationship and ''f'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1 = 0 gives {{nowrap|''y''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 5''y''<sup>2</sup> + 4''y'' \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}}. If instead we eliminate with respect to the factors ''g'' and ''h'' of ''f'', we obtain the corresponding factors for the polynomial for ''y'', and then the 23-adic valuation applied to the constant (norm) term allows us to compute the valuations of ''y'' for ''g'' and ''h'' (which are both 1 in this instance.)\n\n===Dedekind discriminant theorem===\n\nMuch of the significance of the discriminant lies in the fact that ramified ultrametric places are all places obtained from factorizations in '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> where ''p'' divides the discriminant.  This is even true of the polynomial discriminant; however the converse is also true, that if a prime ''p'' divides the discriminant, then there is a ''p''-place which ramifies. For this converse the field discriminant is needed.  This is the '''Dedekind discriminant theorem'''.  In the example above, the discriminant of the number field '''Q'''(''x'') with ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 = 0 is \u221223, and as we have seen the 23-adic place ramifies.  The Dedekind discriminant tells us it is the only ultrametric place which does.  The other ramified place comes from the absolute value on the complex embedding of ''F''.\n\n==Galois groups and Galois cohomology==\nGenerally in abstract algebra, field extensions ''F'' / ''E'' can be studied by examining the [[Galois group]] Gal(''F'' / ''E''), consisting of field automorphisms of ''F'' leaving ''E'' elementwise fixed. As an example, the Galois group Gal ('''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>) / '''Q''') of the cyclotomic field extension of degree ''n'' (see above) is given by ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>\u00d7</sup>, the group of invertible elements in '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''. This is the first stepstone into [[Iwasawa theory]].\n\nIn order to include all possible extensions having certain properties, the Galois group concept is commonly applied to the (infinite) field extension {{overline|''F''}} / ''F'' of the [[algebraic closure]], leading to the [[absolute Galois group]] ''G'' := Gal({{overline|''F''}}  / ''F'') or just Gal(''F''), and to the extension ''F'' / '''Q'''. The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] links fields in between ''F'' and its algebraic closure and closed subgroups of Gal (''F''). For example, the [[abelianization]] (the biggest abelian quotient) ''G''<sup>ab</sup> of ''G'' corresponds to a field referred to as the maximal [[abelian extension]] ''F''<sup>ab</sup> (called so since any further extension is not abelian, i.e., does not have an abelian Galois group). By the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], the maximal abelian extension of '''Q''' is the extension generated by all [[roots of unity]]. For more general number fields, [[class field theory]], specifically the [[Artin reciprocity law]] gives an answer by describing ''G''<sup>ab</sup> in terms of the [[idele class group]]. Also notable is the [[Hilbert class field]], the maximal abelian unramified field extension of ''F''. It can be shown to be finite over ''F'', its Galois group over ''F'' is isomorphic to the class group of ''F'', in particular its degree equals the class number ''h'' of ''F'' (see above).\n\nIn certain situations, the Galois group [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on other mathematical objects, for example a group. Such a group is then also referred to as a Galois module. This enables the use of [[group cohomology]] for the Galois group Gal(''F''), also known as [[Galois cohomology]], which in the first place measures the failure of exactness of taking Gal(''F'')-invariants, but offers deeper insights (and questions) as well. For example, the Galois group ''G'' of a field extension ''L'' / ''F'' acts on ''L''<sup>\u00d7</sup>, the nonzero elements of ''L''. This Galois module plays a significant role in many arithmetic [[duality (mathematics)|dualities]], such as [[Poitou-Tate duality]]. The [[Brauer group]] of ''F'', originally conceived to classify [[division algebra]]s over ''F'', can be recast as a cohomology group, namely H<sup>2</sup>(Gal (''F''), {{overline|''F''}}<sup>\u00d7</sup>).\n\n==Local-global principle==\nGenerally speaking, the term \"local to global\" refers to the idea that a global problem is first done at a local level, which tends to simplify the questions. Then, of course, the information gained in the local analysis has to be put together to get back to some global statement. For example, the notion of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] reifies that idea in [[topology]] and [[geometry]].\n\n===Local and global fields===\nNumber fields share a great deal of similarity with another class of fields much used in [[algebraic geometry]] known as [[Function field of an algebraic variety|function fields]] of [[algebraic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s. An example is '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>(''T''). They are similar in many respects, for example in that number rings are one-dimensional regular rings, as are the [[coordinate ring]]s (the quotient fields of which is the function field in question) of curves. Therefore, both types of field are called [[global field]]s. In accordance with the philosophy laid out above, they can be studied at a local level first, that is to say, by looking at the corresponding [[local field]]s. For number fields ''F'', the local fields are the  completions of ''F'' at all places, including the archimedean ones (see [[local analysis]]). For function fields, the local fields are completions of the local rings at all points of the curve for function fields.\n\nMany results valid for function fields also hold, at least if reformulated properly, for number fields. However, the study of number fields often poses difficulties and phenomena not encountered in function fields. For example, in function fields, there is no dichotomy into non-archimedean and archimedean places. Nonetheless, function fields often serves as a source of intuition what should be expected in the number field case.\n\n===Hasse principle===\n{{main|Hasse principle}}\nA prototypical question, posed at a global level, is whether some polynomial equation has a solution in ''F''. If this is the case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The [[local-global principle]] or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of ''F'', which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as [[intermediate value theorem]] at the archimedean places and [[p-adic analysis]] at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where [[local class field theory]] is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related to the fact that the Galois groups of the completions ''F''<sub>v</sub> can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of '''Q''' are far less understood.\n\n===Adeles and ideles===\nIn order to assemble local data pertaining to all local fields attached to ''F'', the [[adele ring]] is set up. A multiplicative variant is referred to as [[idele]]s.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Dirichlet's unit theorem]], [[S-unit]]\n*[[Kummer extension]]\n*[[Minkowski's theorem]], [[Geometry of numbers]]\n*[[Chebotarev's density theorem]]\n* [[Ray class group]]\n* [[Decomposition group]]\n* [[Genus field]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{Citation | last1=Cohn | first1=Harvey | title=A Classical Invitation to Algebraic Numbers and Class Fields | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=New York | series=Universitext | year=1988}}\n* [[Keith Conrad|Conrad, Keith]] http://www.math.uconn.edu/~kconrad/blurbs/gradnumthy/unittheorem.pdf\n* {{Citation | last1=Janusz | first1=Gerald J. | title=Algebraic Number Fields | publisher=[[American Mathematical Society]] | location=Providence, R.I. | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8218-0429-2 | year=1996}}\n* Helmut Hasse, ''Number Theory'', Springer ''Classics in Mathematics'' Series (2002)\n* [[Serge Lang]], ''Algebraic Number Theory'', second edition, Springer, 2000\n* Richard A.

Thus ''F'' is a field that contains '''Q''' and has finite [[Hamel dimension|dimension]] when considered as a [[vector space]] over '''Q'''.\n\nThe study of algebraic number fields, and, more generally, of algebraic extensions of the field of rational numbers, is the central topic of [[algebraic number theory]].\n\n==Definition==\n\n===Prerequisites===\n\n{{Main|Field (mathematics)|l1=Field|Vector space}}\nThe notion of algebraic number field relies on the concept of a [[field (mathematics)|field]]. A field consists of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of elements together with two operations, namely [[addition]], and [[multiplication]], and some distributivity assumptions. A prominent example of a field is the field of [[rational number]]s, commonly denoted '''Q''', together with its usual operations of addition and multiplication.\n\nAnother notion needed to define algebraic number fields is [[vector space]]s. To the extent needed here, vector spaces can be thought of as consisting of sequences (or [[tuple]]s)\n:(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ...)\nwhose entries are elements of a fixed field, such as the field '''Q'''. Any two such sequences can be added by adding the entries one per one. Furthermore, any sequence can be multiplied by a single element ''c'' of the fixed field. These two operations known as [[vector addition]] and [[scalar multiplication]] satisfy a number of properties that serve to define vector spaces abstractly. Vector spaces are allowed to be \"infinite-dimensional\", that is to say that the sequences constituting the vector spaces are of infinite length. If, however, the vector space consists of ''finite'' sequences\n:(''x''<sub>1</sub>, ''x''<sub>2</sub>, ..., ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>),\nthe vector space is said to be of finite [[Hamel dimension|dimension]], ''n''.\n\n===<span id=\"degreeofanumberfield\"></span> Definition ===\n\nAn '''algebraic number field''' (or simply '''number field''') is a finite-[[degree of a field extension|degree]] [[field extension]] of the field of rational numbers. Here '''degree''' means the dimension of the field as a vector space over '''Q'''.\n\n==Examples==\n\n* The smallest and most basic number field is the field '''Q''' of rational numbers. Many properties of general number fields are modeled after the properties of '''Q'''.\n* The [[Gaussian rational]]s, denoted '''Q'''(''i'') (read as \"'''Q''' [[Adjunction (field theory)|adjoined]] ''i''\"), form the first nontrivial example of a number field. Its elements are expressions of the form\n\n::''a''+''bi''\n\n: where both ''a'' and ''b'' are rational numbers and ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]]. Such expressions may be added, subtracted, and multiplied according to the usual rules of arithmetic and then simplified using the identity\n\n::''i''<sup>2</sup> = \u22121.\n\n: Explicitly,\n\n:: (''a'' + ''bi'') + (''c'' + ''di'') = (''a'' + ''c'') + (''b'' + ''d'')''i'',\n:: (''a'' + ''bi'') (''c'' + ''di'') = (''ac'' \u2212 ''bd'') + (''ad'' + ''bc'')''i''.\n\n: Non-zero Gaussian rational numbers are [[invertible]], which can be seen from the identity\n\n::<math>(a+bi)\\left(\\frac{a}{a^2+b^2}-\\frac{b}{a^2+b^2}i\\right)=\\frac{(a+bi)(a-bi)}{a^2+b^2}=1.</math>\n\n: It follows that the Gaussian rationals form a number field which is two-dimensional as a vector space over '''Q'''.\n\n* More generally, for any [[square-free]] integer ''d'', the [[quadratic field]]\n\n:: '''Q'''(\u221a{{overline|''d''}})\n\n: is a number field obtained by adjoining the square root of ''d'' to the field of rational numbers. Arithmetic operations in this field are defined in analogy with the case of gaussian rational numbers, ''d'' = \u2212 1.\n\n* [[Cyclotomic field]]\n\n:: '''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>), &nbsp; \u03b6<sub>''n''</sub> = exp (2\u03c0''i'' / ''n'')\n\n: is a number field obtained from '''Q''' by adjoining a primitive ''n''th root of unity ''\u03b6''<sub>''n''</sub>. This field contains all complex ''n''th roots of unity and its dimension over '''Q''' is equal to ''\u03c6''(''n''), where ''\u03c6'' is the [[Euler totient function]].\n\n* The [[real number]]s, '''R''', and the [[complex number]]s, '''C''', are fields which have infinite dimension as '''Q'''-vector spaces, hence, they are ''not'' number fields. This follows from the [[uncountable|uncountability]] of '''R''' and '''C''' as sets, whereas every number field is necessarily [[countable]].\n* The set '''Q'''<sup>2</sup> of [[ordered pair]]s of rational numbers, with the entrywise addition and multiplication is a two-dimensional commutative algebra over '''Q'''. However, it is not a field, since it has [[zero divisor]]s:\n\n:(1, 0) \u00b7 (0, 1) = (1 \u00b7 0, 0 \u00b7 1) = (0, 0).\n\n==Algebraicity and ring of integers==\nGenerally, in [[abstract algebra]], a field extension ''F'' / ''E'' is [[algebraic field extension|algebraic]] if every element ''f'' of the bigger field ''F'' is the zero of a [[polynomial]] with coefficients ''e''<sub>0</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''m''</sub> in ''E'':\n:''p''(''f'') = ''e''<sub>''m''</sub>''f''<sup>''m''</sup> + ''e''<sub>''m''\u22121</sub>''f''<sup>''m''\u22121</sup>  + ... + ''e''<sub>1</sub>''f'' + ''e''<sub>0</sub> = 0.\nIt is a fact that every field extension '''of finite degree''' is algebraic (proof: for ''x'' in ''F'' simply consider 1, ''x'', ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ''x''<sup>3</sup>, ..., we get a linear dependence, i.e. a polynomial that ''x'' is a root of!) because of the finite degree. In particular this applies to algebraic number fields, so any element ''f'' of an algebraic number field ''F'' can be written as a zero of a polynomial with rational coefficients. Therefore, elements of ''F'' are also referred to as ''[[algebraic numbers]]''. Given a polynomial ''p'' such that ''p''(''f'') = 0, it can be arranged such that the leading coefficient ''e''<sub>''m''</sub> is one, by dividing all coefficients by it, if necessary. A polynomial with this property is known as a [[monic polynomial]]. In general it will have rational coefficients. If, however, its coefficients are actually all integers, ''f'' is called an ''[[algebraic integer]]''. Any (usual) integer ''z'' \u2208 '''Z''' is an algebraic integer, as it is the zero of the linear monic polynomial:\n:''p''(''t'') = ''t'' \u2212 ''z''.\nIt can be shown that any algebraic integer that is also a rational number must actually be an integer, hence the name \"algebraic integer\". Again using abstract algebra, specifically the notion of a [[finitely generated module]], it can be shown that the sum and the product of any two algebraic integers is still an algebraic integer.  It follows that the algebraic integers in ''F'' form a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] denoted ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> called the '''[[ring of integers]]''' of ''F''. It is a [[subring]] of (that is, a ring contained in) ''F''. A field contains no [[zero divisors]] and this property is inherited by any subring. Therefore, the ring of integers of ''F'' is an [[integral domain]]. The field ''F'' is the [[field of fractions]] of the integral domain ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>.  This way one can get back and forth between the algebraic number field ''F'' and its ring of integers ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. Rings of algebraic integers have three distinctive properties: firstly, ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is an integral domain that is [[integrally closed domain|integrally closed]] in its field of fractions ''F''. Secondly, ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is a [[Noetherian ring]]. Finally, every nonzero [[prime ideal]] of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> is [[maximal ideal|maximal]] or, equivalently, the [[Krull dimension]] of this ring is one. An abstract commutative ring with these three properties is called a ''[[Dedekind ring]]'' (or ''Dedekind domain''), in honor of [[Richard Dedekind]], who undertook a deep study of rings of algebraic integers.\n\n===Unique factorization===\nFor general [[Dedekind ring]]s, in particular rings of integers, there is a unique factorization of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]] into a product of [[prime ideal]]s. For example, the ideal (6) in '''Z'''[{{radic|\u22125}}] factors into prime ideals as\n: (6) = (2, 1 + {{radic|\u22125}})(2,1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}})(3, 1 + {{radic|\u22125}})(3, 1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}}).\nHowever, unlike '''Z''' as the ring of integers of '''Q''', the ring of integers of a proper extension of '''Q''' need not admit [[unique factorization domain|unique factorization]] of numbers into a product of prime numbers or, more precisely, [[prime element]]s. This happens already for [[quadratic integer]]s, for example in {{nowrap|1=''O''<sub>'''Q'''({{radic|\u22125}})</sub> = '''Z'''[{{radic|\u22125}}]}}, the uniqueness of the factorization fails:\n: 6 = 2 \u22c5 3 = (1 + {{radic|\u22125}}) \u22c5 (1 \u2212 {{radic|\u22125}}).\nUsing the [[field norm|norm]] it can be shown that these two factorization are actually inequivalent in the sense that the factors do not just differ by a [[unit (ring theory)|unit]] in ''O''<sub>'''Q'''({{radic|\u22125}})</sub>. [[Euclidean domain]]s are unique factorization domains; for example '''Z'''[''i''], the ring of [[Gaussian integer]]s, and '''Z'''[''\u03c9''], the ring of [[Eisenstein integer]]s, where ''\u03c9'' is a cube root of unity (unequal to 1), have this property.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Ireland | first1=Kenneth | author1-link=Kenneth Ireland | last2=Rosen | first2=Michael | title=A Classical Introduction to Modern Number Theory | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | isbn=978-0-387-97329-6 | year=1998}}, Ch. 1.4</ref>\n\n===\u03b6-functions, ''L''-functions and class number formula===\nThe failure of unique factorization is measured by the [[Class number (number theory)|class number]], commonly denoted ''h'', the cardinality of the so-called [[ideal class group]]. This group is always finite. The ring of integers ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> possesses unique factorization if and only if it is a principal ring or, equivalently, if ''F'' has [[List of number fields with class number one|class number 1]]. Given a number field, the class number is often difficult to compute. The [[class number problem]], going back to [[Gauss]], is concerned with the existence of imaginary quadratic number fields (i.e., '''Q'''(\u221a{{overline|\u2212''d''}}), ''d'' \u2265 1) with prescribed class number. The [[class number formula]] relates ''h'' to other fundamental invariants of ''F''. It involves the [[Dedekind zeta function]] \u03b6<sub>''F''</sub>(s), a function in a complex variable ''s'', defined by\n:<math>\\zeta_F(s) := \\prod_{\\mathfrak{p}} \\frac{1}{1-N(\\mathfrak{p})^{-s}}</math>.\n(The product is over all prime ideals of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, <math>N(\\mathfrak p)</math> denotes the norm of the prime ideal or, equivalently, the (finite) number of elements in the [[residue field]] <math>O_F / \\mathfrak p</math>. The infinite product converges only for [[Real part|Re]](''s'') > 1, in general [[analytic continuation]] and the [[functional equation]] for the zeta-function are needed to define the function for all ''s'').\nThe Dedekind zeta-function generalizes the [[Riemann zeta-function]] in that \u03b6<sub>'''Q'''</sub>(''s'') = \u03b6(''s'').\n\nThe class number formula states that \u03b6<sub>''F''</sub>(''s'') has a [[simple pole]] at ''s'' = 1 and at this point the [[residue (complex analysis)|residue]] is given by\n:<math> \\frac{2^{r_1}\\cdot(2\\pi)^{r_2}\\cdot h\\cdot \\operatorname{Reg}}{w \\cdot \\sqrt{|D|}}.</math>\n\nHere ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> classically denote the number of [[real and complex embeddings|real embeddings]] and pairs of [[real and complex embeddings|complex embeddings]] of ''F'', respectively. Moreover, Reg is the [[regulator (mathematics)|regulator]] of ''F'', ''w'' the number of [[root of unity|roots of unity]] in ''F'' and ''D'' is the discriminant of ''F''.\n\n[[Dirichlet L-function]]s ''L''(\u03c7, ''s'') are a more refined variant of \u03b6(''s''). Both types of functions encode the arithmetic behavior of '''Q''' and ''F'', respectively. For example, [[Dirichlet's theorem on arithmetic progressions|Dirichlet's theorem]] asserts that in any [[arithmetic progression]]\n:''a'', ''a'' + ''m'', ''a'' + 2''m'', ...\nwith [[coprime]] ''a'' and ''m'', there are infinitely many prime numbers. This theorem is implied by the fact that the Dirichlet ''L''-function is nonzero at ''s'' = 1. Using much more advanced techniques including [[algebraic K-theory]] and [[Tamagawa measure]]s, modern number theory deals with a description, if largely conjectural (see [[Tamagawa number conjecture]]), of values of more general [[L-function]]s.<ref>{{Citation | last1=Bloch | first1=Spencer | last2=Kato | first2=Kazuya | author2-link=Kazuya Kato | title=The Grothendieck Festschrift, Vol. I | publisher=Birkh\u00e4user Boston | location=Boston, MA | series=Progr.

It is then also the case that any element of ''F'' can be written uniquely as\n:''m''<sub>1</sub>''b''<sub>1</sub> + ... + ''m<sub>n</sub>b<sub>n</sub>'',\nwhere now the ''m<sub>i</sub>'' are rational numbers. The algebraic integers of ''F'' are then precisely those elements of ''F'' where the ''m<sub>i</sub>'' are all integers.\n\nWorking [[local ring|locally]] and using tools such as the [[Frobenius map]], it is always possible to explicitly compute such a basis, and it is now standard for [[computer algebra system]]s to have built-in programs to do this.\n\n===Power basis===\n\nLet ''F'' be a number field of degree ''n''. Among all possible bases of ''F'' (seen as a '''Q'''-vector space), there are particular ones known as [[power basis|power bases]], that are bases of the form\n:''B<sub>x</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{1, ''x'', ''x''<sup>2</sup>, ..., ''x''<sup>''n''\u22121</sup>}\nfor some element ''x'' \u2208 ''F''. By the [[primitive element theorem]], there exists such an ''x'', called a [[primitive element (field theory)|primitive element]]. If ''x'' can be chosen in ''O<sub>F</sub>'' and such that ''B<sub>x</sub>'' is a basis of ''O<sub>F</sub>'' as a free '''Z'''-module, then ''B<sub>x</sub>'' is called a [[power integral basis]], and the field ''F'' is called a [[monogenic field]]. An example of a number field that is not monogenic was first given by Dedekind. His example is the field obtained by adjoining a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 2''x'' \u2212 8}}.<ref>{{harvnb|Narkiewicz|2004|loc=\u00a72.2.6}}</ref>\n\n==Regular representation, trace and determinant==\nUsing the multiplication in ''F'', the elements of the field ''F'' may be represented by ''n''-by-''n'' [[matrix (math)|matrices]]\n:''A''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''A''(''x'')=(''a''<sub>''ij''</sub>)<sub>1 \u2264 ''i'', ''j'' \u2264 ''n''</sub>,\nby requiring\n:<math>x e_i = \\sum_{j=1}^n a_{ij} e_j, \\quad a_{ij}\\in\\mathbf{Q}.</math>\nHere ''e''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''e''<sub>''n''</sub> is a fixed basis for ''F'', viewed as a '''Q'''-vector space. The rational numbers ''a''<sub>''ij''</sub> are uniquely determined by ''x'' and the choice of a basis since any element of ''F'' can be uniquely represented as a [[linear combination]] of the basis elements. This way of associating a matrix to any element of the field ''F'' is called the ''[[regular representation]]''. The square matrix ''A'' represents the effect of multiplication by ''x'' in the given basis. It follows that if the element ''y'' of ''F'' is represented by a matrix ''B'', then the product ''xy'' is represented by the [[matrix product]] ''BA''. [[Invariant (mathematics)|Invariant]]s of matrices, such as the [[trace (linear algebra)|trace]], [[determinant]], and [[characteristic polynomial]], depend solely on the field element ''x'' and not on the basis. In particular, the trace of the matrix ''A''(''x'') is called the ''[[field trace|trace]]'' of the field element ''x'' and denoted Tr(''x''), and the determinant is called the ''[[field norm|norm]]'' of ''x'' and denoted N(''x'').\n\nBy definition, standard properties of traces and determinants of matrices carry over to Tr and N: Tr(''x'') is a [[linear function]] of ''x'', as expressed by {{nowrap|Tr(''x'' + ''y'') {{=}} Tr(''x'') + Tr(''y'')}}, {{nowrap|Tr(''\u03bbx'') {{=}} ''\u03bb'' Tr(''x'')}}, and the norm is a multiplicative [[homogeneous function]] of degree ''n'': {{nowrap|N(''xy'') {{=}} N(''x'') N(''y'')}}, {{nowrap|N(''\u03bbx'') {{=}} ''\u03bb''<sup>''n''</sup> N(''x'')}}. Here ''\u03bb'' is a rational number, and ''x'', ''y'' are any two elements of ''F''.\n\nThe ''[[trace form]]'' derives is a [[bilinear form]] defined by means of the trace, as Tr(''x'' ''y''). The ''integral trace form'', an integer-valued [[symmetric matrix]] is defined as ''t''<sub>ij</sub> = Tr(''b''<sub>i</sub>''b''<sub>j</sub>), where ''b''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''b''<sub>n</sub> is an integral basis for ''F''. The [[discriminant of an algebraic number field|''discriminant'']] of ''F'' is defined as det(''t''). It is an integer, and is an invariant property of the field ''F'', not depending on the choice of integral basis.\n\nThe matrix associated to an element ''x'' of ''F'' can also be used to give other, equivalent descriptions of algebraic integers. An element ''x'' of ''F'' is an algebraic integer if and only if the characteristic polynomial ''p''<sub>''A''</sub> of the matrix ''A'' associated to ''x'' is a monic polynomial with integer coefficients.  Suppose that the matrix ''A'' that represents an element ''x'' has integer entries in some basis ''e''. By the [[Cayley\u2013Hamilton theorem]], ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''A'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, and it follows that ''p''<sub>''A''</sub>(''x'')&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, so that ''x'' is an algebraic integer. Conversely, if ''x'' is an element of ''F'' which is a root of a monic polynomial with integer coefficients then the same property holds for the corresponding matrix ''A''. In this case it can be proven that ''A'' is an [[integer matrix]] in a suitable basis of ''F''. The property of being an algebraic integer is ''defined'' in a way that is independent of a choice of a basis in ''F''.\n\n===Example===\n\nConsider ''F'' = '''Q'''(''x''), where ''x'' satisfies ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;11''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 = 0. Then an integral basis is [1, ''x'', 1/2(''x''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)], and the corresponding integral trace form is\n\n:<math>\\begin{bmatrix}\n3 & 11 & 61 \\\\\n11 & 119 & 653 \\\\\n61 & 653 & 3589\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe \"3\" in the upper left hand corner of this matrix is the trace of the matrix of the map defined by the first basis element (1) in the regular representation of F on F. This basis element induces the identity map on the 3-dimensional vector space, F. The trace of the matrix of the identity map on a 3-dimensional vector space is 3.\n\nThe determinant of this is {{nowrap|1304 {{=}} 2<sup>3</sup>\u00b7163}}, the field discriminant; in comparison the [[discriminant|root discriminant]], or discriminant of the polynomial, is {{nowrap|5216 {{=}} 2<sup>5</sup>\u00b7163}}.\n\n==Places==\n\nMathematicians of the nineteenth century assumed that algebraic numbers were a type of complex number.<ref>{{citation\n | last = Kleiner | first = Israel\n | doi = 10.2307/2589500\n | issue = 7\n | journal = The American Mathematical Monthly\n | mr = 1720431\n | pages = 677\u2013684\n | quote = To Dedekind, then, fields were subsets of the complex numbers.\n | title = Field theory: from equations to axiomatization.

Essentially, an absolute value is a notion to measure the size of elements ''f'' of ''F''. Two such absolute values are considered equivalent if they give rise to the same notion of smallness (or proximity). In general, they fall into three regimes. Firstly (and mostly irrelevant), the trivial absolute value | |<sub>0</sub>, which takes the value 1 on all non-zero ''f'' in ''F''. The second and third classes are Archimedean places and non-Archimedean (or ultrametric) places. The completion of ''F'' with respect to a place is given in both cases by taking [[Cauchy sequence]]s in ''F'' and dividing out [[null sequence]]s, that is, sequences (''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)<sub>''n'' \u2208 '''N'''</sub> such that |''x''<sub>''n''</sub>| tends to zero when ''n'' tends to infinity. This can be shown to be a field again, the so-called completion of ''F'' at the given place.\n\nFor ''F'' = '''Q''', the following non-trivial norms occur ([[Ostrowski's theorem]]): the (usual) [[absolute value]], which gives rise to the complete [[topological field]] of the real numbers '''R'''. On the other hand, for any prime number ''p'', the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic]] absolute values is defined by\n:|''q''|<sub>''p''</sub> = ''p''<sup>\u2212''n''</sup>, where ''q'' = ''p''<sup>''n''</sup> ''a''/''b'' and ''a'' and ''b'' are integers not divisible by ''p''.\nIn contrast to the usual absolute value, the ''p''-adic norm gets ''smaller'' when ''q'' is multiplied by ''p'', leading to quite different behavior of '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> vis-\u00e0-vis '''R'''.\n\n===Archimedean places===\n\nThe standard notation ''r''<sub>1</sub> and ''r''<sub>2</sub> for the number of real and complex embeddings is used, respectively (see below).\n\nCalculating the archimedean places of ''F'' is done as follows: let ''x'' be a primitive element of ''F'', with minimal polynomial ''f'' (over '''Q'''). Over '''R''', ''f'' will generally no longer be irreducible, but its irreducible (real) factors are either of degree one or two. Since there are no repeated roots, there are no repeated factors. The roots ''r'' of factors of degree one are necessarily real, and replacing ''x'' by ''r'' gives an embedding of ''F'' into '''R'''; the number of such embeddings is equal to the number of real roots of ''f''. Restricting the standard absolute value on '''R''' to ''F'' gives an archimedean absolute value on ''F''; such an absolute value is also referred to as a ''real place'' of ''F''.  On the other hand, the roots of factors of degree two are pairs of [[complex conjugate|conjugate]] complex numbers, which allows for two conjugate embeddings into '''C'''. Either one of this pair of embeddings can be used to define an absolute value on ''F'', which is the same for both embeddings since they are conjugate. This absolute value is called a ''complex place'' of ''F''.<ref>Cohn, Chapter 11 \u00a7C p.&nbsp;108</ref><ref>Conrad</ref>\n\nIf all roots of ''f'' above are real (respectively, complex) or, equivalently, any possible embedding ''F'' \u2282 '''C''' is actually forced to be inside '''R''' (resp. '''C'''), ''F'' is called [[Totally real number field|totally real]] (resp. [[Totally complex number field|totally complex]]).<ref>Cohn, Chapter 11 \u00a7C p.&nbsp;108</ref><ref>Conrad</ref>\n\n===Non-Archimedean or ultrametric places===\nTo find the non-Archimedean places, let again ''f'' and ''x'' be as above. In '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>, ''f'' splits in factors of various degrees, none of which are repeated, and the degrees of which add up to ''n'', the degree of ''f''. For each of these ''p''-adically irreducible factors ''t'', we may suppose that ''x'' satisfies ''t'' and obtain an embedding of ''F'' into an algebraic extension of finite degree over '''Q'''<sub>p</sub>. Such a [[local field]] behaves in many ways like a number field, and the ''p''-adic numbers may similarly play the role of the rationals; in particular, we can define the norm and trace in exactly the same way, now giving functions mapping to '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub>. By using this ''p''-adic norm map '''N'''<sub>''t''</sub> for the place ''t'', we may define an absolute value corresponding to a given ''p''-adically irreducible factor ''t'' of degree ''m'' by |\u03b8|<sub>''t''</sub> = |'''N'''<sub>''t''</sub>(\u03b8)|<sub>''p''</sub><sup>1/''m''</sup>.  Such an absolute value is called an [[ultrametric]], non-Archimedean or ''p''-adic place of ''F''.\n\nFor any ultrametric place ''v'' we have that |''x''|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 1 for any ''x'' in ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, since the minimal polynomial for ''x'' has integer factors, and hence its ''p''-adic factorization has factors in '''Z'''<sub>''p''</sub>.  Consequently, the norm term (constant term) for each factor is a ''p''-adic integer, and one of these is the integer used for defining the absolute value for ''v''.\n\n===Prime ideals in ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>===\nFor an ultrametric place ''v'', the subset of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> defined by |''x''|<sub>''v''</sub> < 1 is an [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] ''P'' of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. This relies on the ultrametricity of ''v'': given ''x'' and ''y'' in ''P'', then\n:|''x'' + ''y''|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 max (|''x''|<sub>''v''</sub>, |y|<sub>''v''</sub>) < 1.\nActually, ''P'' is even a [[prime ideal]].\n\nConversely, given a prime ideal ''P'' of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>, a [[discrete valuation]] can be defined by setting v<sub>''P''</sub>(''x'') = ''n'' where ''n'' is the biggest integer such that ''x'' \u2208 ''P''<sup>''n''</sup>, the ''n''-fold power of the ideal. This valuation can be turned into an ultrametric place. Under this correspondence, (equivalence classes) of ultrametric places of ''F'' correspond to prime ideals of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. For '''F''' = '''Q''', this gives back Ostrowski's theorem: any prime ideal in '''Z''' (which is necessarily by a single prime number) corresponds to a non-Archimedean place and vice versa. However, for more general number fields, the situation becomes more involved, as will be explained below.\n\nYet another, equivalent way of describing ultrametric places is by means of [[localization of a ring|localizations]] of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. Given an ultrametric place ''v'' on a number field ''F'', the corresponding localization is the subring ''T'' of ''F'' of all elements ''x'' such that |\u2009''x''\u2009|<sub>''v''</sub> \u2264 1. By the ultrametric property ''T'' is a ring. Moreover, it contains ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. For every element ''x'' of ''F'', at least one of ''x'' or ''x''<sup>\u22121</sup> is contained in ''T''.  Actually, since ''F''<sup>\u00d7</sup>/''T''<sup>\u00d7</sup> can be shown to be isomorphic to the integers, ''T'' is a [[discrete valuation ring]], in particular a [[local ring]]. Actually, ''T'' is just the localization of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> at the prime ideal ''P''. Conversely, ''P'' is the maximal ideal of ''T''.\n\nAltogether, there is a three-way equivalence between ultrametric absolute values, prime ideals, and localizations on a number field.\n\n==Ramification==\n[[Image:Schematic depiction of ramification.svg|right|thumb|300px|Schematic depiction of ramification: the fibers of almost all points in ''Y'' below consist of three points, except for two points in ''Y'' marked with dots, where the fibers consist of one and two points (marked in black), respectively. The map ''f'' is said to be ramified in these points of ''Y''.]]\n[[Ramification (mathematics)|Ramification]], generally speaking, describes a geometric phenomenon that can occur with finite-to-one maps (that is, maps ''f'': ''X'' \u2192 ''Y'' such that the [[preimage]]s of all points ''y'' in ''Y'' consist only of finitely many points): the cardinality of the [[fiber (mathematics)|fibers]] ''f''<sup>\u22121</sup>(''y'') will generally have the same number of points, but it occurs that, in special points ''y'', this number drops. For example, the map\n:'''C''' \u2192 '''C''', ''z'' \u21a6 ''z''<sup>''n''</sup>\nhas ''n'' points in each fiber over ''t'', namely the ''n'' (complex) roots of ''t'', except in t = ''0'', where the fiber consists of only one element, ''z'' = 0. One says that the map is \"ramified\" in zero. This is an example of a [[branched covering]] of [[Riemann surface]]s. This intuition also serves to define [[splitting of prime ideals in Galois extensions|ramification in algebraic number theory]]. Given a (necessarily finite) extension of number fields ''F'' / ''E'', a prime ideal ''p'' of ''O''<sub>''E''</sub> generates the ideal ''pO''<sub>''F''</sub> of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub>. This ideal may or may not be a prime ideal, but, according to the Lasker\u2013Noether theorem (see above), always is given by\n:''pO''<sub>''F''</sub> = ''q''<sub>1</sub><sup>''e''<sub>1</sub></sup> ''q''<sub>2</sub><sup>''e''<sub>2</sub></sup> ... ''q''<sub>''m''</sub><sup>''e''<sub>''m''</sub></sup>\nwith uniquely determined prime ideals ''q''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> and numbers (called ramification indices) ''e''<sub>''i''</sub>. Whenever one ramification index is bigger than one, the prime ''p'' is said to ramify in ''F''.\n\nThe connection between this definition and the geometric situation is delivered by the map of [[spectrum of a ring|spectra]] of rings Spec ''O''<sub>''F''</sub> \u2192 Spec ''O''<sub>''E''</sub>. In fact, [[unramified morphism]]s of [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]s in [[algebraic geometry]] are a direct generalization of unramified extensions of number fields.\n\nRamification is a purely local property, i.e., depends only on the completions around the primes ''p'' and ''q''<sub>''i''</sub>. The [[inertia group]] measures the difference between the local Galois groups at some place and the Galois groups of the involved finite residue fields.\n\n===An example===\n\nThe following example illustrates the notions introduced above. In order to compute the ramification index of '''Q'''(''x''), where\n\n:''f''(''x'') = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1 = 0,\n\nat 23, it suffices to consider the field extension '''Q'''<sub>23</sub>(''x'') / '''Q'''<sub>23</sub>. Up to 529 = 23<sup>2</sup> (i.e., [[Modular arithmetic|modulo]] 529) ''f'' can be factored as\n:''f''(''x'') = (''x'' + 181)(''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 181''x'' \u2212 38) = ''gh''.\n\nSubstituting {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} ''y'' + 10}} in the first factor ''g'' modulo 529 yields ''y'' + 191, so the valuation |\u2009''y''\u2009|<sub>''g''</sub> for ''y'' given by ''g'' is |\u2009\u2212191\u2009|<sub>23</sub> = 1. On the other hand, the same substitution in ''h'' yields {{nowrap|''y''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 161''y'' \u2212 161 modulo 529.}} Since 161 = 7\u2009\u00d7\u200923,\n\n:|''y''|<sub>''h''</sub> = \u221a{{overline|\u2223161\u2223<sub>23</sub>}} = 1 / \u221a{{overline|23}}.\n\nSince possible values for the absolute value of the place defined by the factor ''h'' are not confined to integer powers of 23, but instead are integer powers of the square root of 23, the ramification index of the field extension at 23 is two.\n\nThe valuations of any element of ''F'' can be computed in this way using [[resultant]]s. If, for example ''y'' = ''x''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1, using the resultant to eliminate ''x'' between this relationship and ''f'' = ''x''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 ''x'' \u2212 1 = 0 gives {{nowrap|''y''<sup>3</sup> \u2212 5''y''<sup>2</sup> + 4''y'' \u2212 1 {{=}} 0}}. If instead we eliminate with respect to the factors ''g'' and ''h'' of ''f'', we obtain the corresponding factors for the polynomial for ''y'', and then the 23-adic valuation applied to the constant (norm) term allows us to compute the valuations of ''y'' for ''g'' and ''h'' (which are both 1 in this instance.)\n\n===Dedekind discriminant theorem===\n\nMuch of the significance of the discriminant lies in the fact that ramified ultrametric places are all places obtained from factorizations in '''Q'''<sub>''p''</sub> where ''p'' divides the discriminant.  This is even true of the polynomial discriminant; however the converse is also true, that if a prime ''p'' divides the discriminant, then there is a ''p''-place which ramifies. For this converse the field discriminant is needed.  This is the '''Dedekind discriminant theorem'''.  In the example above, the discriminant of the number field '''Q'''(''x'') with ''x''<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 = 0 is \u221223, and as we have seen the 23-adic place ramifies.  The Dedekind discriminant tells us it is the only ultrametric place which does.  The other ramified place comes from the absolute value on the complex embedding of ''F''.\n\n==Galois groups and Galois cohomology==\nGenerally in abstract algebra, field extensions ''F'' / ''E'' can be studied by examining the [[Galois group]] Gal(''F'' / ''E''), consisting of field automorphisms of ''F'' leaving ''E'' elementwise fixed. As an example, the Galois group Gal ('''Q'''(\u03b6<sub>''n''</sub>) / '''Q''') of the cyclotomic field extension of degree ''n'' (see above) is given by ('''Z'''/''n'''''Z''')<sup>\u00d7</sup>, the group of invertible elements in '''Z'''/''n'''''Z'''. This is the first stepstone into [[Iwasawa theory]].\n\nIn order to include all possible extensions having certain properties, the Galois group concept is commonly applied to the (infinite) field extension {{overline|''F''}} / ''F'' of the [[algebraic closure]], leading to the [[absolute Galois group]] ''G'' := Gal({{overline|''F''}}  / ''F'') or just Gal(''F''), and to the extension ''F'' / '''Q'''. The [[fundamental theorem of Galois theory]] links fields in between ''F'' and its algebraic closure and closed subgroups of Gal (''F''). For example, the [[abelianization]] (the biggest abelian quotient) ''G''<sup>ab</sup> of ''G'' corresponds to a field referred to as the maximal [[abelian extension]] ''F''<sup>ab</sup> (called so since any further extension is not abelian, i.e., does not have an abelian Galois group). By the [[Kronecker\u2013Weber theorem]], the maximal abelian extension of '''Q''' is the extension generated by all [[roots of unity]]. For more general number fields, [[class field theory]], specifically the [[Artin reciprocity law]] gives an answer by describing ''G''<sup>ab</sup> in terms of the [[idele class group]]. Also notable is the [[Hilbert class field]], the maximal abelian unramified field extension of ''F''. It can be shown to be finite over ''F'', its Galois group over ''F'' is isomorphic to the class group of ''F'', in particular its degree equals the class number ''h'' of ''F'' (see above).\n\nIn certain situations, the Galois group [[Group action (mathematics)|acts]] on other mathematical objects, for example a group. Such a group is then also referred to as a Galois module. This enables the use of [[group cohomology]] for the Galois group Gal(''F''), also known as [[Galois cohomology]], which in the first place measures the failure of exactness of taking Gal(''F'')-invariants, but offers deeper insights (and questions) as well. For example, the Galois group ''G'' of a field extension ''L'' / ''F'' acts on ''L''<sup>\u00d7</sup>, the nonzero elements of ''L''. This Galois module plays a significant role in many arithmetic [[duality (mathematics)|dualities]], such as [[Poitou-Tate duality]]. The [[Brauer group]] of ''F'', originally conceived to classify [[division algebra]]s over ''F'', can be recast as a cohomology group, namely H<sup>2</sup>(Gal (''F''), {{overline|''F''}}<sup>\u00d7</sup>).\n\n==Local-global principle==\nGenerally speaking, the term \"local to global\" refers to the idea that a global problem is first done at a local level, which tends to simplify the questions. Then, of course, the information gained in the local analysis has to be put together to get back to some global statement. For example, the notion of [[sheaf (mathematics)|sheaves]] reifies that idea in [[topology]] and [[geometry]].\n\n===Local and global fields===\nNumber fields share a great deal of similarity with another class of fields much used in [[algebraic geometry]] known as [[Function field of an algebraic variety|function fields]] of [[algebraic curve]]s over [[finite field]]s. An example is '''F'''<sub>''p''</sub>(''T''). They are similar in many respects, for example in that number rings are one-dimensional regular rings, as are the [[coordinate ring]]s (the quotient fields of which is the function field in question) of curves. Therefore, both types of field are called [[global field]]s. In accordance with the philosophy laid out above, they can be studied at a local level first, that is to say, by looking at the corresponding [[local field]]s. For number fields ''F'', the local fields are the  completions of ''F'' at all places, including the archimedean ones (see [[local analysis]]). For function fields, the local fields are completions of the local rings at all points of the curve for function fields.\n\nMany results valid for function fields also hold, at least if reformulated properly, for number fields. However, the study of number fields often poses difficulties and phenomena not encountered in function fields. For example, in function fields, there is no dichotomy into non-archimedean and archimedean places. Nonetheless, function fields often serves as a source of intuition what should be expected in the number field case.\n\n===Hasse principle===\n{{main|Hasse principle}}\nA prototypical question, posed at a global level, is whether some polynomial equation has a solution in ''F''. If this is the case, this solution is also a solution in all completions. The [[local-global principle]] or Hasse principle asserts that for quadratic equations, the converse holds, as well. Thereby, checking whether such an equation has a solution can be done on all the completions of ''F'', which is often easier, since analytic methods (classical analytic tools such as [[intermediate value theorem]] at the archimedean places and [[p-adic analysis]] at the nonarchimedean places) can be used. This implication does not hold, however, for more general types of equations. However, the idea of passing from local data to global ones proves fruitful in class field theory, for example, where [[local class field theory]] is used to obtain global insights mentioned above. This is also related to the fact that the Galois groups of the completions ''F''<sub>v</sub> can be explicitly determined, whereas the Galois groups of global fields, even of '''Q''' are far less understood.\n\n===Adeles and ideles===\nIn order to assemble local data pertaining to all local fields attached to ''F'', the [[adele ring]] is set up.

It is different from full dresses such as evening dresses, dress suits, and wedding dresses due to having a skirt length of five centimetres below the knee, unlike other full-length dresses. The demi-toilet style is suitable for a simple, casual look. For example, lace could be added to the bottom of the dress when attending banquets or decorate with flowers for an afternoon tea. This kind of dress is lightweight and comfortable, and it is suitable for many ceremonial occasions, including cocktail parties, birthday parties, business meetings, dates, vacations, weddings and so on. It used to serve as a symbol of reputation when well-designed dresses and luxurious accessories directly represented one's elevated status and authority.\n\n== Evolution process ==\nIn the 1920s, demi-toilet first appeared at wine tastings and was described as a skirt at that time. It was a fashionable daytime outfit with long, loose gem-coloured skirt straight to the knee and collocated by a small-cap, gloves and a small handbag. In 1926, Gabrielle [[Coco Chanel|CoCo\u00b7Chanel]] first displayed this skirt on [[Vogue (magazine)|VOGUE]] and aroused public attention on a black dress to a great extent. This dress has only a small amount of diagonal decoration. Vogue magazine called it Chanel's \"Ford T model car\" and predicted the prototype of this modest dress would become essential clothing for all women. \n\nAt the end of the 1920s, the demi-toilet dress was still modelled after the daytime outfit. Yet, it had begun to enter its evolution.\n\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s, all-day dresses were available, and demi-toilet appeared. Black was the most popular colour of this garment. Silk and satin were the most commonly used fabrics, and the length was generally only to the knee. The rise of black dresses was mainly due to two reasons. The first reason was that the black dress was rigorous and straightforward as an office dress, and it looked fashionable and elegant as well when attending a party at night.\nFurthermore, they were usually embellished with faux-diamond buttons and clothing accessories, such as brooches, sequins. And it was suitable enough to appear in evening activities like dance parties, cocktails parties, etc. Moreover, limited to the black and white photography techniques of the time, female stars usually wore black dresses in the movies to avoid the colour distortion of the dress in the film imaging. The Demi-toilet, dress quickly became a symbol of women's freedom of movement, mind, and body at that time and gave people a feeling of carefreeness.\n\nAfter [[World War II]], due to the return of soldiers from foreign countries, the clothing of other nationalities and different fabrics began to enter into Western society. The fashion scene changed considerably. The style of dress became more open, the length of the dress became shorter, the neckline became lower, the body was tighter, and the sleeves were removed. The post-war dresses had become more eye-catching and glamorous with more reflective sequins and shiny embroidery. People thought that the shinier of clothes, the better.\n\nIn the late 1940s, [[Christian Dior (fashion house)|Christian Dior]] was the first to introduce the word 'Demi-toilet' to describe the trend of dress at the time. A slightly exaggerated hat, along with [[Opera gloves|long elbow gloves]], a small chain bag with a flash powder box, and shoes that matched the colour of the handbag, were the most popular style at the cocktail party. This tradition continued into the 1960s.\n\nIn the 1960s, the colour became relatively lighter, and pastel, silver, and gold instead of black became the main colour of the dress. The decorations on the dress were reduced. Since cocktail parties became less popular, most people stayed at home at night. So by the end of the 1960s, more and more women started to wear a simple dress in daily life. Home-made dresses started to replace demi-toilet dresses with fancy decorations. However, the design of the dresses still followed the trend of the time.\n\nIn the 1970s, the casual style was born, and loose jumpsuits and pants replaced the dresses.\n\nIn the 1980s, after the casual trend, demi-toilet once again became popular, usually with satin as the fabric and decorated with lace.\n\nIn the 1990s, demi-toilet became more and more popular. People started to wear it on formal occasions. For example, some Hollywood actresses wore it on the red carpet and leaders wore it to give speeches to the public. Since then, fashion designers of various brands had re-launched a collection of demi-toilet dresses that had been ignored for several decades.\n\n== Modern Characteristic ==\nToday, demi-toilet dresses are a must-have for most brands of fashion collections. Significant changes in the style of dresses through history have evolved into a variety of styles that are emerging today. These kinds of dresses lead the fashion trend, let the girls have beautiful dresses, embellished with elegant temperament. Demi-toilet brings women not only noble temperament and elegant femininity, but also a symbol of taste and status, which is popular among women.\n\nNowadays, the style of the demi-toilet is diverse, with court retro, ethnic style, elegant sweetness, British aristocrats, garden girls, rock style, goddess style, exotic style, civilian fashion and so on. These styles are also novel and unique, including tube top skirts, suspender skirts, slanted skirts, waist skirts, tank tops, mini skirts, cake skirts, fishtail skirts, skirts, pleated skirts, tube skirts and more. In addition, materials such as chiffon, cotton, lace, silk, wool, linen, satin, denim, and leather are used.\n\n== Style Categories ==\n\n=== Princess pattern<ref>{{Cite book|title=The complete costume dictionary|last=Lewandowski, Elizabeth J., 1960-|others=Lewandowski, Dan|isbn=9780810840041|location=Lanham, Maryland|oclc=694238143|year = 2011}}</ref> ===\nThe princess dress has many different styles, such as a tube top and a sling.

Based on the geometric relationship arising from the angles of the roller contact surfaces of the wedge-shaped locking piece locking piece and the barrel extension recesses, the rearward motion of the bolt head is delayed by a predetermined ratio. Thus during the same period of time, the bolt head carrier moves significantly faster than the bolt head by the predetermined ratio. This ratio is continued until the locking rollers have been withdrawn from the barrel extension recesses. After the rollers retract entirely behind the bolt head, the locking recesses of the barrel extension are cleared, and all parts continue moving rearward together, opening the breech and actuating the extraction and feeding cycles. The chamber is opened under high pressure, thus the chamber received a series of flutes in order to increase extraction reliability and prevent sticking of the spent casing to the chamber walls.\n\nLike the G3 and G33 bolts the HK41 bolt features an anti-bounce mechanism that prevents the bolt from bouncing off the barrel's breech surface. The \"bolt head locking lever\" is a spring-loaded claw mounted on the bolt carrier that grabs the bolt head as the bolt carrier group goes into battery. The lever essentially ratchets into place with friction, providing enough resistance to being re-opened that the bolt carrier does not rebound. The spring-powered claw extractor is also contained inside the bolt while the lever ejector is located inside the trigger housing (actuated by the recoiling bolt).\n\n===Features===\nThe G41 [[receiver (firearms)|receiver]] is [[Stamping (metalworking)|stamped]] from a smooth {{convert|1.0|mm|abbr=on|2}} [[Sheet metal|sheet]] of high-tensile [[steel]] rather than the {{convert|1.2|mm|abbr=on|2}} thick sheet steel used by the HK33.\n\nThe HK41 also had a redesigned bolt assembly. It was designed around 5.56\u00d745mm NATO ammunition with revised geometries between the bolt mechanism components to work with NATO STANAG magazines. It could also use older .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm M193 ammunition.\nThe reliable functioning of roller-delayed blowback mechanisms is limited by specific ammunition and arm parameters like bullet weight, propellant charge, barrel length and amount of wear. For obtaining a proper and safe functioning parameters bandwith arms Heckler & Koch offer a variety of locking pieces with different mass and shoulder angles. The angles are critical and determine the unlock timing and pressure curve progression as the locking pieces act in unison with the bolt head carrier.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sd8FrUe8fMM How Does It Work: Roller Delayed Blowback]</ref><ref>[http://firearmshistory.blogspot.com/2010/08/actions-blowback-action-roller-delayed.html Actions: Blowback Action: Roller Delayed Blowback ]</ref><ref>[https://www.internationalsportsman.com/how-roller-delayed-firearms-work-and-why-it-matters/ How Roller-Delayed Firearms Work and Why it Matters]</ref>\nThe HK41 bolt assembly is lighter than the G33 bolt assembly. The redesigned bolt was paired with a new recoil spring which consisted of five wound strands around a central coil. This reduced recoil.\n\nThe revised buttstock on the G41 is held in place by two pins. Unlike the earlier HK33, the G41\u2019s pistol grip assembly is not retained by a pin at the front of the assembly behind the magazine well housing and can be removed by the user during a field strip.\n\nThe spent cartridge casing extractor is installed inside the bolt head, while the tilting lever ejector is contained in the trigger housing. The rifle is hammer-fired and has a trigger group with a fire control selector that enables selecting safe, semi-automatic, burst and continuous fire modes. The fire selector's positions are marked with bullet [[pictogram]]s and it also serves as a manual safety against unintentional discharge. The selector is ambidextrous and its lever is mirrored on both sides of the trigger housing. In the \"safe\" position, the trigger and sear are disabled.\n\nThe G41 uses NATO [[STANAG magazine]]s (from the [[M16 rifle]]) with a capacity of 30 rounds. The magazine release is located on the left side of the rifle, above the magazine well.\n\nThe weapon incorporates a manual [[forward assist]] that can be used to positively close the bolt, similar to the one used on the American [[M16_rifle#XM16E1_and_M16A1_(Colt_Model_603)|M16A1]] rifle, and a side-folding heavy-gauge wire carrying handle near its point of balnce which resembles that of the [[FN FAL]]. It also has a \"hold-open\" bolt catch which holds the bolt open after the last round in the magazine has been fired (the bolt release button is just above the magazine release) and has a spring-loaded polymer dust cover that seals the ejection port from debris.\n\nDespite reducing the weight of some components the weight of the HK41 exceeded the weight of the preceeding G33, making the HK41 relatively heavy compared to other 5.56\u00d745mm NATO chambered assault rifles of its era.\n\n===Barrel===\nThe cold hammer-forged barrel has a hexagonal [[polygonal rifling|polygonal]] bore. It comes rifled for either the NATO-standard, Belgian SS109 62 grain bullet with a twist of 178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) or in a 305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) twist for use with American .223 Remington/5.56\u00d745mm ammunition with the M193 55 grain projectile. The bore chamber is fluted to assist in the extraction of spent cartridges.<ref name=\"wo\u017aniak\" /> The barrel is equipped with a [[flash suppressor]] that is also designed to launch [[rifle grenade]]s.\n\n===Sights===\n[[File:Heckler & Koch rotating drum sight pictures.png|thumb|''Drehvisier'' rotating drum sight pictures]]\n\nThe firearm is equipped with a relatively low [[iron sight]] line that consists of a ''Drehvisier'' a rotary rear drum and hooded front post. The rear sight is mechanically adjustable for both windage and elevation with the help of tools. This deliberately prevents non-armorers to (re)zero the iron sight line. The rotary drum features an open V-notch (numbered 1) for rapid target acquisition, close range, low light and impaired visibility use and three apertures (numbered 2, 3 and 4) used for: {{convert|200|-|400|m|yd|0}} in {{convert|100|m|yd|0}} increments for more precise aiming. The 1 V-notch and 2 or {{convert|200|m|yd|0}} aperture settings have an identical point of aim. The V-notch and apertures are calibrated for [[5.56\u00d745mm NATO]] ball ammunition.\n\nThe [[Receiver (firearms)|receiver]] housing has a NATO pattern optics mount (meeting [[Picatinny rail|STANAG 2324]]) that replaced HK\u2019s claw-mount system sed to mount day (typically the Hensoldt 4\u00d724 telescopic sight) or night aiming optics.\nThe Hensoldt Fero 4\u00d724 [[telescopic sight]] and mount assembly were developed for designated marksman use.

It also uses the [[bayonet]] from the G3. It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.

It also can mount the '''FERO Z24-G 4\u00d724''' optical sight on a proprietary detachable bracket on the receiver and a clip-on winter trigger.\n\nThe G41 can also mount a detachable [[40 mm]] [[Heckler & Koch HK69A1|HK79]] [[grenade launcher]] that replaces the synthetic forearm. The weapon in this configuration is known as the '''G41TGS''', or '''''\"Tactical Group Support\"'''''.\n\n==Variants==\nNote: the 1:178mm (1:7 in) rifling was compatible with the European-standard SS109 round and the 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling was compatible with the US-standard M193 Ball round.\n*'''G41''': This is the standard model with a fixed stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A1''': This model has a fixed stock and 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A2''': This model has a telescoping shoulder stock and 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling.\n*'''G41A3''': This model features a telescopic stock and a 1:305&nbsp;mm (1:12 in) rifling pitch.\n*'''G41K''': This is a [[carbine]] (K\u2014''Karabiner'') variant of the G41A2 with a shortened {{convert|380|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} barrel (reduced in length to the base of the foresight), 1:178&nbsp;mm (1:7 in) rifling twist rate and a telescopic stock. The G41K is too short to accept the HK79 or fire rifle grenades.\n*'''G41TGS''': The \"Tactical Group Support\" model adds a HK79 [[grenade launcher]].\n*'''LF G41''': [[Luigi Franchi]] made a sample run of the G41, G41A2 and G41K in 1988 for possible production under license; these were later modified for trials by the Italian Army. It differed from the Heckler & Koch model in that it had a polygonal 4-groove barrel with a chromed bore. When the G41 was rejected by the German [[Bundeswehr]] in 1989, it was dropped from consideration and the improved [[Beretta AR70/90]] was chosen instead in 1990. The LF G41 however entered use with the [[Italian commando frogmen]] (COMSUBIN).\n*'''LF Mod. 641''': A modified variant of the G41 also intended to replace the BM59. It lost out to the AR70/90.\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only. Please do not add entries into this list without a citation from a reliable source.
