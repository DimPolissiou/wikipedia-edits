The [[Anacapa Island Archeological District]] is a {{convert|700|acre|adj=on}} [[historic district (United States)|historic district]] that was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] (NRHP) in 1979.\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\nHistorically, the northern islands were occupied by the island [[Chumash people|Chumash]], while the southern islands were occupied by the [[Tongva people|Tongva]].\n\nThe earliest known Chumash village site has been discovered on Santa Rosa Island. It belongs to the period around 7,500 BP. Soon after, the population density on the islands\nbegins to rise. Significant increase in fish and marine mammal exploitation has been observed.<ref name=\"Park Timeline NPS\"/>\n\nAround 2,500 BP (500 BC), there was significant evolution in technology and increasing reliance on fishing. The circular shell fishhooks were increasingly used. Mortars and pestles were manufactured on San Miguel Island for trade with the mainland.\n\nA new type of boat, ''Tomol'' (frameless, planked canoe) appeared on the islands around 1,500 BP (500 AD). Also, bow and arrows were introduced at that time.\n\nAuthor [[Scott O'Dell]] wrote about the indigenous peoples living on the island in his novel ''[[Island of the Blue Dolphins]]''. [[Aleut]] hunters visited the islands to hunt otters in the early 1800s. The Aleuts purportedly clashed with the native Chumash, killing many over trading disputes. Aleut interactions with the natives were also detailed in O'Dell's book.<ref name=\"Park Timeline NPS\">{{cite web|title=Park Timeline|url=http://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/historyculture/upload/Park-Timeline-2012v.pdf|website=National Park Service|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=5 May 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Chumash and Tongva were removed from the islands in the early 19th century and taken to [[Mission Indians|Spanish missions]] and pueblos on the adjacent mainland. For a century, the Channel Islands were used primarily for ranching and fishing activities, which had significant impacts on island ecosystems, including the local extinction of sea otters, bald eagles, and other species.

It belongs to the period around 7,500 BP. Soon after, the population density on the islands\nbegins to rise. Significant increase in fish and marine mammal exploitation has been observed.<ref name=\"Park Timeline NPS\"/>\n\nAround 2,500 BP (500 BC), there was significant evolution in technology and increasing reliance on fishing. The circular shell fishhooks were increasingly used. Mortars and pestles were manufactured on San Miguel Island for trade with the mainland.\n\nA new type of boat, ''Tomol'' (frameless, planked canoe) appeared on the islands around 1,500 BP (500 AD). Also, bow and arrows were introduced at that time.\n\nAuthor [[Scott O'Dell]] wrote about the indigenous peoples living on the island in his novel ''[[Island of the Blue Dolphins]]''. [[Aleut]] hunters visited the islands to hunt otters in the early 1800s. The Aleuts purportedly clashed with the native Chumash, killing many over trading disputes.

Current occurrences of the critically endangered [[North Pacific right whale]]s and historically abundant [[Steller's sea lion]]s in these areas are unknown. Seabirds, including the [[western gull]]s, [[bald eagle]]s, [[pigeon guillemot]]s, and [[Scripps's murrelet]]s use the islands as well for shelter and breeding grounds. The endemic [[island fox]] is California's smallest natural canine and has rebounded from its near extinction in the late 1990s. Several endemic reptile and amphibian species including the [[island fence lizard]], [[island night lizard]], and [[Channel Islands slender salamander]] live on the islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Animals \u2013 Channel Islands National Park (U.S. National Park Service)|url=http://www.nps.gov/chis/learn/nature/animals.htm|website=Channel Islands National Park|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|access-date=9 May 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Conservation==\n===Terrestrial===\n\nTerrestrial conservation efforts are being made to maintain the islands' endemic species.

He succeeded his father in c. 995. He stands at the threshold of recorded history, since he is the first Swedish ruler about whom there is substantial knowledge. He is regarded as the first king known to have ruled both the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] and the [[Geats]]. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]], who were the last to adopt Christianity in [[Scandinavia]]. He is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted in parts of [[Sweden]] until the 12th century, Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt Christianity. \n<ref>https://sweden.se/society/10-fundamentals-of-religion-in-sweden/</ref>\n\nOlof was victorious alongside [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] when the kings created an alliance to defeat the Norwegian king [[Olaf Tryggvason]] in the [[Battle of Svolder]]. After the Battle of Svolder, the victorious leaders split Norway into areas of control. [[Heimskringla |Heimskringla]] gives the most detailed account of the division. Olof received four districts in Trondheim as well as M\u00f8re, Romsdal and R\u00e5nrike. <ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sweyn-I#ref184129</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nOne of many explanations to the name ''Sk\u00f6tkonung'' is that it is derived from the Swedish word \"skatt\", which can mean either \"taxes\" or \"treasure\". The latter meaning has given the interpretation \"tributary king\" and one English scholar speculates about a tributary relationship to the Danish king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who was his stepfather.<ref>Peter Sawyer, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings''. Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-285434-8}}, p.169.</ref> That explanation, however, is not supported by evidence or historical sources. Another possible explanation of the name refers to the fact that he was the first Swedish king to stamp coins.<ref>Myntkabinettet: [http://www.myntkabinettet.se/web/Olof_skotkonung.aspx Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721214716/http://www.myntkabinettet.se/web/Olof_skotkonung.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> An ancient land ownership ceremony which placed a parcel of earth in someone's ''lap'' (Swedish: ''sk\u00f6te'') was called ''scotting'' and may have been involved in this epithet.<ref>Lagerqvist & \u00c5berg in ''\u00d6knamn och tillnamn p\u00e5 nordiska storm\u00e4n och kungligheter'' {{ISBN|91-87064-21-9}} p. 23</ref>\n\nThe Old Norse \"\u00d3l\u00e1fr s\u0153nski\" means \"Olaf the Swedish\", an epithet used to distinguish him from the Norwegian kings [[Olaf Tryggvasson]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]].\n\n==Life==\nOur knowledge of Olof is mostly based on [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s and [[Adam of Bremen]]'s accounts, which have been subject to criticism from source-critical scholars. The eldest account by the German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), relates that Sweyn Forkbeard was expelled from his Danish realm by the Swedish King Eric the Victorious in the late 10th century. When Eric died (c. 995), Sweyn returned and regained his kingdom, marrying Eric's widow. Meanwhile, however, Olof had succeeded his father Eric, gathered an army, and launched a surprise attack against Sweyn. The Danish king was once again expelled while Olof occupied his lands. After this, however, the conflict was resolved. Since Sweyn had married Olof's mother he was reinstated on the Danish throne and the two kings were thereafter allies.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 91 (Book II, Chapter 39).</ref> Snorri Sturluson (c. 1230) and the other Icelandic saga writers likewise say that Sweyn married Olof's mother after the death of Eric the Victorious, however without mentioning any conflict. Also, Snorri describes Sweyn and Olof as equal allies when they defeated the Norwegian king [[Olav Tryggvason]] in the [[battle of Svolder]] 1000, and thereafter divided Norway between themselves (see below).<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, pp.. 180, 283, 289.</ref> It is commonly believed that Adam's account about Sweyn's defeats at the hand of Eric and Olof is partial and might have been misinterpreted; the marriage to Olof's mother may in fact have sealed Sweyn's precedence position.<ref>Maja Hagerman, ''Sp\u00e5ren av kungens m\u00e4n''. Stockholm: Rab\u00e9n Prisma, 1996.</ref>\n[[Image:Stadshuset Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung.jpg|thumb|250px|Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung as imagined by Ansgar Almquist in the 1920s, statue at [[Stockholm City Hall]].]]\n\n===Viking expedition to Wendland===\nAccording to Snorri, Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung led a Viking expedition to [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]] early in his reign. He captured [[Edla]], the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and kept her as mistress. She gave him the son [[Emund the Old|Emund]] (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughters [[Astrid Olofsdotter|Astrid]] (later wife of [[Olaf II of Norway]]) and Holmfrid (married to Sven Jarl of Norway).<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, p. 107 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapter 88).</ref> He later married [[Estrid of the Obotrites]], and she bore him the son [[Anund Jacob]] and the daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]].<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 91 (Book II, Chapter 39).</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Sweyn Forkbeard===\nWhile Adam of Bremen praises Olof as a good Christian, Icelandic authors paint an unfavourable picture of the king who was haughty and prickly. Olof is said to have preferred royal [[sport]]s to war, which may explain the ease with which [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] retook the Danish lands his father Eric had conquered.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 86 (Book II, Chapter 30).</ref> Olof may also have lost the right to tribute which his predecessors had preserved in what is now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]].\n\nIn 1000, he joined forces with [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and with the Norwegian [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]] [[Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson|Eric]] and [[Sveinn H\u00e1konarson|Sven]], against the Norwegian King [[Olaf Tryggvason]]. The circumstances have been much debated in modern historical research, but a contemporary poem confirms that Eric Jarl gathered auxiliaries in Sweden: \"The belligent jarl / gathered much manpower / in [[Svithiod]], the chief went / southward to the battle.\"<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, p. 289.</ref> Olaf Tryggvason was attacked by the allied fleets in the [[Battle of Svolder]], the location of which is uncertain. It may have been either in [[\u00d6resund]] or [[Pomerania]]. Olaf Tryggvason disappeared in the battle and Norway was appropriated by the allied lords. The bulk of the conquests went to Sweyn Forkbeark while Olof gained a part of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] as well as modern [[Bohusl\u00e4n]]. These lands were placed under Sven Jarl, son-in-law of the king.<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, p. 289 (Olav Tryggvasons saga, chapter 113).</ref>\n\n===Norwegian-Swedish War===\nWhen the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by [[Olaf II of Norway]] (Olaf the Saint) in 1015, a new war erupted between Norway and Sweden. There is a circumstantial account of this in Snorri Sturluson's work. As he writes, many men in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, Olof's cousin, the [[earl]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]] and the Norwegian king's emissaries [[Bj\u00f6rn Stallare]] and [[Hjalti Skeggiason]] had arrived at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] of [[Uppsala]] in an attempt to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father [[Thorgny Lawspeaker]].\n\nThorgny delivered a powerful speech in which he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as [[Erik Anundsson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn (III) Eriksson|Bj\u00f6rn]] had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to their men's advice. Thorgny, himself, had taken part in many successful pillaging expeditions with Olof's father [[Eric the Victorious]] and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who were eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that paid tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen.\n\nThorgny finished his speech by saying: \"if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook any more of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at [[Mula thing]] threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.\"<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, pp. 89-95 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapters 72-80).</ref> Upon hearing this, King Olof complied with the demands of the peasantry for the time being.\n\nHowever, far from keeping his promise Olof married his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd-Irene]] to [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] instead. When Olaf of Norway heard about the arrangement he was furious and intent on attacking Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. However, the [[Geatish]] jarl [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]], colluding with Olaf II's skald [[Sigvat Thordarson]], managed to avert the impending war. Olof's other daughter [[Astrid Olofsdotter of Sweden|Astrid]] stayed with Ragnvald at the time, and it was agreed that she would take Ingegerd's place. Unbeknownst to Olof, she traveled to Norway and married Olaf II. Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung was highly upset, but soon ran into trouble at home. Both the Swedes and Geats were displeased with the self-willed rule of the king. The [[lawspeaker]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Emund, traveled to [[Uppsala|Gamla Uppsala]] and spoke to Olof's councilors, and a settlement was made. Olof agreed to share his power with his son [[Anund Jacob]] who was 10 or 12 years at the time. Olof was also forced to accept a settlement with [[Olaf II of Norway]] at [[Kungah\u00e4lla]].<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, pp. 108-228 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapters 88-94).</ref> The veracity of Snorri Sturluson's account of Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung, written more than two centuries later, is difficult to assess; however, he quotes several probably genuine scaldic verses which allude to some of the related events.\n\nOne result of the hostilities between Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung and Olaf of Norway was, according to Snorri Sturluson, that the people of [[J\u00e4mtland]] and [[H\u00e4lsingland]] came under the Swedish rather than Norwegian king. Previously the J\u00e4mtlanders and part of the H\u00e4lsinglanders had adhered to Norway since the days of [[Hakon the Good]].<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, p. 204 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapter 137).</ref> The veracity of this is not known, but the medieval provincial laws of J\u00e4mtland show Swedish influences, and there are indications that Christianity arrived from Central Sweden in the 11th century.<ref>Erik Gunnes (1976), ''Norges historie. Bind 2''. Oslo: Cappelen, p. 340.</ref> J\u00e4mtland reverted to the Norwegian king in 1111, while H\u00e4lsingland was henceforth under Sweden.<ref>P.A. Munch, ''Det norske Folks historie. Anden Deel''. Christiania: Tonsbergs, 1855, p. 596-7.</ref> \n\n===Diplomacy===\nOlof's ally Sweyn Forkbeard occupied [[England]] in 1013, but died shortly afterwards, and the Anglo-Saxon ruler [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] was able to return. According to Adam of Bremen, \"the son of the king, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], returned home with the army and prepared a new war against the English. Olav [II], whom the Norwegians had chosen as their commander, now separated from the Danish kingdom. Cnut, who felt threatened from two directions, then entered an alliance with his brother Olof Eriksson who ruled in Sweden, and planned to take power in England, and then in Norway,  with his assistance. Equipped with a thousand large ships, Cnut thus traversed the British Sea\".<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 99 (Book II, Chapter 52).</ref> From Swedish rune stones it also appears that many people joined the Danish Viking expeditions of the early 11th century. After [[Cnut the Great]] became [[King of England]] in 1016, he sent the two sons of the deceased King [[Edmund Ironside]] to Olof (who was either Canute's half-brother or stepbrother), supposedly with instructions to have the children murdered. Instead of having them killed, the two boys were secretly sent either to [[Kiev]],<ref>Anderson and Onslow both say Hungary</ref> where Olof's daughter [[Ingigerd Olofsdotter|Ingigerd]] was the Queen, or to Poland, where Canute's uncle [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]] was duke.<ref> MichaelAnne Guido and John P. Ravilious, \"From Theophanu to St. Margaret of Scotland: A study of Agatha's ancestry\", Foundations, vol. 4, 2012, pp. 81-121.</ref>\n\n===Christian King===\nIncluded in the [[Westrogothic law]] from c. 1240 is the first brief Swedish chronicle, which begins with Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. It relates that Olof was baptized in [[Husaby]] in [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] by the missionary [[Sigfrid of Sweden|Sigfrid]], and made generous donations on spot.<ref>Quoted in Mats G. Larsson, ''G\u00f6tarnas riken: Uppt\u00e4cktsf\u00e4rder till Sveriges enande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 185.</ref> At Husaby parish church, there is a sign commemorating his baptism; nearby is a well thought to be the same sacred spring where Olof was baptized.\n\nHe was the first Swedish king to remain a Christian until his death. However, the circumstances about his baptism are not clear. A document from 1008 says that a certain bishop, dispatched by Archbishop [[Bruno of Querfurt]], visited the Suigi tribe and managed to baptize the king, whose queen was already Christian. 1,000 people and seven communities followed his example. The Suigi have sometimes been identified as the Swedes, though this has been rejected by several other scholars.<ref>Wladyslaw Duszko, \"Ett kungligt dop: Olof sk\u00f6tkonung och Bruno av Querfurt Kring ett aktualiserat problem i svensk historieskrivning\", ''Fornv\u00e4nnen'' 103, 2008, p. 286. [http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/3195/2008_283.pdf?sequence=1]</ref> On the other hand, Olof's coinage (see below) indicates that he was a Christian already at the time of his accession in c. 995.<ref>Jan Arvid Hellstr\u00f6m, ''V\u00e4gar till Sveriges kristnande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 1996, p. 245.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Adam of Bremen]], Olof planned to tear down the [[Uppsala temple]], which was allegedly an important cult centre.<ref>Its existence is debated; see Jan Arvid Hellstr\u00f6m, ''V\u00e4gar till Sveriges kristnande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 1996, pp. 214, 232.</ref> The fact that a large part of the Swedes were still pagan forced him to abandon this aim. The pagans, weary of his plans, made an agreement with Olof to the effect that he, if he wished to be a Christian, must exercise his royal authority in a province of his choice. If he founded a church, he was not supposed to force anyone to convert. Olof was content with this and installed a bishopric in the province of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], closer to Denmark and Norway. On the wishes of Olof, the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen anointed Thurgot as the first Bishop in [[Skara]]. This Thurgot was successful in disseminating Christianity among the West Geats and east Geats.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, pp. 102-3 (Book II, chapter 58).</ref>\n\nThe legend of St. [[Sigfrid]], known since the 13th century, relates that the still pagan Olof called in the English [[Archbishop of York]], Sigfrid, to teach the new faith in his realm. On his way, Sigfrid and his three nephews came to [[V\u00e4rend]] in southern [[Sm\u00e5land]] where the twelve local tribes endorsed Christianity at a [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]. Sigfrid left his nephews to tend matters in V\u00e4rend and proceeded to Olof's court where the king and his family were baptised. In the meanwhile a heathen reaction in V\u00e4rend cost the lives of the nephews, whose heads were sunk in the [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lake]]. Hearing about this, Sigfrid returned to V\u00e4rend where the heads were discovered through a miracle. King Olof then appeared in V\u00e4rend with a force, punished the murderers, and forced the locals to yield properties to the Church. Whether the legend reflects the expansion of Olof's realm to the south is unsure. The account seems to incorporate various elements in order to legitimise the establishment of the Bishopric of [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6]] in c. 1170.<ref>Lars-Olof Larsson, \"Sigfrid\", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'' [https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=5906]</ref> It is nevertheless known from Adam of Bremen that an English missionary called Sigfrid preached among the Swedes and Geats in the first half of the 11th century.<ref>Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 102 (Book II, Chapter 57), 106 (Book II, Chapter 64).</ref>\n\n==Coinage and extent of the realm==\n\nWhen he stamped coins in [[Sigtuna]] in the province of [[Uppland]] Olof used the word ''rex'' for ''king''. ''OLUF REX'' as in the coin displayed above or ''OLAF REX''. The use of Latin seems to suggest that he was already baptised at this time but on the other hand the coins were imitating English pennies in type and style. Sigtuna is written ''SITUN'', ''ZINT'' (in the coin above), ''ZTNETEI'', or ''SIDEI''. The two last has been deciphered as ''Si(gtuna) Dei'' meaning ''God's Sigtuna''.<ref>Thunmark-Nyl\u00e9n, Lena et al. (1981).

Sigtuna may be understood as the area in [[Uppland]] ruled from the town of this name, while rulership over the Swedes may indicate a more extensive realm. Contemporary scaldic poetry indicates Olof as the ruler of the Swedes as well as the [[Geats]] ([[G\u00f6tar]]), and the same goes for the account of Adam of Bremen.<ref>Ros, Jonas (2002) \"Sigtuna och folklanden; den tidiga Sigtunamyntningen och den politiska geografin\", ''Fornv\u00e4nnen'' 97:3, p. 170 [http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/3025/2002_161.pdf]</ref> The exact nature of the relation between the Swedes and Geats, and the process by which a unified kingdom was created, has been intensively debated.

He succeeded his father in c. 995. He stands at the threshold of recorded history, since he is the first Swedish ruler about whom there is substantial knowledge. He is regarded as the first king known to have ruled both the [[Swedes (Germanic tribe)|Swedes]] and the [[Geats]]. In Sweden, the reign of king [[Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung|Olov Sk\u00f6tkonung]] ({{circa|995\u20131020}}) is considered to be the transition from the Viking age to the Middle Ages, because he was the first Christian king of the Swedes, who were the last to adopt Christianity in [[Scandinavia]]. He is associated with a growing influence of the church in what is today southwestern and central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted in parts of [[Sweden]] until the 12th century, Olof being the last king in Scandinavia to adopt Christianity. \n<ref>https://sweden.se/society/10-fundamentals-of-religion-in-sweden/</ref>\n\nOlof was victorious alongside [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] when the kings created an alliance to defeat the Norwegian king [[Olaf Tryggvason]] in the [[Battle of Svolder]]. After the Battle of Svolder, the victorious leaders split Norway into areas of control. [[Heimskringla |Heimskringla]] gives the most detailed account of the division. Olof received four districts in Trondheim as well as M\u00f8re, Romsdal and R\u00e5nrike. <ref>https://www.britannica.com/biography/Sweyn-I#ref184129</ref>\n\n==Etymology==\nOne of many explanations to the name ''Sk\u00f6tkonung'' is that it is derived from the Swedish word \"skatt\", which can mean either \"taxes\" or \"treasure\". The latter meaning has given the interpretation \"tributary king\" and one English scholar speculates about a tributary relationship to the Danish king [[Sweyn Forkbeard]], who was his stepfather.<ref>Peter Sawyer, ''The Oxford Illustrated History of the Vikings''. Oxford University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-19-285434-8}}, p.169.</ref> That explanation, however, is not supported by evidence or historical sources. Another possible explanation of the name refers to the fact that he was the first Swedish king to stamp coins.<ref>Myntkabinettet: [http://www.myntkabinettet.se/web/Olof_skotkonung.aspx Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721214716/http://www.myntkabinettet.se/web/Olof_skotkonung.aspx |date=2011-07-21 }}</ref> An ancient land ownership ceremony which placed a parcel of earth in someone's ''lap'' (Swedish: ''sk\u00f6te'') was called ''scotting'' and may have been involved in this epithet.<ref>Lagerqvist & \u00c5berg in ''\u00d6knamn och tillnamn p\u00e5 nordiska storm\u00e4n och kungligheter'' {{ISBN|91-87064-21-9}} p. 23</ref>\n\nThe Old Norse \"\u00d3l\u00e1fr s\u0153nski\" means \"Olaf the Swedish\", an epithet used to distinguish him from the Norwegian kings [[Olaf Tryggvasson]] and [[Olaf II of Norway|Olaf Haraldsson]].\n\n==Life==\nOur knowledge of Olof is mostly based on [[Snorri Sturluson]]'s and [[Adam of Bremen]]'s accounts, which have been subject to criticism from source-critical scholars. The eldest account by the German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), relates that Sweyn Forkbeard was expelled from his Danish realm by the Swedish King Eric the Victorious in the late 10th century. When Eric died (c. 995), Sweyn returned and regained his kingdom, marrying Eric's widow. Meanwhile, however, Olof had succeeded his father Eric, gathered an army, and launched a surprise attack against Sweyn. The Danish king was once again expelled while Olof occupied his lands. After this, however, the conflict was resolved. Since Sweyn had married Olof's mother he was reinstated on the Danish throne and the two kings were thereafter allies.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 91 (Book II, Chapter 39).</ref> Snorri Sturluson (c. 1230) and the other Icelandic saga writers likewise say that Sweyn married Olof's mother after the death of Eric the Victorious, however without mentioning any conflict. Also, Snorri describes Sweyn and Olof as equal allies when they defeated the Norwegian king [[Olav Tryggvason]] in the [[battle of Svolder]] 1000, and thereafter divided Norway between themselves (see below).<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, pp.. 180, 283, 289.</ref> It is commonly believed that Adam's account about Sweyn's defeats at the hand of Eric and Olof is partial and might have been misinterpreted; the marriage to Olof's mother may in fact have sealed Sweyn's precedence position.<ref>Maja Hagerman, ''Sp\u00e5ren av kungens m\u00e4n''. Stockholm: Rab\u00e9n Prisma, 1996.</ref>\n[[Image:Stadshuset Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung.jpg|thumb|250px|Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung as imagined by Ansgar Almquist in the 1920s, statue at [[Stockholm City Hall]].]]\n\n===Viking expedition to Wendland===\nAccording to Snorri, Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung led a Viking expedition to [[L\u00fcchow-Dannenberg|Wendland]] early in his reign. He captured [[Edla]], the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and kept her as mistress. She gave him the son [[Emund the Old|Emund]] (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughters [[Astrid Olofsdotter|Astrid]] (later wife of [[Olaf II of Norway]]) and Holmfrid (married to Sven Jarl of Norway).<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, p. 107 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapter 88).</ref> He later married [[Estrid of the Obotrites]], and she bore him the son [[Anund Jacob]] and the daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]].<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 91 (Book II, Chapter 39).</ref>\n\n===Alliance with Sweyn Forkbeard===\nWhile Adam of Bremen praises Olof as a good Christian, Icelandic authors paint an unfavourable picture of the king who was haughty and prickly. Olof is said to have preferred royal [[sport]]s to war, which may explain the ease with which [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] retook the Danish lands his father Eric had conquered.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 86 (Book II, Chapter 30).</ref> Olof may also have lost the right to tribute which his predecessors had preserved in what is now [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]].\n\nIn 1000, he joined forces with [[Sweyn Forkbeard]] and with the Norwegian [[Jarl (title)|Jarls]] [[Eir\u00edkr H\u00e1konarson|Eric]] and [[Sveinn H\u00e1konarson|Sven]], against the Norwegian King [[Olaf Tryggvason]]. The circumstances have been much debated in modern historical research, but a contemporary poem confirms that Eric Jarl gathered auxiliaries in Sweden: \"The belligent jarl / gathered much manpower / in [[Svithiod]], the chief went / southward to the battle.\"<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, p. 289.</ref> Olaf Tryggvason was attacked by the allied fleets in the [[Battle of Svolder]], the location of which is uncertain. It may have been either in [[\u00d6resund]] or [[Pomerania]]. Olaf Tryggvason disappeared in the battle and Norway was appropriated by the allied lords. The bulk of the conquests went to Sweyn Forkbeark while Olof gained a part of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] as well as modern [[Bohusl\u00e4n]]. These lands were placed under Sven Jarl, son-in-law of the king.<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. I. Stockholm: Fabel, 1991, p. 289 (Olav Tryggvasons saga, chapter 113).</ref>\n\n===Norwegian-Swedish War===\nWhen the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by [[Olaf II of Norway]] (Olaf the Saint) in 1015, a new war erupted between Norway and Sweden. There is a circumstantial account of this in Snorri Sturluson's work. As he writes, many men in both [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, Olof's cousin, the [[earl]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]] and the Norwegian king's emissaries [[Bj\u00f6rn Stallare]] and [[Hjalti Skeggiason]] had arrived at the [[Thing (assembly)|thing]] of [[Uppsala]] in an attempt to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter]] to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father [[Thorgny Lawspeaker]].\n\nThorgny delivered a powerful speech in which he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as [[Erik Anundsson]] and [[Bj\u00f6rn (III) Eriksson|Bj\u00f6rn]] had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to their men's advice. Thorgny, himself, had taken part in many successful pillaging expeditions with Olof's father [[Eric the Victorious]] and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who were eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that paid tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen.\n\nThorgny finished his speech by saying: \"if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook any more of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at [[Mula thing]] threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.\"<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, pp. 89-95 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapters 72-80).</ref> Upon hearing this, King Olof complied with the demands of the peasantry for the time being.\n\nHowever, far from keeping his promise Olof married his daughter [[Ingegerd Olofsdotter|Ingegerd-Irene]] to [[Yaroslav I the Wise]] instead. When Olaf of Norway heard about the arrangement he was furious and intent on attacking Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. However, the [[Geatish]] jarl [[Ragnvald Ulfsson]], colluding with Olaf II's skald [[Sigvat Thordarson]], managed to avert the impending war. Olof's other daughter [[Astrid Olofsdotter of Sweden|Astrid]] stayed with Ragnvald at the time, and it was agreed that she would take Ingegerd's place. Unbeknownst to Olof, she traveled to Norway and married Olaf II. Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung was highly upset, but soon ran into trouble at home. Both the Swedes and Geats were displeased with the self-willed rule of the king. The [[lawspeaker]] of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], Emund, traveled to [[Uppsala|Gamla Uppsala]] and spoke to Olof's councilors, and a settlement was made. Olof agreed to share his power with his son [[Anund Jacob]] who was 10 or 12 years at the time. Olof was also forced to accept a settlement with [[Olaf II of Norway]] at [[Kungah\u00e4lla]].<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, pp. 108-228 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapters 88-94).</ref> The veracity of Snorri Sturluson's account of Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung, written more than two centuries later, is difficult to assess; however, he quotes several probably genuine scaldic verses which allude to some of the related events.\n\nOne result of the hostilities between Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung and Olaf of Norway was, according to Snorri Sturluson, that the people of [[J\u00e4mtland]] and [[H\u00e4lsingland]] came under the Swedish rather than Norwegian king. Previously the J\u00e4mtlanders and part of the H\u00e4lsinglanders had adhered to Norway since the days of [[Hakon the Good]].<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''. Vol. II. Stockholm: Fabel, 1992, p. 204 (Olav den heliges saga, Chapter 137).</ref> The veracity of this is not known, but the medieval provincial laws of J\u00e4mtland show Swedish influences, and there are indications that Christianity arrived from Central Sweden in the 11th century.<ref>Erik Gunnes (1976), ''Norges historie. Bind 2''. Oslo: Cappelen, p. 340.</ref> J\u00e4mtland reverted to the Norwegian king in 1111, while H\u00e4lsingland was henceforth under Sweden.<ref>P.A. Munch, ''Det norske Folks historie. Anden Deel''. Christiania: Tonsbergs, 1855, p. 596-7.</ref> \n\n===Diplomacy===\nOlof's ally Sweyn Forkbeard occupied [[England]] in 1013, but died shortly afterwards, and the Anglo-Saxon ruler [[\u00c6thelred the Unready]] was able to return. According to Adam of Bremen, \"the son of the king, [[Cnut the Great|Cnut]], returned home with the army and prepared a new war against the English. Olav [II], whom the Norwegians had chosen as their commander, now separated from the Danish kingdom. Cnut, who felt threatened from two directions, then entered an alliance with his brother Olof Eriksson who ruled in Sweden, and planned to take power in England, and then in Norway,  with his assistance. Equipped with a thousand large ships, Cnut thus traversed the British Sea\".<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, p. 99 (Book II, Chapter 52).</ref> From Swedish rune stones it also appears that many people joined the Danish Viking expeditions of the early 11th century. After [[Cnut the Great]] became [[King of England]] in 1016, he sent the two sons of the deceased King [[Edmund Ironside]] to Olof (who was either Canute's half-brother or stepbrother), supposedly with instructions to have the children murdered. Instead of having them killed, the two boys were secretly sent either to [[Kiev]],<ref>Anderson and Onslow both say Hungary</ref> where Olof's daughter [[Ingigerd Olofsdotter|Ingigerd]] was the Queen, or to Poland, where Canute's uncle [[Boles\u0142aw I Chrobry]] was duke.<ref> MichaelAnne Guido and John P. Ravilious, \"From Theophanu to St. Margaret of Scotland: A study of Agatha's ancestry\", Foundations, vol. 4, 2012, pp. 81-121.</ref>\n\n===Christian King===\nIncluded in the [[Westrogothic law]] from c. 1240 is the first brief Swedish chronicle, which begins with Olof Sk\u00f6tkonung. It relates that Olof was baptized in [[Husaby]] in [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]] by the missionary [[Sigfrid of Sweden|Sigfrid]], and made generous donations on spot.<ref>Quoted in Mats G. Larsson, ''G\u00f6tarnas riken: Uppt\u00e4cktsf\u00e4rder till Sveriges enande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 2002, p. 185.</ref> At Husaby parish church, there is a sign commemorating his baptism; nearby is a well thought to be the same sacred spring where Olof was baptized.\n\nHe was the first Swedish king to remain a Christian until his death. However, the circumstances about his baptism are not clear. A document from 1008 says that a certain bishop, dispatched by Archbishop [[Bruno of Querfurt]], visited the Suigi tribe and managed to baptize the king, whose queen was already Christian. 1,000 people and seven communities followed his example. The Suigi have sometimes been identified as the Swedes, though this has been rejected by several other scholars.<ref>Wladyslaw Duszko, \"Ett kungligt dop: Olof sk\u00f6tkonung och Bruno av Querfurt Kring ett aktualiserat problem i svensk historieskrivning\", ''Fornv\u00e4nnen'' 103, 2008, p. 286. [http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/3195/2008_283.pdf?sequence=1]</ref> On the other hand, Olof's coinage (see below) indicates that he was a Christian already at the time of his accession in c. 995.<ref>Jan Arvid Hellstr\u00f6m, ''V\u00e4gar till Sveriges kristnande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 1996, p. 245.</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Adam of Bremen]], Olof planned to tear down the [[Uppsala temple]], which was allegedly an important cult centre.<ref>Its existence is debated; see Jan Arvid Hellstr\u00f6m, ''V\u00e4gar till Sveriges kristnande''. Stockholm: Atlantis, 1996, pp. 214, 232.</ref> The fact that a large part of the Swedes were still pagan forced him to abandon this aim. The pagans, weary of his plans, made an agreement with Olof to the effect that he, if he wished to be a Christian, must exercise his royal authority in a province of his choice. If he founded a church, he was not supposed to force anyone to convert. Olof was content with this and installed a bishopric in the province of [[V\u00e4sterg\u00f6tland]], closer to Denmark and Norway. On the wishes of Olof, the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen anointed Thurgot as the first Bishop in [[Skara]]. This Thurgot was successful in disseminating Christianity among the West Geats and east Geats.<ref>Adam av Bremen, ''Historien om Hamburgerstiftet och dess biskopar''. Stockholm: Proprius, 1984, pp. 102-3 (Book II, chapter 58).</ref>\n\nThe legend of St. [[Sigfrid]], known since the 13th century, relates that the still pagan Olof called in the English [[Archbishop of York]], Sigfrid, to teach the new faith in his realm. On his way, Sigfrid and his three nephews came to [[V\u00e4rend]] in southern [[Sm\u00e5land]] where the twelve local tribes endorsed Christianity at a [[Thing (assembly)|Thing]]. Sigfrid left his nephews to tend matters in V\u00e4rend and proceeded to Olof's court where the king and his family were baptised. In the meanwhile a heathen reaction in V\u00e4rend cost the lives of the nephews, whose heads were sunk in the [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6 Lake]]. Hearing about this, Sigfrid returned to V\u00e4rend where the heads were discovered through a miracle. King Olof then appeared in V\u00e4rend with a force, punished the murderers, and forced the locals to yield properties to the Church. Whether the legend reflects the expansion of Olof's realm to the south is unsure. The account seems to incorporate various elements in order to legitimise the establishment of the Bishopric of [[V\u00e4xj\u00f6]] in c. 1170.<ref>Lars-Olof Larsson, \"Sigfrid\", ''Svenskt biografiskt lexikon'' [https://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=5906]</ref> It is nevertheless known from Adam of Bremen that an English missionary called Sigfrid preached among the Swedes and Geats in the first half of the 11th century.<ref>Adam av Bremen (1984), p. 102 (Book II, Chapter 57), 106 (Book II, Chapter 64).</ref>\n\n==Coinage and extent of the realm==\n\nWhen he stamped coins in [[Sigtuna]] in the province of [[Uppland]] Olof used the word ''rex'' for ''king''. ''OLUF REX'' as in the coin displayed above or ''OLAF REX''. The use of Latin seems to suggest that he was already baptised at this time but on the other hand the coins were imitating English pennies in type and style. Sigtuna is written ''SITUN'', ''ZINT'' (in the coin above), ''ZTNETEI'', or ''SIDEI''. The two last has been deciphered as ''Si(gtuna) Dei'' meaning ''God's Sigtuna''.<ref>Thunmark-Nyl\u00e9n, Lena et al. (1981). ''Vikingatidens ABC'', Statens historiska museum, 1981. {{ISBN|91-7192-490-6}}, p.232.</ref><ref>Maiander, Harry et al. (1947). ''Sveriges historia genom tiderna. F\u00f6rsta delen.'' Stockholm, 1947. p.159.</ref> The earliest Olof coins merely depict him as \"King in Sigtuna\", while the later ones have \"King of the Swedes\". \n\nIt has been suggested that this change in nomenclature relates to a widening of Olof's base of power around 1000. Sigtuna may be understood as the area in [[Uppland]] ruled from the town of this name, while rulership over the Swedes may indicate a more extensive realm. Contemporary scaldic poetry indicates Olof as the ruler of the Swedes as well as the [[Geats]] ([[G\u00f6tar]]), and the same goes for the account of Adam of Bremen.<ref>Ros, Jonas (2002) \"Sigtuna och folklanden; den tidiga Sigtunamyntningen och den politiska geografin\", ''Fornv\u00e4nnen'' 97:3, p. 170 [http://samla.raa.se/xmlui/bitstream/handle/raa/3025/2002_161.pdf]</ref> The exact nature of the relation between the Swedes and Geats, and the process by which a unified kingdom was created, has been intensively debated. While the unification has traditionally been thought to depart from the provinces around lake [[M\u00e4laren]] some scholars hold that the Geatic provinces were leading the process, and that the construction of a Swedish kingdom was a long process that was only concluded in the 13th century.<ref>Dick Harrison, ''Sveriges historia. 600-1350''.

The poem has some interest in it since it gives a view into the kingship and reign of Olof: \"The warrior guards his land, few kings are as mighty as him; Olof pleases the eagle, the Swedish king is outstanding\".<ref>\u00d3l\u00e1fsdr\u00e1pa, verse 6 [http://www.heimskringla.no/wiki/%C3%93l%C3%A1fsdr%C3%A1pa_s%C5%93nska_(B1)]</ref> Other skalds who served Olof were [[Gunnlaugr ormstunga]], [[Hrafn \u00d6nundarson]] and [[Gizurr svarti]].\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Olaf Scotking of Sweden alleged grave 2009 Husaby G\u00f6tene.jpg|thumb|right|The alleged ''Olaf Grave'' at Husaby Church]]\nJudging from Snorri Sturluson's chronology of events, Olof died a natural death in the winter of 1021\u20131022.<ref>Snorre Sturluson, ''Nordiska kungasagor''.

After graduating from Los Angeles's [[Otis College of Art and Design]], Gordon moved to New York City to begin an art career. There, she formed Sonic Youth with [[Thurston Moore]] in 1981. She and Moore married in 1984, and the band released a total of six albums on independent labels before the end of the 1980s. They would subsequently release nine studio albums on the major label [[DGC Records]], beginning with ''[[Goo (album)|Goo]]'' in 1990. Gordon was also a founding member of the musical project [[Free Kitten]], which she formed with [[Julia Cafritz]] in 1993.\n\nSonic Youth released their sixteenth and final studio album, ''[[The Eternal (album)|The Eternal]]'' (2009), on [[Matador Records]] before disbanding in 2011 after Gordon and Moore separated. Following the dissolution of Sonic Youth and her divorce from Moore, Gordon formed the experimental duo [[Body/Head]] with Bill Nace, releasing their debut album ''[[Coming Apart (album)|Coming Apart]]'' in 2013. She subsequently formed [[Glitterbust]] with Alex Knost, releasing a self-titled debut album in 2016. Body/Head released their second studio album, ''The Switch'', in 2018. She released her first solo album, ''[[No Home Record]]'', in 2019. \n\nIn addition to her work as a musician, Gordon has had ventures in [[Record producer|record producing]], fashion, and acting, and has worked consistently as a visual artist throughout her musical career. She debuted as a producer on [[Hole (band)|Hole]]'s debut album ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991), and founded the Los Angeles-based clothing line X-Girl in 1993. Beginning in the mid-2000s, Gordon began acting, making minor appearances in such films as ''[[Last Days (2005 film)|Last Days]]'' (2005) and ''[[I'm Not There]]'' (2007), followed by guest-starring appearances on several television series. In February 2015, she published a memoir, ''[[Girl in a Band]]'', by [[HarperCollins]] imprint Dey Street Books.\n\n==Life and career==\n===1953\u20131978: Early life===\nKim Althea Gordon was born April 28, 1953{{sfn|George-Warren|Romanowski|2005|p=912}} in [[Rochester, New York]], the second child of Althea ({{abbr|d.|died}} 2002) and Calvin Wayne Gordon (1915{{en dash}}1998).<ref name=stage/><ref name=maron>{{cite interview|interviewer=[[Marc Maron]]|last=Gordon|first=Kim|work=[[WTF with Marc Maron]]|date=March 26, 2015|title=Interview with Kim Gordon}}</ref><ref name=memoriam>{{cite web|work=University of California, Los Angeles|date=February 24, 1998|url=https://senate.universityofcalifornia.edu/_files/inmemoriam/html/WayneC.Gordon.htm|accessdate=August 23, 2018|title=In Memoriam: C.

I was in a punk underground scene dominated by hardcore dudes who yelled mean shit at me every night, and journalists routinely called my voice shrill, unlistenable. Kim made me feel accepted in a way I hadn't before. Fucking Kim Gordon thought I was on the right track, haters be damned.

Youth]].\n\nBorn in [[Rochester, New York]], Gordon was raised in [[Los Angeles]], California, where her father was a professor at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]]. After graduating from Los Angeles's [[Otis College of Art and Design]], Gordon moved to New York City to begin an art career. There, she formed Sonic Youth with [[Thurston Moore]] in 1981.

When the studio was absorbed by [[Warner Bros.]] in 1928, he remained there and worked on hundreds of projects until his retirement from [[feature film]]s.
