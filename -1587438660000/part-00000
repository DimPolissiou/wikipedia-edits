The following year, shipwright Charles Gorsuch settled Whetstone Point, the present location of [[Fort McHenry]]. In 1665, the west side of the Jones Falls on the Inner Harbor was settled when 550 acres of land, thereafter named Cole's Harbor, was granted to Thomas Cole and later sold to David Jones in 1679. [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Old Saint Paul's Parish]] of [[Baltimore County]] was one of the \"Original Thirty\" parishes designated for the Colony. It included the county of Baltimore and future Baltimore Town and was part of the \"established\" or \"state\" [[Church of England]], also known as the [[Anglican Church]]. It was the first church built in the metro area, erected in 1692 on the Patapsco Neck peninsula in southeastern Baltimore County, along the [[Colgate Creek]] which flowed into the [[Patapsco River]] (present site of today's [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] Marine Terminal of the [[Port of Baltimore]]). Jones's stepson James Todd resurveyed Cole's Harbor in 1696. The tract was renamed Todd's Range, which was then sold off in progressively smaller parcels, thereby forming the land that would become the Town of Baltimore thirty years later.\n\nAnother \"Baltimore\" existed on the Bush River as early as 1674. That first county seat of Baltimore County is known today as \"Old Baltimore\". It was located on the Bush River on land that in 1773 became part of [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]]. In 1674, the General Assembly passed \"An Act for erecting a Court-house and Prison in each County within this Province.\"<ref>{{cite book | url = http://msa.maryland.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000075/html/am75--61.html | title = Laws of Maryland At Large, with Proper Indexes | first = Thomas | last = Bacon | authorlink = Thomas Bacon (priest) | location = Annapolis | publisher = Jonas Green | year = 1765 | volume = 75 | page = 61}}</ref> The site of the court house and jail for Baltimore County was evidently \"Old Baltimore\" near the Bush River.

The exact location of Old Baltimore was lost for years. It was certain that the location was somewhere on the site of the present-day [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]] (APG), a U.S. Army testing facility. in the 1990s, APG's Cultural Resource Management Program took up the task of finding Old Baltimore. The firm of R. Christopher Goodwin & Associates was contracted for the project. After Goodwin first performed historical and archival work, they coordinated their work with existing landscape features to locate the site of Old Baltimore. APG's Explosive Ordnance Disposal personnel went in with Goodwin to defuse any unexploded ordnance. Working in 1997 and 1998, the field team uncovered building foundations, trash pits, [[Zooarchaeology|faunal remains]], and 17,000 artifacts, largely from the 17th century.<ref>{{cite journal | url = https://www.nps.gov/CRMJournal/CRM/v22n5.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Cultural Resource Management | volume = 22 | number = 5 | year = 1999 | publisher = U.S. Department of the Interior, National Park Service, Cultural Resources | title = Aberdeen Proving Ground Uncovers 17th-century Settlement of \"Old  Baltimore\" | first = David G. | last = Blick | pages = 42\u201344}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://core.tdar.org/dataset/392044/artifact-inventory-old-baltimore-aberdeen-proving-ground|title=Artifact Inventory, Old Baltimore, Aberdeen Proving Ground|last=|first=|date=2014|website=The Digital Archaeological Record|doi=10.6067/XCV8NZ88MD|id=tDAR id: 392044<!--present in archive.org-->|access-date=February 15, 2017}}</ref> The Bush River proved to be an unfortunate location because the port became [[silt]]ed and impassable to ships, forcing the port facilities to relocate.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://patch.com/maryland/aberdeen/sign-site-of-old-baltimore | title = SIGN: Site of \"Old Baltimore\" | first = Linda | last = Childers | date = April 18, 2011 | work = Aberdeen Patch | publisher = Patch Media | access-date = June 7, 2017}}</ref> By the time Baltimore on the Patapsco River was established in 1729, Old Baltimore Town had faded away.<ref name=RememberingOldBaltimore>{{cite news | author= Charlotte and \"Doc\" Cronin | url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/harford/aberdeen-havre-de-grace/ph-ag-doc-cronin-column-0919-20140919-story.html | title = Remembering Old Baltimore when it was near Aberdeen | work = [[The Baltimore Sun]] | date = September 19, 2014}}</ref>\n\nMaryland's colonial General Assembly created and authorized the [[Port of Baltimore]] in 1706 at the Head of the Northwest Branch of the [[Patapsco River]] in what was later known as \"the Basin\" (today's [[Inner Harbor]]) and later expanded east and southeast down-river to the settlement later known as [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]] to the east near the mouth of the [[Jones Falls]] and further in the nineteenth century to what became known as [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]].\n\nThe city is named after [[Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore|Cecil Calvert, second Lord Baltimore]],<ref>{{citation|title=Baltimore City, Maryland: Historical Chronology|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/mdmanual/36loc/bcity/chron/html/bcitychron17.html|publisher=Maryland State Archives|date=February 29, 2016|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> (1605\u20131675),<ref>{{citation|title=Calvert Family Tree|url=http://www.lib.umd.edu/binaries/content/assets/public/special/projects/riversdale/calvertfamilytree.pdf|publisher=University Libraries, University of Maryland|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> of the [[Irish House of Lords]] and founding proprietor of the [[Province of Maryland]].<ref>{{citation|title=Maryland History Timeline|url=http://www.visitmaryland.org/info/maryland-history-timeline|publisher=Maryland Office of Tourism|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=egan>{{citation|first=Casey|last=Egan|date=November 23, 2015|title=The surprising Irish origins of Baltimore, Maryland|url=http://www.irishcentral.com/roots/history/The-surprising-Irish-origins-of-Baltimore-Maryland.html|website=IrishCentral|access-date=April 11, 2016}}</ref> Cecilius Calvert was the oldest son of [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore|Sir George Calvert]], (1579\u20131632), who became the [[Baron Baltimore|First Lord Baltimore]] of [[County Longford]], Ireland in 1625.

Unlike many other towns established around that time, Baltimore was more than just existence on paper. [[German American|German immigrants]] began to settle along the [[Chesapeake Bay]] by 1723, living in the Baltimore area. The General Assembly enlarged Baltimore Town in 1745 and incorporated David Jones's original settlement known as Jones Town. Baltimore sent representatives to the Assembly, and over the next two decades it acquired nine parcels of land and annexed neighboring villages including Fells Point to become an important community on the head of the [[Patapsco River]]. As the Town grew, increasing numbers of German Lutheran immigrants established [[Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Zion Church]] in 1755, and later also a German Reformed congregation was organized as the first among the [[Protestant]]s to be represented which also attracted more of these \"[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]\" settlers to the region. Early German settlers also later established the [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German Society of Maryland]] in 1783 in order to foster the German language and German culture in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |title= Significant dates in Baltimore's immigration history |publisher= Baltimore Immigration Memorial Foundation |accessdate= 2012-08-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231058/http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |archive-date= 2013-01-11 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Mount Clare Mansion - Front angle.jpg|alt=View of the front of Mount Clare Mansion.|thumb|[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare Mansion]], known today as the Mount Clare Museum House, is the oldest Colonial-era structure in Baltimore.]]\nThroughout the 18th Century, Baltimore drained and filled in marshes (notably Thomas \"Harrison's Marsh\" along the Jones Falls west bank), built canals around the falls and through the center of town, built bridges across the Falls and annexed neighboring [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jones's Town]] to the northeast in 1745 and expanded southeastward towards the neighboring, bustling, shipbuilding port at [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]]. It became by far the largest city in the Middle Atlantic colonies between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. A political deal by the increasingly powerful financial interests in the growing town and with the rapidly growing population, was reached and the county seat with its important center of a courthouse for all Baltimore County was moved from Old Joppa over its citizens enraged protests. Baltimoreans paid some 300 pounds sterling the next year to erect a fine brick courthouse with a bell tower and steeple on a Courthouse Square (future Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets) along with the necessary \"whipping post\", [[stocks]] (for confining heads and arms), podium for making public announcements and news, and a nearby jail, on the northern hills overlooking the harbor basin and with its back sitting over a rugged cliff and bluffs to the northeast with \"Steiger's Meadow\" bordering the twisting loop of the [[Jones Falls]] which bended southwestward before running north again.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] temporarily fled from Philadelphia and held sessions in Baltimore between December 1776 and February 1777. When the Continental Congress authorized the privateering of British vessels, eager Baltimore merchants accepted the challenge, and as the war progressed, the shipbuilding industry expanded and boomed. There was no major military action near the city though, except for the passing nearby and a feint towards the town by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet as they headed north up the Chesapeake Bay to land an army at [[Elkton, Maryland|Head of Elk]] in the northeast corner to march on the American capital at [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and the following battles at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]].\n\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and in Baltimore flour milling increased along the [[Jones Falls|Jones]] and [[Gwynns Falls]]. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered Baltimore's economic growth. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic.<ref>Garrett Power,  \"Parceling out Land in the Vicinity of Baltimore: 1632-1796, Part 2,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1993 88(2): 150-180,</ref>\n\nThe economic foundations laid down between 1763 and 1776 were vital to the even greater expansion seen during the Revolutionary War. Though still lagging behind Philadelphia, Baltimore merchants and entrepreneurs produced an expanding commercial community with family businesses and partnerships proliferating in shipping, the flour-milling and grain business, and the indentured servant traffic. International trade focused on four areas: Britain, Southern Europe, the West Indies, and the North American coastal towns. Credit was the essence of the system and a virtual chain of indebtedness meant that bills remained long unpaid and little cash was used among overseas correspondents, merchant wholesalers, and retail customers. Bills of exchange were used extensively, often circulating as currency. Frequent crises of credit, and the wars with France kept prices and markets in constant flux, but men such as William Lux and the Christie brothers produced a maturing economy and a thriving metropolis by the 1770s.<ref>Paul K.  Walker, \"Business and Commerce in Baltimore on the Eve of Independence,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1976 71(3): 296-309,</ref>\n\nThe population reached 14,000 in 1790, but the decade was a rough one for the city. The Bank of England's suspension of specie payments caused the network of Atlantic credit to unravel, leading to a mild recession. The [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798-1800 caused major disruptions to Baltimore's trade in the Caribbean. Finally, a yellow fever epidemic diverted ships from the port, while much of the urban population fled into the countryside. The downturn widened to include every social class and area of economic activity. In response the business community diversified away from an economy based heavily on foreign trade.<ref>Richard S.

Baltimore grew rapidly, becoming the largest city in the American South. It dominated the American flour trade after 1800 due to the milling technology of Oliver Evans, the introduction of steam power in processing, and the merchant-millers' development of drying processes which greatly slowed spoilage. Still, by 1830 [[New York City]]'s competition was felt keenly, and Baltimoreans were hard-pressed to match the merchantability standards despite more rigorous inspection controls than earlier, nor could they match the greater financial resources of their northern rivals.\n\nThe city was the site of the [[Battle of Baltimore]] during the [[War of 1812]]. After [[Burning of Washington|burning Washington, D.C.]], the British attacked Baltimore outside the eastern outskirts of town on the \"Patapsco Neck\" on September 12, at the [[Battle of North Point]], then on the night of September 13\u201314, 1814. United States forces from [[Fort McHenry]] successfully defended the city's harbor from the British.\n\n[[Francis Scott Key]], (1779\u20131843), a Maryland lawyer from [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], was aboard a British ship where he had been negotiating for the release of an American prisoner, Dr. [[William Beanes]]. Key witnessed the bombardment from this ship and after seeing the huge [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]] on the morning of September 14, 1814, he wrote \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", a poem recounting the attack. Key's poem was set to a 1780 drinking song by British composer [[John Stafford Smith]], and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became the official [[national anthem]] of the United States in 1931.\n\nA distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker \"The Monumental City\" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President [[John Quincy Adams]]. At an evening function Adams gave the following toast: \"Baltimore: the Monumental City\u2014May the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant.\"<ref name=\"salgaz\">{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:EANX&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C5DE501F137990&svc_dat=HistArchive:ahnpdoc&req_dat=0F418C809CE5EA70|title=Baltimore, October&nbsp;17|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1827|newspaper=|access-date=October 27, 2008|work=[[Salem Gaz.|Salem Gazette]]|location=Salem, Massachusetts|page=2|url-access=subscription |via=NewsBank}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nAlexander Brown (1764\u20131834), a Protestant immigrant from Ireland, came to the city in 1800 and set up a linen business with his sons. Soon the firm [[Alex. Brown & Sons]] moved into cotton and, to a lesser extent, shipping. Brown's sons opened branches in [[Liverpool]], Philadelphia, and New York. The firm was an enthusiastic supporter of the B&O Railroad. By 1850 it was the leading foreign exchange house in the United States. Brown was a business innovator who observed social conditions carefully and was a transition figure to the era after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] stock during the [[Panic of 1819]], he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the 'traditional' to the 'modern' merchant was nearly complete. It became the nation's first investment bank. It was sold in 1997, but the name lives on as [[Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown]], a division of the Germany's Deutsche Bank.<ref>Gary L.

In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring \"that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.\" Their answer was to build a railroad\u2014one of the first commercial lines in the world. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first [[charter]]ed railroad in the United States; twenty thousand investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line. It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&O became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' in 1829. It built the first [[train station|passenger and freight station]] (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the [[Ohio River]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-2629-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC }}</ref> The railroad was merged into its former rival, the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O), to create \"The Chessie System Railroad.\"  The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System Railroad to create [[CSX]] in 1987, with the letters \"CSX\" referring to \"Chessie,\" Seaboard,\" and \"much more to come.\"\n\nFollowing the B&O's start of regular operations in 1830, other railroads were built in the city.<ref name=\"Harwood\">{{cite book |title=Impossible Challenge II: Baltimore to Washington and Harpers Ferry from 1828 to 1994 |last=Harwood, Jr. |first=Herbert H. |year=1994 |publisher=Barnard, Roberts |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-934118-22-1 }}</ref>{{rp|27}} In the early 1830s the [[Baltimore and Port Deposit Rail Road]] began running trains in the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] area, and later in the decade it reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]].<ref name=\"Harwood\" />{{rp|32}} Also in the 1830s, the [[Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad]] operated trains initially to [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Ownings Mills]], and later into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book| last = White, Jr.| first = John H.| title = A history of the American locomotive: its development, 1830-1880| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1A4iiGAz628C| year = 1980| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| location = Mineola, NY| isbn = 978-0-486-23818-0 }}</ref>{{rp|168}} Both lines were later controlled by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Slavery in Maryland declined steadily after the 1810s as the state's economy shifted away from plantation agriculture, as evangelicalism and a liberal [[manumission]] law encouraged slaveholders to free enslaved people held in bondage, and as other slaveholders practiced \"term slavery,\" registering deeds of manumission but postponing the actual date of freedom for a decade or more. Baltimore's shrinking population of enslaved people often lived and worked alongside the city's growing free black population as \"quasi-freedmen.\" With unskilled and semiskilled employment readily available in the shipyards and related industries, little friction with white workers occurred. Despite the overall poverty of the city's free blacks, compared with the condition of those living in Philadelphia, Charleston, and [[New Orleans]], Baltimore was a \"city of refuge,\" where enslaved and free blacks alike found an unusual amount of freedom. Churches, schools, and fraternal and benevolent associations provided a cushion against hardening white attitudes toward free people of color in the wake of [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner's revolt]] in Virginia in 1831. But a flood of [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants swamped Baltimore's labor market after 1840, driving free blacks deeper into poverty.<ref>Christopher Phillips ''Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1791-1860'' (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Maryland Chemical Works of Baltimore used a mix of free labor, hired slave labor, and enslaved people held by the corporation to work in its factory.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History In Prints 1743-1900|first=Laura|last=Rice|page=77}}</ref> Since chemicals needed constant attention, the rapid turnover of free white labor encouraged the owner to use enslaved workers. While slave labor was about 20 percent cheaper, the company began to reduce its dependence on enslaved labor in 1829 when two slaves ran away and one died.<ref>T. Stephen Whitman, \"Industrial Slavery at the Margin: the Maryland Chemical Works,\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 1993 59(1): 31-62,</ref>\n\nThe location of Baltimore in a border state created opportunities for enslaved people in the city to run away and find freedom in the north\u2014as [[Frederick Douglass]] did. Therefore, slaveholders in Baltimore frequently turned to gradual manumission as a means to secure dependable and productive labor from slaves. In promising freedom after a fixed period of years, slaveholders intended to reduce the costs associated with lifetime servitude while providing slaves incentive for cooperation. Enslaved people tried to negotiate terms of manumission that were more advantageous, and the implicit threat of flight weighed significantly in slaveholders' calculations. The dramatic decrease in the enslaved population during 1850-60 indicates that slavery was no longer profitable in the city. Slaves were still used as expensive house servants: it was cheaper to hire a free worker by the day, with the option of dropping him or replacing him with a better worker, rather than run the expense of maintaining a slave month in and month out with little flexibility.<ref>Stephen Whitman,  \"Manumission and the Transformation of Urban Slavery,\" ''Social Science History'' 1995 19(3): 333-370</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Baltimore had the largest free black community in the nation. About 15 schools for black people were operating, including Sabbath schools operated by Methodists, Presbyterians, and Quakers, along with several private academies. All black schools were self-sustaining, receiving no state or local government funds, and whites in Baltimore generally opposed educating the black population, continuing to tax black property holders to maintain schools from which black children were excluded by law. Baltimore's black community, nevertheless, was one of the largest and most divided in America due to this experience.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\">{{cite book |last=Collier-Thomas |first=Bettye |authorlink= |title=The Baltimore Black Community, 1865-1910 |url= |accessdate= |year=1974 |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing Party and Baltimore politics===\nBaltimore in the [[Third Party System]] had two-party competitive elections, with powerful bosses, carefully orchestrated political violence, and an emerging working-class consciousness at the polls. The fierce politics of the 1850s had galvanized the white workers, most of them German, who opposed slavery. The American Party emerged in the mid-1850s to represent Protestants and to counter the Democratic Party, which was increasingly controlled by [[Catholic Irish]]. When Baltimore erupted in violence at the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s 1861 inauguration, for example, the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] \"Blood Tubs\" that took to the streets were veterans of political rioting. The nativist American ([[Know-Nothing]]) Party captured the Baltimore government in 1854. The party promoted modernization, including professionalizing police and fire departments, expanding the courts, and upgrading the water supply.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown\" (2012) p 470</ref> The party used [[Spoils system|patronage]] and, especially, coercion and election-day violence; its armed gangs scared off Democratic voters, but the Irish and Germans fought back. Voters elected a congressman and governor nominated by the party during its short life. In 1860 the Democrat-controlled legislature took back the city police, the [[state militia|militia]], patronage, and the electoral machinery, and prosecuted some Know-Nothings for electoral fraud. By 1861 the Know-Nothings had split over secession.<ref name=\"Towers\">{{cite book |last=Towers |first=Frank |authorlink= |title=The Urban South and the Coming of the Civil War |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-2297-6 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Baltimore during and after the Civil War: 1861\u20141894 ==\n\n===Civil War===\n[[File:Baltimore Riot 1861.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]]]\nThe Civil War divided Baltimore and Maryland's residents. Much of the social and political elite favored the Confederacy\u2014and indeed owned house slaves. In the 1860 election the city's large German element voted not for Lincoln but for Southern Democrat [[John C. Breckinridge]]. They were less concerned with the abolition of slavery, an issue emphasized by Republicans, and much more with nativism, temperance, and religious beliefs, associated with the Know-Nothing Party and strongly opposed by the Democrats. However the Germans hated slavery and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref name=\"Towers\" />\n\nWhen [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers from the [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|6th Massachusetts Militia]] and some unarmed [[Pennsylvania National Guard|Pennsylvania state militia]] known as the \"Washington Brigade\" from [[Philadelphia]] with their band marched through the city at the start of the war, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers attacked the troops, which led to the first bloodshed in the Civil War during the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]. Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot, which caused Union troops to later occupy Baltimore in May under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts. Maryland came under direct federal administration\u2014in part, to prevent the state from seceding\u2014until the end of the war in April 1865.\n\nWhen Massachusetts troops marched through the city on April 19, 1861, en route to [[Washington, D.C.]], a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rebel mob attacked]]; 4 soldiers and 12 rioters were dead, and 36 soldiers and uncounted rioters had been injured. Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks|Thomas Hicks]] realized action needed to be taken. He convened a special session of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] but moved its location to a site in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], a distance from the secessionist groups. In doing this and by other actions, Hicks managed to neutralize the General Assembly to avoid Maryland's secession from the Union, becoming a hero in the eyes of the Unionists in the state. Meanwhile, pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] gangs burned the bridges connecting Baltimore and Washington to the North, and cut the telegraph lines. Lincoln sent in federal troops under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Ben Butler]]; they seized the city, imposed [[martial law]], and arrested leading Confederate spokesmen. The prisoners were later released and the rail lines reopened, making Baltimore a major Union base during the war.<ref>Browne, ''Baltimore in the Nation, 1789-1861'' (1980); Sheads and Toomey, ''Baltimore during the Civil War'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===African Americans after the Civil War===\nMaryland was not subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but the end of slavery meant heightened racial tensions as free blacks flocked to the city and many armed confrontations erupted between blacks and whites. Rural blacks who flocked to Baltimore created increased competition for skilled jobs and upset the prewar relationship between free blacks and whites. As black migrants were relegated to unskilled work or no work at all, violent strikes erupted. Denied entry into the regular state militia, armed blacks formed militias of their own. In the midst of this change, white Baltimoreans interpreted black discontent as disrespect for law and order, which justified police repression.<ref>Richard Paul Fuke,  \"Blacks, Whites, and Guns: Interracial Violence in Post-emancipation Maryland,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1997 92(3): 326-347</ref>\n[[File:Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House.jpg|alt=Photograph of Sharp Street Church on Dolphin Street|thumb|Sharp Street Church was established 1787 and erected existing building in 1898]]\nBaltimore had a larger population of African Americans than any northern city. The new Maryland state constitution of 1864 ended slavery and provided for the education of all children, including blacks. The Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People established schools for blacks that were taken over by the public school system, which then restricted education for blacks beginning in 1867 when Democrats regained control of the city. Establishing an unequal system that prepared white students for citizenship while using education to reinforce black subjugation, Baltimore's postwar school system exposed the contradictions of race, education, and republicanism in an age when African Americans struggled to realize the ostensible freedoms gained by emancipation.<ref>Robert S. Wolff, \"The Problem of Race in the Age of Freedom: Emancipation and the Transformation of Republican Schooling in Baltimore, 1860-1867,\" ''Civil War History'' 2006 52(3): 229-254</ref> Thus blacks found themselves forced to support [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] legislation and urged that the \"colored schools\" be staffed only with black teachers. From 1867 to 1900 black schools grew from 10 to 27 and enrollment from 901 to 9,383. The Mechanical and Industrial Association achieved success only in 1892 with the opening of the Colored Manual Training School. Black leaders were convinced by the Rev. William Alexander and his newspaper, the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American|Afro American]]'', that economic advancement and first-class citizenship depended on equal access to schools.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\" />\n\n===Economic growth===\n[[File:Baltimore Street Map, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baltimore Street Map, 1892]]\nBy 1880 manufacturing replaced trade and made the city a nationally important industrial center. The port continued to ship increasing amounts of grain, flour, tobacco, and raw cotton to Europe. The new industries of men's clothing, canning, tin and sheet-iron ware products, foundry and machine shop products, cars, and tobacco manufacture had the largest labor force and largest product value.<ref>Eleanor S. Bruchey,  \"The Development of Baltimore Business, 1880-1914,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1969 64(1): 18-42</ref>\n\nThe construction of new housing was a major factor in Baltimore's economy. Vill (1986) examines the activities of major builders between 1869 and 1896, especially as they gained access to building land and capital. Most, but not all, of the major builders were craftsmen who were entrepreneurs compared with others in the building trades, but were still small businessmen who built small numbers of houses during long careers. They worked with landowners, and both groups manipulated the city's leasehold system to their own advantage. Builders obtained credit from a diverse array of sources, including sellers of land, building societies, and land companies. The most important source was individual lenders, who lent money in small amounts either on their own account or through lawyers and trustees overseeing funds held in trust. In spite of their important role in shaping the city, the contractors were small businessmen who rarely achieved citywide visibility.<ref>Martha J. Vill, \"Building Enterprise in Late Nineteenth-Century Baltimore,\" ''Journal of Historical Geograph'' 1986 12(2): 162-181,</ref> Until the 1890s, Baltimore remained a patchwork of nationalities with white natives, [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[History of the Irish in Baltimore|Irish immigrants]], and [[African Americans in Maryland|black Baltimoreans]] scattered throughout the 'social quilt' in heterogeneous neighborhoods.\n\n[[File:Sixth Maryland Regiment firing on the rioters in Baltimore.png|thumb|240px|[[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877]]]]\nBaltimore was the origin of a major [[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877|railroad workers' strike in 1877]] when the B&O company attempted to lower wages. On July 20, 1877, Maryland Governor [[John Lee Carroll]] called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]] to end the strikes, which had disrupted train service at [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in western Maryland. Citizens sympathetic to the railroad workers attacked the National Guard troops as they marched from their armories in Baltimore to [[Camden Station]]. Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired on the crowd, killing 10 and wounding 25. Rioters then damaged B&O trains and burned portions of the rail station. Order was restored in the city on July 21\u201322 when federal troops arrived to protect railroad property and end the strike.\n\n===YWCA===\nExpanded economic activity brought many immigrants from the countryside and from Europe after the Civil War. Concerns for young, single Protestant women alone in cities led to the growth of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) movement. When the Baltimore YWCA was founded in 1883, they only offered their services to white women and so the Colored Women's YWCA was founded in 1896.

The Rebuilding of Baltimore |pages=249ff}}</ref> Baltimore was a poorly managed city in 1890, despite its economic vitality. Already [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and New York were moving to modernize their [[public works]] infrastructures and to support the construction of [[capital-intensive]], technologically sophisticated [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[water supply]] systems. Baltimore lagged behind the other American metropolises because of its culture of privatism and the politicization of its municipal administration. However, during the 1890-1920 period the city responded to the same concerns as Chicago, New York, and Boston. The increase in urban crises, particularly the 1904 fire and the deterioration of sanitary conditions, prompted demands for reform. Moreover, the municipal administration underwent a process of moralization and professionalization in the 20th century. Afterward, Baltimore modeled itself on the other American metropolises and chose to modernize its institutions and address the industrial and urban challenges of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Alan D. |authorlink= |title=The Origin and Resolution of an Urban Crisis: Baltimore, 1890-1930 |series=Johns Hopkins studies in urban affairs |url=https://archive.org/details/originresolution0000ande |accessdate= |year=1977 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780801819704 |page= |pages= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Park planning===\nThe story of the Patapsco Forest Reserve (later renamed the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]]) near Baltimore reveals notable connections between the Progressive-era movements for forest conservation and urban park planning. In 1903, the Patapsco Valley site, although outside the city boundary, was nevertheless identified by the Olmstead Brothers landscape architecture firm as an ideal site to acquire property for future park development. At the same time, the Maryland State Board of Forestry, seeking to establish scientific forestry research, received donated land for this purpose in the Patapsco Valley. Over subsequent decades, a powerful alliance of urban elites, state managers, and city officials assembled thousands of acres along the Patapsco River. The site evolved into a unique hybrid of forest preserve and public park that reflected both its location on the urban fringe and its dual heritage in the conservation and parks movements.<ref>Geoffrey L. Buckley, et al. \"The Patapsco Forest Reserve: Establishing a 'City Park' for Baltimore, 1907-1941,\" ''Historical Geography'' 2006 34: 87-108</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\nWhen in 1918 the US government reversed its draft exemption for married workers and required all men to work in essential occupations or serve in the military, professional baseball players either enlisted or joined industrial baseball leagues. Company leagues included those of [[Bethlehem Steel]], which had recreational leagues on both coasts that by 1918 represented a major-league level of competition. [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], a Bethlehem Steel company town, had a Steel League team, whose results Baltimore baseball fans followed closely. At the same time, fans also followed the draft status and 1918 season of Baltimore native [[Babe Ruth]], then playing with the Boston Red Sox and considering his own options, including joining an industrial league team. In September Bethlehem Steel, fearing competition with other leagues over professional talent, disbanded the Steel League. When the war ended in November, players such as Ruth were free to re-sign with their major league teams.<ref>Peter T. Dalleo, and J. Vincent Watchorn, III, \"Baltimore, the 'Babe,' and the Bethlehem Steel League, 1918,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1998 93(1): 88-106,</ref>\n\n==Depression and War: 1929\u20141949==\nArgersinger (1988) describes the loss of power by traditional Democratic leaders and organizations in Baltimore under the [[New Deal]]. The old-line Democrats operated in the spirit of traditional political bosses who dispensed the patronage. They were, at best, lukewarm Roosevelt supporters because the New Deal threatened their monopoly on patronage. Blacks, other ethnic groups, labor, and other former supporters turned from their patrons to other leadership. Baltimore Mayor Howard W. Jackson's support gradually eroded until he was defeated in a gubernatorial primary election to choose an opponent for a Republican who earlier defeated Governor Albert C. Richie, a conservative Democrat.<ref>Jo Ann E.  Argersinger, ''Toward a New Deal in Baltimore: People and Government in the Great Depression'' (1988)</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Construction of aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant at Baltimore, MD. Machine gun turrets are completely assembled... - NARA - 520744.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling an aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore]]\nBaltimore was a major war production center in [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, on the southeastern edge of the harbor, which built Liberty ships; its work force peaked at 46,700 in late 1943. Even larger was [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft plant located {{convert|10|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. By late 1943 about 150,000 to 200,000 migrant war workers had arrived. They were predominantly poor white southerners; most came from the hills of Virginia, [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], Pennsylvania, [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]]. War mobilization brought federal pressure to unionize the work force, and by 1941 the leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] had organized most of Baltimore's large industries, while the more conservative [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] also gained many new members. By 1945, labor unions and ethnics had taken over local politics and liberal mayors enjoyed black as well as white support. The machine was led by Italian Catholic politicians such as [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s father, [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], who was mayor in 1947\u201359; her brother, [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], was mayor from 1967 to 1971.<ref>Pelosi married and moved to San Francisco in the late 1960s.</ref>\n\n[[John Francis Cronin|Father John F. Cronin]]'s early confrontations with Communists in the World War II-era labor movement turned him into a leading anti-Communist in the Catholic Church and the US government during the [[Cold War]]. Father Cronin, then a prominent Catholic parish priest, saw a united labor movement as central to his moderate, reformist vision for Baltimore's social ills, and worked closely with anti-Communist labor leaders.<ref>Joshua B. Freeman, and Steve Rosswurm, \"The Education of an Anti-Communist: Father John F. Cronin and the Baltimore Labor Movement,\" ''Labor History'' 1992 33(2): 217-247</ref>\n\n==Cold War era==\nIn 1950, the city's population topped out at 950,000 people, of whom 24 percent were black. Then the [[white flight|white movement to the suburbs]] began in earnest, and the population inside the city limits steadily declined and became proportionately more black.\n\n===Schools===\nIntegration of [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore's public schools]] at first went smoothly, as city elites suppressed working class white complaints, as white families migrated to suburban school systems. By the 1970s new problems had surfaced. Formerly white schools had become mostly black schools, though whites still made up most of the faculty and administration. Worse, the school system had become dependent on federal funding. In 1974, these circumstances led to two dramatic incidents. A teachers' strike highlighted the city's unwillingness to raise teachers' salaries because a hike in property taxes would further alienate white residents. A second crisis revolved around a federally mandated desegregation plan that also threatened to alienate the remaining white residents. \n\n===Drugs===\n[[Heroin]] supply and use in Baltimore rose explosively in the 1960s, following a trend of rising drug use across the United States. In the late 1940s there were only a few dozen African-American heroin addicts in the Pennsylvania Avenue area of the city. Heroin use began largely for reasons of prestige within a group that most middle-class blacks looked down on. When the Baltimore police formed the three-man narcotics squad in 1951 there was only moderate profit in drug dealing and shoplifting was the addict's crime of choice. By the late 1950s young whites were using the drug, and by 1960 there were over one thousand heroin addicts in the police files; this figure doubled in the 1960s. A generation of profiteering young, violent black dealers took over in the 1960s as violence increased and the price of heroin skyrocketed. Increasing drug usage was the primary reason for burglaries rising tenfold and robberies rising thirtyfold from 1950 to 1970. Soaring numbers of broken homes and Baltimore's declining economic status probably exacerbated the drug problem. Adolescents in suburban areas began using drugs in the late 1960s.<ref>Jill Jonnes, \"Everybody Must Get Stoned: The Origins Of Modern Drug Culture In Baltimore,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1996 91(2): 132-155</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the black churches, and the ''Afro-American'' weekly newspaper took charge of organizing and publicizing demonstrations. There was no rioting.\n\n[[Read's Drug Store]] in Baltimore was the site of one of the nation's earliest [[sit-in]]s in January 1955. When a handful of black students sat at the store's lunch counter for less than half an hour, it precipitated a wave of desegregation.<ref name=hicks>{{cite news|last=Appleton|first=Andrea|title=Helena Hicks: A participant in the Read's Drug Store sit-in talks about changing history on the spur of the moment|url=http://citypaper.com/news/helena-hicks-1.1274631|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=CityPaper|date=22 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229200403/http://citypaper.com/news/helena-hicks-1.1274631|archive-date=29 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Ron Cassie, \"[http://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2015/1/19/morgan-students-staged-reads-drugstore-sit-in-60-years-ago And Service for All: Sixty years ago, Morgan State College students staged the first successful lunch-counter sit-ins]\", ''Baltimore'' Magazine, 19 January 2015.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and his national [[civil rights movement]] inspired black ministers in Baltimore to mobilize their communities in opposition to local discrimination. The churches were instrumental in keeping lines of communication open between the geographically and politically divided middle-class and poor blacks, a chasm that had widened since the end of World War II. Ministers formed a network across churches and denominations and did much of the face-to-face work of motivating people to organize and protest. In many cases they also adopted King's theology of justice and freedom and altered their preaching styles.<ref>David Milobsky, \"Power from the Pulpit: Baltimore's African-American Clergy, 1950-1970,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine' '1994 89(3): 274-289,</ref>\n\n===1968 unrest===\n{{main|Baltimore riot of 1968|King assassination riots}}\nUnrest in the black inner-city exploded for four nights in April 1968, after news arrived of the assassination of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King]] in Memphis Tennessee.<ref>Peter B.

About a thousand businesses were ransacked or burned, especially liquor stores, supermarkets, furniture stores, and taverns. Many shops never reopened, leaving the burned-out districts permanently under-served by retail stores. Governor [[Spiro T. Agnew]] sent in 5,000 National Guardsmen and imposed an 11 p.m. curfew. That was not enough, so President Lyndon Johnson, at the governor's request, sent in 6,000 U.S. Army combat troops to finally regain control of the city. The episode was a stimulus for an exodus to the suburbs and a political backlash by white voters.<ref>Timothy Wheeler, \"City rioting evokes memories of 1968 unrest'' [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-riots/bs-md-riots-1968-20150428-story.html ''The Baltimore Sun'' 28 April, 2015]</ref> Agnew's statement that \"evil men and not evil conditions\" caused the riots resonated with white ethnic urban voters, and Republican [[Richard Nixon]] selected Agnew as his vice presidential running mate that summer.<ref>Elizabeth Nix and Jessica Elfenbein, eds., ''Baltimore '68: Riots and Rebirth in an American City'' (2011), p. xiii [https://www.amazon.com/Baltimore-68-Riots-Rebirth-American-ebook/dp/B006JY2I2E/ excerpt]</ref>\n\n===Backlash===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, racial politics intensified in Baltimore, as in other cities. White Southerners came to Baltimore for factory jobs during World War II, permanently altering the city's political landscape. The new arrivals approved of the segregated system that had been in effect since the early 20th century. Working whites mobilized to prevent school integration after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of the Supreme Court in 1954. They believed that their interests were being sacrificed to those of black Americans. As working-class whites began to feel increasingly embattled in the face of federal intervention into local practices, many turned to the 1964 presidential primary campaign of [[George Wallace]] who swept the white working class vote. Durr (2003) explains the defection of white working-class voters in Baltimore to the Republican Party as being caused by their fears that the Democratic Party's desegregation policies posed a threat to their families, workplaces, and neighborhoods.<ref>Kenneth Durr, \"When Southern Politics Came North: the Roots of White Working-class Conservatism in Baltimore, 1940-1964,\" ''Labor History'' (1996) 37#3 pp: 309-331; Durr, ''Behind the Backlash: White Working-Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940-1980'' (2003)</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Baltimore's population declined by more than 200,000. The center of gravity has since shifted away from manufacturing and trade to service and knowledge industries, such as medicine and finance.

Such producerist views drew on aspects of the Wesleyan ethic, appropriated the commonweal traditions of 18th-century [[republicanism]], and initially resisted those of classical liberal, individualistic, self-interested capitalism.

The appeals made on behalf of these democratizations, Sutton shows, drew imaginatively on both producerist and Wesleyan rhetoric. By the 1850s, Sutton (1998) shows that the corporate ideals and individual disciplines of religious producerism were expressed in trade unionism, in evangelical missions to workers, in factory preaching, in workers' congregations, in temperance and Sabbatarianism, in the Sunday school movement, and in the politics of Protestant communal hegemony.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />\n\n===Baptists===\nThe Appalachians and southern whites arriving in the 1940s brought along a strong religious tradition with them.

The following year, shipwright Charles Gorsuch settled Whetstone Point, the present location of [[Fort McHenry]]. In 1665, the west side of the Jones Falls on the Inner Harbor was settled when 550 acres of land, thereafter named Cole's Harbor, was granted to Thomas Cole and later sold to David Jones in 1679. [[St. Paul's Episcopal Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Old Saint Paul's Parish]] of [[Baltimore County]] was one of the \"Original Thirty\" parishes designated for the Colony. It included the county of Baltimore and future Baltimore Town and was part of the \"established\" or \"state\" [[Church of England]], also known as the [[Anglican Church]]. It was the first church built in the metro area, erected in 1692 on the Patapsco Neck peninsula in southeastern Baltimore County, along the [[Colgate Creek]] which flowed into the [[Patapsco River]] (present site of today's [[Dundalk, Maryland|Dundalk]] Marine Terminal of the [[Port of Baltimore]]). Jones's stepson James Todd resurveyed Cole's Harbor in 1696. The tract was renamed Todd's Range, which was then sold off in progressively smaller parcels, thereby forming the land that would become the Town of Baltimore thirty years later.\n\nAnother \"Baltimore\" existed on the Bush River as early as 1674. That first county seat of Baltimore County is known today as \"Old Baltimore\". It was located on the Bush River on land that in 1773 became part of [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]].

Unlike many other towns established around that time, Baltimore was more than just existence on paper. [[German American|German immigrants]] began to settle along the [[Chesapeake Bay]] by 1723, living in the Baltimore area. The General Assembly enlarged Baltimore Town in 1745 and incorporated David Jones's original settlement known as Jones Town. Baltimore sent representatives to the Assembly, and over the next two decades it acquired nine parcels of land and annexed neighboring villages including Fells Point to become an important community on the head of the [[Patapsco River]]. As the Town grew, increasing numbers of German Lutheran immigrants established [[Zion Lutheran Church (Baltimore, Maryland)|Zion Church]] in 1755, and later also a German Reformed congregation was organized as the first among the [[Protestant]]s to be represented which also attracted more of these \"[[Pennsylvania Dutch]]\" settlers to the region. Early German settlers also later established the [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German Society of Maryland]] in 1783 in order to foster the German language and German culture in Baltimore.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |title= Significant dates in Baltimore's immigration history |publisher= Baltimore Immigration Memorial Foundation |accessdate= 2012-08-20 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130111231058/http://www.immigrationbaltimore.org/historical_timeline.htm |archive-date= 2013-01-11 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n[[File:Mount Clare Mansion - Front angle.jpg|alt=View of the front of Mount Clare Mansion.|thumb|[[Mount Clare (Maryland)|Mount Clare Mansion]], known today as the Mount Clare Museum House, is the oldest Colonial-era structure in Baltimore.]]\nThroughout the 18th Century, Baltimore drained and filled in marshes (notably Thomas \"Harrison's Marsh\" along the Jones Falls west bank), built canals around the falls and through the center of town, built bridges across the Falls and annexed neighboring [[Jonestown, Baltimore|Jones's Town]] to the northeast in 1745 and expanded southeastward towards the neighboring, bustling, shipbuilding port at [[Fells Point, Baltimore|Fells Point]]. It became by far the largest city in the Middle Atlantic colonies between [[Philadelphia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]. A political deal by the increasingly powerful financial interests in the growing town and with the rapidly growing population, was reached and the county seat with its important center of a courthouse for all Baltimore County was moved from Old Joppa over its citizens enraged protests. Baltimoreans paid some 300 pounds sterling the next year to erect a fine brick courthouse with a bell tower and steeple on a Courthouse Square (future Calvert Street, between East Lexington and Fayette Streets) along with the necessary \"whipping post\", [[stocks]] (for confining heads and arms), podium for making public announcements and news, and a nearby jail, on the northern hills overlooking the harbor basin and with its back sitting over a rugged cliff and bluffs to the northeast with \"Steiger's Meadow\" bordering the twisting loop of the [[Jones Falls]] which bended southwestward before running north again.\n\nDuring the [[American Revolution]], the [[Second Continental Congress]] temporarily fled from Philadelphia and held sessions in Baltimore between December 1776 and February 1777. When the Continental Congress authorized the privateering of British vessels, eager Baltimore merchants accepted the challenge, and as the war progressed, the shipbuilding industry expanded and boomed. There was no major military action near the city though, except for the passing nearby and a feint towards the town by the British [[Royal Navy]] fleet as they headed north up the Chesapeake Bay to land an army at [[Elkton, Maryland|Head of Elk]] in the northeast corner to march on the American capital at [[History of Philadelphia|Philadelphia]] and the following battles at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]] and [[Battle of Germantown|Germantown]].\n\nThe American Revolution stimulated the domestic market for wheat and iron ore, and in Baltimore flour milling increased along the [[Jones Falls|Jones]] and [[Gwynns Falls]]. Iron ore transport greatly boosted the local economy. The British naval blockade hurt Baltimore's shipping, but also freed merchants and traders from British debts, which along with the capture of British merchant vessels furthered Baltimore's economic growth. By 1800 Baltimore had become one of the major cities of the new republic.<ref>Garrett Power,  \"Parceling out Land in the Vicinity of Baltimore: 1632-1796, Part 2,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1993 88(2): 150-180,</ref>\n\nThe economic foundations laid down between 1763 and 1776 were vital to the even greater expansion seen during the Revolutionary War. Though still lagging behind Philadelphia, Baltimore merchants and entrepreneurs produced an expanding commercial community with family businesses and partnerships proliferating in shipping, the flour-milling and grain business, and the indentured servant traffic. International trade focused on four areas: Britain, Southern Europe, the West Indies, and the North American coastal towns. Credit was the essence of the system and a virtual chain of indebtedness meant that bills remained long unpaid and little cash was used among overseas correspondents, merchant wholesalers, and retail customers. Bills of exchange were used extensively, often circulating as currency. Frequent crises of credit, and the wars with France kept prices and markets in constant flux, but men such as William Lux and the Christie brothers produced a maturing economy and a thriving metropolis by the 1770s.<ref>Paul K.  Walker, \"Business and Commerce in Baltimore on the Eve of Independence,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1976 71(3): 296-309,</ref>\n\nThe population reached 14,000 in 1790, but the decade was a rough one for the city. The Bank of England's suspension of specie payments caused the network of Atlantic credit to unravel, leading to a mild recession. The [[Quasi-War]] with France in 1798-1800 caused major disruptions to Baltimore's trade in the Caribbean. Finally, a yellow fever epidemic diverted ships from the port, while much of the urban population fled into the countryside. The downturn widened to include every social class and area of economic activity. In response the business community diversified away from an economy based heavily on foreign trade.<ref>Richard S.

Baltimore grew rapidly, becoming the largest city in the American South. It dominated the American flour trade after 1800 due to the milling technology of Oliver Evans, the introduction of steam power in processing, and the merchant-millers' development of drying processes which greatly slowed spoilage. Still, by 1830 [[New York City]]'s competition was felt keenly, and Baltimoreans were hard-pressed to match the merchantability standards despite more rigorous inspection controls than earlier, nor could they match the greater financial resources of their northern rivals.\n\nThe city was the site of the [[Battle of Baltimore]] during the [[War of 1812]]. After [[Burning of Washington|burning Washington, D.C.]], the British attacked Baltimore outside the eastern outskirts of town on the \"Patapsco Neck\" on September 12, at the [[Battle of North Point]], then on the night of September 13\u201314, 1814. United States forces from [[Fort McHenry]] successfully defended the city's harbor from the British.\n\n[[Francis Scott Key]], (1779\u20131843), a Maryland lawyer from [[Georgetown, D.C.|Georgetown]] and [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], was aboard a British ship where he had been negotiating for the release of an American prisoner, Dr. [[William Beanes]]. Key witnessed the bombardment from this ship and after seeing the huge [[Star-Spangled Banner Flag|American flag]] on the morning of September 14, 1814, he wrote \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", a poem recounting the attack. Key's poem was set to a 1780 drinking song by British composer [[John Stafford Smith]], and \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" became the official [[national anthem]] of the United States in 1931.\n\nA distinctive local culture started to take shape, and a unique skyline peppered with churches and monuments developed. Baltimore acquired its moniker \"The Monumental City\" after an 1827 visit to Baltimore by President [[John Quincy Adams]]. At an evening function Adams gave the following toast: \"Baltimore: the Monumental City\u2014May the days of her safety be as prosperous and happy, as the days of her dangers have been trying and triumphant.\"<ref name=\"salgaz\">{{Cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:EANX&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=10C5DE501F137990&svc_dat=HistArchive:ahnpdoc&req_dat=0F418C809CE5EA70|title=Baltimore, October&nbsp;17|last=|first=|date=October 23, 1827|newspaper=|access-date=October 27, 2008|work=[[Salem Gaz.|Salem Gazette]]|location=Salem, Massachusetts|page=2|url-access=subscription |via=NewsBank}}</ref>\n\n===Finance===\nAlexander Brown (1764\u20131834), a Protestant immigrant from Ireland, came to the city in 1800 and set up a linen business with his sons. Soon the firm [[Alex. Brown & Sons]] moved into cotton and, to a lesser extent, shipping. Brown's sons opened branches in [[Liverpool]], Philadelphia, and New York. The firm was an enthusiastic supporter of the B&O Railroad. By 1850 it was the leading foreign exchange house in the United States. Brown was a business innovator who observed social conditions carefully and was a transition figure to the era after 1819 when cash and short credits became the norms of business relations. By concentrating his capital in small-risk ventures and acquiring ships and [[Second Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]] stock during the [[Panic of 1819]], he came to monopolize Baltimore's shipping trade with Liverpool by 1822. Brown next expanded into packet ships, extended his lines to Philadelphia, and began financing Baltimore importers, specializing in merchant banking from the late 1820s to his death in 1834. The emergence of a money economy and the growth of the Anglo-American cotton trade allowed him to escape Baltimore's declining position in trans-Atlantic trade. His most important innovation was the drawing up of his own bills of exchange. By 1830 his company rivaled the Bank of the United States in the American foreign exchange markets, and the transition from the 'traditional' to the 'modern' merchant was nearly complete. It became the nation's first investment bank. It was sold in 1997, but the name lives on as [[Deutsche Bank Alex. Brown]], a division of the Germany's Deutsche Bank.<ref>Gary L.

In 1827, twenty-five merchants and bankers studied the best means of restoring \"that portion of the Western trade which has recently been diverted from it by the introduction of steam navigation.\" Their answer was to build a railroad\u2014one of the first commercial lines in the world. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] (B&O) became the first [[charter]]ed railroad in the United States; twenty thousand investors purchased $5 million in stock to import the rolling stock and build the line. It was a commercial and financial success, and invented many new managerial methods that became standard practice in railroading and modern business. The B&O became the first company to operate a [[steam locomotive|locomotive]] built in America, with the ''[[Tom Thumb (locomotive)|Tom Thumb]]'' in 1829. It built the first [[train station|passenger and freight station]] (Mount Clare in 1829) and was the first railroad that earned passenger revenues (December 1829), and published a timetable (May 23, 1830). On December 24, 1852, it became the first rail line to reach the [[Ohio River]] from the [[East Coast of the United States|eastern seaboard]].<ref name=\"Dilts\">{{cite book |title=The Great Road: The Building of the Baltimore and Ohio, the Nation's First Railroad, 1828\u20131853 |last=Dilts |first=James D. |year=1996 |publisher=Stanford University Press |location=Palo Alto, CA |isbn=978-0-8047-2629-0 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=JjrCWPwvHzIC }}</ref> The railroad was merged into its former rival, the Chesapeake and Ohio (C&O), to create \"The Chessie System Railroad.\"  The Chessie System merged with the Seaboard System Railroad to create [[CSX]] in 1987, with the letters \"CSX\" referring to \"Chessie,\" Seaboard,\" and \"much more to come.\"\n\nFollowing the B&O's start of regular operations in 1830, other railroads were built in the city.<ref name=\"Harwood\">{{cite book |title=Impossible Challenge II: Baltimore to Washington and Harpers Ferry from 1828 to 1994 |last=Harwood, Jr. |first=Herbert H. |year=1994 |publisher=Barnard, Roberts |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-934118-22-1 }}</ref>{{rp|27}} In the early 1830s the [[Baltimore and Port Deposit Rail Road]] began running trains in the [[Canton, Baltimore|Canton]] area, and later in the decade it reached [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]].<ref name=\"Harwood\" />{{rp|32}} Also in the 1830s, the [[Baltimore and Susquehanna Railroad]] operated trains initially to [[Owings Mills, Maryland|Ownings Mills]], and later into [[Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"White\">{{cite book| last = White, Jr.| first = John H.| title = A history of the American locomotive: its development, 1830-1880| url = https://books.google.com/?id=1A4iiGAz628C| year = 1980| publisher = Courier Dover Publications| location = Mineola, NY| isbn = 978-0-486-23818-0 }}</ref>{{rp|168}} Both lines were later controlled by the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Slavery in Maryland declined steadily after the 1810s as the state's economy shifted away from plantation agriculture, as evangelicalism and a liberal [[manumission]] law encouraged slaveholders to free enslaved people held in bondage, and as other slaveholders practiced \"term slavery,\" registering deeds of manumission but postponing the actual date of freedom for a decade or more. Baltimore's shrinking population of enslaved people often lived and worked alongside the city's growing free black population as \"quasi-freedmen.\" With unskilled and semiskilled employment readily available in the shipyards and related industries, little friction with white workers occurred. Despite the overall poverty of the city's free blacks, compared with the condition of those living in Philadelphia, Charleston, and [[New Orleans]], Baltimore was a \"city of refuge,\" where enslaved and free blacks alike found an unusual amount of freedom. Churches, schools, and fraternal and benevolent associations provided a cushion against hardening white attitudes toward free people of color in the wake of [[Nat Turner's slave rebellion|Nat Turner's revolt]] in Virginia in 1831. But a flood of [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[Irish American|Irish]] immigrants swamped Baltimore's labor market after 1840, driving free blacks deeper into poverty.<ref>Christopher Phillips ''Freedom's Port: The African American Community of Baltimore, 1791-1860'' (1997)</ref>\n\nThe Maryland Chemical Works of Baltimore used a mix of free labor, hired slave labor, and enslaved people held by the corporation to work in its factory.<ref>{{cite book|title=Maryland History In Prints 1743-1900|first=Laura|last=Rice|page=77}}</ref> Since chemicals needed constant attention, the rapid turnover of free white labor encouraged the owner to use enslaved workers. While slave labor was about 20 percent cheaper, the company began to reduce its dependence on enslaved labor in 1829 when two slaves ran away and one died.<ref>T. Stephen Whitman, \"Industrial Slavery at the Margin: the Maryland Chemical Works,\" ''Journal of Southern History'' 1993 59(1): 31-62,</ref>\n\nThe location of Baltimore in a border state created opportunities for enslaved people in the city to run away and find freedom in the north\u2014as [[Frederick Douglass]] did. Therefore, slaveholders in Baltimore frequently turned to gradual manumission as a means to secure dependable and productive labor from slaves. In promising freedom after a fixed period of years, slaveholders intended to reduce the costs associated with lifetime servitude while providing slaves incentive for cooperation. Enslaved people tried to negotiate terms of manumission that were more advantageous, and the implicit threat of flight weighed significantly in slaveholders' calculations. The dramatic decrease in the enslaved population during 1850-60 indicates that slavery was no longer profitable in the city. Slaves were still used as expensive house servants: it was cheaper to hire a free worker by the day, with the option of dropping him or replacing him with a better worker, rather than run the expense of maintaining a slave month in and month out with little flexibility.<ref>Stephen Whitman,  \"Manumission and the Transformation of Urban Slavery,\" ''Social Science History'' 1995 19(3): 333-370</ref>\n\nOn the eve of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], Baltimore had the largest free black community in the nation. About 15 schools for black people were operating, including Sabbath schools operated by Methodists, Presbyterians, and Quakers, along with several private academies. All black schools were self-sustaining, receiving no state or local government funds, and whites in Baltimore generally opposed educating the black population, continuing to tax black property holders to maintain schools from which black children were excluded by law. Baltimore's black community, nevertheless, was one of the largest and most divided in America due to this experience.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\">{{cite book |last=Collier-Thomas |first=Bettye |authorlink= |title=The Baltimore Black Community, 1865-1910 |url= |accessdate= |year=1974 |publisher=George Washington University |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n===Know-Nothing Party and Baltimore politics===\nBaltimore in the [[Third Party System]] had two-party competitive elections, with powerful bosses, carefully orchestrated political violence, and an emerging working-class consciousness at the polls. The fierce politics of the 1850s had galvanized the white workers, most of them German, who opposed slavery. The American Party emerged in the mid-1850s to represent Protestants and to counter the Democratic Party, which was increasingly controlled by [[Catholic Irish]]. When Baltimore erupted in violence at the time of President [[Abraham Lincoln]]'s 1861 inauguration, for example, the pro-[[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] \"Blood Tubs\" that took to the streets were veterans of political rioting. The nativist American ([[Know-Nothing]]) Party captured the Baltimore government in 1854. The party promoted modernization, including professionalizing police and fire departments, expanding the courts, and upgrading the water supply.<ref>Frank Towers, \"Mobtown\" (2012) p 470</ref> The party used [[Spoils system|patronage]] and, especially, coercion and election-day violence; its armed gangs scared off Democratic voters, but the Irish and Germans fought back. Voters elected a congressman and governor nominated by the party during its short life. In 1860 the Democrat-controlled legislature took back the city police, the [[state militia|militia]], patronage, and the electoral machinery, and prosecuted some Know-Nothings for electoral fraud. By 1861 the Know-Nothings had split over secession.<ref name=\"Towers\">{{cite book |last=Towers |first=Frank |authorlink= |title=The Urban South and the Coming of the Civil War |url= |accessdate= |year=2004 |publisher=University of Virginia Press |location=Charlottesville, VA |isbn=0-8139-2297-6 |page= |pages=}}</ref>\n\n== Baltimore during and after the Civil War: 1861\u20141894 ==\n\n===Civil War===\n[[File:Baltimore Riot 1861.jpg|thumb|240px|The [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]]]\nThe Civil War divided Baltimore and Maryland's residents. Much of the social and political elite favored the Confederacy\u2014and indeed owned house slaves. In the 1860 election the city's large German element voted not for Lincoln but for Southern Democrat [[John C. Breckinridge]]. They were less concerned with the abolition of slavery, an issue emphasized by Republicans, and much more with nativism, temperance, and religious beliefs, associated with the Know-Nothing Party and strongly opposed by the Democrats. However the Germans hated slavery and supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref name=\"Towers\" />\n\nWhen [[Union Army|Union]] soldiers from the [[6th Regiment Massachusetts Volunteer Militia|6th Massachusetts Militia]] and some unarmed [[Pennsylvania National Guard|Pennsylvania state militia]] known as the \"Washington Brigade\" from [[Philadelphia]] with their band marched through the city at the start of the war, [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathizers attacked the troops, which led to the first bloodshed in the Civil War during the [[Baltimore riot of 1861]]. Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed during the riot, which caused Union troops to later occupy Baltimore in May under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] of Massachusetts. Maryland came under direct federal administration\u2014in part, to prevent the state from seceding\u2014until the end of the war in April 1865.\n\nWhen Massachusetts troops marched through the city on April 19, 1861, en route to [[Washington, D.C.]], a [[Baltimore riot of 1861|rebel mob attacked]]; 4 soldiers and 12 rioters were dead, and 36 soldiers and uncounted rioters had been injured. Governor [[Thomas Holliday Hicks|Thomas Hicks]] realized action needed to be taken. He convened a special session of the [[Maryland General Assembly|General Assembly]] but moved its location to a site in [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]], a distance from the secessionist groups. In doing this and by other actions, Hicks managed to neutralize the General Assembly to avoid Maryland's secession from the Union, becoming a hero in the eyes of the Unionists in the state. Meanwhile, pro-[[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] gangs burned the bridges connecting Baltimore and Washington to the North, and cut the telegraph lines. Lincoln sent in federal troops under Gen. [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Ben Butler]]; they seized the city, imposed [[martial law]], and arrested leading Confederate spokesmen. The prisoners were later released and the rail lines reopened, making Baltimore a major Union base during the war.<ref>Browne, ''Baltimore in the Nation, 1789-1861'' (1980); Sheads and Toomey, ''Baltimore during the Civil War'' (1997).</ref>\n\n===African Americans after the Civil War===\nMaryland was not subject to [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], but the end of slavery meant heightened racial tensions as free blacks flocked to the city and many armed confrontations erupted between blacks and whites. Rural blacks who flocked to Baltimore created increased competition for skilled jobs and upset the prewar relationship between free blacks and whites. As black migrants were relegated to unskilled work or no work at all, violent strikes erupted. Denied entry into the regular state militia, armed blacks formed militias of their own. In the midst of this change, white Baltimoreans interpreted black discontent as disrespect for law and order, which justified police repression.<ref>Richard Paul Fuke,  \"Blacks, Whites, and Guns: Interracial Violence in Post-emancipation Maryland,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1997 92(3): 326-347</ref>\n[[File:Sharp Street Memorial United Methodist Church and Community House.jpg|alt=Photograph of Sharp Street Church on Dolphin Street|thumb|Sharp Street Church was established 1787 and erected existing building in 1898]]\nBaltimore had a larger population of African Americans than any northern city. The new Maryland state constitution of 1864 ended slavery and provided for the education of all children, including blacks. The Baltimore Association for the Moral and Educational Improvement of the Colored People established schools for blacks that were taken over by the public school system, which then restricted education for blacks beginning in 1867 when Democrats regained control of the city. Establishing an unequal system that prepared white students for citizenship while using education to reinforce black subjugation, Baltimore's postwar school system exposed the contradictions of race, education, and republicanism in an age when African Americans struggled to realize the ostensible freedoms gained by emancipation.<ref>Robert S. Wolff, \"The Problem of Race in the Age of Freedom: Emancipation and the Transformation of Republican Schooling in Baltimore, 1860-1867,\" ''Civil War History'' 2006 52(3): 229-254</ref> Thus blacks found themselves forced to support [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] legislation and urged that the \"colored schools\" be staffed only with black teachers. From 1867 to 1900 black schools grew from 10 to 27 and enrollment from 901 to 9,383. The Mechanical and Industrial Association achieved success only in 1892 with the opening of the Colored Manual Training School. Black leaders were convinced by the Rev. William Alexander and his newspaper, the ''[[Baltimore Afro-American|Afro American]]'', that economic advancement and first-class citizenship depended on equal access to schools.<ref name=\"Collier-Thomas\" />\n\n===Economic growth===\n[[File:Baltimore Street Map, 1892.jpg|thumb|Baltimore Street Map, 1892]]\nBy 1880 manufacturing replaced trade and made the city a nationally important industrial center. The port continued to ship increasing amounts of grain, flour, tobacco, and raw cotton to Europe. The new industries of men's clothing, canning, tin and sheet-iron ware products, foundry and machine shop products, cars, and tobacco manufacture had the largest labor force and largest product value.<ref>Eleanor S. Bruchey,  \"The Development of Baltimore Business, 1880-1914,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1969 64(1): 18-42</ref>\n\nThe construction of new housing was a major factor in Baltimore's economy. Vill (1986) examines the activities of major builders between 1869 and 1896, especially as they gained access to building land and capital. Most, but not all, of the major builders were craftsmen who were entrepreneurs compared with others in the building trades, but were still small businessmen who built small numbers of houses during long careers. They worked with landowners, and both groups manipulated the city's leasehold system to their own advantage. Builders obtained credit from a diverse array of sources, including sellers of land, building societies, and land companies. The most important source was individual lenders, who lent money in small amounts either on their own account or through lawyers and trustees overseeing funds held in trust. In spite of their important role in shaping the city, the contractors were small businessmen who rarely achieved citywide visibility.<ref>Martha J. Vill, \"Building Enterprise in Late Nineteenth-Century Baltimore,\" ''Journal of Historical Geograph'' 1986 12(2): 162-181,</ref> Until the 1890s, Baltimore remained a patchwork of nationalities with white natives, [[History of the Germans in Baltimore|German]] and [[History of the Irish in Baltimore|Irish immigrants]], and [[African Americans in Maryland|black Baltimoreans]] scattered throughout the 'social quilt' in heterogeneous neighborhoods.\n\n[[File:Sixth Maryland Regiment firing on the rioters in Baltimore.png|thumb|240px|[[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877]]]]\nBaltimore was the origin of a major [[Baltimore railroad strike of 1877|railroad workers' strike in 1877]] when the B&O company attempted to lower wages. On July 20, 1877, Maryland Governor [[John Lee Carroll]] called up the 5th and 6th Regiments of the [[Maryland Army National Guard|National Guard]] to end the strikes, which had disrupted train service at [[Cumberland, Maryland|Cumberland]] in western Maryland. Citizens sympathetic to the railroad workers attacked the National Guard troops as they marched from their armories in Baltimore to [[Camden Station]]. Soldiers from the 6th Regiment fired on the crowd, killing 10 and wounding 25. Rioters then damaged B&O trains and burned portions of the rail station. Order was restored in the city on July 21\u201322 when federal troops arrived to protect railroad property and end the strike.\n\n===YWCA===\nExpanded economic activity brought many immigrants from the countryside and from Europe after the Civil War. Concerns for young, single Protestant women alone in cities led to the growth of the [[Young Women's Christian Association]] (YWCA) movement. When the Baltimore YWCA was founded in 1883, they only offered their services to white women and so the Colored Women's YWCA was founded in 1896.

The Rebuilding of Baltimore |pages=249ff}}</ref> Baltimore was a poorly managed city in 1890, despite its economic vitality. Already [[Boston]], [[Chicago]], and New York were moving to modernize their [[public works]] infrastructures and to support the construction of [[capital-intensive]], technologically sophisticated [[Sanitary sewer|sewer]] and [[water supply]] systems. Baltimore lagged behind the other American metropolises because of its culture of privatism and the politicization of its municipal administration. However, during the 1890-1920 period the city responded to the same concerns as Chicago, New York, and Boston. The increase in urban crises, particularly the 1904 fire and the deterioration of sanitary conditions, prompted demands for reform. Moreover, the municipal administration underwent a process of moralization and professionalization in the 20th century. Afterward, Baltimore modeled itself on the other American metropolises and chose to modernize its institutions and address the industrial and urban challenges of the era.<ref>{{cite book |last=Anderson |first=Alan D. |authorlink= |title=The Origin and Resolution of an Urban Crisis: Baltimore, 1890-1930 |series=Johns Hopkins studies in urban affairs |url=https://archive.org/details/originresolution0000ande |accessdate= |year=1977 |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=9780801819704 |page= |pages= |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\n===Park planning===\nThe story of the Patapsco Forest Reserve (later renamed the [[Patapsco Valley State Park]]) near Baltimore reveals notable connections between the Progressive-era movements for forest conservation and urban park planning. In 1903, the Patapsco Valley site, although outside the city boundary, was nevertheless identified by the Olmstead Brothers landscape architecture firm as an ideal site to acquire property for future park development. At the same time, the Maryland State Board of Forestry, seeking to establish scientific forestry research, received donated land for this purpose in the Patapsco Valley. Over subsequent decades, a powerful alliance of urban elites, state managers, and city officials assembled thousands of acres along the Patapsco River. The site evolved into a unique hybrid of forest preserve and public park that reflected both its location on the urban fringe and its dual heritage in the conservation and parks movements.<ref>Geoffrey L. Buckley, et al. \"The Patapsco Forest Reserve: Establishing a 'City Park' for Baltimore, 1907-1941,\" ''Historical Geography'' 2006 34: 87-108</ref>\n\n===Baseball===\nWhen in 1918 the US government reversed its draft exemption for married workers and required all men to work in essential occupations or serve in the military, professional baseball players either enlisted or joined industrial baseball leagues. Company leagues included those of [[Bethlehem Steel]], which had recreational leagues on both coasts that by 1918 represented a major-league level of competition. [[Sparrows Point, Maryland]], a Bethlehem Steel company town, had a Steel League team, whose results Baltimore baseball fans followed closely. At the same time, fans also followed the draft status and 1918 season of Baltimore native [[Babe Ruth]], then playing with the Boston Red Sox and considering his own options, including joining an industrial league team. In September Bethlehem Steel, fearing competition with other leagues over professional talent, disbanded the Steel League. When the war ended in November, players such as Ruth were free to re-sign with their major league teams.<ref>Peter T. Dalleo, and J. Vincent Watchorn, III, \"Baltimore, the 'Babe,' and the Bethlehem Steel League, 1918,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1998 93(1): 88-106,</ref>\n\n==Depression and War: 1929\u20141949==\nArgersinger (1988) describes the loss of power by traditional Democratic leaders and organizations in Baltimore under the [[New Deal]]. The old-line Democrats operated in the spirit of traditional political bosses who dispensed the patronage. They were, at best, lukewarm Roosevelt supporters because the New Deal threatened their monopoly on patronage. Blacks, other ethnic groups, labor, and other former supporters turned from their patrons to other leadership. Baltimore Mayor Howard W. Jackson's support gradually eroded until he was defeated in a gubernatorial primary election to choose an opponent for a Republican who earlier defeated Governor Albert C. Richie, a conservative Democrat.<ref>Jo Ann E.  Argersinger, ''Toward a New Deal in Baltimore: People and Government in the Great Depression'' (1988)</ref>\n\n===World War II===\n[[File:Construction of aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant at Baltimore, MD. Machine gun turrets are completely assembled... - NARA - 520744.jpg|thumb|Worker assembling an aircraft at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Baltimore]]\nBaltimore was a major war production center in [[World War II]]. The biggest operations were Bethlehem Steel's Fairfield Yard, on the southeastern edge of the harbor, which built Liberty ships; its work force peaked at 46,700 in late 1943. Even larger was [[Glenn L. Martin Company|Glenn Martin]], an aircraft plant located {{convert|10|mi|km}} northeast of downtown. By late 1943 about 150,000 to 200,000 migrant war workers had arrived. They were predominantly poor white southerners; most came from the hills of Virginia, [[North Carolina]], [[West Virginia]], Pennsylvania, [[Kentucky]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]]. War mobilization brought federal pressure to unionize the work force, and by 1941 the leftist [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]] had organized most of Baltimore's large industries, while the more conservative [[American Federation of Labor|AFL]] also gained many new members. By 1945, labor unions and ethnics had taken over local politics and liberal mayors enjoyed black as well as white support. The machine was led by Italian Catholic politicians such as [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s father, [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], who was mayor in 1947\u201359; her brother, [[Thomas D'Alesandro III]], was mayor from 1967 to 1971.<ref>Pelosi married and moved to San Francisco in the late 1960s.</ref>\n\n[[John Francis Cronin|Father John F. Cronin]]'s early confrontations with Communists in the World War II-era labor movement turned him into a leading anti-Communist in the Catholic Church and the US government during the [[Cold War]]. Father Cronin, then a prominent Catholic parish priest, saw a united labor movement as central to his moderate, reformist vision for Baltimore's social ills, and worked closely with anti-Communist labor leaders.<ref>Joshua B. Freeman, and Steve Rosswurm, \"The Education of an Anti-Communist: Father John F. Cronin and the Baltimore Labor Movement,\" ''Labor History'' 1992 33(2): 217-247</ref>\n\n==Cold War era==\nIn 1950, the city's population topped out at 950,000 people, of whom 24 percent were black. Then the [[white flight|white movement to the suburbs]] began in earnest, and the population inside the city limits steadily declined and became proportionately more black.\n\n===Schools===\nIntegration of [[Baltimore City Public Schools|Baltimore's public schools]] at first went smoothly, as city elites suppressed working class white complaints, as white families migrated to suburban school systems. By the 1970s new problems had surfaced. Formerly white schools had become mostly black schools, though whites still made up most of the faculty and administration. Worse, the school system had become dependent on federal funding. In 1974, these circumstances led to two dramatic incidents. A teachers' strike highlighted the city's unwillingness to raise teachers' salaries because a hike in property taxes would further alienate white residents. A second crisis revolved around a federally mandated desegregation plan that also threatened to alienate the remaining white residents. \n\n===Drugs===\n[[Heroin]] supply and use in Baltimore rose explosively in the 1960s, following a trend of rising drug use across the United States. In the late 1940s there were only a few dozen African-American heroin addicts in the Pennsylvania Avenue area of the city. Heroin use began largely for reasons of prestige within a group that most middle-class blacks looked down on. When the Baltimore police formed the three-man narcotics squad in 1951 there was only moderate profit in drug dealing and shoplifting was the addict's crime of choice. By the late 1950s young whites were using the drug, and by 1960 there were over one thousand heroin addicts in the police files; this figure doubled in the 1960s. A generation of profiteering young, violent black dealers took over in the 1960s as violence increased and the price of heroin skyrocketed. Increasing drug usage was the primary reason for burglaries rising tenfold and robberies rising thirtyfold from 1950 to 1970. Soaring numbers of broken homes and Baltimore's declining economic status probably exacerbated the drug problem. Adolescents in suburban areas began using drugs in the late 1960s.<ref>Jill Jonnes, \"Everybody Must Get Stoned: The Origins Of Modern Drug Culture In Baltimore,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine'' 1996 91(2): 132-155</ref>\n\n===Civil rights===\nIn the 1930s and 1940s the local chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the black churches, and the ''Afro-American'' weekly newspaper took charge of organizing and publicizing demonstrations. There was no rioting.\n\n[[Read's Drug Store]] in Baltimore was the site of one of the nation's earliest [[sit-in]]s in January 1955. When a handful of black students sat at the store's lunch counter for less than half an hour, it precipitated a wave of desegregation.<ref name=hicks>{{cite news|last=Appleton|first=Andrea|title=Helena Hicks: A participant in the Read's Drug Store sit-in talks about changing history on the spur of the moment|url=http://citypaper.com/news/helena-hicks-1.1274631|accessdate=22 February 2012|newspaper=CityPaper|date=22 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229200403/http://citypaper.com/news/helena-hicks-1.1274631|archive-date=29 February 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>Ron Cassie, \"[http://www.baltimoremagazine.com/2015/1/19/morgan-students-staged-reads-drugstore-sit-in-60-years-ago And Service for All: Sixty years ago, Morgan State College students staged the first successful lunch-counter sit-ins]\", ''Baltimore'' Magazine, 19 January 2015.</ref>\n\nIn the late 1950s [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and his national [[civil rights movement]] inspired black ministers in Baltimore to mobilize their communities in opposition to local discrimination. The churches were instrumental in keeping lines of communication open between the geographically and politically divided middle-class and poor blacks, a chasm that had widened since the end of World War II. Ministers formed a network across churches and denominations and did much of the face-to-face work of motivating people to organize and protest. In many cases they also adopted King's theology of justice and freedom and altered their preaching styles.<ref>David Milobsky, \"Power from the Pulpit: Baltimore's African-American Clergy, 1950-1970,\" ''Maryland Historical Magazine' '1994 89(3): 274-289,</ref>\n\n===1968 unrest===\n{{main|Baltimore riot of 1968|King assassination riots}}\nUnrest in the black inner-city exploded for four nights in April 1968, after news arrived of the assassination of the Reverend [[Martin Luther King]] in Memphis Tennessee.<ref>Peter B.

About a thousand businesses were ransacked or burned, especially liquor stores, supermarkets, furniture stores, and taverns. Many shops never reopened, leaving the burned-out districts permanently under-served by retail stores. Governor [[Spiro T. Agnew]] sent in 5,000 National Guardsmen and imposed an 11 p.m. curfew. That was not enough, so President Lyndon Johnson, at the governor's request, sent in 6,000 U.S. Army combat troops to finally regain control of the city. The episode was a stimulus for an exodus to the suburbs and a political backlash by white voters.<ref>Timothy Wheeler, \"City rioting evokes memories of 1968 unrest'' [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-riots/bs-md-riots-1968-20150428-story.html ''The Baltimore Sun'' 28 April, 2015]</ref> Agnew's statement that \"evil men and not evil conditions\" caused the riots resonated with white ethnic urban voters, and Republican [[Richard Nixon]] selected Agnew as his vice presidential running mate that summer.<ref>Elizabeth Nix and Jessica Elfenbein, eds., ''Baltimore '68: Riots and Rebirth in an American City'' (2011), p. xiii [https://www.amazon.com/Baltimore-68-Riots-Rebirth-American-ebook/dp/B006JY2I2E/ excerpt]</ref>\n\n===Backlash===\nIn the 1950s and 1960s, racial politics intensified in Baltimore, as in other cities. White Southerners came to Baltimore for factory jobs during World War II, permanently altering the city's political landscape. The new arrivals approved of the segregated system that had been in effect since the early 20th century. Working whites mobilized to prevent school integration after the ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' decision of the Supreme Court in 1954. They believed that their interests were being sacrificed to those of black Americans. As working-class whites began to feel increasingly embattled in the face of federal intervention into local practices, many turned to the 1964 presidential primary campaign of [[George Wallace]] who swept the white working class vote. Durr (2003) explains the defection of white working-class voters in Baltimore to the Republican Party as being caused by their fears that the Democratic Party's desegregation policies posed a threat to their families, workplaces, and neighborhoods.<ref>Kenneth Durr, \"When Southern Politics Came North: the Roots of White Working-class Conservatism in Baltimore, 1940-1964,\" ''Labor History'' (1996) 37#3 pp: 309-331; Durr, ''Behind the Backlash: White Working-Class Politics in Baltimore, 1940-1980'' (2003)</ref>\n\nBetween 1950 and 1990, Baltimore's population declined by more than 200,000. The center of gravity has since shifted away from manufacturing and trade to service and knowledge industries, such as medicine and finance.

Such producerist views drew on aspects of the Wesleyan ethic, appropriated the commonweal traditions of 18th-century [[republicanism]], and initially resisted those of classical liberal, individualistic, self-interested capitalism.

The appeals made on behalf of these democratizations, Sutton shows, drew imaginatively on both producerist and Wesleyan rhetoric. By the 1850s, Sutton (1998) shows that the corporate ideals and individual disciplines of religious producerism were expressed in trade unionism, in evangelical missions to workers, in factory preaching, in workers' congregations, in temperance and Sabbatarianism, in the Sunday school movement, and in the politics of Protestant communal hegemony.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />\n\n===Baptists===\nThe Appalachians and southern whites arriving in the 1940s brought along a strong religious tradition with them.

It was replaced by a bigger building, the current Zion Church on North Gay Street and East Lexington Street erected from 1807 to 1808.

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies, introduced a national [[loyalty program]], and enforced [[Fair trade coffee|fair trade]] standards. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nA noted author of business literature, he has [[Howard Schultz#Author|written four books]]: ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), ''For Love of Country'' (2014) and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|politically centrist]] views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join all three contests because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum and is widely considered to be a [[New Democrats|centrist Democrat]] ideologically. His positions on domestic politics are socially liberal and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally moderate]]. In foreign policy, he is seen as a \"[[liberal hawk]]\", favoring [[Polarity (international relations)|American-led]] international affairs and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|neoliberalism]].

He served as the chairman and [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) of the [[Starbucks|Starbucks Coffee Corporation]] for more than two decades; first from 1986 to 2000, and then from 2008 to 2017. After stepping down as CEO, Schultz stayed at the company from 2017 to 2018 as its executive chairman overseeing Starbucks's philanthropic and charitable giving arm. Leading the firm for nearly four decades, he is the [[Starbucks#History|longest-serving head]] of the coffeehouse. Schultz owned the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] from 2001 to 2006, a basketball franchise that he sold for US$350 million to [[Clay Bennett (businessman)|Clay Bennett]], who [[Seattle SuperSonics relocation to Oklahoma City|moved the NBA team]] to Oklahoma creating the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]]. <!--The lack of citations is purposeful.

The large lead is OK given the content in the article and Wikipedia's MOS:INTRO policy.-->\n\nBorn and raised in the [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn borough]] of New York, Schultz graduated from [[Northern Michigan University]] in 1975. After briefly selling office equipment door-to-door one of his early clients, the then coffeehouse startup Starbucks, onboarded him as their marketing and operations head in 1982. A business trip to [[Milan|Milan, Italy]] and the [[Coffee in Italy|country's coffee culture]] inspired him to open Il Giornale, a specialty coffeeshop that  merged with Starbucks during the late-1980s. Schultz pushed the new company to sell more than coffee beans and equipment, quickly establishing a large network of stores that served espresso, coffee, teas, and casual food. Following large-scale distribution deals \u2013 particularly with major hotels, groceries, and bookstores \u2013 Starbucks became the [[List of coffeehouse chains|largest coffee-house chain]] in the world.<!--Cited in body.--> Schultz took the company [[Initial public offering|public]] in 1992 and used a $271 million valuation to double their store count in a series of  highly publicized [[coffee wars]]. He stepped down in 2000 to focus on Starbucks' international expansion, succeeded by [[Orin C. Smith|Orin Smith]].<!--Second tenure as CEO, 2008 to 2017.-->\n\nDuring the [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]], Schultz returned as chief executive to stabilize the company after years of unsustainable growth. Succeeding [[Jim Donald (businessman)|Jim Donald]], Schultz led a mass-firing of executives, shuttered hundreds of weak stores, and temporarily closed all U.S. stores to retrain employees in making espresso. He orchestrated multiple acquisitions of American and Chinese beverage companies, introduced a national [[loyalty program]], and enforced [[Fair trade coffee|fair trade]] standards. His aggressive expansion in Chinese markets has been credited with reconciling the [[Chinese tea culture|country's tea-culture]] with [[Coffee production in China|coffee consumption in China]]. Schultz's positioning of Starbucks as a social hub (\"[[Howard Schultz#Career|third place]]\") is widely seen as introducing the [[Third wave of coffee#History|second wave]] of coffee culture in the U.S., particularly in [[Seattle]]. His second tenure sustained both<!--Cited in body.--> [[Criticism of Starbucks|significant and sustained criticism]] as well as growth, ultimately adding nearly $100 billion in [[market capitalization]] to the company, a 21,000% increase in [[shareholder value]]. <!--Cited in body.-->Schultz was succeeded by [[Kevin Johnson (executive)|Kevin Johnson]] as CEO in April 2017, and has, since 2018, retained the title \"Chairman emeritus\" of Starbucks. \n\nA noted author of business literature, he has [[Howard Schultz#Author|written four books]]: ''Pour Your Heart Into It'' (1997), ''Onward'' (2011), ''For Love of Country'' (2014) and ''From the Ground Up'' (2019). Long known for his outspoken [[Centrism|politically centrist]] views, Schultz considered a candidacy in the [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]], [[2016 United States presidential election|2016,]] and [[2020 United States presidential election|2020 U.S. presidential elections]] as an independent candidate. He declined to join all three contests because of the [[Political parties in the United States|two-party system]] and fears of [[Spoiler effect|splitting the vote]]. Schultz supports [[bipartisanship]] across the political spectrum and is widely considered to be a [[New Democrats|centrist Democrat]] ideologically. His positions on domestic politics are socially liberal and [[Fiscal conservatism|fiscally moderate]]. In foreign policy, he is seen as a \"[[liberal hawk]]\", favoring [[Polarity (international relations)|American-led]] international affairs and [[Neoliberalism (international relations)|institutionalism]]. Schultz was named the [[The World's Billionaires|680th-richest person in the U.S.]] by ''Forbes'' with a [[net worth]] of $4.0 billion (April 2020).<ref name=\":26\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/profile/howard-schultz/#6de1621452c6|title=Howard Schultz|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=April 2, 2019}}</ref> To further his private philanthropic efforts, he established the Schultz Family Foundation which focuses on helping military veterans and fighting [[youth unemployment]].<!--Leave space for {{TOC}}.-->\n\n== Early life and education ==\nHoward D.

In the 1960s, international business courses were introduced and soon became an important focus of the school's curriculum. The New York University, Graduate School of Business Administration, C.J. Devine Institute of Finance (1959\u20131966) published many key Finance and Investment bulletins related to International finance. The school awarded its first Doctor of Commercial Sciences degree in 1970.\n<!--a series of publications followed...

Prominent investment banker and Home Depot investor [[Kenneth Langone]] (MBA 1960) donated $10 million to Stern in 1999. The Langone MBA for Working Professionals was renamed in his honor. Celebrating its 100th birthday in the year 2000, Stern launched a $100 million centennial campaign, the school's most ambitious fundraising effort to date.

{"title_page": "Go and mathematics", "text_new": "{{GoBoardGame}}\nThe game of [[Go (board game)|Go]] is one of the most popular games in the world. As a result of its elegant and simple rules, the game has long been an inspiration for [[mathematical]] research. [[Shen Kuo]], a Chinese scholar in 11th century, estimated that the number of possible board positions is around 10<sup>172</sup> in ''[[The Dream Pool Essays]]''. In more recent years, research of the game by [[John Horton Conway|John H. Conway]] led to the invention of the [[surreal number]]s and contributed to development of [[combinatorial game theory]] (with Go Infinitesimals<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoInfinitesimals Go Infinitesimals]</ref> being a specific example of its use in Go).\n\n==Computational complexity==\n\nGeneralized Go is played on ''n x n'' boards, and the [[Complexity class|computational complexity]] of determining the winner in a given position of generalized Go depends crucially on the [[ko rule]]s.\n\nGo is \u201calmost\u201d in [[PSPACE]], since in normal play, moves are not reversible, and it is only through capture that there is the possibility of the repeating patterns necessary for a harder complexity.\n\n===Without Ko===\n\nWithout ko, Go is [[PSPACE-hard]].<ref name=\"sipser1980\">{{cite journal|last1=Lichtenstein|first1=David|last2=Sipser|first2=Michael|title=Go Is Polynomial-Space Hard|journal=Journal of the ACM|date=April 1980|volume=27|issue=2|pages=393\u2013401|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/go/seminar/2003/030331/p393-lichtenstein.pdf|doi=10.1145/322186.322201}}</ref> This is proved by reducing [[True Quantified Boolean Formula#PSPACE-completeness|True Quantified Boolean Formula]], which is known to be PSPACE-complete, to [[generalized geography]], to planar generalized geography, to [[Generalized geography#Planar bipartite graph with maximum degree 3|planar generalized geography with maximum degree 3]], finally to Go positions.\n\nGo with superko is not known to be in PSPACE. Though actual games seem never to last longer than <math>n^2</math> moves, in general it is not known if there were a polynomial bound on the length of Go games. If there were, Go would be PSPACE-complete. As it currently stands, it might be PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME-complete, or even EXPSPACE-complete.\n\n===Japanese ko rule===\n\nJapanese ko rules state that only the basic ko, that is, a move that reverts the board to the situation one move previously, is forbidden. Longer repetitive situations are allowed, thus potentially allowing a game to loop forever, such as the triple ko, where there are three kos at the same time, allowing a cycle of 12 moves.\n\nWith Japanese ko rules, Go is [[EXPTIME]]-complete.<ref name=\"robson1983\">{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=John|title=The complexity of Go|journal=Proceedings of the IFIP 9th World Computer Congress on Information Processing|date=1983|pages=413\u2013417}}</ref>\n\n===Superko rule===\n\nThe [[superko rule]] (also called the positional superko rule) states that a repetition of any board position that has previously occurred is forbidden. This is the ko rule used in most Chinese and US rulesets.\n\nIt is an open problem what the complexity class of Go is under superko rule. Though Go with Japanese ko rule is EXPTIME-complete, both the lower and the upper bounds of Robson\u2019s EXPTIME-completeness proof<ref name=\"robson1983\" /> break when the superko rule is added.\n\nIt is known that it is at least PSPACE-hard, since the proof in<ref name=\"sipser1980\" /> of the PSPACE-hardness of Go does not rely on the ko rule, or lack of the ko rule. It is also known that Go is in EXPSPACE.<ref name=\"robson1984\">{{cite book|last1=Robson|first1=J|title=Combinatorial games with exponential space complete decision problems|journal=Proceedings of the Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science|volume=176|date=1984|pages=498\u2013506|doi=10.1007/BFb0030333|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-13372-8}}</ref>\n\nRobson<ref name=\"robson1984\" /> showed that if the superko rule, that is, \u201cno previous position may ever be recreated\u201d, is added to certain two-player games that are EXPTIME-complete, then the new games would be EXPSPACE-complete. Intuitively, this is because an exponential amount of space is required even to determine the legal moves from a position, because the game history leading up to a position could be exponentially long.\n\nAs a result, superko variants (moves that repeat a previous board position are not allowed) of generalized [[chess]] and [[checkers]] are EXPSPACE-complete, since generalized chess<ref name=\"Fraenkel1981\">{{cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

However, this result does not apply to Go.<ref name=\"robson1984\" />\n\n===Complexity of certain Go configurations===\n\nA Go endgame begins when the board is divided into areas that are isolated from all other local areas by living stones, such that each local area has a polynomial size canonical game tree. In the language of [[combinatorial game theory]], it happens when a Go game decomposes into a sum of subgames with polynomial size canonical game trees.\n\nWith that definition, Go endgames are PSPACE-hard.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolfe|first1=David|editor1-last=Nowakowski|editor1-first=Richard J.|title=Go endgames are PSPACE-hard|journal=More Games of No Chance, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute Publications 42|date=2002|pages=125\u2013136|url=http://library.msri.org/books/Book42/files/wolfe.pdf}}</ref>\n\nThis is proven by converting the [[True quantified Boolean formula|Quantified Boolean Formula]] problem, which is PSPACE-complete, into a sum of small (with polynomial size canonical game trees) Go subgames.

Conway]] led to the invention of the [[surreal number]]s and contributed to development of [[combinatorial game theory]] (with Go Infinitesimals<ref>[http://senseis.xmp.net/?GoInfinitesimals Go Infinitesimals]</ref> being a specific example of its use in Go).\n\n==Computational complexity==\n\nGeneralized Go is played on ''n x n'' boards, and the [[Complexity class|computational complexity]] of determining the winner in a given position of generalized Go depends crucially on the [[ko rule]]s.\n\nGo is \u201calmost\u201d in [[PSPACE]], since in normal play, moves are not reversible, and it is only through capture that there is the possibility of the repeating patterns necessary for a harder complexity.\n\n===Without Ko===\n\nWithout ko, Go is [[PSPACE-hard]].<ref name=\"sipser1980\">{{cite journal|last1=Lichtenstein|first1=David|last2=Sipser|first2=Michael|title=Go Is Polynomial-Space Hard|journal=Journal of the ACM|date=April 1980|volume=27|issue=2|pages=393\u2013401|url=http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~games/go/seminar/2003/030331/p393-lichtenstein.pdf|doi=10.1145/322186.322201}}</ref> This is proved by reducing [[True Quantified Boolean Formula#PSPACE-completeness|True Quantified Boolean Formula]], which is known to be PSPACE-complete, to [[generalized geography]], to planar generalized geography, to [[Generalized geography#Planar bipartite graph with maximum degree 3|planar generalized geography with maximum degree 3]], finally to Go positions.\n\nGo with superko is not known to be in PSPACE. Though actual games seem never to last longer than <math>n^2</math> moves, in general it is not known if there were a polynomial bound on the length of Go games. If there were, Go would be PSPACE-complete. As it currently stands, it might be PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME-complete, or even EXPSPACE-complete.\n\n===Japanese ko rule===\n\nJapanese ko rules state that only the basic ko, that is, a move that reverts the board to the situation one move previously, is forbidden. Longer repetitive situations are allowed, thus potentially allowing a game to loop forever, such as the triple ko, where there are three kos at the same time, allowing a cycle of 12 moves.\n\nWith Japanese ko rules, Go is [[EXPTIME]]-complete.<ref name=\"robson1983\">{{cite journal|last1=Robson|first1=John|title=The complexity of Go|journal=Proceedings of the IFIP 9th World Computer Congress on Information Processing|date=1983|pages=413\u2013417}}</ref>\n\n===Superko rule===\n\nThe [[superko rule]] (also called the positional superko rule) states that a repetition of any board position that has previously occurred is forbidden. This is the ko rule used in most Chinese and US rulesets.\n\nIt is an open problem what the complexity class of Go is under superko rule. Though Go with Japanese ko rule is EXPTIME-complete, both the lower and the upper bounds of Robson\u2019s EXPTIME-completeness proof<ref name=\"robson1983\" /> break when the superko rule is added.\n\nIt is known that it is at least PSPACE-hard, since the proof in<ref name=\"sipser1980\" /> of the PSPACE-hardness of Go does not rely on the ko rule, or lack of the ko rule. It is also known that Go is in EXPSPACE.<ref name=\"robson1984\">{{cite book|last1=Robson|first1=J|title=Combinatorial games with exponential space complete decision problems|journal=Proceedings of the Mathematical Foundations of Computer Science|volume=176|date=1984|pages=498\u2013506|doi=10.1007/BFb0030333|series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn=978-3-540-13372-8}}</ref>\n\nRobson<ref name=\"robson1984\" /> showed that if the superko rule, that is, \u201cno previous position may ever be recreated\u201d, is added to certain two-player games that are EXPTIME-complete, then the new games would be EXPSPACE-complete. Intuitively, this is because an exponential amount of space is required even to determine the legal moves from a position, because the game history leading up to a position could be exponentially long.\n\nAs a result, superko variants (moves that repeat a previous board position are not allowed) of generalized [[chess]] and [[checkers]] are EXPSPACE-complete, since generalized chess<ref name=\"Fraenkel1981\">{{cite journal| author = [[Aviezri Fraenkel]] and D.

It is served by the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train and the [[Rockaway Park Shuttle]] at all times, the latter of which originates/terminates here.\n\nBroad Channel originally opened in 1880 as a [[Long Island Railroad]] station. The LIRR discontinued service in 1950 after a fire on the trestle across [[Jamaica Bay]], to the station's north. The station reopened June 28, 1956, as a subway station.\n\nBroad Channel is one of two New York City Subway stations located on its own island, the other being the [[Roosevelt Island station]] in Manhattan. It is also the only subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in [[Jamaica Bay]] and only has about 3,000 residents. Thus it is the least-used in the subway {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and the second-least-used on weekdays after only [[Beach 105th Street station|Beach 105th Street]]. However, this station is the only transfer point for riders traveling between Brooklyn and Manhattan (which the A train travels to) and the four other stations served by the Rockaway Park Shuttle.\n\nNorth of this station, two additional tracks are located within the right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and to go back into service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars to make sure that they are ready for acceptance into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.\n\n==History==\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|default}};{{linear-gradient|left|#{{NYCS color|A}}, #{{NYCS color|S}}}}\n|title-color=white\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Howard Beach\u2013JFK Airport (IND Rockaway Line)|Howard Beach]]\nuhbvSTRa\nWDOCKSm!~MFADEgq!~lhvSTR(l)\\uhvSTR\\WDOCKSm!~MFADEfq!~lhvSTR(r) ~~ ~~ [[Jamaica Bay]] Trestle ~~\nuhbvSTRe\nudENDEa\\uvSTRfg\\d\nd\\udLSTR\\uvLSTR\\numN015 ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Long track section|approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}}}}\nPOINTERf@fq\\udSTR\\uvSTR\\udENDEa\\ ~~ ~~ ~~ Test track\n\\uvSTR\\uvSTR\\POINTERg@gq ~~ ~~ ~~ Shuttle relay track\nuv\u00dcSTl\\uvSHI2g+l-\nudENDEe\\uv\u00dcST\\d\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\nWASSERq!~MFADEgq\\WASSERq!~MSTR!~uvBR\u00dcCKE1\\WASSERq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ Jamaica Bay\nuvLSTR ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Long track section|approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}}}}\nWASSERq!~MFADEgq\\WASSERq!~MSTR!~uvBR\u00dcCKE1\\WASSERq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ Jamaica Bay\nuSHI1+l\\uSHI1+r\nuSTRc2\\uSTR3!~uSTR2u\\uABZ23\\uSTRc3\nuSTRc2\\uSTR3+1!~uSTRc2\\uSTR3+1!~uSTRc4\\uSTR2+4u!~uSTRc1\\uSTR2+4!~uSTRc3\\uSTRc3\nudSTR+1\\uvSTR+1-!~uSTRc4\\uSTRc4\\uSTRc1\\uv-STR+4!~uSTRc1\\udSTR+4\nc!~udSTR\\uABZg+l\\uSTRq\\udSTRq\\uSTRq\\cd!~uABZg+r\\udSTR ~~ ~~ ~~ Hammels Wye\nuv\u00dcSTr\\\\\\\\uv\u00dcSTl\nuvSTRfg\\\\\\\\uvSTRfg\nuvSTR\\\\\\\\uvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Beach 67th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|B 67 St]] \u2013 Far Rockaway Branch\nuvSTR!~MFADEf\\\\\\\\ ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Beach 90th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|B 90 St]] \u2013 Rockaway Park Branch\n}}\n}}\n\nThe station originally opened in 1880 as a [[New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad]] station (although some sources claim it opened in June 1881)<!--V.

It is served by the [[A (New York City Subway service)|A]] train and the [[Rockaway Park Shuttle]] at all times, the latter of which originates/terminates here.\n\nBroad Channel originally opened in 1880 as a [[Long Island Railroad]] station. The LIRR discontinued service in 1950 after a fire on the trestle across [[Jamaica Bay]], to the station's north. The station reopened June 28, 1956, as a subway station.\n\nBroad Channel is one of two New York City Subway stations located on its own island, the other being the [[Roosevelt Island station]] in Manhattan. It is also the only subway station serving the island of Broad Channel, which is located in [[Jamaica Bay]] and only has about 3,000 residents. Thus it is the least-used in the subway {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, and the second-least-used on weekdays after only [[Beach 105th Street station|Beach 105th Street]]. However, this station is the only transfer point for riders traveling between Brooklyn and Manhattan (which the A train travels to) and the four other stations served by the Rockaway Park Shuttle.\n\nNorth of this station, two additional tracks are located within the right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and to go back into service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars to make sure that they are ready for acceptance into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.\n\n==History==\n{{stack|float=right|\n{{Routemap\n|title=Track layout\n|title-bg=#{{NYCS color|default}};{{linear-gradient|left|#{{NYCS color|A}}, #{{NYCS color|S}}}}\n|title-color=white\n|legend =track\n|map=\nuvSTR!~MFADEg ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Howard Beach\u2013JFK Airport (IND Rockaway Line)|Howard Beach]]\nuhbvSTRa\nWDOCKSm!~MFADEgq!~lhvSTR(l)\\uhvSTR\\WDOCKSm!~MFADEfq!~lhvSTR(r) ~~ ~~ [[Jamaica Bay]] Trestle ~~\nuhbvSTRe\nudENDEa\\uvSTRfg\\d\nd\\udLSTR\\uvLSTR\\numN015 ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Long track section|approximately {{convert|2|mi|km}}}}\nPOINTERf@fq\\udSTR\\uvSTR\\udENDEa\\ ~~ ~~ ~~ Test track\n\\uvSTR\\uvSTR\\POINTERg@gq ~~ ~~ ~~ Shuttle relay track\nuv\u00dcSTl\\uvSHI2g+l-\nudENDEe\\uv\u00dcST\\d\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\ndBSl\\uvSTR\\dBSr\nWASSERq!~MFADEgq\\WASSERq!~MSTR!~uvBR\u00dcCKE1\\WASSERq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ Jamaica Bay\nuvLSTR ~~ ~~ ~~ {{BSsplit|Long track section|approximately {{convert|1000|ft|m}}}}\nWASSERq!~MFADEgq\\WASSERq!~MSTR!~uvBR\u00dcCKE1\\WASSERq!~MFADEfq ~~ ~~ ~~ Jamaica Bay\nuSHI1+l\\uSHI1+r\nuSTRc2\\uSTR3!~uSTR2u\\uABZ23\\uSTRc3\nuSTRc2\\uSTR3+1!~uSTRc2\\uSTR3+1!~uSTRc4\\uSTR2+4u!~uSTRc1\\uSTR2+4!~uSTRc3\\uSTRc3\nudSTR+1\\uvSTR+1-!~uSTRc4\\uSTRc4\\uSTRc1\\uv-STR+4!~uSTRc1\\udSTR+4\nc!~udSTR\\uABZg+l\\uSTRq\\udSTRq\\uSTRq\\cd!~uABZg+r\\udSTR ~~ ~~ ~~ Hammels Wye\nuv\u00dcSTr\\\\\\\\uv\u00dcSTl\nuvSTRfg\\\\\\\\uvSTRfg\nuvSTR\\\\\\\\uvSTR!~MFADEf ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Beach 67th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|B 67 St]] \u2013 Far Rockaway Branch\nuvSTR!~MFADEf\\\\\\\\ ~~ ~~ ~~ to [[Beach 90th Street (IND Rockaway Line)|B 90 St]] \u2013 Rockaway Park Branch\n}}\n}}\n\nThe station originally opened in 1880 as a [[New York, Woodhaven and Rockaway Railroad]] station (although some sources claim it opened in June 1881)<!--V.

A kinetic energy storage system with KESS technology was installed, and as a result, the voltage regulation of the track improved.

The complex is located in the vicinity of [[One Court Square]] in [[Long Island City, Queens]], and is served by the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7]], [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], and [[G (New York City Subway service)|G]] trains at all times; the [[M (New York City Subway service)|M]] train on weekdays; and the [[7d (New York City Subway service)|&lt;7&gt;]] express train during weekdays in the peak direction.\n\nThe complex comprises three originally separate stations, formerly known as '''23rd Street\u2013Ely Avenue''' (Queens Boulevard Line), '''Long Island City\u2013Court Square''' (Crosstown Line), and '''45th Road\u2013Court House Square''' (Flushing Line). The Flushing Line station was the first to open, in 1916. The Crosstown Line station opened in 1933, followed by the Queens Boulevard Line station in 1939.\n\nTwo passageways were built to connect the three stations. The first was built in 1990, following the opening of the [[Citigroup]] office tower at One Court Square.

Queens Boulevard Line]]. The complex is located in the vicinity of [[One Court Square]] in [[Long Island City, Queens]], and is served by the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7]], [[E (New York City Subway service)|E]], and [[G (New York City Subway service)|G]] trains at all times; the [[M (New York City Subway service)|M]] train on weekdays; and the [[7d (New York City Subway service)|&lt;7&gt;]] express train during weekdays in the peak direction.\n\nThe complex comprises three originally separate stations, formerly known as '''23rd Street\u2013Ely Avenue''' (Queens Boulevard Line), '''Long Island City\u2013Court Square''' (Crosstown Line), and '''45th Road\u2013Court House Square''' (Flushing Line). The Flushing Line station was the first to open, in 1916. The Crosstown Line station opened in 1933, followed by the Queens Boulevard Line station in 1939.\n\nTwo passageways were built to connect the three stations. The first was built in 1990, following the opening of the [[Citigroup]] office tower at One Court Square.
