It tells the story of Abdulrahman Zeitoun, the Syrian-American owner of a painting and contracting company in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], who chose to ride out [[Hurricane Katrina]] in his [[Uptown New Orleans|Uptown]] home.\n\nAfter the hurricane, he traveled the flooded city in a secondhand canoe rescuing neighbors, caring for abandoned pets and distributing fresh water, but was arrested without reason or explanation at one of his rental houses, along with three others, by a mixed group of [[National Guard of the United States|U.S. Army National Guard]] soldiers and local police officers. Zeitoun and the others were accused of terrorist activities, presumably because of the large amount of money found in their possession as well as maps of the city and a storage disc, and were detained for 23 days. Zeitoun was refused medical attention and the use of a phone to alert his family. His wife and daughters, who were staying with friends far away from the city, only learned that he had disappeared.\n\n==Plot summary==\nAbdulrahman Zeitoun grew up in Syria. After a few years of apprenticeship in the Syrian port city of [[Jableh]], Zeitoun spent twenty years working at sea as a muscleman, engineer and fisherman. During this time he traveled the world and eventually settled in the United States in 1988. Zeitoun met his wife Kathy, a native of [[Baton Rouge]], with whom he founded their business, Zeitoun Painting Contractors LLC. Kathy converted to Islam.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/mar/11/dave-eggers-zeitoun-hurricane-katrina|title=The amazing true story of Zeitoun|first=Ed|last=Pilkington|date=11 March 2010|accessdate=23 August 2017|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]}}</ref>\n\nIn late August 2005, as Hurricane Katrina approached the city, Kathy and their four children left New Orleans for Baton Rouge.

Richard Marsh lived until 1727 when his Brewery was bequeathed to his widow, and then to his daughter, who sold the property on to Samuel Shepherd around 1741. Samuel Shepherd was from [[Deal, Kent]]. He had an interest in malting when he moved to Faversham around 1730 and had established himself as a Brewer of Malt by 1734. Shepherd expanded on his interest, through acquiring a number of public houses, but it was his son, Julius Shepherd, who extended this trend still further upon his inheritance of the Brewery in 1770, when the company held four such outlets. In 1789, he set about modernising the process of malt grinding and pumping, which had been previously worked with the employment of horses, by introducing what was reputed to be the first steam engine ([[Boulton and Watt]]) to be used for this purpose outside London, and was then able to describe his business as the ''Faversham Steam Brewery''.\n\n[[File:Spanish Galleon Tavern.jpg|right|thumb|The Spanish Galleon Tavern in [[Greenwich]]]]\n\nHenry, his second son, born in 1780, continued the family tradition, and raised his son of the same name into the business. It was this Henry Shepherd (1816~77) who was to be the last of the Shepherds actively involved in the Company. The death of Henry senior at the age of eighty-two occurred in 1862 and although his own son was not a businessman of the same determination, the firm's expansion continued adequately with John Mares, who had come to the financial assistance of the Shepherd Brewery during the recession of the mid-1840s and continued as the impetus behind ''Shepherd and Mares'' until Percy Beale Neame joined the Brewery in 1864. Mares had seen the potential of the Brewery's growth with the arrival of the long delayed railway service in 1858. He pressed the firm to actively prepare for such growth. Horse-drawn drays were used to carry the Brewery's ales throughout Kent, and malts were imported by barge at [[Faversham Creek]] at its own wharf which was also used as the means to deliver its product to London, until the 1850s when steamboats were beginning to prove more expeditious to the task. The railways soon even outpaced and replaced the steamboats.\n\nMares' unexpected death at the age of 45 in 1864 placed Percy Neame, at the age of 28, as the stronger partner with Henry Shepherd, and with the challenge left to him in Mares' successful expansion programme he brought the Faversham Brewery well into the Neame family's dominion.\n\nShepherd Neame have embraced 21st-century brewing techniques, for instance using PDX Reactor Technology for the heat treatment of wort, rather than the traditional method, using a [[Brewing#Brew kettle or copper|calandria]]. This has led to a reduction in energy consumption of 50%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oalgroup.com/|title=Food Processing, Robotics & Automation Food Manufacturing Solutions from OAL|website=Food Processing, Robotics & Automation Food Manufacturing Solutions from OAL}}</ref>\n\nAlong with the [[Three Tuns Brewery]] in [[Shropshire]], Shepherd Neame claims to the oldest brewery in Great Britain.

The rich, ruby-coloured classic is one of the oldest names in British beer, brewed since 1958.

It has [[Protected Geographical Indication]].\n*'''Master Brew''' (cask: 3.7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 4%[[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is the Shepherd Neame's flagship beer. It is a distinctive, amber bitter ale, with a hoppy aroma. It has [[Protected Geographical Indication]].\n*'''Brilliant Ale''' (cask: 4% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 5.6% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) was first brewed between 1825 and 1855, and is believed to have been inspired by the early morning sun sending golden shafts of light through the [[brewhouse]] window on to the oak [[mash tun]]. Brewers decided to create a beer that echoed these hues, and used 100% pale [[malt]] and the East Kent [[Goldings]] hops to create a golden, brilliantly bright, hoppy ale. While staying true to the spirit of the popular [[pale ale]], the modern incarnation has been rejuvenated by using the modern hop variety [[Cascade hop|Cascade]].\n*'''India Pale Ale''' (cask: 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle 6.1% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) hails from the tradition of 18th Century [[India pale ale|IPA]]s, which relied on generous hopping to protect exports during arduous journeys. This modern incarnation retains the strength, body and strong hop character which is synonymous with this beer's provenance. A glorious showcase of the distinct, heavily hopped beers for which Shepherd Neame is famed, India Pale Ale delivers potent bitterness, offset with generous amounts of pale ale malt to deliver a balanced, yet uncompromising brew. \n*'''Double Stout''' (cask: 4.0% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 5.2% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a black, creamy brew with a velvety-smooth palate of dry, burnt flavours, complemented by roast, cocoa and coffee notes. \n*'''Mild''' (cask: 3.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a dark beer with a complex aroma of dark chocolate, mocha coffee, vanilla and a smokiness reminiscent of autumn bonfires. The smooth, rich blend of chocolate and coffee is complemented by subtle hoppy, fruit flavours.\n*'''Christmas Ale''' (cask 5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available during December. It is a full-bodied, warming winter ale, featuring a warming combination of fruits and spices. It combines pale and crystal malts with Target and Challenger hops for bitterness, and Goldings hops for aroma.\n\n===Seasonal beers===\n*'''Amber Ale''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from January to March. A golden brown beer perfect for winter, Amber Ale boasts a fruity aroma and a full, malty palate. It combines Pale, Crystal and Brown malts, bittered by English Challenger hops, with American Cascade hops added for aroma.\n*'''Early Bird Spring Hop''' (cask: 4.3% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from March to May. A pale golden beer, with floral aroma, Early Bird is full-bodied and takes its name from the Early Bird variety of East Kent Goldings hops, grown in hop gardens near the brewery.  It has been brewed by Shepherd Neame since the mid-1990s.\n*'''Goldings Ale''' (cask 4.1% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from June to September. The soft [[golden ale]] is made from Kentish [[First Gold]] and German Hersbrukker [[hops]], dry hopped with Kentish [[Goldings]] grown in gardens close to the Faversham-based brewery. These citrusy hops are melded with the nutty, wholemeal character of crystal and ale [[malt]] to create a tangy, fresh finish.\n*'''Queen Court Harvest Ale''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from August to September. It is brewed every year to celebrate the start of the [[harvest]] across Kent's hop gardens. It is named after Queen Court Farm at [[Ospringe]] near [[Faversham]], the brewery's former hop farm which houses the National Hop Collection, dedicated to the preservation of the UK's hop-growing heritage and containing hundreds of rare varieties. The ale features pale and crystal malts and a mix of hops from across the globe to reflect the huge range of varieties available to modern brewers. It is bittered with Kentish [[First Gold]], before German Hersbrucker is added as a late copper hop and a blend of UK Cascade and US Centennial are added as dry hops in cask.\n*'''Late Red Autumn Hop Ale''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from September to December. The crimson copper-coloured seasonal ale is a complex, full flavoured brew, forging the perfect balance between rich, dark malt flavours and a citrussy hop finish. It blends pale ale malt and gently-kilned crystal malt with UK Cascade and Goldings hops. To enhance its taste and aroma, the brew is triple-hopped, with a late copper addition of Goldings and Cascade.\n\n===Limited edition beers===\nShepherd Neame has created a range of innovative limited edition beers under its No.18 Yard Brewhouse brand, using experimental brewing ingredients:\n*'''Dragonfire''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from April to May. It was created to commemorate St George's Day, and combines [[barley]], [[oats]], [[rye]] and [[wheat]] with two English hop varieties \u2013 Goldings and First Gold \u2013 in addition to a fiery secret ingredient. It is full bodied and rich with a mellow mahogany hue.\n*'''4-4-2''' (cask 4.0% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from June to July, and is named after the England side's favoured football formation, as it has its own special line-up, in the form of 10 different hop varieties. They are melded with crystal and ale malt to create a delicious, full bodied brew which is pale in colour.\n*'''Tallyman's Special''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is brewed by Shepherd Neame every year for the Kent Green Hop Beer Fortnight at the end of September. Instead of the usual dried hops, the brew uses fresh green hops and showcases the full array of esters and aromas usually lost in the drying process.\n*'''Spooks Ale''' (cask 4.7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from October to November. It describes itself as The Official Ghost Brew of All Hallows, and is appropriately a dark ruby colour. It boasts a biscuity palate created by a trio of Pale, Crystal, Brown and Chocolate malts, with bitterness provided by Target hops and a citrus aroma from Styrian Goldings.\n*'''Rudolph's Reward''' (3.7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available during December. A crisp, light winter beer, it combines pale and crystal malts with Target and East Kent Goldings hops, with mulled wine spices added at the end of the brew.\n\n===Whitstable Bay collection===\nShepherd Neame originally adopted the Faversham Steam Brewery moniker in the late 18th century when it became one of the first steam-powered breweries outside London. The brewery bought a five horse power engine from steam pioneers Boulton and Watt which powered all processes on site, pairing the revolutionary machinery with the finest local ingredients to create exceptional beers. It has now revived the title to reflect the traditional provenance of the Whitstable Bay collection.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Organic Ale''' (bottle: 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a light-coloured ale brewed using only organic ingredients, including organic Tradition or Challenger hops, organic Ale and Crystal malts and the brewery's own chalk-filtered mineral water, also certified organic. It combines delicate hints of fresh hops with the softer, buttery richness of pale and crystal malts.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Pale Ale''' (draught: 3.9% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 4% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a light-coloured, thirst quenching beer is brewed with the Challenger and Styrian Goldings hops, and Ale and Crystal malts. The sweet maltiness balances perfectly with the fresh pine notes provided by the hops added late in the process.\n\nSee also Whitstable Bay Black Oyster Stout and Whitstable Bay Blonde Lager under Keg.\n\n===Keg beers===\nShepherd Neame produces brewery-conditioned draught beers which are brewed in exactly the same way as traditional, cask beers but filtered before being packaged into pressurised kegs. This ensures consistency of taste, and is the preferred option in bars where there is limited, or no, cellar space.\n[[File:WhitstableBayBlackOysterStoutPourShot.jpg|thumb|right|Whitstable Bay Oyster Stout]]\n*'''Whitstable Bay Black Oyster Stout'''  (draught 4.2% abv), is a silky keg stout brewed using a unique blend of four coloured malts which impart a rich, complex flavour of roasted mocha notes, balanced by a subtly bitterness from the finest Admiral hops, and finished with a smooth, creamy head.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Blonde Lager''' (draught: 4.5% abv, bottle: 4.5% abv) takes its name from the golden hue of the beer. It is brewed with Challenger, Centennial and Saaz hops, and Lager and Crystal Malts. It has a floral aroma, paired with buttery biscuit base notes and crisp, citrus flavours.\n\n===Bottled beers===\nIn addition to the bottled versions of some of its most popular beers such as Spitfire and Bishops Finger, Shepherd Neame also produces some beers in bottle only.\n\n'''1698 Bottle Conditioned Kentish Strong Ale''' (bottle 6.5% abv). First brewed in 1998 to celebrate Shepherd Neame's tercentenary, 1698 is thrice hopped and bottle conditioned. A silver medal winner in the Taste of Britain Awards, 1698 has been included in the International Beer Challenge's World's Top 50 Beers and has won a Gold Award from the British Bottlers' Institute. It has Protected Geographical Indication, the same regional produce protection afforded to Champagne and Parma Ham.\n\n===Lager===\nThe brewery also produces a range of [[lager]]s, mainly under licence, such as  [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams Boston Lager]],  [[Holsten]] Export,  [[Oranjeboom]] and [[United Beverages Group|Kingfisher]], but also [[H\u00fcrlimann]] [[Pale Lager|''Sternbrau Lager: Export Bier'']] [330 ml or 500 ml Bottle, 500 ml can, or draft keg; 4.8% ABV]. Shepherd Neame manufactures this beer in Britain and exports it to Europe. A [[bock]] style beer is also brewed. These are served on draught in the brewery's pubs and receive more frontage than non-brewery brands.\n\n==Pubs==\n[[File:Eastern City of London 08.03.2013 16-14-33 east india arms.jpg|thumb|[[East India Arms]] in the City of London]]\n\nThe brewery owns around 330 pubs and establishments, mostly in Kent, but extending across the South East of England. These are predominantly tenanted public houses situated in towns and villages. The brewery also manages its own chain of hotels, including The Royal Albion in [[Broadstairs]] and The George Hotel in [[Cranbrook, Kent]]. The brewery's own brands are typically given prominence in terms of frontage with extensive branding. All fonts and pumps bear the distinctive logos and branding, glasses are branded and bar runners that advertise the house beers are commonplace.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ivo Neame]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* \"Bottle of Britain Campaign\" (1997\u20132005)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/ }}\n* [http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/shepherd-neame/711/ RateBeer]\n* [http://www.quaffale.org.uk/php/brewery/501 Quaffale]\n\n{{British Royal Warrant holders}}\n{{Pubs in London}}\n\n[[Category:1698 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Breweries in England]]\n[[Category:British Royal Warrant holders]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Kent]]\n[[Category:Faversham]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Kent]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name             = Shepherd Neame Ltd\n| logo             = Shepherd Neame Brewery logo.png\n| caption          = \n| location_city    = [[Faversham]], [[Kent]]\n| location_country = England\n| owner            = Jonathan Neame<br>Chief Executive\n| foundation       = 1698\n| industry         = [[Alcoholic drink]]s \n| products         = [[Beer]] \n| production       = {{convert|211000|impbbl|hl}} (2016)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/sites/default/files/Shepherd%20Neame%20Preliminary%20Results%20Release%202016.pdf|title=Shepherd Neame Preliminary Results Release 2016|publisher=shepherdneame.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n| revenue =  \u00a3139.9m (2016)<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/sites/default/files/uploads/InvRel/Shepherd%20Neame%20Annual%20Report%202016.pdf|title=Shepherd Neame Annual Report 2016|publisher=shepherdneame.co.uk|accessdate=21 September 2016}}</ref>\n| num_employees    = 1318<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n| website =  {{url|shepherdneame.co.uk}}\n}}\n\n'''Shepherd Neame''' is an English independent [[brewery]] founded in 1698 in [[Faversham]], [[Kent]], and family-owned since 1864.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHh-4M_QxEsC&pg=PA85|title=World's Best Beers: One Thousand Craft Brews from Cask to Glass|last=McFarland|first=Ben|publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc|year=2009|isbn=9781402766947|page=85}}</ref> The brewery produces a range of [[cask ale]]s and [[filtered beer]]s.

A pale golden beer, with floral aroma, Early Bird is full-bodied and takes its name from the Early Bird variety of East Kent Goldings hops, grown in hop gardens near the brewery.  It has been brewed by Shepherd Neame since the mid-1990s.\n*'''Goldings Ale''' (cask 4.1% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from June to September. The soft [[golden ale]] is made from Kentish [[First Gold]] and German Hersbrukker [[hops]], dry hopped with Kentish [[Goldings]] grown in gardens close to the Faversham-based brewery. These citrusy hops are melded with the nutty, wholemeal character of crystal and ale [[malt]] to create a tangy, fresh finish.\n*'''Queen Court Harvest Ale''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from August to September. It is brewed every year to celebrate the start of the [[harvest]] across Kent's hop gardens. It is named after Queen Court Farm at [[Ospringe]] near [[Faversham]], the brewery's former hop farm which houses the National Hop Collection, dedicated to the preservation of the UK's hop-growing heritage and containing hundreds of rare varieties. The ale features pale and crystal malts and a mix of hops from across the globe to reflect the huge range of varieties available to modern brewers. It is bittered with Kentish [[First Gold]], before German Hersbrucker is added as a late copper hop and a blend of UK Cascade and US Centennial are added as dry hops in cask.\n*'''Late Red Autumn Hop Ale''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from September to December. The crimson copper-coloured seasonal ale is a complex, full flavoured brew, forging the perfect balance between rich, dark malt flavours and a citrussy hop finish. It blends pale ale malt and gently-kilned crystal malt with UK Cascade and Goldings hops. To enhance its taste and aroma, the brew is triple-hopped, with a late copper addition of Goldings and Cascade.\n\n===Limited edition beers===\nShepherd Neame has created a range of innovative limited edition beers under its No.18 Yard Brewhouse brand, using experimental brewing ingredients:\n*'''Dragonfire''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from April to May. It was created to commemorate St George's Day, and combines [[barley]], [[oats]], [[rye]] and [[wheat]] with two English hop varieties \u2013 Goldings and First Gold \u2013 in addition to a fiery secret ingredient. It is full bodied and rich with a mellow mahogany hue.\n*'''4-4-2''' (cask 4.0% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from June to July, and is named after the England side's favoured football formation, as it has its own special line-up, in the form of 10 different hop varieties. They are melded with crystal and ale malt to create a delicious, full bodied brew which is pale in colour.\n*'''Tallyman's Special''' (cask 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is brewed by Shepherd Neame every year for the Kent Green Hop Beer Fortnight at the end of September. Instead of the usual dried hops, the brew uses fresh green hops and showcases the full array of esters and aromas usually lost in the drying process.\n*'''Spooks Ale''' (cask 4.7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available from October to November. It describes itself as The Official Ghost Brew of All Hallows, and is appropriately a dark ruby colour. It boasts a biscuity palate created by a trio of Pale, Crystal, Brown and Chocolate malts, with bitterness provided by Target hops and a citrus aroma from Styrian Goldings.\n*'''Rudolph's Reward''' (3.7% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is available during December. A crisp, light winter beer, it combines pale and crystal malts with Target and East Kent Goldings hops, with mulled wine spices added at the end of the brew.\n\n===Whitstable Bay collection===\nShepherd Neame originally adopted the Faversham Steam Brewery moniker in the late 18th century when it became one of the first steam-powered breweries outside London. The brewery bought a five horse power engine from steam pioneers Boulton and Watt which powered all processes on site, pairing the revolutionary machinery with the finest local ingredients to create exceptional beers. It has now revived the title to reflect the traditional provenance of the Whitstable Bay collection.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Organic Ale''' (bottle: 4.5% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a light-coloured ale brewed using only organic ingredients, including organic Tradition or Challenger hops, organic Ale and Crystal malts and the brewery's own chalk-filtered mineral water, also certified organic. It combines delicate hints of fresh hops with the softer, buttery richness of pale and crystal malts.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Pale Ale''' (draught: 3.9% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]], bottle: 4% [[Alcohol by volume|abv]]) is a light-coloured, thirst quenching beer is brewed with the Challenger and Styrian Goldings hops, and Ale and Crystal malts. The sweet maltiness balances perfectly with the fresh pine notes provided by the hops added late in the process.\n\nSee also Whitstable Bay Black Oyster Stout and Whitstable Bay Blonde Lager under Keg.\n\n===Keg beers===\nShepherd Neame produces brewery-conditioned draught beers which are brewed in exactly the same way as traditional, cask beers but filtered before being packaged into pressurised kegs. This ensures consistency of taste, and is the preferred option in bars where there is limited, or no, cellar space.\n[[File:WhitstableBayBlackOysterStoutPourShot.jpg|thumb|right|Whitstable Bay Oyster Stout]]\n*'''Whitstable Bay Black Oyster Stout'''  (draught 4.2% abv), is a silky keg stout brewed using a unique blend of four coloured malts which impart a rich, complex flavour of roasted mocha notes, balanced by a subtly bitterness from the finest Admiral hops, and finished with a smooth, creamy head.\n*'''Whitstable Bay Blonde Lager''' (draught: 4.5% abv, bottle: 4.5% abv) takes its name from the golden hue of the beer. It is brewed with Challenger, Centennial and Saaz hops, and Lager and Crystal Malts. It has a floral aroma, paired with buttery biscuit base notes and crisp, citrus flavours.\n\n===Bottled beers===\nIn addition to the bottled versions of some of its most popular beers such as Spitfire and Bishops Finger, Shepherd Neame also produces some beers in bottle only.\n\n'''1698 Bottle Conditioned Kentish Strong Ale''' (bottle 6.5% abv). First brewed in 1998 to celebrate Shepherd Neame's tercentenary, 1698 is thrice hopped and bottle conditioned. A silver medal winner in the Taste of Britain Awards, 1698 has been included in the International Beer Challenge's World's Top 50 Beers and has won a Gold Award from the British Bottlers' Institute. It has Protected Geographical Indication, the same regional produce protection afforded to Champagne and Parma Ham.\n\n===Lager===\nThe brewery also produces a range of [[lager]]s, mainly under licence, such as  [[Samuel Adams (beer)|Samuel Adams Boston Lager]],  [[Holsten]] Export,  [[Oranjeboom]] and [[United Beverages Group|Kingfisher]], but also [[H\u00fcrlimann]] [[Pale Lager|''Sternbrau Lager: Export Bier'']] [330 ml or 500 ml Bottle, 500 ml can, or draft keg; 4.8% ABV]. Shepherd Neame manufactures this beer in Britain and exports it to Europe. A [[bock]] style beer is also brewed. These are served on draught in the brewery's pubs and receive more frontage than non-brewery brands.\n\n==Pubs==\n[[File:Eastern City of London 08.03.2013 16-14-33 east india arms.jpg|thumb|[[East India Arms]] in the City of London]]\n\nThe brewery owns around 330 pubs and establishments, mostly in Kent, but extending across the South East of England. These are predominantly tenanted public houses situated in towns and villages. The brewery also manages its own chain of hotels, including The Royal Albion in [[Broadstairs]] and The George Hotel in [[Cranbrook, Kent]]. The brewery's own brands are typically given prominence in terms of frontage with extensive branding. All fonts and pumps bear the distinctive logos and branding, glasses are branded and bar runners that advertise the house beers are commonplace.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Ivo Neame]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* \"Bottle of Britain Campaign\" (1997\u20132005)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{official website|http://www.shepherdneame.co.uk/ }}\n* [http://www.ratebeer.com/brewers/shepherd-neame/711/ RateBeer]\n* [http://www.quaffale.org.uk/php/brewery/501 Quaffale]\n\n{{British Royal Warrant holders}}\n{{Pubs in London}}\n\n[[Category:1698 establishments in England]]\n[[Category:Breweries in England]]\n[[Category:British Royal Warrant holders]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Kent]]\n[[Category:Faversham]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Kent]]\n", "name_user": "Headhitter", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Copyedit (minor)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd_Neame_Brewery"}

They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in Motomezuka and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name Motomezuka is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through Fumiko Enchi's novel, \"Masks.\" It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before The Frolic of the Beasts.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysis on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko. Looking at the photograph, she thanks the researcher and says, \"Now I can serve my time in peace.\" Y\u016bko puts the photograph in her pocket and leaves.\n\n==Setting==\n\"Iro Village\" is a fictional place set in the former fishing village of [[:ja:\u5b89\u826f\u91cc\u6751|Arari]], which was merged into the current town of [[Nishiizu]]. Similarly, a reference to Mt Taiya is also fictional. However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \"Ono-san\" or \"Ono-yama.\" The Japanese characters \"Ono\" can also be read \"Taiya.\" Mishima stayed at a [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research). A monument to Mishima is located in the area of Cape Kogane, with a passage from ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' engraved on it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.at-s.com/facilities/article/view/place/133395.html |title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u6587\u5b66\u7891\uff3b\u8cc0\u8302\u90e1\u897f\u4f0a\u8c46\u753a\uff3d\uff5c\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |date=27 November 2015 |website=\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Title==\nBefore its official English translation, the novel's title was variously translated as ''Beastly Entanglements''<ref>{{cite book|author=Naoki Inose|title=Persona: A Biography of Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgPyWO87k8C&pg=PT374|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=978-1-61172-008-2|page=374}}</ref> and ''The Amusement of Beasts''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Damian Flanagan|title=Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUmCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA251|date=15 August 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-419-9|page=251}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''K\u014dji''' \u2013 a 21-year-old university student who is a \"fun-loving, hotheaded youth\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=27}}</ref> He has \"regular and firm features\" and a \"somewhat oldfashioned warrior's face and relatively bony nose.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref> He has no living parents, siblings, or relatives, and went to college on his parents' inheritance.

The photo shoot took place in a remote farming village in the Tohoku district of Japan and was a collaboration between Eikoh and Tatsumi Hijikata, the creator of the Ankoku Buto (Dance of Darkness) style of dance.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Motomezuka]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{NCID|BN15662660}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frolic of the Beasts, The}}\n[[Category:1961 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Yukio Mishima]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Shukan Shincho (magazine)]]\n[[Category:Japanese novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Shinchosha books]]\n[[Category:Adultery in novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about death]]\n[[Category:Novels about murder]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative novels]]\n[[Category:Novels based on plays]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=March 2020}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2020}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name = The Frolic of the Beasts\n| image = Kemono no tawamure (Mishima Yukio).png\n| alt = \n| caption = First edition cover (Japan)\n| author = [[Yukio Mishima]]\n| title_orig = {{nihongo|\u7363\u306e\u622f\u308c|Kemono no tawamure|}}\n| orig_lang_code = ja\n| translator = Andrew Clare\n| cover_artist = [[Kaii Higashiyama]]\n| country = Japan\n| language = Japanese\n| genre = \n| set_in = [[Nishiizu|Iro]] and [[Tokyo]]\n| publisher = [[Shinchosha]]\n| pub_date = 30 September 1961\n| english_pub_date = 27 November 2018\n| published = 12 June 1961\u20134 September 1961 in ''[[Shukan Shincho (magazine)|Shukan Shincho]]''\n| media_type = Print (hardcover)\n| pages = 207<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BN15662660/ |title=\u7378\u306e\u6232\u308c |website=[[CiNii]] |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n| awards = \n| isbn = \n| isbn_note = \n| oclc = 673928594\n| dewey = 895.63/5\n| congress = PL833.I7 K4\n}}\n{{nihongo|'''''The Frolic of the Beasts'''''|\u7363\u306e\u622f\u308c|Kemono no tawamure|lead=yes}} is a 1961 novel by [[Yukio Mishima]].

They meet a group of village girls who tell them the story of Unai. In the story, two men, Sasada and Chinu, declare their love for Unai. Unwilling to incur the jealousy of one by favouring the other, Unai declined to make a choice. Her parents make the two suitors compete for her hand, but each contest results in a draw. In torment, Unai drowns herself in Ikuta River. After her funeral, Sasada and Chinu were inconsolable, and they commit suicide by stabbing each other to death. Unai's ghost bears the karmic responsibility for their demise. The priest intones prayers for her soul. She hears the prayers, but they are of no avail; she is unable to escape from the [[Upaya#Parable of the burning house|Burning House]] (a Buddhist metaphor for the secular world) and the [[The Eight Cold Hells|Eight Great Hells]], through which she is eternally tormented by her demons. In another version of the story, Unai is depicted as being pulled in different directions by the deceased lovers in a metaphorical tug of war. There is a clear allusion to Y\u016bko's relationship with Ippei and K\u014dji. The [[love triangle]] between Unai, Sasada, and Chinu corresponds to that of ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' with Y\u016bko, Ippei, and K\u014dji, as well as in Kiyoshi's and Matsukichi's quarrel over Kimi's love.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> It is interesting to note that in the traditional Noh theatre, immorality was always regarded as a sin which would lead to eternal damnation in the fires of hell (echoing Unai's fate in Motomezuka and Y\u016bko's anguish in prison).\n\nThe name Motomezuka is likely to be a corruption of Otomezuka (the \"Maiden's Grave\"), the original story being contained in an episode of the Yamato Monogatari, a tale combining narrative fiction with waka poetry from he mid-tenth century. The earliest references to the story appear in poem form in the Many\u014dsh\u016b, the oldest and greatest anthology of Japanese poems, compiled during the late Nara period.\n\nNoh theatre performances are characterised by their use of meticulously designed masks that represent specific characters and facial expressions. N\u014d masks are referenced throughout ''The Frolic of the Beasts''.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> At the beginning of the novel's first chapter, K\u014dji humours himself with the thought that his own face \"is like a well-crafted, carved wooden mask.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/> In the novel's prologue, Ippei's expression is described as an \"interminable smile\", which recalls the fixed expression of N\u014d masks.<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA6|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=6}}</ref><ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://lithub.com/the-frolic-of-the-beasts/ |title=The Frolic of the Beasts |date=28 November 2018 |website=[[Literary Hub]] |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref> Also, the \"dark grape luster\" of Y\u016bko's \"characteristic thick lipstick\" is likely a direct reference to the archetypal \"young woman\" (Wakaonna) character portrayed in Noh productions.<ref name=\"Translator's Note\"/><ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT20|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=20}}</ref> In his review for ''[[The Japan Times]]'', Damian Flanagan also compared the \"jumbled\" nature of the novel's nonlinear narrative as creating a \"transcendent unearthliness\" similar to that of a Noh play.<ref name=\"The Japan Times\"/>\n\nMiyoko Tanaka, the commentator in the original Shinchosha paperback edition of the novel says that both in the form of the story, which is \"like a dream rising from weed-infested ruins,\" and from the descriptions of the faces of the characters, \"we Japanese clearly recognize vestiges of the traditional Noh theater performance.\"\n\nMishima was infatuated with the Noh theater and he wrote several Noh plays himself (adapted from ancient Noh performances). All of his plays were performed in Japan and some of them in other cities around the world, including New York. There is some speculation that Mishima was partly influenced in his choice of subject matter by the theme of Noh masks running through Fumiko Enchi's novel, \"Masks.\" It seems certain that Mishima rated Enchi highly and described this book as an \"esoteric masterpiece.\" Enchi's novel was published in 1958, three years before The Frolic of the Beasts.\n\n==Plot==\n===Prologue===\nIn a photograph, three smiling individuals\u2013Ippei Kusakado, his wife Y\u016bko, and the youthful K\u014dji\u2013are seen standing on the harbor wall in Iro Village, a rural fishing port in the western part of the [[Izu Peninsula]] in [[Shizuoka Prefecture]]. The photograph was taken on a hot summer day. It was taken only days before \"the final wretched incident\". It was immediately sent to the chief priest of Taisenji temple. In Iro, there are also rice paddies as well as the Kusakado greenhouses, located beside the Kusakado family home. On the mountainside lies a new graveyard, reaching halfway up the slope of the mountain from its base. In spite of opposition from the villagers, the chief priest of Taisenji temple erected the new graves with the money that was entrusted to him. Ippei's grave lies on the right, K\u014dji's on the left, and Y\u016bko's in the center. Y\u016bko's, however, is only a \"living monument\", reserved for her eventual death.\n\n===Chapter 1===\nK\u014dji is released from prison. He travels by boat from [[Numazu]] to Iro Village, where Y\u016bko is waiting for him. K\u014dji tells himself that he has repented and is a different person, but once he arrives he is immediately told by Y\u016bko that he hasn't changed. Y\u016bko had become his guarantor upon his release, but they both question whether they have made a mistake in K\u014dji coming to Iro. Y\u016bko closed the Tokyo shop a year ago, moved to Iro, and started the Kusakado greenhouse, which K\u014dji will work in. The two of them walk through Iro to the Kusakado house. Greeted by villagers on the way, K\u014dji is ashamed knowing rumours of his past will spread but Y\u016bko tells him to keep his head up. K\u014dji is seized by fear when he sees Ippei in front of the gate of the house.\n\n===Chapter 2===\nTwo years earlier, when he was a 21-year-old university student, K\u014dji was hired to work at a Western ceramics shop in Ginza, Tokyo. Ippei Kusakado, a 40-year-old man, is the owner and manager of the ceramics shop but also translates and reviews German literature in his spare time. While drinking together at a bar, Ippei tells K\u014dji about his unhappiness with his wife Y\u016bko's lack of jealousy. He says he has tried everything to make her jealous, confessing to his numerous affairs. K\u014dji, jealous of Ippei's \"corrupt heart\", falls in love with Y\u016bko that night, despite not having met her before. K\u014dji begins a secret affair with Y\u016bko. One night, Y\u016bko told K\u014dji that she knows Ippei has been adulterous, showing him documentation from a private investigator who tracked his infidelity. She cried, but told K\u014dji not to tell her husband of her suffering. On a summer's day, six months after he first met Y\u016bko, K\u014dji is waiting for Y\u016bko outside a hospital. He spots a black wrench laying on the ground and puts it in his jacket pocket. Much later while in prison, K\u014dji reflected on the wrench, viewing it as a manifestation of \"[[Will (philosophy)|will]]\" that had become a material phenomen which sought to \"upset the very foundations\" of the order of his world. That evening, Y\u016bko and K\u014dji walk in on Ippei and find him with a lover, Machiko. Y\u016bko simply asks Ippei to \"return home quietly\". K\u014dji expected a grand confrontation, where \"the truth of\nperverse human nature begins to shine\". He instead sees it as \"nothing other than things he had grown utterly tired of seeing: the mediocre concealment of human shame, the irony of keeping up appearances.\" Y\u016bko, crying and jabbering, is struck across the cheek twice by Ippei. K\u014dji immediately reacts without \"emotion, objective, or motive\", and repeatedly bashes the left side of Ippei's head with the wrench he had placed in the pocket of his jacket.\n\n===Chapter 3===\nIn Iro, K\u014dji meets Ippei for the first time since he was imprisoned. K\u014dji's assault leaves Ippei with a fractured cranium and a cerebral contusion. Ippei is diagnosed with [[aphasia]] and [[Hemiplegia|paralysed on his right side]], and is left with an \"interminable smile\". K\u014dji explains his assault as driven by an extreme unease with enduring that \"world bereft of logic\", and chose to impart the \"cold, hard, black logic of iron\" of the wrench. K\u014dji works in the Kusakado greenhouse with fellow gardener Teijiro. One day, K\u014dji, Y\u016bko and Ippei go for a picnic at the nearby waterfall and greet Kakujin, the priest of Taisenji temple, on the way. They stop at the village shrine to make a peace offering with a lily, but Y\u016bko is unimpressed with the shrine's appearance and size. Y\u016bko's sacrilege scares K\u014dji. Y\u016bko suddenly begins to taunt Ippei, asking him if he understands \"sacrifice\". Ippei replies that he does not understand and K\u014dji tries to defend him but Y\u016bko cuts K\u014dji off and calls Ippei an idiot. Y\u016bko throws the lily into the plunge pool, and Ippei's face displays \"a look of pure anxiety born of being cut off from all understanding\". She asks Ippei if he understands the word \"kiss\", then passionately kisses K\u014dji in front of him. K\u014dji scolds Y\u016bko for using him for Ippei's sake. She answers, asserting she has used K\u014dji from the beginning and that he surely likes it. K\u014dji strikes Y\u016bko across the cheek and turns to Ippei, who has a fixed smile on his face. Terrified, K\u014dji embraces Y\u016bko to erase the fear from his mind, but her kiss \"had lost completely its exquisite taste\".\n\n===Chapter 4===\nOne evening, K\u014dji is drinking alone at the Storm Petrel, the only bar in Iro Village. He gossips with the bar's owner about Teijir\u014d's young daughter, Kimi. K\u014dji has never heard Teijir\u014d speak about Kimi, and senses that there are ill feelings between them. After Kimi's mother died, they had lived together until Kimi suddenly left for Hamamatsu to become a factory girl. Kimi has not interacted with Teijir\u014d since returning to Iro for a ten-day vacation from her work at the Imperial Instruments factory in Hamamatsu. Kimi is strikingly beautiful and makes the village girls of Iro jealous by her presence. She carries a ukulele with her wherever she goes. At around 9:00 p.m., Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi enter the bar and K\u014dji joins them at their table. Matsukichi is a fisherman and Kiyoshi is a member of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force ground crew. They are both Kimi's childhood friends, and have quarrelled with each other over her love ever since. K\u014dji envies Kiyoshi's \"simple lyrical spirit\", but considers Matsukichi \"a dull-witted young animal\". Looking at the three characters, K\u014dji thinks of Y\u016bko, who has not permitted him to kiss her since the incident during the picnic. He realises the depth of his love for Y\u016bko and repeats \"I have repented\" to himself. Together in the bar, K\u014dji, Kimi, Matsukichi, and Kiyoshi all get drunk and Kimi offers up her ukulele, swearing that whichever of the young men gets it will be the one who gets her love. Interested, they all leave in a small boat and travel to Urayasu where they go nude swimming. They walk into Urayasu forest and start a bonfire, where Kimi refuses to give up her ukulele. Matsukichi steals the instrument from Kimi, then passes it to Kiyoshi. The two men pass it back and forth to each other as Kimi attempts to take it back. Matsukichi and Kiyoshi take the ukulele and jump into the boat together, rowing into the bay by themselves. K\u014dji and Kimi return to the forest bonfire. Kimi says she purposely did not swim after the boat because she wished be alone with K\u014dji. Kimi says she respects K\u014dji's love for Y\u016bko, but is \"prepared to make a sacrifice and act as a stand-in\". K\u014dji and Kimi have sex, but K\u014dji cannot suppress the thought that the experience is \"nothing but a poor imitation\" of the \"perfect flesh\" that he created and refined with his imagination while in prison. They swim across the bay and return home. Several days later, K\u014dji hears rumours that Kiyoshi kept the ukulele, carrying it around wherever he went to the envy of the other young men in the village. That night, after drinking at the bar, Matsukichi confesses to K\u014dji that he and Kiyoshi made a secret pact. Kiyoshi only cared about his reputation, and agreed to never lay a hand on Kimi. The night after they went to Urayasu, Kimi gave herself to Matsukichi. When Matsukichi told Kimi of their pact, she laughed but accepted his proposal nonetheless. K\u014dji is surprised that Matsukichi has no inkling that he and Kimi had sex while alone on the island together.\n\n===Chapter 5===\nWhile working in the greenhouse, Teijir\u014d suddenly confesses to K\u014dji that he raped Kimi. Teijir\u014d then shows K\u014dji a pornographic photograph of a boy in a student's uniform having sex with a girl in a sailor uniform, and remarks that the girl has a similar appearance to that of Kimi. K\u014dji is disturbed by Teijir\u014d's unsolicited confession, and questions what the purpose of his confession was. Kimi stops by the Kusakado house to say goodbye before leaving to return to the factory in Hamamatsu. Looking at her, K\u014dji theorises that Kimi had slept with him and persuaded Matsukichi to love her only in order to infect them with the \"germ-like secret of her father's crime\" without letting them know her truth. He imagines she was quitely picturing \"the origin of her burning, rejuvenating humiliation and self-loathing\" while they had sex. Kimi says goodbye and squeezes K\u014dji's hands, gazing in his eyes. K\u014dji stares only at Y\u016bko, who takes out a hairpin from her hair and pricks the back of Kimi's hand. Kimi leaves, running down the slope laughing maniacally, while Y\u016bko turns away with a frown on her face. In the heat of that night, K\u014dji is lying on his bed while covered by a mosquito net. Y\u016bko enters K\u014dji's room and tells him she stuck her hairpin in the hand of the \"conceited\" Kimi to warn her, not out of jealously. Y\u016bko compares her action to that of K\u014dji with the wrench, and reveals that she is jealous of Koji's crime. She is jealous of \"not having a crime to her name\" that would allow her to at least \"stand beside him\". K\u014dji and Y\u016bko passionately embrace between the mosquito net, but Y\u016bko sees a figure outside and loudly screams that her husband is approaching. K\u014dji realises Y\u016bko wishes to be caught by Ippei, that it would liberate her from her \"long-continued suffering\". He is infuriated by Y\u016bko and refuses to let her through the mosquito net, not wanting to be caught by Ippei in an adulterous position with Y\u016bko. Ippei climbs the stairs and tells Y\u016bko he wants to sleep there because it is cool. Several days later, after a typhoon passes and misses West Izu, K\u014dji speaks with Kakujin the priest at Taisenji temple. He sees Y\u016bko and Ippei coming down the slope, and Y\u016bko asks K\u014dji to accompany Ippei on his daily walk. K\u014dji decides to confront Ippei on their walk, vehemently questioning him and accusing him of elaborately tormenting Y\u016bko and him under the guise of his mental incapacity. He calls him a \"hollow cavern\" and \"empty hole\" which the household revolves around. K\u014dji asks Ippei what he wants, to which Ippei responds he wishes to go home. K\u014dji is angered by this \"childlike supplication\" and further presses Ippei, asking him what he really wants. Ippei responds, \"Death. I want to die.\" They meet back up with Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji tells her that he feels his life is being lived solely for Ippei's sake. There is a tacit understanding between them, and Y\u016bko says, \"There's no going back now after all of this.\" The three of them arrive at the harbor, and Y\u016bko says they should travel to the other side of the bay one day. She suggests Teijir\u014d take them over in the boat in the middle of the day and that they should take \"lots of pictures\".\n\n===Epilogue===\nOn a summer vacation, a folklore researcher travels to Iro and speaks with a priest, Kakujin, who recounts his memories of Ippei, Y\u016bko, and K\u014dji. Kakujin tells of the time Y\u016bko and K\u014dji appeared at Taisenji temple, confessing to strangling Ippei to death. Kakujin shows the researcher the photo described in the novel's prologue. It had been given to him the day before Ippei was murdered. K\u014dji testified that he murdered Ippei at Ippei's request, but K\u014dji's gifting of the photograph to the priest was used as indelible evidence of [[Malice aforethought|premeditated]] murder. K\u014dji was given the death penalty, and Y\u016bko was sentenced to life imprisonment. While in prison, Y\u016bko requested Kakujin to arrange their graves side by side, with Y\u016bko in between. The researcher visits the graves, and takes a photograph. The priest asks the researcher to deliver the photograph on his behalf to Y\u016bko in person. The researcher later travels to Tochigi prison and meets Y\u016bko.

Similarly, a reference to Mt Taiya is also fictional. However, nearby Arari is a real mountain called \"Ono-san\" or \"Ono-yama.\" The Japanese characters \"Ono\" can also be read \"Taiya.\" Mishima stayed at a [[Ryokan (inn)|ryokan]] in Arari and also visited the Air Self Defense Force base at nearby Hamamatsu while writing ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' (Mishima is known to have been assiduous with his on-site research). A monument to Mishima is located in the area of Cape Kogane, with a passage from ''The Frolic of the Beasts'' engraved on it.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.at-s.com/facilities/article/view/place/133395.html |title=\u4e09\u5cf6\u7531\u7d00\u592b\u6587\u5b66\u7891\uff3b\u8cc0\u8302\u90e1\u897f\u4f0a\u8c46\u753a\uff3d\uff5c\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |date=27 November 2015 |website=\u30a2\u30c3\u30c8\u30a8\u30b9 |accessdate=10 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Title==\nBefore its official English translation, the novel's title was variously translated as ''Beastly Entanglements''<ref>{{cite book|author=Naoki Inose|title=Persona: A Biography of Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgPyWO87k8C&pg=PT374|date=1 January 2013|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|isbn=978-1-61172-008-2|page=374}}</ref> and ''The Amusement of Beasts''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Damian Flanagan|title=Yukio Mishima|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSUmCQAAQBAJ&pg=PA251|date=15 August 2014|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-78023-419-9|page=251}}</ref>\n\n==Characters==\n* '''K\u014dji''' \u2013 a 21-year-old university student who is a \"fun-loving, hotheaded youth\".<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wi17DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA27|year=2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43415-3|page=27}}</ref> He has \"regular and firm features\" and a \"somewhat oldfashioned warrior's face and relatively bony nose.\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Yukio Mishima|title=The Frolic of the Beasts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dMguDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT14|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-525-43416-0|page=14}}</ref> He has no living parents, siblings, or relatives, and went to college on his parents' inheritance.

He selected it as being appropriate because the story largely takes place in a rural shore town and involves a love triangle, which invokes a rock garden and a burning element that is beginning to affect the larger whole. The cover is among the best 75 book cover designs in America for 2018.\n\nUK Edition (Penguin Modern Classics)\nThe cover design uses a photograph taken in the mid 1960s by Eikoh Hosoe, and part of a series of photographs from a collection called Kamaitachi (a mythical weasel with sickle-like claws). The photo shoot took place in a remote farming village in the Tohoku district of Japan and was a collaboration between Eikoh and Tatsumi Hijikata, the creator of the Ankoku Buto (Dance of Darkness) style of dance.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[Motomezuka]]''\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{NCID|BN15662660}}\n\n{{Yukio Mishima}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frolic of the Beasts, The}}\n[[Category:1961 Japanese novels]]\n[[Category:Novels by Yukio Mishima]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Japan]]\n[[Category:Novels set in Tokyo]]\n[[Category:Novels first published in serial form]]\n[[Category:Works originally published in Shukan Shincho (magazine)]]\n[[Category:Japanese novels adapted into films]]\n[[Category:Shinchosha books]]\n[[Category:Adultery in novels]]\n[[Category:Novels about death]]\n[[Category:Novels about murder]]\n[[Category:Nonlinear narrative novels]]\n[[Category:Novels based on plays]]\n", "name_user": "I grieve in stereo", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eChapter 3", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frolic_of_the_Beasts"}

The name derives from ''Ryddynges'', a clearing or riding in a wood. This was the ancient forest known as Alfreton Grove within the manor of Alfreton. The settlement goes back at least to the 12th century, when Hugh de Ryddynges received half of the manor of Riddings and half of Watnall from his relative Ralf Ingram of Alfreton.<ref>Johnson, Reginald. 1968, Page 140 'A History of Alfreton'.</ref>\n\n==Industrial development==\nThe surrounding area had traditional industries of coal and ironstone mining, which remained small in scale until the opening of a branch from the [[Cromford Canal]] in 1793 gave impetus to the construction of iron furnaces. In 1800 [[Derby]] ironfounders Thomas Saxelby, James Oakes and Forrester opened the Riddings Iron Works. By 1806 Thos. Saxelby & Co. had become the largest producers of pig iron in Derbyshire.\n\nOakes became sole owner of the Iron Works in 1818 with the purchase of Forrester's shares (Saxelbye having sold up in 1808). Throughout the nineteenth century Oakes and his family expanded their industrial holdings to include several local collieries. In 1888 they established the Riddings and District Gas Company in partnership with the Butterley Company. By-products of gas production were used to produce tar, [[sulphuric acid]] and other chemicals; local supplies of clay were fired to make bricks and pipes.\n\n[[File:Riddings, Derbys, SW aspect.JPG|thumb|left|[[St James' Church, Riddings]]]]\nThe Oakes family contributed extensively to the fabric of the village. In addition to their family home of Riddings House these contributions included a substantial part of the parish church of [[James, son of Zebedee|St James]] (1833) and the National School of 1845. The church has a north \u2013 south alignment. Riddings House is now (2008) a residential home for the elderly, the surrounding park is now public, and the associated Model Farm has been converted to housing.\n\nThe German chemist [[Robert Bunsen]], who gave his name to the [[Bunsen burner]] in scientific experiments, was brought to Riddings in 1844 by Scottish scientist Professor [[Lyon Playfair, 1st Baron Playfair|Lyon Playfair]] to examine the behaviour of the coke fired blast furnaces.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} The buildings in which he worked still stand today on the former ironworks site.\n\nThe heavy industries have now gone but employment is now provided on a modern estate by lighter industries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Riddings History|publisher=Derbyshire UK Net|url=http://www.derbyshireuk.net/riddings.html|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref>\n\nThere is one family business in Riddings that has spanned 8 generations and is still trading after more than 200 years.

The latter was built in 1702 on the site of a chapel of ease dedicated to [[St Mary Magdalen]].\n\n==Windmills==\nJames Oakes also built two tower [[windmill]]s, named James and Sarah (after his wife Sarah Haddon).

Midland Wind and Watermills Group. {{ISBN|0-9517794-2-7}}</ref> or 1877, possibly on the site of a post mill advertised for sale in 1829. James was a brick tower {{convert|67|ft|m}} high of 7 storeys, {{convert|36|ft|6|in|m}} diameter at the base, driven by six double-bladed patent sails and with eight-bladed fantails. Sarah appears to have had only 6 storeys. There were 2 open galleries on both mills, above the second floor and below the cap. The windshafts were of iron, {{convert|13|in|cm}} diameter. Other internal equipment has not been recorded.\n\nBecause the mills were close together one of the towers would 'rob the wind' (or obstruct the airflow to the sails) of the other. Consequentially before 1890 the Sarah mill had its sails removed and the milling machinery powered by a vertical-boilered stationary steam engine. It is possible that Sarah never had the sails fitted. The mills were used for grinding grain from the Oakes' estates, both for flour and for animal feed. In 1918 the sails of the James mill were removed and the steam plant replaced by a {{convert|24|hp}} oil engine which powered both mills. The mills stopped work c. 1927.\n\nThe floors of James were removed some time after 1927 and the mill used by the Granwood company,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.granwood.co.uk/html/about_granwood_flooring__3_.html|title=Granwood flooring}}</ref> manufacturers of composition block flooring, to store sawdust.<ref>Gifford, Alan. 1995. Page 70. ''Derbyshire Windmills.'' Midland Wind and Watermills Group. {{ISBN|0-9517794-2-7}}</ref>\n\nOwnership of the mills passed to the [[National Coal Board]] in 1947. In 1948 the N.C.B. sold the mills and some surrounding land to Deosan Ltd., who had a nearby chemical factory. Both mills were used by Deosan as storage space. In the winter of 1949 Deosan contracted an Alfreton scrap dealer to remove most of the metal from the mills, including the windshafts, in preparation for the installation of working plant. From Sarah {{convert|30|LT|0}} of scrap were removed; from James (after erecting scaffolding inside the tower) {{convert|7|LT|0}}. The floors of James were re-instated and it was used for storage; Sarah had chemical plant installed.\n\nIn 1959 the Diversey Corporation of Chicago bought Deosan,<ref>Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, Feb. 1959 (VOL. 36)</ref> and the mills passed into the ownership of its subsidiary Diversey (UK) Ltd. In the early morning of Tuesday 29 January 1963 a fire started in Sarah, gutting the mill and destroying nearby storage sheds.

The floors of James were re-instated and it was used for storage; Sarah had chemical plant installed.\n\nIn 1959 the Diversey Corporation of Chicago bought Deosan,<ref>Journal of the American Oil Chemists' Society, Feb. 1959 (VOL. 36)</ref> and the mills passed into the ownership of its subsidiary Diversey (UK) Ltd. In the early morning of Tuesday 29 January 1963 a fire started in Sarah, gutting the mill and destroying nearby storage sheds. Both mills were demolished soon afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jacksdale.org.uk/pages/JDHeritage/RiddingsMills.htm|title=Riddings Windmills \u2013 'Sarah & James'|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105222846/http://jacksdale.org.uk/pages/JDHeritage/RiddingsMills.htm|archivedate=5 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The land has since become a housing estate.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.andrewspages.dial.pipex.com/dby/kelly/riddings.htm Relevant page of Kelly's Directory of the Counties of Derbyshire, Nottinghamshire and Leicestershire, 1891]\n*[http://www.picturethepast.org.uk/frontend.php?action=printdetails&keywords=Ref_No_increment;EQUALS;DMAG000860 Photograph of workers at the Oakes Iron Works at Riddings c. 1916]\n{{Commons category-inline|Riddings, Derbyshire}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Villages in Derbyshire]]\n[[Category:Geography of Amber Valley]]\n", "name_user": "Crouch, Swale", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:Category:Unparished areas in Derbyshire", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddings"}
