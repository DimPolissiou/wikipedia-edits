They maintain traditions that are similar to both [[Brahmins]] and [[Rajputs]]. According to community Comman Man A Writer  [https://karansinghshivtalav.blogspot.com/ Karan Singh Shivtalav] the community has rich cultural values, and is engaged primarily in agriculture, catering, and trading.<ref name=\"TOI2009\">{{cite news|title=Rajpurohits pitch in for Cong|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-04-14/jaipur/28018905_1_community-social-evils-rajasthan|accessdate=20 December 2012|newspaper=[[Times of India]]|date=14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nRajpurohit Is a Surname Represented that Brahmin By \"Dharma\" And \"Rajput\" By Karma , Actually In The Main Format Rajpurohit Is A Truely Son Of Lord \"Parshuram\".\n\nRajpurohit is a caste word. But it originated as a title. The first mention of the word priest is found in the Indus culture as a priestly king. What was the responsibility of this priestly king? There is no clear reference to this. By considering the dignity of the priestly king in civilization, we can infer that the priestly king had assumed a great responsibility. According to a research, the priestly king used to ensure that all the people of the city have eaten uninterrupted food, after which he himself takes food. This feature of the king is not found in any other diplomatic history. Another result of research has been found that one day of the year, on the day of Baisakhi Purnima, all the people of the city used to dedicate their movable and immovable property at the feet of the priest. The priestly king used to lawfully surrender this wealth to the supreme authority of the world and return it to its owner for offerings. The owner of the property, if disqualified and illegal, had the right to transfer the property to another appropriate person. Propertyless citizens also have the privilege of giving a fair share of collective property and dedicated property. In order to discharge that responsibility faithfully, the priestly king had to bear very special qualities. This very special quality can become the basis of interpretation of the word priest.\n<br />\n[[File:Kheteswar Dham.jpg|alt=Kheteswar Dham|thumb|[[Theartmound.blogspot.com|The Art Mound]]]]\n\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0The one who performs the priestly work is called the priest. Purohitya has been defined differently by different scholars. The true meaning of Purohitya is the name of the pure method that makes the Ihloka and the hereafter beautiful, for the welfare of the whole and the individual. The person carrying out this responsibility is a proven signature in itself. Purohitya is a method by which a person can succeed in the life of the hereafter and hereafter. The remaining people came to the priest to follow this method to make their life successful.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The term priest has been analyzed by many interpreters as + interest. The original meaning in this interpretation has remained the same. But the grammatical error remains flawed. There is a combination of the words Pur + U and Hita. Pur means city or village. Pur means city dwellers or villagers. Interest means welfare. In ancient times, there was the notion of city state and village state. By accepting the ideal of the welfare of all of them, that sense of overall welfare, the person who makes it a life goal. He holds the priestly title.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Now consider the word Rajpurohit. Raj + priest is analyzed by the interpreters as the priest of the king. According to the Tatpurusha Samas, in this sense, Raja Pradhan and the priest priest. He is a king and therefore a priest. But according to Sanatan tradition Vipra is first and Kshatriya second. Therefore, the second interpretation of the word Rajpurohit can also be the priest of the state. Raj also means a state or country. The entire group of men was called a state. In this sense, Rajpurohit became interested in the interests of the entire state. In this sense of Rajpurohit, the original meaning of the word Purohit is also preserved.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0At the end of the topic come the new interpretation of the word Rajpurohit. Which has not been mentioned before even today. Raj Mane Mysteries means mystery lanes, the path traveling towards the spiritual destination. In other words, the fields of knowledge, science, art, etc. related to the spiritual world. Knowledgeable, skilled and scientific personality of the spiritual world was called Rajguru. In the context of Rajpurohit, the person who has done purohitya karma to bring a person to Brahm has been named Rajpurohit. In other words, the person skilled in the art of making Narayan from a male is Rajpurohit. The question here is that in the spiritual world, there are no acts of consecration. This question is true that rituals are not required for a person who is walking towards the spiritual destination, the spiritual practice is the sponsorship of the teacher teaching various lessons of the world to achieve the progress of spirituality. Here the king is head and the priest is secondary. Hence the term Acharya has been more prevalent. Rajpurohit means the one who is interested in the whole society.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Elemental and logical can say that priest is not required in spiritual world. The priest is a business person, while spirituality is a sense of self. Here one thing has to be kept in mind that Purohitya can never be a business. There is no ritual ritual. It is a karmic science. Which is designed to make the world and spiritual world pleasant and beautiful.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 The above study shows that there are misconceptions about the priestly position in the society. But one can never be a businessman who lives in the interest. The priesthood is depicted by Pandits and Pandas. Its true form is not visible anywhere today. It was safe only with Rajpurohit.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0If we consider the word Rajpurohit in the context of Rajasthan, then the appearance of a vassal comes out. The modern meaning of Rajpurohit is for a person who has knowledge of wisdom, bravery like Kshatriya, efficiency of Vaishya and good sense of Shudra. Social economic theory uses the term Sadvipra for this. If Rajpurohit has all the above four qualities, then he can come under the purview of Sadvipra.

Before the Music Modernization Act, the status of copyright on sound recordings in the United States from before such copyrights were nationalized 1972 was somewhat nebulous. The copyrights granted prior to that were considered a state issue and, even if no state law provided for it, some courts established an extra-legal [[common law copyright]], the exact nature of which was inconsistently applied.<ref>[http://www.pdinfo.com/Copyright-Law/Public-Domain-Sound-Recordings.php ]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn the European Union and Canada, sound recordings were copyrighted for fifty years until 2013.

The film follows various people involved in the [[country music|country]] and [[gospel music]] businesses in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], over a five-day period, leading up to a gala concert for a [[Populism|populist]] outsider running for President on the Replacement Party ticket.\n\n''Nashville'' is often noted for its scope. The film contains 24 main characters, an hour's worth of musical numbers, and multiple storylines. Its large [[ensemble cast]] includes [[David Arkin]], [[Barbara Baxley]], [[Ned Beatty]], [[Karen Black]], [[Ronee Blakley]], [[Timothy Brown (actor)|Timothy Brown]], [[Keith Carradine]], [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Robert DoQui]], [[Shelley Duvall]], [[Allen Garfield]], [[Henry Gibson]], [[Scott Glenn]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], David Hayward, [[Michael Murphy (actor)|Michael Murphy]], [[Allan F. Nicholls]], Dave Peel, [[Cristina Raines]], [[Bert Remsen]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Gwen Welles]], and [[Keenan Wynn]].\n\nThe screenplay for ''Nashville'' was written by Altman's frequent collaborator [[Joan Tewkesbury]], based partly on her experiences as an outsider visiting the city and observing its local music industry. Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974.\n\n''Nashville'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the summer of 1975, and opened to largely positive reviews. It garnered [[List of accolades received by Nashville|numerous accolades]], including five [[Academy Award]] nominations, including one win for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] for Carradine's track \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\". The film was also nominated for a total of 11 [[Golden Globe Awards]], to date the highest number of nominations received by one film.\n\nSelected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] in 1992, it is now considered Altman's [[masterpiece|magnum opus]],<ref name=magnum>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/movies/la-ca-mn-nashville-robert-altman-20150607-story.html |title=Why Robert Altman's brilliant 'Nashville' never had a sequel  |last=Gabler |first=Neal |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 5, 2015 |accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref name=sffs>{{cite web|url=http://history.sffs.org/films/film_details.php?id=3416 |title=Nashville |last=Thomson |first=David |publisher=San Francisco Film Society |date=2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2016}} \"It seems clearer than ever that Nashville is [...] Altman's greatest achievement\"</ref> and one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest films of all time]].  \n\n==Plot==\nHal Philip Walker, a Replacement Party candidate in an upcoming election, arrives in [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] for a fundraising gala. Meanwhile, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the upcoming [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]]. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the [[BBC]], attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following a burn accident, and is greeted at [[Nashville International Airport|Berry Field]] by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are [[Private first class|Pfc.]] Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen [[groupie]] going by the name \"L.A. Joan,\" is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.\n\nOn the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from [[heat exhaustion]], and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle [[multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up]] occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea Reese, a white [[gospel]] singer, and Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two [[deafness|deaf]] children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White also performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another [[nervous breakdown]]. \n\nOn Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a [[Black church|black Baptist]] church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings [[In the Garden (1912 song)|\"In the Garden\"]] from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs. \n\nAfter Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at [[Opryland USA]] that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a [[striptease]] in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but she is saved by Wade.\n\nThe next morning, the performers and audience converge at the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]] for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred also arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. A bullet grazes Haven's arm, but Barbara Jean is seriously injured. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried from the stage, bleeding and unconscious, while Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \"[[assassination of John F. Kennedy|This isn't Dallas]]\". Winifred is handed the microphone in the melee, and begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", joined by Linnea's gospel choir.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Major characters'''\n{{cast listing|\n* [[David Arkin]] as Norman, a chauffeur hired to drive Bill, Mary and Tom during their stay in Nashville.

Smith]], all playing themselves. Gould and Christie were passing through Nashville when Altman added them. Altman himself plays Bob, an unseen producer who in the beginning of the film is producing Haven Hamilton's song \"200 Years.\" He can be heard on a speaker when Hamilton gets agitated by Frog's inept piano playing.\n\n==Analysis and themes==\nIn a 1995 academic article published in ''[[American Quarterly]]'', Paul Lauter, a professor of American Studies at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], compared the film to \"a poststructuralist theoretical text\", adding that \"it invites, indeed valorizes, contradiction and seems designed to resist closure.\"<ref name=\"versionsofnashville\">{{cite journal |first = Paul| last = Lauter| title=\"Versions of Nashville, Visions of American Studies\": Presidential Address to the American Studies Association, October 27, 1994 |journal=American Quarterly |volume=47 |issue=2 |page=197 |jstor=2713279 | date = June 1995   }}</ref> As a result, he explained, \"interpretations of the film have been wildly divergent and evaluations contradictory.\"<ref name=\"versionsofnashville\"/>\n\n===Political content===\nFilm scholars Yoram Allon, Del Cullen, and Hannah Patterson describe ''Nashville'' as an \"epic study of ambition, greed, talent, and politics in American culture, with the country and western music businesses serving as a microcosm of American society.\"{{sfn|Allon|Cullen|Patterson|2002|p=9}} Ray Sawhill of ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' views the film as reflective of the 1970s' political climate, writing that the film \"comes across as a piece of [[New Journalism]]; it's like [[Norman Mailer]]'s reports from conventions and rallies. Altman is using Nashville metaphorically\u2014he's really talking about politics. I wish he didn't make that quite so explicit. There's a reference to Dallas and a few to the [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]], as well as some red-white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era's uneasy political soul. What it reveals is a country trying to pull itself together from a nervous breakdown.\"<ref name=salon>{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/control/2000/06/27/nashville_2/|title=A movie called \"Nashville\"|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date=June 27, 2000|author=Sawhill, Ray|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190815051317/https://www.salon.com/control/2000/06/27/nashville_2/|archive-date=August 15, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Celebrity===\nSawhill suggests that the film is preoccupied with \"a populist culture driving itself mad with celebrity\" and presents Nashville as a \"provincial New York or [[Hollywood]], as one of the places where the culture manufactures its image of itself.\"<ref name=salon/> He cites the various recording and communication devices present as evidence of this: \"wires, phones, intercoms, cameras, mikes, speakers\u2014seem to be everywhere; so does the machinery of publicity and fame. We watch the city recording itself, playing itself back to itself and marketing that image to itself. We eavesdrop on the culture's conversation with itself.

Ronee Blakley, a singer-songwriter from [[Idaho]] with no acting experience,{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=167}} was in Nashville at the time and took on the role at the last minute, having been hired to write several songs for the film.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|pages=119\u2013122}} Barbara Harris, primarily a stage actress, was given the role of fledgling singer Winifred,{{sfn|Stuart|2003|pages=102\u2013104}} while Gwen Welles was cast as Sueleen, a waitress who longs to be a singer.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=80}} \n\nIn the role of Linnea Reese, the gospel singer and dedicated mother, Altman cast Lily Tomlin, who at the time had no prior film experience, having worked exclusively in television.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=93}} \"When I got the script, I didn't even know what part I was being considered for,\" Tomlin recalled. \"But I thought, I could play any one of these parts.

Under Altman's direction, Perri based the film's unusual, [[kitsch]]y title sequence on low-budget [[K-Tel Records]] television commercials, and bought in [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]] to provide the loud, brash [[voiceover]]. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"perkins\">{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|website=[[Art of the Title]]|accessdate=11 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811100417/http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|archivedate=11 August 2017|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAltman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director [[Alan Rudolph]] suggested he create an expanded version of ''Nashville'' to be shown in two parts, \"Nashville Red\" and \"Nashville Blue\", but the film ultimately remained intact.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour [[miniseries]] of ''Nashville'', based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases.\n\nHowever, in a 2000 interview with ''The A.V. Club'', Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there \"were no deleted scenes\" and that \"almost everything we shot is in that film\". Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn't used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Nashville: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nMany of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film.

'And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon.

Several incidents she experienced appear in the finished film, though Altman improvised numerous additional scenes and plot strands during filming. The film was shot on location in Nashville in 1974.\n\n''Nashville'' was released by [[Paramount Pictures]] in the summer of 1975, and opened to largely positive reviews.

Meanwhile, country superstar Haven Hamilton records a patriotic song commemorating the upcoming [[United States Bicentennial|Bicentennial]]. Opal, an Englishwoman who claims to be working on a documentary for the [[BBC]], attempts to listen in on the sessions. Later that day, country singer Barbara Jean returns to Nashville following a burn accident, and is greeted at [[Nashville International Airport|Berry Field]] by local industry elites, including Haven and his companion, Lady Pearl, a nightclub owner. Also present are [[Private first class|Pfc.]] Glenn Kelly, who is obsessed with Barbara Jean, and a popular folk trio consisting of married couple Bill and Mary, and guitarist Tom, who are in town to record an album. Meanwhile, Martha, a teen [[groupie]] going by the name \"L.A. Joan,\" is picked up by her uncle, Mr. Green, at the airport; she has arrived to visit her dying aunt Esther, but covertly plans to pursue musicians. In the airport cafe, African-American cook Wade Cooley and his co-worker, a waitress named Sueleen, discuss her aspirations to become a singer.\n\nOn the tarmac, Barbara Jean collapses from [[heat exhaustion]], and those in attendance depart the airport only to become stranded after a vehicle [[multiple-vehicle collision|pile-up]] occurs. During the commotion, Winifred, an aspiring country singer, runs away from her husband Star; Star then gives a ride to Kenny Frasier, who has just arrived in town carrying a violin case. Opal takes advantage of the traffic jam to interview Linnea Reese, a white [[gospel]] singer, and Tommy Brown, an African-American country singer. That night, Sueleen performs at an open mic at Lady Pearl's club, demonstrating no singing ability. Meanwhile, Linnea's husband Del has John Triplette, Walker's political organizer, over for dinner. Throughout the meal, Linnea mainly focuses on communicating with her two [[deafness|deaf]] children. Tom, who crossed paths with Linnea earlier that day, phones the house to ask Linnea on a date, but she dissuades him. Glamorous singer Connie White also performs that night, in lieu of Barbara Jean at the [[Grand Ole Opry]]. Mary misses Connie's performance to Bill's dismay, instead having sex with Tom at the hotel. At the hospital, Barbara Jean argues with her manager husband Barnett over Connie replacing her, and he accuses her of having another [[nervous breakdown]]. \n\nOn Sunday morning, Lady Pearl, Wade, and Sueleen attend a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] mass, while Linnea sings in the choir of a [[Black church|black Baptist]] church. In the hospital chapel, Barbara Jean sings [[In the Garden (1912 song)|\"In the Garden\"]] from her wheelchair while Mr. Green, Pfc. Kelly, and others watch. Opal wanders through a massive auto scrapyard, recording observations on a tape recorder. Haven, Tommy, and their families attend the stock car races, where Winifred unsuccessfully attempts to sing on a small stage. Bill and Mary argue in their hotel room and are interrupted by Triplette, who recruits them to perform at the gala, while Tom tries to get chauffeur Norman to score him drugs. \n\nAfter Barbara Jean is discharged, she gives a performance at [[Opryland USA]] that ends in her being pulled off stage as she rambles between songs. To remediate her poor performance, Barnett pledges her to perform at Walker's gala. Martha meanwhile agitates Kenny, who is renting a room in her uncle's house, when she attempts to investigate his violin case. At Lady Pearl's club that night, Linnea, Martha, Bill, Mary, Opal, Norman and Wade are among those attending an open mic. Tom sings \"[[I'm Easy (Keith Carradine song)|I'm Easy]]\" and Linnea, moved, goes back to his room, where they have sex. Meanwhile, at an all-male Walker fundraiser, Sueleen is booed off stage for singing poorly; Del and Triplette convince her to perform a [[striptease]] in exchange for a slot at the gala. A drunken Del later comes onto Sueleen, but she is saved by Wade.\n\nThe next morning, the performers and audience converge at the [[Parthenon (Nashville)|Parthenon]] for Walker's gala concert. The lineup consists of Haven, Barbara Jean, Linnea and her choir, Mary and Tom, and Sueleen; Winifred also arrives, hoping to sing. Meanwhile, Mr. Green and Kenny arrive at the gala searching for Martha, who has failed to attend her aunt Esther's funeral, and find her accompanying Bill. During Barbara Jean's set, Kenny produces a gun from his violin case, and begins shooting at the stage. A bullet grazes Haven's arm, but Barbara Jean is seriously injured. Pfc. Kelly disarms Kenny as chaos breaks out. Barbara Jean is carried from the stage, bleeding and unconscious, while Haven tries to calm the crowd by exhorting them to sing, asserting that \"[[assassination of John F. Kennedy|This isn't Dallas]]\". Winifred is handed the microphone in the melee, and begins singing \"It Don't Worry Me\", joined by Linnea's gospel choir.\n\n==Cast==\n'''Major characters'''\n{{cast listing|\n* [[David Arkin]] as Norman, a chauffeur hired to drive Bill, Mary and Tom during their stay in Nashville.

Altman is using Nashville metaphorically\u2014he's really talking about politics. I wish he didn't make that quite so explicit. There's a reference to Dallas and a few to the [[Kennedy family|Kennedys]], as well as some red-white-and-blue visual cues, that the film could have done without. Still, the result is an X-ray of the era's uneasy political soul.

Under Altman's direction, Perri based the film's unusual, [[kitsch]]y title sequence on low-budget [[K-Tel Records]] television commercials, and bought in [[Johnny Grant (radio personality)|Johnny Grant]] to provide the loud, brash [[voiceover]]. Perri later went on to design titles for a number of other major Hollywood pictures, including ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' (1976), ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977), and ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980).<ref name=\"perkins\">{{cite web|last1=Perkins|first1=Will|title=Dan Perri: A Career Retrospective|url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|website=[[Art of the Title]]|accessdate=11 August 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170811100417/http://www.artofthetitle.com/feature/dan-perri-a-career-retrospective/|archivedate=11 August 2017|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAltman had enough footage to produce a four-hour film, and assistant director [[Alan Rudolph]] suggested he create an expanded version of ''Nashville'' to be shown in two parts, \"Nashville Red\" and \"Nashville Blue\", but the film ultimately remained intact.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} After a rush of critical acclaim, ABC expressed interest in a proposal for a 10-hour [[miniseries]] of ''Nashville'', based on the footage not used in the final cut, but plans for the project were scrapped.{{sfn|Stuart|2003|p=276}} The additional footage has not been made available on DVD releases.\n\nHowever, in a 2000 interview with ''The A.V. Club'', Altman disputed the claim that he had several hours worth of deleted scenes to cut another feature-length film (or two) out of. Altman claimed that there \"were no deleted scenes\" and that \"almost everything we shot is in that film\". Altman further stated the unseen, extra footage that wasn't used in the final cut of the film was mainly music and not much else.\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Nashville: The Original Motion Picture Soundtrack}}\nMany of the actors and actresses in the film composed the songs they performed in the film.

'Well, I mean you're the one that predicted there would be a political assassination of a star.' 'And I said 'Well, I don't feel responsible,' but I said, 'but don't you feel responsible for not heeding my warning?' The statement here is, these people are not assassinated because of their ideas or what they do. They're assassinated to draw attention to the assassin. And in political assassinations, in their sort of warped minds, they know that they are going to have a certain amount of people who said 'that son of a bitch [the politician] should have been shot,' because there's such heat about it. But actually what they are doing is killing somebody who's in the public eye and is some sort of an icon. Because this feeling that by doing that, committing that assassination they draw the attention to themself, and they make themselves consequently important.
