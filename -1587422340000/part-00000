The post is named after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General]] [[John Bell Hood]] who is best known for commanding the [[Texas Brigade]] against the U.S. Army during the [[American Civil War]]. It is located halfway between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], about {{convert|60|mi}} from each, within the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. Fort Hood is an installation of the United States Army.\n\nIts origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August. As originally constructed, Fort Hood had an area of {{convert|158706|acre}}, with billeting for 6,007 officers and 82,610 enlisted personnel. The main [[cantonment]] of Fort Hood had a total population of 53,416 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. Fort Hood is the most populous [[United States military deployments|U.S. military installation]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news |title=Tested by tragedy, Fort Hood family of civilians and soldiers deserve Texan of the Year honor |author=James Ragland |url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/columnists/james-ragland/20091206-Tested-by-tragedy-Fort-Hood-2933.ece |newspaper=Dallas Morning News |date=December 6, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}<br/>{{cite news |title=Bangor native to head leadership group  |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5BA9AAAAIBAJ&sjid=RS4MAAAAIBAJ&dq=fort%20hood%20most%20populous%20world&pg=1099%2C4334436 |newspaper=Bangor Daily News |date=April 10, 1985 |accessdate=May 4, 2013}}</ref> The main business area is in [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]], with the training countryside area of the post in [[Coryell County, Texas|Coryell County]]. In April 2014, the Fort Hood website lists 45,414 assigned soldiers and 8,900 civilian employees with Fort Hood covering {{convert|214000|acre}}, making it one of the largest military bases in the world by area.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins===\nDuring [[World War II]], [[tank destroyer]]s were developed to counter German mobile armored units. These were mobile anti-[[tank]] guns on armored [[Half-track|halftracks]] or specially developed tanks. Wide-open space was needed for the tank destroyer testing and training, which Texas had in abundance. [[Andrew Davis Bruce|Andrew Davis (A.D.) Bruce]] was assigned to organize a new Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing Center, and he chose Killeen, Texas for the new camp.<ref name=\"historicalmarker\">{{cite web|title=Lt.

An initial acquisition of {{Convert|180000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.\n\nAbout 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of [[Clear Creek, Texas|Clear Creek]], [[Elijah, Texas|Elijah]], and [[Antelope, Texas (Bell County)|Antelope]] were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the \"Cradle of Killeen,\" provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Hood area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn mid-August the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named for the Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]], who gained recognition during the Civil War as the commander of Hood's [[Texas Brigade]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional {{Convert|16000|acre|km2}} in Bell County and {{Convert|34943|acre|km2}} in [[Coryell County]] near [[Gatesville, Texas]] were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as [[North Camp Hood]]. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nAt the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops, which was maintained until early 1944.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1944, the number of tank destroyer battalions in training at Camp Hood declined rapidly. [[Field artillery]] battalions and the Infantry Replacement Training Center replaced them in March 1944. By September, the Infantry Center was the largest activity on post with 31,545 troops. The total camp population on the last day of 1944 was 50,228.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDuring the last year of World War II Camp Hood's mission shifted and its population drastically decreased. As the war came to an end, troop training slowed and the priorities were equipment reclamation and demobilization. A separation center was established in September 1945, and as the year ended, post strength had fallen to 1,807 prisoners and about 11,000 troops.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[File:DBP.Uniform.2009.jpg|thumb|Lt. [[Donald Prell]] wearing his WWII U.S. Army uniform in 2009]]\nThe Infantry Replacement Center was officially shut down on January 7, 1946, the orders being signed by the Adjutant General, Major John O\u2019Keefe and the Assistant Adjutant General, 1st. Lt. [[Donald Prell]].\n\nIn mid-1954, [[III Corps (United States)|III Corps]] moved from [[California]] to Fort Hood. The Corps supervised the training of combat units at Fort Hood and other Fourth Army stations from 1954 to 1959 when III Corps was inactivated. Probably the most famous trainee to come through Fort Hood was [[Elvis Presley]], arriving on 28 March 1958. Other than receiving record amounts of mail (3\u20134 bags per day), he was treated like all other trainees. On 19 September, Presley shipped out for Germany.\nDuring this period, the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] was reactivated and deployed to Germany as part of the \"Gyroscope\" concept of unit movement. In 1958, the 4th Infantry Division was selected to be the sole infantry component in the [[Strategic Army Corps]] (STRAC) and assigned the mission to suppress aggression wherever American interests were threatened.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the U.S. Army [[Strategic Army Corps]] (STRAC). On 15 June 1963 [[West Fort Hood|Killeen Base]] was turned over to the Army.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn October 1969, Killeen Base was designated as [[West Fort Hood]] and the airfield's name was designated as Robert Gray Army Airfield. The base was named after a Killeen native who was a pilot of a B-25 bomber on the famous [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo in 1942. He was killed later in World War II flying combat missions. With the redesignation came a change in mission at West Fort Hood. Nuclear weapons were removed; they had been secretly kept there since 1947.<ref>Fort Hood: The Great Place to Call Home, Fort Hood's Official Post Guide, Fort Hood History, page 72. Marcoa Publishing Inc., 2004, under contract with Fort Hood. Editorial content edited and prepared by the Public Affairs Office of Fort Hood.</ref>\n\nDuring the late 1960s Fort Hood trained and deployed a number of units and individuals for duty in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. As the United States ended its role in the conflict, thousands of returning soldiers completed their active duty with one of the divisions. During this time, the post was modernized. On 13 September 1965 Darnall Hospital opened. In 1970, construction began on Palmer Theater and Venable Village was dedicated. Modern barracks were springing up around post. The wood buildings of Fort Hood were replaced with brick structures.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 1967, Fort Hood was officially designated a two-division post with the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions.\n\nIn 1971, the colors of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] came to Fort Hood from Vietnam, resulting in the reflagging of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], the colors of which were sent to Germany to reflag the 4th Armored Division.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFrom 23 December 1972, to 19 January 1973, Elements of the 13th Support Brigade deployed to the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]] to assist in disaster relief serving at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSince the early 1970s, Fort Hood has played a major role in the training, testing, and introduction of new equipment, tactics, and organizations. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Test and Experimentation Command (now the U.S. Army Operational Test Command), located at West Fort Hood has been A primary player. Fort Hood fielded the [[M1 Abrams]] tank, [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2/3 Bradley Infantry/Cavalry Fighting Vehicle]], the Multiple Launch rocket System (MLRS), and the AH-64 Apache helicopter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn January 1975, the 1st Cav \"First Team\" was reorganized, as the Army's newest armored division. Since fielding the M-1 Abrams in 1980, force modernization has continued as a major focus. The First Team became the first division to field the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the [[Humvee]], the [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|Multiple Launch Rocket System]] and [[Mobile Subscriber Equipment]] (MSE) tactical communications.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Army expeditions 1990\u20132000===\n\nIn August 1990, Fort Hood was alerted for deployments to Southwest Asia as part of the joint forces participating in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Shield]]. The deployment to [[Saudi Arabia]] began in September, extending into mid-October.\n\nOn 21 May 1991, with the reactivation of its 3rd Brigade (\"Greywolf\") the 1st Cavalry Division became the largest division in the Army upon its return to the United States. In October 1992 the Engineer Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reactivated. Through the Engineer Restructuring Initiative, the nucleus of the brigade was formed around the [[8th Engineer Battalion]]. The [[20th Engineer Battalion]] was brought from Fort Campbell, KY, to join the brigade, and the [[91st Engineer Battalion]] was activated to complete the brigade.\n\nIn November 1992, the unit designations for the battalions remaining from the former \"Tiger\" Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division were returned prior to 2nd AD's activation at Fort Hood on 2 December 1992. This action was done to realign the historical designations of units to their parent divisions. On 29 November 1992, the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry was designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry; 1st Battalion, 67th Armor to 3rd Battalion, [[8th Cavalry Regiment|8th Cavalry]], and 1st Battalion, [[3rd Field Artillery]] to 2nd Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery]]. On 16 December 1992, 1st Cavalry Division units designated to accomplish realignments for historical purposes and included the 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor reflagged as 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry; 3rd Battalion, 32nd Armor to 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry; and Battery A, [[333rd Field Artillery]] to Battery B, [[26th Field Artillery]].\n\nDuring the post war periods called [[Operation Desert Farewell|Operation Desert Calm]] and [[Operation Provide Comfort]], Fort Hood units continued to serve in the [[Persian Gulf]] area. From December 1992 to May 1993, Fort Hood soldiers deployed to [[Somalia]] for [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] to command and control the Joint Task Force Support Command. In the fall of 1994, Fort Hood units participated in the largest deployment since Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm executed split base operations in the Caribbean Basin, Central America and Southwest Asia, in support of Operations Vigilant Warrior and Sea Signal V, as well as other contingency operations.\n\n13th COSCOM Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the headquarters in December 1992 to [[Mogadishu]] to serve as the nucleus of [[Joint Task Force Support Command]]. Their major units included the 593rd Support Group ([[Fort Lewis]]), 36th Engineer Group ([[Fort Benning]]), [[7th Transportation Brigade (United States)|7th Transportation Group]] ([[Fort Eustis]]), and 62d Medical Group (Fort Lewis). Soldiers of the Lucky 13th returned to Fort hood in May 1993.\n\nAs a result of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission (BRAC) reductions, the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]], then located at [[Fort Polk]] Louisiana, was reflagged as the U.S. 2nd Armored Division in late 1992. By mid-1993 the division at Fort Hood had completed changes of unit names to those associated with the 5th Division, and began participation in the early stages of the Army's Experimental Force, [[Transformation of the United States Army|Force XXI]].\n\nIn 1995, the 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Infantry Division]]. Twenty-five years after making its home in Colorado, the Ironhorse Division was again restationed to meet the Army's requirements but this move would be quite different from others. The Ironhorse Division became a split-based organization with six brigades and three separate battalions stationed at Fort Hood and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team remaining at [[Fort Carson]]. By December 1995 The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) assumed responsibility as the Army's Experimental Force (Force XXI), and on 15 December 1995 its colors were unfurled for the first time over central Texas and Fort Hood.\n\nSince the 1990s, Fort Hood units have supported [[Implementation Force|Operation Joint Endeavor]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In October 1998, The 1st Cavalry Division was the first United States division to assume authority of the Multinational Division (North) area of operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mission was to conduct operations to enforce the military provisions set forth by the Dayton Peace Accords.\n\nIn 1998, the Ironhorse Division was designated to be the Army's first Multi-Component unit. The main objective being to enhance Total Force integration, optimize the unique capabilities of each component, and improve the overall readiness of the Army. The program was developed to leverage the strengths of the Army's three components (active, reserve and National Guard). As such, 515 positions within the division have been designated as reserve component. These positions include individuals, a unit from the [[Wyoming National Guard]] and dual-mission units from the [[Texas Army National Guard]].\n\nIn addition to peacekeeping efforts, Fort Hood units routinely participate in national and international disaster relief efforts. Hours after the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], III Corps units were ready to move out to provide assistance. Fort Hood units also aided [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]], after an earthquake ravaged the city.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Fort Hood continued an extensive building program to modernize the post. This modernization continues today{{when|date=October 2015}}, with emphasis on quality of life, force projection and training. The Robertson Blood Center, Soldier Development Center, and a new commissary at Warrior Way have been completed. Many other improvements were made to improve the Power Projection Mission of the post such as improvements to the railhead and the runway at Gray Army Airfield. Training ranges have been upgraded.\n\n===Army expeditions 2000 until 2009===\nAt the beginning of the 21st century the Army's modernization was in full swing. Some of these new advances in technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank, the M2A2 [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the [[M109 howitzer|M109A6 Paladin howitzer]], the [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]], the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow Helicopter]], and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Bradley Linebacker]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFort Hood was the first installation selected to privatize post housing under the residential communities initiative. Under this initiative, new housing units, remodeled housing and community improvements will be added to the post.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 2001, the [[War on Terror]] became a prime focus. Fort Hood transitioned from an open to a closed post with the help of military police from reserve units. The 1st Cav sent additional troops to [[Kuwait]] to protect against possible aggressive actions from Iraq. The 4003rd Garrison Support Reserve unit fills vacancies left by deploying units at Fort Hood. Fort Hood has a key role as a training base for mobilizing Reserve and National Guard units to support the Homeland Defense effort.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany Fort Hood units have deployed to [[Afghanistan]] for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and to [[Iraq]] for [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. In December 2003, the 4th Infantry Division captured [[Saddam Hussein]]. In the spring of 2004, the 1st Cavalry Division followed the 4th Infantry Division deploying to Iraq. [[Task Force ODIN]] was created at Ft. Hood.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 2005, 13th COSCOM and key enablers were called to support Joint Task Force [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]/[[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hurricane relief and went on to serve as the senior joint logistical support command for JTF Katrina. 13th COSCOM eventually provided one hundred million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 2009, Fort Carson, [[Colorado|Colorado's]] First Army Division West re-stationed to Fort Hood in order to consolidate its mission to conduct [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve component]] mobilization training and validation for deployment, switching places with 4th Infantry Division, which relocated to Fort Carson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations |title=Force Structure Actions at Fort Hood, |publisher=U.S. Army Public Affairs. |accessdate=5 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212120/http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations/ |archivedate=19 June 2009 |df=dmy }}.  8 June 2009.</ref>\n\n===2007 navigation exercise incident===\nOn 12 June 2007, the body of Lawrence George Sprader, Jr was found at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. in a brushy area located within the Central Texas Army post's training ground.

During peacetime, Fort Hood is a gated post, with the 1st Cavalry Division Museum, the Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA), and a number of other facilities that are open to the public. Access to the cantonments became restricted starting In July 2001. However, passes are available to visit the two museums on post, and the lake area remains open to the public without restriction since it is outside the cantonments.

The Fort Hood main cantonment area, otherwise referred to as Main post, holds its own airfield, [[Hood Army Airfield]]. North Fort Hood is bounded by Gatesville to the northwest. West Fort Hood, bounded by Killeen and Copperas Cove, includes Fort Hood's second airfield, [[Robert Gray Army Airfield]], which has been expanded for civilian use ([[Killeen\u2013Fort Hood Regional Airport]] (GRK)) and additional training areas.

The post is named after [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] [[General]] [[John Bell Hood]] who is best known for commanding the [[Texas Brigade]] against the U.S. Army during the [[American Civil War]]. It is located halfway between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], about {{convert|60|mi}} from each, within the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]]. Fort Hood is an installation of the United States Army.\n\nIts origin was the need for wide-open space to test and train with World War II tank destroyers. The [[United States Department of War|War Department]] announced the location in January 1942, and the initial completion was set for that August. As originally constructed, Fort Hood had an area of {{convert|158706|acre}}, with billeting for 6,007 officers and 82,610 enlisted personnel.

An initial acquisition of {{Convert|180000|acre|km2|abbr=on}} was made, and it was estimated that the camp would cost $22.8 million for the land, facilities, and development of utilities. The date of completion was set for 15 August 1942.\n\nAbout 300 families had to move from their homes to make room for the camp area and the communities of [[Clear Creek, Texas|Clear Creek]], [[Elijah, Texas|Elijah]], and [[Antelope, Texas (Bell County)|Antelope]] were demolished to facilitate construction of the base. The old Sugar Loaf community, historically called the \"Cradle of Killeen,\" provided the city with many of its first citizens in 1882. All that remains of the community is the mountain from which it took its name, located in the Fort Hood area. To lessen the burden of moving, the Army agreed to allow land to be used for grazing for a nominal grazing fee. This grazing arrangement still continues today.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn mid-August the camp was occupied and the official opening took place on 18 September 1942. Camp Hood was named for the Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]], who gained recognition during the Civil War as the commander of Hood's [[Texas Brigade]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe original facilities provided housing and training sites for nearly 38,000 troops. In January 1943, an additional {{Convert|16000|acre|km2}} in Bell County and {{Convert|34943|acre|km2}} in [[Coryell County]] near [[Gatesville, Texas]] were purchased. The site near Gatesville was known as the sub-camp and later as [[North Camp Hood]]. During the war years, North Camp Hood housed nearly 40,000 troops and 4,000 prisoners of war, and was the site for the southern branch of the [[United States Disciplinary Barracks]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nAt the end of 1942, there were about 45,000 troops living and training at Camp Hood and in late June 1943 it peaked at almost 95,000 troops, which was maintained until early 1944.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 1944, the number of tank destroyer battalions in training at Camp Hood declined rapidly. [[Field artillery]] battalions and the Infantry Replacement Training Center replaced them in March 1944. By September, the Infantry Center was the largest activity on post with 31,545 troops. The total camp population on the last day of 1944 was 50,228.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nDuring the last year of World War II Camp Hood's mission shifted and its population drastically decreased. As the war came to an end, troop training slowed and the priorities were equipment reclamation and demobilization. A separation center was established in September 1945, and as the year ended, post strength had fallen to 1,807 prisoners and about 11,000 troops.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} [[File:DBP.Uniform.2009.jpg|thumb|Lt.

The Corps supervised the training of combat units at Fort Hood and other Fourth Army stations from 1954 to 1959 when III Corps was inactivated. Probably the most famous trainee to come through Fort Hood was [[Elvis Presley]], arriving on 28 March 1958. Other than receiving record amounts of mail (3\u20134 bags per day), he was treated like all other trainees. On 19 September, Presley shipped out for Germany.\nDuring this period, the [[4th Armored Division (United States)|4th Armored Division]] was reactivated and deployed to Germany as part of the \"Gyroscope\" concept of unit movement. In 1958, the 4th Infantry Division was selected to be the sole infantry component in the [[Strategic Army Corps]] (STRAC) and assigned the mission to suppress aggression wherever American interests were threatened.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 1961, Fort Hood again became the home for the III Corps, and in February 1962, III Corps was assigned as part of the U.S. Army [[Strategic Army Corps]] (STRAC). On 15 June 1963 [[West Fort Hood|Killeen Base]] was turned over to the Army.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn October 1969, Killeen Base was designated as [[West Fort Hood]] and the airfield's name was designated as Robert Gray Army Airfield. The base was named after a Killeen native who was a pilot of a B-25 bomber on the famous [[Doolittle Raid]] on Tokyo in 1942. He was killed later in World War II flying combat missions. With the redesignation came a change in mission at West Fort Hood.

As the United States ended its role in the conflict, thousands of returning soldiers completed their active duty with one of the divisions. During this time, the post was modernized. On 13 September 1965 Darnall Hospital opened. In 1970, construction began on Palmer Theater and Venable Village was dedicated. Modern barracks were springing up around post. The wood buildings of Fort Hood were replaced with brick structures.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 1967, Fort Hood was officially designated a two-division post with the 1st and 2nd Armored Divisions.\n\nIn 1971, the colors of the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]] came to Fort Hood from Vietnam, resulting in the reflagging of the [[1st Armored Division (United States)|1st Armored Division]], the colors of which were sent to Germany to reflag the 4th Armored Division.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFrom 23 December 1972, to 19 January 1973, Elements of the 13th Support Brigade deployed to the [[1972 Nicaragua earthquake]] to assist in disaster relief serving at Camp Christine, Managua, Nicaragua.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSince the early 1970s, Fort Hood has played a major role in the training, testing, and introduction of new equipment, tactics, and organizations. The U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command's Test and Experimentation Command (now the U.S. Army Operational Test Command), located at West Fort Hood has been A primary player. Fort Hood fielded the [[M1 Abrams]] tank, [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle|M2/3 Bradley Infantry/Cavalry Fighting Vehicle]], the Multiple Launch rocket System (MLRS), and the AH-64 Apache helicopter.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn January 1975, the 1st Cav \"First Team\" was reorganized, as the Army's newest armored division. Since fielding the M-1 Abrams in 1980, force modernization has continued as a major focus. The First Team became the first division to field the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter, M2 Bradley Fighting Vehicle, the [[Humvee]], the [[M270 Multiple Launch Rocket System|Multiple Launch Rocket System]] and [[Mobile Subscriber Equipment]] (MSE) tactical communications.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\n===Army expeditions 1990\u20132000===\n\nIn August 1990, Fort Hood was alerted for deployments to Southwest Asia as part of the joint forces participating in [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Shield]]. The deployment to [[Saudi Arabia]] began in September, extending into mid-October.\n\nOn 21 May 1991, with the reactivation of its 3rd Brigade (\"Greywolf\") the 1st Cavalry Division became the largest division in the Army upon its return to the United States. In October 1992 the Engineer Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division was reactivated. Through the Engineer Restructuring Initiative, the nucleus of the brigade was formed around the [[8th Engineer Battalion]]. The [[20th Engineer Battalion]] was brought from Fort Campbell, KY, to join the brigade, and the [[91st Engineer Battalion]] was activated to complete the brigade.\n\nIn November 1992, the unit designations for the battalions remaining from the former \"Tiger\" Brigade of the 2nd Armored Division were returned prior to 2nd AD's activation at Fort Hood on 2 December 1992. This action was done to realign the historical designations of units to their parent divisions. On 29 November 1992, the 3rd Battalion, 41st Infantry was designated as the 1st Battalion, 9th Cavalry; 1st Battalion, 67th Armor to 3rd Battalion, [[8th Cavalry Regiment|8th Cavalry]], and 1st Battalion, [[3rd Field Artillery]] to 2nd Battalion, [[82nd Field Artillery]]. On 16 December 1992, 1st Cavalry Division units designated to accomplish realignments for historical purposes and included the 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor reflagged as 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry; 3rd Battalion, 32nd Armor to 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry; and Battery A, [[333rd Field Artillery]] to Battery B, [[26th Field Artillery]].\n\nDuring the post war periods called [[Operation Desert Farewell|Operation Desert Calm]] and [[Operation Provide Comfort]], Fort Hood units continued to serve in the [[Persian Gulf]] area. From December 1992 to May 1993, Fort Hood soldiers deployed to [[Somalia]] for [[Unified Task Force|Operation Restore Hope]] to command and control the Joint Task Force Support Command. In the fall of 1994, Fort Hood units participated in the largest deployment since Operation Desert Shield and Desert Storm executed split base operations in the Caribbean Basin, Central America and Southwest Asia, in support of Operations Vigilant Warrior and Sea Signal V, as well as other contingency operations.\n\n13th COSCOM Commander Brig. Gen. Billy K. Solomon deployed along with a portion of the headquarters in December 1992 to [[Mogadishu]] to serve as the nucleus of [[Joint Task Force Support Command]]. Their major units included the 593rd Support Group ([[Fort Lewis]]), 36th Engineer Group ([[Fort Benning]]), [[7th Transportation Brigade (United States)|7th Transportation Group]] ([[Fort Eustis]]), and 62d Medical Group (Fort Lewis). Soldiers of the Lucky 13th returned to Fort hood in May 1993.\n\nAs a result of the [[Base Realignment and Closure]] Commission (BRAC) reductions, the [[5th Infantry Division (United States)|5th Infantry Division (Mechanized)]], then located at [[Fort Polk]] Louisiana, was reflagged as the U.S. 2nd Armored Division in late 1992. By mid-1993 the division at Fort Hood had completed changes of unit names to those associated with the 5th Division, and began participation in the early stages of the Army's Experimental Force, [[Transformation of the United States Army|Force XXI]].\n\nIn 1995, the 2nd Armored Division was reflagged as the [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|U.S. 4th Infantry Division]]. Twenty-five years after making its home in Colorado, the Ironhorse Division was again restationed to meet the Army's requirements but this move would be quite different from others. The Ironhorse Division became a split-based organization with six brigades and three separate battalions stationed at Fort Hood and the 3rd Brigade Combat Team remaining at [[Fort Carson]]. By December 1995 The 4th Infantry Division (Mechanized) assumed responsibility as the Army's Experimental Force (Force XXI), and on 15 December 1995 its colors were unfurled for the first time over central Texas and Fort Hood.\n\nSince the 1990s, Fort Hood units have supported [[Implementation Force|Operation Joint Endeavor]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In October 1998, The 1st Cavalry Division was the first United States division to assume authority of the Multinational Division (North) area of operation in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The mission was to conduct operations to enforce the military provisions set forth by the Dayton Peace Accords.\n\nIn 1998, the Ironhorse Division was designated to be the Army's first Multi-Component unit. The main objective being to enhance Total Force integration, optimize the unique capabilities of each component, and improve the overall readiness of the Army. The program was developed to leverage the strengths of the Army's three components (active, reserve and National Guard). As such, 515 positions within the division have been designated as reserve component. These positions include individuals, a unit from the [[Wyoming National Guard]] and dual-mission units from the [[Texas Army National Guard]].\n\nIn addition to peacekeeping efforts, Fort Hood units routinely participate in national and international disaster relief efforts. Hours after the [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]], III Corps units were ready to move out to provide assistance. Fort Hood units also aided [[Managua]], [[Nicaragua]], after an earthquake ravaged the city.\n\nDuring the 1990s, Fort Hood continued an extensive building program to modernize the post. This modernization continues today{{when|date=October 2015}}, with emphasis on quality of life, force projection and training. The Robertson Blood Center, Soldier Development Center, and a new commissary at Warrior Way have been completed. Many other improvements were made to improve the Power Projection Mission of the post such as improvements to the railhead and the runway at Gray Army Airfield. Training ranges have been upgraded.\n\n===Army expeditions 2000 until 2009===\nAt the beginning of the 21st century the Army's modernization was in full swing. Some of these new advances in technology and war fighting included the fielding of the M1A2 Abrams Main Battle Tank, the M2A2 [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]] (ODS) Bradley Infantry Fighting Vehicle, the [[M109 howitzer|M109A6 Paladin howitzer]], the [[Bell OH-58 Kiowa|OH-58D Kiowa Warrior]], the [[Boeing AH-64 Apache|AH-64D Apache Longbow Helicopter]], and the [[Bradley Fighting Vehicle#M6 Linebacker|M6 Bradley Linebacker]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nFort Hood was the first installation selected to privatize post housing under the residential communities initiative. Under this initiative, new housing units, remodeled housing and community improvements will be added to the post.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 2001, the [[War on Terror]] became a prime focus. Fort Hood transitioned from an open to a closed post with the help of military police from reserve units. The 1st Cav sent additional troops to [[Kuwait]] to protect against possible aggressive actions from Iraq. The 4003rd Garrison Support Reserve unit fills vacancies left by deploying units at Fort Hood. Fort Hood has a key role as a training base for mobilizing Reserve and National Guard units to support the Homeland Defense effort.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany Fort Hood units have deployed to [[Afghanistan]] for [[Operation Enduring Freedom]], and to [[Iraq]] for [[Iraq War|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. In December 2003, the 4th Infantry Division captured [[Saddam Hussein]]. In the spring of 2004, the 1st Cavalry Division followed the 4th Infantry Division deploying to Iraq. [[Task Force ODIN]] was created at Ft. Hood.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn September 2005, 13th COSCOM and key enablers were called to support Joint Task Force [[Hurricane Katrina|Katrina]]/[[Hurricane Rita|Rita]] hurricane relief and went on to serve as the senior joint logistical support command for JTF Katrina. 13th COSCOM eventually provided one hundred million rations, collected human remains with dignity, executed emergency engineering operations, transported, distributed and stored over one billion dollars in humanitarian relief from both non-governmental and federal sources from across the nation.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nIn 2009, Fort Carson, [[Colorado|Colorado's]] First Army Division West re-stationed to Fort Hood in order to consolidate its mission to conduct [[Reserve components of the United States Armed Forces|reserve component]] mobilization training and validation for deployment, switching places with 4th Infantry Division, which relocated to Fort Carson.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations |title=Force Structure Actions at Fort Hood, |publisher=U.S. Army Public Affairs. |accessdate=5 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619212120/http://www.army.mil/-newsreleases/2009/04/03/19239-force-structure-actions-at-fort-hood-and-other-installations/ |archivedate=19 June 2009 |df=dmy }}.  8 June 2009.</ref>\n\n===2007 navigation exercise incident===\nOn 12 June 2007, the body of Lawrence George Sprader, Jr was found at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. in a brushy area located within the Central Texas Army post's training ground.

The 4th Infantry Division Museum closed at Fort Hood for the last time on 29 May 2009 to complete its move to Colorado although most of the outdoor pieces remained at Fort Hood as part of the new 3CR Museum.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dvidshub.net/?script=news/news_show.php&id=33688|title=Ivy Division museum preparing for move to Fort Carson|publisher=dvidshub}}</ref>\n\nBefore the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|breakup of the Soviet Union]], Fort Hood was billed as the largest military base in the free world (Fort Benning is larger in personnel, Fort Bliss in land area). During peacetime, Fort Hood is a gated post, with the 1st Cavalry Division Museum, the Belton Lake Outdoor Recreation Area (BLORA), and a number of other facilities that are open to the public. Access to the cantonments became restricted starting In July 2001. However, passes are available to visit the two museums on post, and the lake area remains open to the public without restriction since it is outside the cantonments. Various events, including the annual Independence Day celebration, which has one of the largest fireworks displays in the country, are open to the public.\n\nShortly after the 2000 census, responsibility for post housing was turned over to privatized partnership with [http://www.actuslendlease.com Actus Lend Lease]. Under the terms of the contract, most of the housing has been remodeled or rebuilt, and hundreds of new units have been built or are in the process of being built, operating as [http://www.forthoodfh.com Fort Hood Family Housing]. The nine schools on Fort Hood are part of the [[Killeen Independent School District]].\n\nFort Hood consists of three sections: the main cantonment, [[West Fort Hood]], and [[North Fort Hood]]. The main cantonment is bounded by Killeen on the east and [[Copperas Cove, Texas|Copperas Cove]] on the west. The Fort Hood main cantonment area, otherwise referred to as Main post, holds its own airfield, [[Hood Army Airfield]]. North Fort Hood is bounded by Gatesville to the northwest. West Fort Hood, bounded by Killeen and Copperas Cove, includes Fort Hood's second airfield, [[Robert Gray Army Airfield]], which has been expanded for civilian use ([[Killeen\u2013Fort Hood Regional Airport]] (GRK)) and additional training areas. To the east and southeast, the reservation is bounded by [[Harker Heights, Texas|Harker Heights]], [[Nolanville, Texas|Nolanville]], [[Belton, Texas|Belton]], and [[Morgan's Point Resort, Texas|Morgan's Point Resort]].\n\n==Notable residents==\n* [[Mark Adickes]] \u2013 football player, surgeon, commentator\n* [[Donald Buckram]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Robert Griffin III]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Ciara]] - R&B Singer <ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rSYEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA104&lpg=PA104&dq=ciara+dad+was+stationed&source=bl&ots=UgHgcaAMBU&sig=ACfU3U23AQOmMDcfvvIZoEA6GHr9eDr8Wg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj08OfU5NbmAhWEKs0KHQJfAO8Q6AEwCXoECAwQAQ#v=onepage&q=ciara%20dad%20was%20stationed&f=false|title=Vibe|last=Group|first=Vibe Media|date=February 2007|publisher=Vibe Media Group|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VDW5-N9Z|title=Ciara Harris- Texas Birth Index|last=|first=|date=25 Oct 1985|website=[[FamilySearch]]|access-date=27 Dec 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ajc.com/entertainment/celebrity-news/ciara-opens-about-havard-her-new-album-and-what-next/pcOjWDNWpL2Dys0p5dgYfI/|title=ONLY ON AJC: Ciara talks Harvard, her new album, and what\u2019s next|last=Isoul Hussein Harris|first=For the AJC|website=ajc|language=English|access-date=2019-12-27}}</ref>\n* [[Bobby Luna]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Josh Lovelady]] \u2013 football player\n* [[Tamera Mowry]] \u2013 actress\n* [[Tia Mowry]] \u2013 actress\n* [[Donald Prell]] \u2013 futurologist and author\n* [[Elvis Presley]] \u2013 singer, actor\n* [[Geoff Ramsey]] \u2013 film producer, actor\n* [[Lucas Till]] \u2013 actor\n* [[Anna Todd]] \u2013 author\n* [[Yoon Mi-rae]] \u2013 American-born South Korean\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Texas}}\n*[[List of World War II prisoner-of-war camps in the United States]]<ref name=\"Krammer\">{{cite book|last1=Krammer|first1=Arnold|title=Nazi Prisoners of War in America|date=1979|publisher=Stein and Day|location=New York|isbn=0812825713|page=[https://archive.org/details/naziprisonersofw00kram/page/268 268]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/naziprisonersofw00kram/page/268}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n* Cragg, Dan, Sgt.

In less than 40 years they had reached and subdued what we now know as northern England and Wales. Before them lay the wilds of  [[Caledonia]] and by 79AD they were pushing northwards into southern Scotland<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trimontium.co.uk/portfolio-items/the-fort/|title=The Fort|last=Chief|website=Trimontium Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\nHere, on the banks of the [[River Tweed]] under the prominent gaze of the [[Eildon Hill|Eildon Hills]], they began to construct a fort to be used several times over the next hundred years or more. The site was abandoned and reoccupied according to the ebb and flow of fortune, both military and political. It's last occupation may have been by the Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] as he marched north in 208-209AD in a final effort to subdue the local population<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trimontium.co.uk/portfolio-items/the-fort/|title=The Fort|last=Chief|website=Trimontium Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>.\n\nThe Romans did not arrive into an empty landscape. Native [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]] tribes occupied Scotland<ref name=\":0\" /> and the Romans had to deal with them, either through warfare, peaceful trading or by forming alliances. It is almost certain that many and varied arrangements existed over time, the details of which we can only guess at. The local tribes were small scale farmers living in family units in farmsteads scattered throughout the landscape. They may have come together for protection or social & religious gatherings and trading within the mighty hill forts dotted across the Scottish countryside. Sitting above the Trimontium site is Eildon North, one such impressive and magnificent Iron Age hill fort.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.trimontium.co.uk/portfolio-items/the-fort/|title=The Fort|last=Chief|website=Trimontium Museum|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n\nThe fort was laid out as a standard [[Castra|Roman fort]].

Also referred to as the '''5K road race''', '''5&nbsp;km''', or simply '''5K''', it is the shortest of the most common road running distances. It is usually distinguished from the [[5000 metres]]  [[track running]] event by stating the distance in kilometres, rather than metres.laura galvin from Westport once ran 6km in under 15 minutes \n\nAmong road running events, the 5K distance is mostly popular with novice [[jogging|joggers]], as it is comparatively easier to complete the distance without [[endurance training]]. This also makes the distance suitable for people looking to improve or maintain their general [[physical fitness]], rather than develop long-distance running abilities. The brevity of the distance means that less time is required to take part in the activity and that people from a wide range of ages and abilities may participate. From a [[Exercise physiology|physiological]] perspective, five kilometres is towards the low end of endurance running.<ref>Wolfe-Bieler, Kristen (2007-06-08).

Also referred to as the '''5K road race''', '''5&nbsp;km''', or simply '''5K''', it is the shortest of the most common road running distances. It is usually distinguished from the [[5000 metres]]  [[track running]] event by stating the distance in kilometres, rather than metres.\n\nAmong road running events, the 5K distance is mostly popular with novice [[jogging|joggers]], as it is comparatively easier to complete the distance without [[endurance training]]. This also makes the distance suitable for people looking to improve or maintain their general [[physical fitness]], rather than develop long-distance running abilities. The brevity of the distance means that less time is required to take part in the activity and that people from a wide range of ages and abilities may participate. From a [[Exercise physiology|physiological]] perspective, five kilometres is towards the low end of endurance running.<ref>Wolfe-Bieler, Kristen (2007-06-08).

First, one or two letters indicate the postcode area, followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area. This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district, and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street. Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city (such as B for Birmingham) but may also be geographic in nature (such as HS for Outer Hebrides). \n\nEach postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one (or more) postcode districts. (Example: a sizeable part of Southern England is covered by the GU postcode area, named for the town of Guildford. Guildford comprises postal districts GU1 and GU2. Nearby Woking, a major commuter town 6 miles distant, is a post town within postal district GU22.) The central part of the town or city the postcode area is named after will have the number one e.g. B1 (Birmingham), LS1 (Leeds), M1 (Manchester), however other post towns within the area are then either treated alphabetically - particularly in London (e.g. Chingford on the north-eastern edge of London being E4, whereas adjacent Walthamstow to the south being E17) or geographically (e.g. the Outer Hebrides area HS numbering the districts north to south). \n\nAs a general rule, large post towns are numbered from the centre out such that outlying parts have higher numbered districts, but the disparate post towns within a postal area can be numbered based on various criteria (the town the postal area is named after excepted, this always being 1). In particular, one cannot reliably infer the centrality of a postcode district within a postcode area from the postcode alone, as for instance SE1 covers a large part of Central London south of the Thames whereas SE2 covers Abbey Wood at the far end of the Elizabeth Line. See [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]].\n\nPostcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in [[route planning software]] and as the lowest level of aggregation in [[census]] enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29&nbsp;million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the [[Postcode Address File]] database.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThe initial system of named postal districts, developed in London and other large cities from 1857, evolved towards the present form: in 1917 London was split into broad numbered subdivisions, and this extended to the other cities in 1934. Since the local government reorganisation of London in the 1960s, parts of [[Greater London]] lie outside the London postal area. These include large parts of the \"TW\", \"KT\", \"SM\", \"CR\", \"HA\", and \"UB\" postcode areas, among a few others.\n\nAs examples of the postcode system, the postcode of the [[University of Roehampton]] in London is SW15 5PU, where SW stands for south-west London; the postcode of [[GCHQ]] is GL51 0EX, where GL signifies the postal area of [[Gloucester]]. The postal town can be a wide area and does not relate to a specific town, county or region. GL51 is one of the postcodes for the town of Cheltenham (in Gloucestershire).\n\nTheoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number (or name if the house has no number) and postcode alone; however, this is against Royal Mail guidelines, which request the use of a full address.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/81/~/how-to-address-your-mail-(clear-addressing)|title=How to address mail clearly, guide to clear letter addressing|website=personal.help.royalmail.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Earlier postal districts===\n====London====\n{{main|London postal district}}\nThe London post town covers 40% of [[Greater London]]. On inception (in 1857/8), it was divided into ten postal districts: EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The S and NE sectors were later abolished. In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, each postal district was subdivided into sub-districts each identified by a number; the area served directly by the district head office was allocated the number 1; the other numbers were allocated alphabetically by delivery office, e.g. N2 East Finchley delivery office, N3 Finchley delivery office, N4 Finsbury Park delivery office etc. Since then these sub-districts have changed little.\n\nSome older road signs in Hackney still show the North East (NE) sector/district.\n\n====Other large towns====\n[[Image:BirdbrookRoadSigns.jpg|thumb|right|Street name signs on Birdbrook Road, Great Barr, Birmingham, showing old \"Birmingham 22\" (top) and modern \"B44\" postcodes.]]\nFollowing the successful introduction of postal districts in London, the system was extended to other large towns and cities. Liverpool was divided into Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western districts in 1864/65, and Manchester and Salford into eight numbered districts in 1867/68.<ref name=bpma/>\n\nIn 1917, Dublin\u2014then still part of the United Kingdom\u2014was divided into [[Dublin postal districts|numbered postal districts]]. These continue in use in a modified form by [[An Post]], the postal service of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1923, Glasgow was divided in a similar way to London, with numbered districts preceded by a letter denoting the compass point (C, W, NW, N, E, S, SW, SE).<ref name=bpma/>\n\nIn January 1932 the Postmaster General approved the designation of some predominantly urban areas into numbered districts.<ref name=bpma/> In November 1934 the Post Office announced the introduction of numbered districts (short postal codes) in \"every provincial town in the United Kingdom large enough to justify it\". Pamphlets were issued to each householder and business in ten areas notifying them of the number of the district in which their premises lay. The pamphlets included a map of the districts, and copies were made available at local head post offices. The public were \"particularly invited\" to include the district number in the address at the head of letters.<ref name=times1934>{{Cite news|title=Numbered P.O. Districts In Country Towns. Aid To Accurate Delivery |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=20 November 1934 }}</ref> \n\nA publicity campaign in the following year encouraged the use of the district numbers. The slogan for the campaign was \"For speed and certainty always use a postal district number on your letters and notepaper\". A poster was fixed to every pillar box in the affected areas bearing the number of the district and appealing for the public's co-operation. Every post office in the numbered district was also to display this information. Printers of Christmas cards and stationery were requested to always include district numbers in addresses, and [[election agent]]s for candidates in the upcoming [[1935 United Kingdom general election|general election]] were asked to ensure they correctly addressed the 100&nbsp;million items of mail they were expected to post. Businesses were issued with a free booklet containing maps and listings of the correct district number for every street in the ten areas.<ref name=times1935>{{Cite news|title=Postal District Numbers Appeal For Use In Addresses|work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=29 October 1935}}</ref>\n\nThe ten areas were:<ref name=times1935/>\n*[[Birmingham]]\n*[[Brighton]]/[[Hove]]\n*[[Bristol]]\n*[[Edinburgh]]\n*[[Glasgow]]\n*[[Leeds]]/[[Bradford]]\n*[[Liverpool]]\n*[[Manchester]]/[[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]\n*[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n*[[Sheffield]]\n\nFor example, [[Toxteth]] was ''Liverpool 8''. A single numbering sequence was shared by Manchester and Salford: letters would be addressed to Manchester 1 or Salford 7 (lowest digits, respectively). Some Birmingham codes were sub-divided with a letter, such as ''Great Barr, Birmingham 22'' or ''Birmingham 22a'',<ref name=Will>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208065042/http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 February 2007 |title=1951 will, using address in \"Birmingham 22a\" |publisher=Jacomb.com |accessdate=1 September 2010 }}</ref> as can still be seen on many older street-name signs.\n\n===Modern postcode system===\nThe Post Office experimented with electromechanical sorting machines in the late 1950s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8288148.stm \"Modern postcodes are 50 years old\"], [[BBC News]], 2 October 2009</ref> These devices presented an envelope to an operator, who would press a button indicating which bin to sort the letter into.

The uniform system of a set of three final characters after the space (such as 0AA, known as the inward code) was adopted. This was to be the beginning of a ten-year plan, costing an estimated \u00a324&nbsp;million. Within two years it was expected that full coding would be used in [[Aberdeen]], [[Belfast]], [[Brighton]], [[Bristol]], [[Bromley]], [[Cardiff]], [[Coventry]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sheffield]], [[Southampton]] and the [[W postcode area|Western district]] of London.<ref name=times_121066>\"Someone, Somewhere in postal code\", ''The Times'', 12 October 1966</ref> By 1967, codes had been introduced to Aberdeen, Southampton, Brighton and [[Derby]].<ref name=times_040767>\"Post Office plans faster service\", ''The Times'', 4 July 1967</ref> In 1970, codes were introduced to the London Western and [[NW postcode area|North Western]] postal districts.<ref name=times_150870>\"London in brief\", ''The Times'', 15 September 1970</ref> In December 1970, much Christmas mail was postmarked with the message \"Remember to use the Postal Code\" although codes were used to sort mail in only a handful of [[sorting office]]s.<ref name=times_180171>\"Inside the Post Office\", ''The Times'', 18 January 1971</ref>\n\nDuring 1971, occupants of addresses began to receive notification of their postcode.

The districts in both Manchester and Salford gained M postcodes, so Salford 7 became M7 and so on (and similarly in Brighton and Hove, both using the prefix BN). The old coding lives on in a small number of street signs with (for example) \"Salford 7\" at the bottom. In other cases, the district numbers were replaced with unrelated numbers. In Glasgow many of its G-prefixed numbers are not used as C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. In London (as postally defined), 1917-created postal districts are mapped unchanged to those of today but its much enlarged administrative area, Greater London, was created in April 1965. From that month the remaining 60% of Greater London's area has postcodes referring to 13 other post towns. Additionally, there were too few postcodes to adequately cover districts in central London (particularly in the WC and EC areas), so these were subdivided with a letter suffix rather than being split into new numbered districts so as to retain the familiar codes.\n\n====GB postcodes available as OpenData====\nPrior to 1 April 2010, the Royal Mail licensed use of the postcode database for a charge of about \u00a34000 per year.<ref name=\"planning\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon|title=newspaper article on postcodes|author=Charles Arthur|date=10 October 2009|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> Following a campaign and a government consultation in 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |title=DCLG: Policy options for geographic information from Ordnance Survey: Consultation |language=zh |publisher=Communities.gov.uk |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230115507/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |archivedate=30 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the Ordnance Survey released Code-Point Open, detailing each current postcode in Great Britain together with a geo-code for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence ([[Open Government Licence]] as part of [[Ordnance Survey#OS OpenData|OS OpenData]]).\n\n====Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies==== \nThe [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS Geography) maintains and publishes a series of freely available, downloadable postcode products that link all current and terminated UK postcodes to a range of administrative, health, statistical and other geographies using the Code-Point Open grid reference.\n\n==Formatting==\n===Overview===\nThe postcodes are alphanumeric, and are variable in length: ranging from six to eight characters (including a space). Each postcode is divided into two parts separated by a single space: the ''outward code'' and the ''inward code'' respectively. The ''outward code'' includes the ''postcode area'' and the ''postcode district'', respectively. The ''inward code'' includes the ''postcode sector'' and the ''postcode unit'' respectively. Examples of postcodes are \"SW1W 0NY\", \"PO16 7GZ\", \"GU16 7HF\", and \"L1 8JQ\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n!style=\"background:#87cefa; color: black;\" colspan=4| POSTCODE\n|- style=\"background:#ff4500; color: white;\"\n|colspan=2| Outward code\n|colspan=2| Inward code\n|- style=\"background:#ff4500; color: white;\"\n| Area || District || Sector || Unit\n|- style=\"background:#0000cd; color: white;\"\n| SN || 3 || 2 || BD\n|}\n\n===Outward code===\nThe outward code is the part of the postcode before the single space in the middle. It is between two and four characters long. Examples of outward codes are \"L1\", \"W1A\", \"RH1\", \"RH10\" or \"SE1P\". A few outward codes are non-geographic, not divulging where mail is to be sent.\n\n====Postcode area====\nThe [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]] is part of the outward code. The postcode area is either one or two characters long and is alphabetical. Examples of postcode areas are \"L\" for [[Liverpool]], \"RH\" for [[RH postcode area|Redhill]] and \"EH\" for [[Edinburgh]]. A postal area may cover a wide area, for example \"RH\" also covers parts of north Sussex and \"BT\" ([[Belfast]]) covers the whole of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n====Postcode district====\nThe [[List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|postcode district]] is one digit, two digits or a digit followed by a letter.\n\n===Inward code===\nThe inward code is the part of the postcode after the single space in the middle. It is three characters long. The inward code assists in the delivery of post within a postal district. Examples of inward codes are \"0NY\", \"7GZ\", \"7HF\", or \"8JQ\".<ref name=\"Postcodes & Addresses Explained\" />\n\n====Postcode sector====\nThe postcode sector is made up of a single digit (the first character of the inward code).\n\n====Postcode unit====\nThe postcode unit is two characters added to the end of the postcode sector. A postcode unit generally represents a street, part of a street, a single address, a group of properties, a single property, a sub-section of the property, an individual organisation or (for instance [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]) a subsection of the organisation. The level of discrimination is often based on the amount of mail received by the premises or business. Examples of postcode units are \"SW1W 0NY\", \"PO16 7GZ\", \"GU16 7HF\", and \"L1 8JQ\".\n\n===Validation===\nThe format is as follows, where '''A''' signifies a letter and '''9''' a digit:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As mentioned above, the first part starts with the [[postcode area]] and ends with the [[postcode district]]. The second part begins with a single digit, which indicates the '''postcode sector''', and ends with the postcode unit.\n\nPostcode areas are also divided into several [[post town]]s, which predate the introduction of postcodes, with the [[London postal district|London]] post town uniquely covering more than one postcode area.\n\nAs of June 2016, there are 124 postcode areas, 2,987 postcode districts, 11,192 postcode sectors, and 1,500 post towns.<ref name=\"pafstats1208\" /> Addresses receiving large volumes of mail are each assigned separate \"large user\" postcodes.

The PAF is commercially licenceable and is often incorporated in address management software packages. The capabilities of such packages allow most addresses to be constructed solely from the postcode and house number. By including the [[Ordnance Survey|map reference]]s of postcodes in the address database, the postcode can be used to pinpoint a postcode area on a map. PAF is updated daily.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn its [http://www.poweredbypaf.com poweredbypaf.com] website, Royal Mail publishes summary information about major changes to postcode sectors and postal localities (including post towns). Individual postcodes or postal addresses can be found using Royal Mail's [http://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode Postcode and Address Finder] website, but this is limited to 50 free searches per user per day.\n\n===Code-Point Open===\nA complete list of all current Great Britain postcodes, known as Code-Point Open, has been made available online (since 1 April 2010) by Ordnance Survey. Under the government's [[OS OpenData]] initiative, it is available for re-use without charge under an attribution-only licence. The Code-Point Open list includes median coordinates for each postcode but excludes postcodes in Northern Ireland and the [[Crown dependencies]]. Unlike the PAF products provided by Royal Mail, the Code-Point Open list does not include postal address text.\n\n===ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup===\nThe [[Office For National Statistics]] also produces postcode directories, under similar licence terms to the OS product. Both the ONSPD and NSPL contain Northern Ireland postcodes, with centroid coordinates in the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|OSI]] grid as opposed to the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB grid]], although Northern Ireland postcodes are subject to a more restrictive licence permitting internal business use only.<ref name=\"ons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences|title=Licences|website=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Postcodes for the Crown Dependences are also included, without co-ordinates. A further difference is that non-current postcodes and dates of introduction and withdrawal of postcodes are included.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{See also|Postcode lottery}}\nWhile postcodes were introduced to expedite the delivery of mail, they are useful tools for other purposes, particularly because codes are very fine-grained and identify just a few addresses. Among these uses are:\n* With [[satellite navigation]] systems, to navigate to an address by street number and postcode\n* By life insurance companies and pension funds to assess longevity for pricing and reserving<ref name=\"insurance\">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/103077/sm20080225.pdf Richards, S.

A computer program uses the postcodes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance as the crow flies (or, if used in conjunction with street-map software, by road distance).

First, one or two letters indicate the postcode area, followed by one or two digits signifying a district within that area. This is followed by a space and then a number denoting a sector within said district, and finally by two letters which are allocated to streets or sides of a street. Postcode areas are often named for a major town or city (such as B for Birmingham) but may also be geographic in nature (such as HS for Outer Hebrides). \n\nEach postcode area contains a number of post towns which are not themselves alphabetically denoted however each will generally constitute one (or more) postcode districts. (Example: a sizeable part of Southern England is covered by the GU postcode area, named for the town of Guildford. Guildford comprises postal districts GU1 and GU2. Nearby Woking, a major commuter town 6 miles distant, is a post town within postal district GU22.) The central part of the town or city the postcode area is named after will have the number one e.g. B1 (Birmingham), LS1 (Leeds), M1 (Manchester), however other post towns within the area are then either treated alphabetically - particularly in London (e.g. Chingford on the north-eastern edge of London being E4, whereas adjacent Walthamstow to the south being E17) or geographically (e.g. the Outer Hebrides area HS numbering the districts north to south). \n\nAs a general rule, large post towns are numbered from the centre out such that outlying parts have higher numbered districts, but the disparate post towns within a postal area can be numbered based on various criteria (the town the postal area is named after excepted, this always being 1). In particular, one cannot reliably infer the centrality of a postcode district within a postcode area from the postcode alone, as for instance SE1 covers a large part of Central London south of the Thames whereas SE2 covers Abbey Wood at the far end of the Elizabeth Line. See [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]].\n\nPostcodes have been adopted for a wide range of purposes in addition to aiding the sorting of mail: for calculating insurance premiums, designating destinations in [[route planning software]] and as the lowest level of aggregation in [[census]] enumeration. The boundaries of each postcode unit and within these the full address data of currently about 29&nbsp;million addresses (delivery points) are stored, maintained and periodically updated in the [[Postcode Address File]] database.<ref name=guide/>\n\nThe initial system of named postal districts, developed in London and other large cities from 1857, evolved towards the present form: in 1917 London was split into broad numbered subdivisions, and this extended to the other cities in 1934. Since the local government reorganisation of London in the 1960s, parts of [[Greater London]] lie outside the London postal area. These include large parts of the \"TW\", \"KT\", \"SM\", \"CR\", \"HA\", and \"UB\" postcode areas, among a few others.\n\nAs examples of the postcode system, the postcode of the [[University of Roehampton]] in London is SW15 5PU, where SW stands for south-west London; the postcode of [[GCHQ]] is GL51 0EX, where GL signifies the postal area of [[Gloucester]]. The postal town can be a wide area and does not relate to a specific town, county or region. GL51 is one of the postcodes for the town of Cheltenham (in Gloucestershire).\n\nTheoretically, deliveries can reach their destination using the house number (or name if the house has no number) and postcode alone; however, this is against Royal Mail guidelines, which request the use of a full address.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/81/~/how-to-address-your-mail-(clear-addressing)|title=How to address mail clearly, guide to clear letter addressing|website=personal.help.royalmail.com}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n===Earlier postal districts===\n====London====\n{{main|London postal district}}\nThe London post town covers 40% of [[Greater London]]. On inception (in 1857/8), it was divided into ten postal districts: EC (East Central), WC (West Central), N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, and NW. The S and NE sectors were later abolished. In 1917, as a wartime measure to improve efficiency, each postal district was subdivided into sub-districts each identified by a number; the area served directly by the district head office was allocated the number 1; the other numbers were allocated alphabetically by delivery office, e.g. N2 East Finchley delivery office, N3 Finchley delivery office, N4 Finsbury Park delivery office etc. Since then these sub-districts have changed little.\n\nSome older road signs in Hackney still show the North East (NE) sector/district.\n\n====Other large towns====\n[[Image:BirdbrookRoadSigns.jpg|thumb|right|Street name signs on Birdbrook Road, Great Barr, Birmingham, showing old \"Birmingham 22\" (top) and modern \"B44\" postcodes.]]\nFollowing the successful introduction of postal districts in London, the system was extended to other large towns and cities. Liverpool was divided into Eastern, Northern, Southern and Western districts in 1864/65, and Manchester and Salford into eight numbered districts in 1867/68.<ref name=bpma/>\n\nIn 1917, Dublin\u2014then still part of the United Kingdom\u2014was divided into [[Dublin postal districts|numbered postal districts]]. These continue in use in a modified form by [[An Post]], the postal service of the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In 1923, Glasgow was divided in a similar way to London, with numbered districts preceded by a letter denoting the compass point (C, W, NW, N, E, S, SW, SE).<ref name=bpma/>\n\nIn January 1932 the Postmaster General approved the designation of some predominantly urban areas into numbered districts.<ref name=bpma/> In November 1934 the Post Office announced the introduction of numbered districts (short postal codes) in \"every provincial town in the United Kingdom large enough to justify it\". Pamphlets were issued to each householder and business in ten areas notifying them of the number of the district in which their premises lay. The pamphlets included a map of the districts, and copies were made available at local head post offices. The public were \"particularly invited\" to include the district number in the address at the head of letters.<ref name=times1934>{{Cite news|title=Numbered P.O. Districts In Country Towns. Aid To Accurate Delivery |work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=20 November 1934 }}</ref> \n\nA publicity campaign in the following year encouraged the use of the district numbers. The slogan for the campaign was \"For speed and certainty always use a postal district number on your letters and notepaper\". A poster was fixed to every pillar box in the affected areas bearing the number of the district and appealing for the public's co-operation. Every post office in the numbered district was also to display this information. Printers of Christmas cards and stationery were requested to always include district numbers in addresses, and [[election agent]]s for candidates in the upcoming [[1935 United Kingdom general election|general election]] were asked to ensure they correctly addressed the 100&nbsp;million items of mail they were expected to post. Businesses were issued with a free booklet containing maps and listings of the correct district number for every street in the ten areas.<ref name=times1935>{{Cite news|title=Postal District Numbers Appeal For Use In Addresses|work=[[The Times]] |page=14 |date=29 October 1935}}</ref>\n\nThe ten areas were:<ref name=times1935/>\n*[[Birmingham]]\n*[[Brighton]]/[[Hove]]\n*[[Bristol]]\n*[[Edinburgh]]\n*[[Glasgow]]\n*[[Leeds]]/[[Bradford]]\n*[[Liverpool]]\n*[[Manchester]]/[[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]]\n*[[Newcastle upon Tyne]]\n*[[Sheffield]]\n\nFor example, [[Toxteth]] was ''Liverpool 8''. A single numbering sequence was shared by Manchester and Salford: letters would be addressed to Manchester 1 or Salford 7 (lowest digits, respectively). Some Birmingham codes were sub-divided with a letter, such as ''Great Barr, Birmingham 22'' or ''Birmingham 22a'',<ref name=Will>{{Cite web |url=http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208065042/http://www.jacomb.com/w1951_1960.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 February 2007 |title=1951 will, using address in \"Birmingham 22a\" |publisher=Jacomb.com |accessdate=1 September 2010 }}</ref> as can still be seen on many older street-name signs.\n\n===Modern postcode system===\nThe Post Office experimented with electromechanical sorting machines in the late 1950s.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8288148.stm \"Modern postcodes are 50 years old\"], [[BBC News]], 2 October 2009</ref> These devices presented an envelope to an operator, who would press a button indicating which bin to sort the letter into. Postcodes were suggested to increase the efficiency of this process by removing the need for the sorter to remember the correct sorting for as many places.<ref name=new_scientist>''New Scientist'', 21 July 2007, p16</ref> In January 1959 the Post Office analysed the results of a survey on public attitudes towards the use of postal codes, choosing a town in which to experiment with codes. The envisaged format was a six-character alphanumeric code with three letters designating the geographical area and three numbers to identify the individual address.<ref name=times_150189>\"Postal codes to speed up mail\", ''The Times'', 15 January 1959</ref> On 28 July [[Ernest Marples]], the [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]], announced that [[Norwich]] had been selected, and that each of the 150,000 private and business addresses would receive a code by October.

The many postcodes for central Croydon began with \"CRO\", while those of the surrounding [[post town]]s with CR2, CR3 and CR4. The uniform system of a set of three final characters after the space (such as 0AA, known as the inward code) was adopted. This was to be the beginning of a ten-year plan, costing an estimated \u00a324&nbsp;million. Within two years it was expected that full coding would be used in [[Aberdeen]], [[Belfast]], [[Brighton]], [[Bristol]], [[Bromley]], [[Cardiff]], [[Coventry]], [[Manchester]], [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Sheffield]], [[Southampton]] and the [[W postcode area|Western district]] of London.<ref name=times_121066>\"Someone, Somewhere in postal code\", ''The Times'', 12 October 1966</ref> By 1967, codes had been introduced to Aberdeen, Southampton, Brighton and [[Derby]].<ref name=times_040767>\"Post Office plans faster service\", ''The Times'', 4 July 1967</ref> In 1970, codes were introduced to the London Western and [[NW postcode area|North Western]] postal districts.<ref name=times_150870>\"London in brief\", ''The Times'', 15 September 1970</ref> In December 1970, much Christmas mail was postmarked with the message \"Remember to use the Postal Code\" although codes were used to sort mail in only a handful of [[sorting office]]s.<ref name=times_180171>\"Inside the Post Office\", ''The Times'', 18 January 1971</ref>\n\nDuring 1971, occupants of addresses began to receive notification of their postcode. Asked in the House of Commons about the completion of the coding exercise, the [[Minister of State]] for Posts and Telecommunications (whose role superseded that of Postmaster General in 1969), [[John Eden, Baron Eden of Winton|Sir John Eden]], stated that it was expected to be completed during 1972.<ref name=times_200472>\"Postal code programme\", ''The Times'', 20 April 1972</ref> The scheme was finalised in 1974 when Norwich was completely re-coded but the scheme tested in Croydon was sufficiently close to the final design for it to be retained, with CRO standardised as CR0 (district zero) thus removing the need to create a CR1 district.<ref name=bpma>[http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf Information Sheet: Postcodes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320052708/http://www.postalheritage.org.uk/history/downloads/BPMA_Info_Sheet_Postcodes_web.pdf |date=20 March 2009 }}, British Postal Museum and Archive</ref>\n\nA quirk remained: the central Newport (Gwent) area was allocated NPT at a similar time to Croydon becoming CRO, and surrounding areas were (as today) allocated NP1\u2013NP8.

The districts in both Manchester and Salford gained M postcodes, so Salford 7 became M7 and so on (and similarly in Brighton and Hove, both using the prefix BN). The old coding lives on in a small number of street signs with (for example) \"Salford 7\" at the bottom. In other cases, the district numbers were replaced with unrelated numbers. In Glasgow many of its G-prefixed numbers are not used as C1 became G1, W1 became G11, N1 became G21, E1 became G31, S1 became G41, SW1 became G51, and so on. In London (as postally defined), 1917-created postal districts are mapped unchanged to those of today but its much enlarged administrative area, Greater London, was created in April 1965. From that month the remaining 60% of Greater London's area has postcodes referring to 13 other post towns. Additionally, there were too few postcodes to adequately cover districts in central London (particularly in the WC and EC areas), so these were subdivided with a letter suffix rather than being split into new numbered districts so as to retain the familiar codes.\n\n====GB postcodes available as OpenData====\nPrior to 1 April 2010, the Royal Mail licensed use of the postcode database for a charge of about \u00a34000 per year.<ref name=\"planning\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2009/oct/07/newly-asked-question-royal-mail-postzon|title=newspaper article on postcodes|author=Charles Arthur|date=10 October 2009|newspaper=Guardian|accessdate=1 September 2010}}</ref> Following a campaign and a government consultation in 2009,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |title=DCLG: Policy options for geographic information from Ordnance Survey: Consultation |language=zh |publisher=Communities.gov.uk |date=23 December 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091230115507/http://www.communities.gov.uk/publications/corporate/ordnancesurveyconsultation |archivedate=30 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> the Ordnance Survey released Code-Point Open, detailing each current postcode in Great Britain together with a geo-code for re-use free of charge under an attribution-only licence ([[Open Government Licence]] as part of [[Ordnance Survey#OS OpenData|OS OpenData]]).\n\n====Postcodes linked to a variety of UK geographies==== \nThe [[Office for National Statistics]] (ONS Geography) maintains and publishes a series of freely available, downloadable postcode products that link all current and terminated UK postcodes to a range of administrative, health, statistical and other geographies using the Code-Point Open grid reference.\n\n==Formatting==\n===Overview===\nThe postcodes are alphanumeric, and are variable in length: ranging from six to eight characters (including a space). Each postcode is divided into two parts separated by a single space: the ''outward code'' and the ''inward code'' respectively. The ''outward code'' includes the ''postcode area'' and the ''postcode district'', respectively. The ''inward code'' includes the ''postcode sector'' and the ''postcode unit'' respectively. Examples of postcodes are \"SW1W 0NY\", \"PO16 7GZ\", \"GU16 7HF\", and \"L1 8JQ\".\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center; margin: 0 auto;\"\n!style=\"background:#87cefa; color: black;\" colspan=4| POSTCODE\n|- style=\"background:#ff4500; color: white;\"\n|colspan=2| Outward code\n|colspan=2| Inward code\n|- style=\"background:#ff4500; color: white;\"\n| Area || District || Sector || Unit\n|- style=\"background:#0000cd; color: white;\"\n| SW || 1W || 0 || NY\n|}\n\n===Outward code===\nThe outward code is the part of the postcode before the single space in the middle. It is between two and four characters long. Examples of outward codes are \"L1\", \"W1A\", \"RH1\", \"RH10\" or \"SE1P\". A few outward codes are non-geographic, not divulging where mail is to be sent.\n\n====Postcode area====\nThe [[List of postcode areas in the United Kingdom|postcode area]] is part of the outward code. The postcode area is either one or two characters long and is alphabetical. Examples of postcode areas are \"L\" for [[Liverpool]], \"RH\" for [[RH postcode area|Redhill]] and \"EH\" for [[Edinburgh]]. A postal area may cover a wide area, for example \"RH\" also covers parts of north Sussex and \"BT\" ([[Belfast]]) covers the whole of [[Northern Ireland]].\n\n====Postcode district====\nThe [[List of postcode districts in the United Kingdom|postcode district]] is one digit, two digits or a digit followed by a letter.\n\n===Inward code===\nThe inward code is the part of the postcode after the single space in the middle. It is three characters long. The inward code assists in the delivery of post within a postal district. Examples of inward codes are \"0NY\", \"7GZ\", \"7HF\", or \"8JQ\".<ref name=\"Postcodes & Addresses Explained\" />\n\n====Postcode sector====\nThe postcode sector is made up of a single digit (the first character of the inward code).\n\n====Postcode unit====\nThe postcode unit is two characters added to the end of the postcode sector. A postcode unit generally represents a street, part of a street, a single address, a group of properties, a single property, a sub-section of the property, an individual organisation or (for instance [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]]) a subsection of the organisation. The level of discrimination is often based on the amount of mail received by the premises or business. Examples of postcode units are \"SW1W 0NY\", \"PO16 7GZ\", \"GU16 7HF\", and \"L1 8JQ\".\n\n===Validation===\nThe format is as follows, where '''A''' signifies a letter and '''9''' a digit:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

As mentioned above, the first part starts with the [[postcode area]] and ends with the [[postcode district]]. The second part begins with a single digit, which indicates the '''postcode sector''', and ends with the postcode unit.\n\nPostcode areas are also divided into several [[post town]]s, which predate the introduction of postcodes, with the [[London postal district|London]] post town uniquely covering more than one postcode area.\n\nAs of June 2016, there are 124 postcode areas, 2,987 postcode districts, 11,192 postcode sectors, and 1,500 post towns.<ref name=\"pafstats1208\" /> Addresses receiving large volumes of mail are each assigned separate \"large user\" postcodes.

The PAF is commercially licenceable and is often incorporated in address management software packages. The capabilities of such packages allow most addresses to be constructed solely from the postcode and house number. By including the [[Ordnance Survey|map reference]]s of postcodes in the address database, the postcode can be used to pinpoint a postcode area on a map. PAF is updated daily.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOn its [http://www.poweredbypaf.com poweredbypaf.com] website, Royal Mail publishes summary information about major changes to postcode sectors and postal localities (including post towns). Individual postcodes or postal addresses can be found using Royal Mail's [http://www.royalmail.com/find-a-postcode Postcode and Address Finder] website, but this is limited to 50 free searches per user per day.\n\n===Code-Point Open===\nA complete list of all current Great Britain postcodes, known as Code-Point Open, has been made available online (since 1 April 2010) by Ordnance Survey. Under the government's [[OS OpenData]] initiative, it is available for re-use without charge under an attribution-only licence. The Code-Point Open list includes median coordinates for each postcode but excludes postcodes in Northern Ireland and the [[Crown dependencies]]. Unlike the PAF products provided by Royal Mail, the Code-Point Open list does not include postal address text.\n\n===ONS Postcode Directory and National Statistics Postcode Lookup===\nThe [[Office For National Statistics]] also produces postcode directories, under similar licence terms to the OS product. Both the ONSPD and NSPL contain Northern Ireland postcodes, with centroid coordinates in the [[Ordnance Survey Ireland|OSI]] grid as opposed to the [[Ordnance Survey National Grid|OSGB grid]], although Northern Ireland postcodes are subject to a more restrictive licence permitting internal business use only.<ref name=\"ons\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/methodology/geography/licences|title=Licences|website=Office for National Statistics|accessdate=31 July 2017}}</ref> Postcodes for the Crown Dependences are also included, without co-ordinates. A further difference is that non-current postcodes and dates of introduction and withdrawal of postcodes are included.\n\n==Other uses==\n{{See also|Postcode lottery}}\nWhile postcodes were introduced to expedite the delivery of mail, they are useful tools for other purposes, particularly because codes are very fine-grained and identify just a few addresses. Among these uses are:\n* With [[satellite navigation]] systems, to navigate to an address by street number and postcode\n* By life insurance companies and pension funds to assess longevity for pricing and reserving<ref name=\"insurance\">[http://www.actuaries.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/103077/sm20080225.pdf Richards, S.

A computer program uses the postcodes of the target address and the branches to list the closest branches in order of distance as the crow flies (or, if used in conjunction with street-map software, by road distance).
