She is most remembered for her appearances in several commercially-successful films, and playing mostly bold roles throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Regarded as one of the most glamorous actresses throughout Hindi cinema, she was also one of the highest paid actresses of her time.\n\nWith a film career spanning 15 years, Babi appeared in more than 50 Hindi films with a variety of genres. She made her debut in 1973 with the film ''Charitra'', and had her breakthrough with the films [[Majboor (1974 film)|''Majboor'']] (1974) and ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), where she then garnered the reputation of a successful actress. Babi was notorious for breaking various cultures and stereotypes among few actresses, and was also the first Indian to have appeared on the cover of ''Time'' magazine.\n\nBabi retired from the film industry in 1985. She had remained unmarried after a string of relationships with [[Kabir Bedi]], [[Danny Denzongpa]] and [[Mahesh Bhatt]]. She was diagnosed with diabetes later in her life, and died of multiple organ failure on 20 January 2005.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-01-22/india/27842530_1_parveen-babi-body-injury-marks \"Parveen Babi dies, alone in death as in life\"], ''[[The Times of India]], 22 January 2005.</ref><ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1005269,flstry-1.cms \"Parveen wanted to be left alone\"], ''[[The Times of India]], 30 January 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205154555/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1005269,flstry-1.cms |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nParveen Babi was born as Parveen Moammed Ali in 1949 [[Junagadh]], [[Gujarat]].

Her first major hit was ''[[Majboor (1974 film)|Majboor]]'' (1974), opposite [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Along with [[Zeenat Aman]], Parveen Babi redefined the image of the [[Indian people|Indian]] film heroine. She was the first [[Bollywood]] star to appear on the front page of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/parveen-babis-iconic-time-magazine-cover/287085-8-66.html |title=Parveen Babi's iconic Time magazine cover \u2013 Movies News \u2013 Bollywood \u2013 ibnlive |publisher=Ibnlive.in.com |date=31 August 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref> in July 1976, much to the amazement of her contemporaries.\n\nThroughout her career, she was thought of more as a glamorous heroine than a serious actress. She was also known as a fashion icon. Famous designer [[Manish Malhotra]] says: \"Parveen Babi brought minimalism into fashion. She was always impeccable, not overdoing it even once.\"<ref name=\"Telegraph India\">{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1101123/jsp/entertainment/story_13209188.jsp |title=Manish Malhotra picks his five favourite super stylish heroines of the seventies |publisher=Telegraph India|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=19 July 2012|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref>\n\nParveen was considered to be one of the most successful actresses of her era, along with [[Hema Malini]], [[Rekha]], [[Zeenat Aman]], [[Jaya Bhaduri]], [[Reena Roy]] and [[Raakhee]]. She starred opposite [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in eight films, all of which were either hits or super-hits. She also starred in other hit films such as ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' (1979), ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' (1979), and ''[[Namak Halaal]]'' (1982) opposite [[Shashi Kapoor]], ''[[Kala Sona]]'' (1975) opposite [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]], ''[[Chandi Sona]]'' (1977) opposite [[Sanjay Khan]] and ''[[Jaani Dost]]'' (1983) opposite [[Dharmendra]]. Towards the end of her career, she appeared in offbeat films such as Vinod Pande's ''[[Yeh Nazdeekiyan]]'' (1982), playing the \"other woman\" opposite [[Marc Zuber]], and ''Dil... Akhir Dil Hai'' (1982), opposite [[Naseeruddin Shah]].<ref>[http://www.brns.com/bollywood/pages1/bolly89.html \"Ashanti\"]. ''brns.com''.</ref>\n\nShe was often compared to her contemporary [[Zeenat Aman]] due to their common image of being sex-symbols. In fact, she acted alongside Aman in ''[[Mahaan]]'' (1983) and ''[[Ashanti (1982 film)|Ashanti]]'' (1982) (inspired by the American television show ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', with the third role played by [[Shabana Azmi]]). In films such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980) and ''[[Namak Halaal]]'' (1982), her screen presence may have been minimal as the films were largely worked around the hero, but Babi brought a certain attractive aloofness to the roles and songs she appeared in. In the big hit movie ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), she made an impact despite a brief supporting role.\n\nHer more memorable roles include \"Anita\" in ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), \"Jenny\" in ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977), and \"Sunita\" in ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980). She was also the original choice for the female protagonist in ''[[Silsila]]'' along with [[Smita Patil]], but was later dropped by [[Yash Chopra]], who stated that while Babi was fine, [[Smita Patil]] was hurt, mainly because the filmmaker had asked actor friend [[Shashi Kapoor]] to pass the bad news to [[Smita Patil|Smita]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Smita-Parveen-the-original-choice-for-Silsila-Yash-Chopra/Article1-937612.aspx |title=Smita-Parveen, the original choice for Silsila: Yash Chopra |work=Hindustan Times |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe later \"disappeared\" from the film scene in 1983, without informing anyone about her whereabouts, a perception that allowed for exaggerated rumours and pompous claims to be whispered in the industry that she might be \"under the control\" of figures in the \"underworld\". Many of her completed films were released in the following years, right up till her last film ''[[Akarshan]]'' releasing in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2005/jan/27pb1.htm |title=Amitabh on Parveen Babi |publisher=Rediff.com |date=27 January 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHer career peaked at the time when most heroines were engulfed in [[India]]n attributes and Babi was one among the few actresses whose attire was completely westernised and this provided her a certain latitude many other contemporary female artists were denied in India's heavily male-dominated and misogynistic cinematic fiefdom. Parveen Babi along with [[Zeenat Aman]] with their chiselled looks, well-sculpted bodies and anglicised accents, donned the mantle of the westernized [[Indian people|Indian]] heroine and imparted to the female prima donna of [[Bollywood]] their characteristic mannerisms forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idiva.com/news-entertainment/the-myth-madness-of-the-late-parveen-babi/12285 |title=The Myth & Madness of Parveen Babi |publisher=iDiva.com |accessdate=28 October 2012|date=26 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs Babi's personality symbolized western standards, it would be difficult for Bollywood producers to personify her role in Indian sentiments. Hence she was given roles which were glamorous and represented standards of a film star quality and established her status as one of the \"Top Heroines of Bollywood\" or the \"Commercially successful Heroine\" and this paved the way to differ herself from the other contemporary actress in Bombay's film industry. She had appeared in most of the commercially successful films of that era and her famous co-stars include [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] who were all leading stars of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"rediff2003\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/may/03dinesh.htm |title=Parveen Babi: A bohemian rhapsody |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> In her acting career, which spanned almost ten years, she has acted in more than fifty films, of which ten were considered to be best. These films were also blockbusters of those times. Parveen Babi replaced the image of saree-clad, conventional [[Indian people|Indian]] lead actresses with a glamorous woman look. She never shied away from portraying roles of women having a live-in relationship with men and consuming alcohol openly, both of which were taboo in those times. She undeniably lit up and overpowered the screen with her presence. The fact that Parveen was paired with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in eight films during the peak of the [[Amitabh Bachchan|Big B]] mania attests to her stature and star power. It seems to have been taken that only a superstar of Bachchan's stature could stand side by side with the presence of Parveen Babi. [[Amitabh Bachchan|Amitabh]] and Parveen complemented each other in the heady first years of the ''[[Amitabh Bachchan|Angry Young Man]]'' phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://song.ezinemark.com/parveen-babi-the-diva-of-hindi-film-industry-7d2e57e2443f.html |title=Parveen Babi \u2013 The Diva of Hindi Film Industry |publisher=Song.ezinemark.com |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe would often appear in popular film songs which have become the craze of the young generations and such song picturisations involved glamorous costumes and ravishing film sets and in time would become hugely popular, and this includes \"Jawaani Jaaneman\" and \"Raat Baaqi Baat Baaqi\" in ''[[Namak Halaal]]'', \"Pyaar Karne Waale\" in ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' and \"Maara Thumka\" in ''[[Kranti]]'', and this popularity made her among the highest paid actresses in Bollywood at those times.

G. Krishnamurti]] and her friend Valentine and spent some of the time in [[California]] and [[Houston]]. On 7 April 1984, she was suspected at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] after she failed to submit her identification papers and as she behaved to be difficult, the authorities handcuffed her and kept her in a general ward with thirty other mentally disturbed patients. The Indian Consul General, who had been informed of the unfortunate incident, had personally come to visit her at the hospital. During U.G.'s visit, Parveen smiled and chatted with the Consul as though nothing had happened.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.well.com/~jct/ugbio/ugbio10.htm |title=<!--mstheme--> 10.

She is most remembered for her appearances in several commercially-successful films, and playing mostly bold roles throughout the 1970s and early 1980s. Regarded as one of the most glamorous actresses throughout Hindi cinema, she was also one of the highest paid actresses of her time.\n\nWith a film career spanning 15 years, Babi appeared in more than 50 Hindi films with a variety of genres. She made her debut in 1973 with the film ''Charitra'', and had her breakthrough with the films [[Majboor (1974 film)|''Majboor'']] (1974) and ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), where she then garnered the reputation of a successful actress. Babi was notorious for breaking various cultures and stereotypes among few actresses, and was also the first Indian to have appeared on the cover of ''Time'' magazine.\n\nBabi retired from the film industry in 1985. She had remained unmarried after a string of relationships with [[Kabir Bedi]], [[Danny Denzongpa]] and [[Mahesh Bhatt]]. She was diagnosed with diabetes later in her life, and died of multiple organ failure on 20 January 2005.<ref>[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-01-22/india/27842530_1_parveen-babi-body-injury-marks \"Parveen Babi dies, alone in death as in life\"], ''[[The Times of India]], 22 January 2005.</ref><ref>[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1005269,flstry-1.cms \"Parveen wanted to be left alone\"], ''[[The Times of India]], 30 January 2005 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205154555/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1005269,flstry-1.cms |date=5 December 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Personal life and education ==\nParveen Babi was born as Parveen Moammed Ali in 1949 [[Junagadh]], [[Gujarat]].

Her first major hit was ''[[Majboor (1974 film)|Majboor]]'' (1974), opposite [[Amitabh Bachchan]]. Along with [[Zeenat Aman]], Parveen Babi redefined the image of the [[Indian people|Indian]] film heroine.

She starred opposite [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in eight films, all of which were either hits or super-hits. She also starred in other hit films such as ''[[Suhaag (1979 film)|Suhaag]]'' (1979), ''[[Kaala Patthar]]'' (1979), and ''[[Namak Halaal]]'' (1982) opposite [[Shashi Kapoor]], ''[[Kala Sona]]'' (1975) opposite [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]], ''[[Chandi Sona]]'' (1977) opposite [[Sanjay Khan]] and ''[[Jaani Dost]]'' (1983) opposite [[Dharmendra]]. Towards the end of her career, she appeared in offbeat films such as Vinod Pande's ''[[Yeh Nazdeekiyan]]'' (1982), playing the \"other woman\" opposite [[Marc Zuber]], and ''Dil... Akhir Dil Hai'' (1982), opposite [[Naseeruddin Shah]].<ref>[http://www.brns.com/bollywood/pages1/bolly89.html \"Ashanti\"]. ''brns.com''.</ref>\n\nShe was often compared to her contemporary [[Zeenat Aman]] due to their common image of being sex-symbols. In fact, she acted alongside Aman in ''[[Mahaan]]'' (1983) and ''[[Ashanti (1982 film)|Ashanti]]'' (1982) (inspired by the American television show ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', with the third role played by [[Shabana Azmi]]). In films such as ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980) and ''[[Namak Halaal]]'' (1982), her screen presence may have been minimal as the films were largely worked around the hero, but Babi brought a certain attractive aloofness to the roles and songs she appeared in. In the big hit movie ''[[Kranti]]'' (1981), she made an impact despite a brief supporting role.\n\nHer more memorable roles include \"Anita\" in ''[[Deewaar]]'' (1975), \"Jenny\" in ''[[Amar Akbar Anthony]]'' (1977), and \"Sunita\" in ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' (1980). She was also the original choice for the female protagonist in ''[[Silsila]]'' along with [[Smita Patil]], but was later dropped by [[Yash Chopra]], who stated that while Babi was fine, [[Smita Patil]] was hurt, mainly because the filmmaker had asked actor friend [[Shashi Kapoor]] to pass the bad news to [[Smita Patil|Smita]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Entertainment/Bollywood/Smita-Parveen-the-original-choice-for-Silsila-Yash-Chopra/Article1-937612.aspx |title=Smita-Parveen, the original choice for Silsila: Yash Chopra |work=Hindustan Times |date=29 September 2012 |accessdate=6 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe later \"disappeared\" from the film scene in 1983, without informing anyone about her whereabouts, a perception that allowed for exaggerated rumours and pompous claims to be whispered in the industry that she might be \"under the control\" of figures in the \"underworld\". Many of her completed films were released in the following years, right up till her last film ''[[Akarshan]]'' releasing in 1988.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2005/jan/27pb1.htm |title=Amitabh on Parveen Babi |publisher=Rediff.com |date=27 January 2005 |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nHer career peaked at the time when most heroines were engulfed in [[India]]n attributes and Babi was one among the few actresses whose attire was completely westernised and this provided her a certain latitude many other contemporary female artists were denied in India's heavily male-dominated and misogynistic cinematic fiefdom. Parveen Babi along with [[Zeenat Aman]] with their chiselled looks, well-sculpted bodies and anglicised accents, donned the mantle of the westernized [[Indian people|Indian]] heroine and imparted to the female prima donna of [[Bollywood]] their characteristic mannerisms forever.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://idiva.com/news-entertainment/the-myth-madness-of-the-late-parveen-babi/12285 |title=The Myth & Madness of Parveen Babi |publisher=iDiva.com |accessdate=28 October 2012|date=26 April 2012 }}</ref>\n\nAs Babi's personality symbolized western standards, it would be difficult for Bollywood producers to personify her role in Indian sentiments. Hence she was given roles which were glamorous and represented standards of a film star quality and established her status as one of the \"Top Heroines of Bollywood\" or the \"Commercially successful Heroine\" and this paved the way to differ herself from the other contemporary actress in Bombay's film industry. She had appeared in most of the commercially successful films of that era and her famous co-stars include [[Amitabh Bachchan]], [[Shashi Kapoor]], [[Feroz Khan (actor)|Feroz Khan]], [[Dharmendra]], [[Rajesh Khanna]], [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Rishi Kapoor]] who were all leading stars of the 1970s and 1980s.<ref name=\"rediff2003\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2003/may/03dinesh.htm |title=Parveen Babi: A bohemian rhapsody |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref> In her acting career, which spanned almost ten years, she has acted in more than fifty films, of which ten were considered to be best. These films were also blockbusters of those times. Parveen Babi replaced the image of saree-clad, conventional [[Indian people|Indian]] lead actresses with a glamorous woman look. She never shied away from portraying roles of women having a live-in relationship with men and consuming alcohol openly, both of which were taboo in those times. She undeniably lit up and overpowered the screen with her presence. The fact that Parveen was paired with [[Amitabh Bachchan]] in eight films during the peak of the [[Amitabh Bachchan|Big B]] mania attests to her stature and star power. It seems to have been taken that only a superstar of Bachchan's stature could stand side by side with the presence of Parveen Babi. [[Amitabh Bachchan|Amitabh]] and Parveen complemented each other in the heady first years of the ''[[Amitabh Bachchan|Angry Young Man]]'' phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://song.ezinemark.com/parveen-babi-the-diva-of-hindi-film-industry-7d2e57e2443f.html |title=Parveen Babi \u2013 The Diva of Hindi Film Industry |publisher=Song.ezinemark.com |accessdate=28 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nShe would often appear in popular film songs which have become the craze of the young generations and such song picturisations involved glamorous costumes and ravishing film sets and in time would become hugely popular, and this includes \"Jawaani Jaaneman\" and \"Raat Baaqi Baat Baaqi\" in ''[[Namak Halaal]]'', \"Pyaar Karne Waale\" in ''[[Shaan (film)|Shaan]]'' and \"Maara Thumka\" in ''[[Kranti]]'', and this popularity made her among the highest paid actresses in Bollywood at those times.

G. Krishnamurti]] and her friend Valentine and spent some of the time in [[California]] and [[Houston]]. On 7 April 1984, she was suspected at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] after she failed to submit her identification papers and as she behaved to be difficult, the authorities handcuffed her and kept her in a general ward with thirty other mentally disturbed patients.

The film stars [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Charlie Hunnam]], and [[Jim Beaver]]. The story, set in [[Victorian era]] [[England]], follows an aspiring author who travels to a remote Gothic mansion in the English hills with her new husband and his sister. There, she must decipher the mystery behind the ghostly visions that haunt her new home.\n\nIn 2006, a [[spec script]] written by Del Toro and Robbins was sold to [[Universal Pictures]], with Del Toro set to direct. Development was delayed due to scheduling conflicts. The film was described as a \"ghost story and gothic romance\" heavily inspired by other horror films, such as ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'', ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on February 10, 2014, with additional filming in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and ended on May 16 that year. The film was produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and Del Toro's production company, [[Guillermo del Toro|DDY Productions]].\n\n''Crimson Peak'' premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 25, 2015, and was released in the United States on October 16, 2015 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the production values, performances and direction, but criticized the plot and characters. It grossed $74 million worldwide against its $55 million budget. The film received three nominations at the [[21st Empire Awards]], including [[Empire Award for Best Horror|Best Horror]]. It received nine nominations at the [[42nd Saturn Awards]], winning three, including [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Chastain and Best Production Design for [[Thomas E. Sanders]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Buffalo, New York]], 1887, [[List of American heiresses|American heiress]] Edith Cushing, the young daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing, is visited by her deceased mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, \"Beware of Crimson Peak.\"\n\nIn 1901, Edith, now a budding young author, meets Sir Thomas Sharpe, an English [[baronet]] who has come to the United States with his sister, Lucille, to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. Unimpressed with Sharpe's previous failures to raise capital, Mr. Cushing rejects Thomas's proposal.\n\nWhen Thomas and Edith become romantically involved, both Edith's father and her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael, disapprove. Mr. Cushing hires a private detective who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpes. Mr. Cushing then bribes the siblings to have Thomas end his relationship with Edith. Thomas, however, sends Edith a note explaining his actions. After Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, Edith and Thomas marry and return to England. They arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated mansion in [[Cumberland]], which is steadily sinking into the [[red clay]] mine it sits atop. Much to her confusion, Edith finds that Lucille is cold toward her while Thomas is physically distant, their marriage remaining unconsummated.\n\nGruesome red ghosts begin appearing to Edith throughout the mansion, frightening her. Thomas decides taking her out of the house for fresh air will help her, and has her accompany him to the local post office. There, Edith discovers that Thomas had some connection to an Italian woman. They are snowed in for the night and take the opportunity to finally make love. Lucille angrily lashes out after their return, seemingly upset that Edith and Thomas were together, which disturbs Edith. By the time Thomas mentions that the estate is referred to as \"Crimson Peak\" due to the warm red clay seeping through the snow, Edith is growing weak and coughing up blood.\n\nEdith explores the mansion and pieces clues together, discovering that Thomas previously married three wealthy women, one of whom was an Italian woman named Enola Schotti. A ghost lures her to a closet where she discovers [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinders]] on which one of Thomas's previous wives recorded a message, explaining that the Sharpes are poisoning her for her inheritance. Edith realizes she, too, is being poisoned through the tea that Lucille gives her every day and that the siblings have had an [[incest]]uous relationship for years. Lucille, the more deranged of the two, also murdered their mother after she had discovered her children's incest, and later the child that had resulted of their relationship. Thomas inherited the family manor that, like many aristocratic estates of the era, is no longer profitable; the Sharpes are virtually penniless. The siblings thus began a \"marriage and murder\" scheme to support themselves and finance Thomas's inventions.\n\nBack in the United States, Alan learns what Mr. Cushing had uncovered about the Sharpes prior to his death: Thomas's multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith. When Alan arrives, Lucille demands that Thomas kill him. By now, Thomas feels suffocated by Lucille, wants to leave all this behind, and has fallen in love with Edith. Wishing to protect her, he inflicts a non-fatal stab wound to Alan and hides him. Lucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate and also confesses that she was the one who murdered Edith's father. Edith stabs Lucille and attempts to flee. Thomas burns the transfers and tells his sister that they can leave the house and they can all be together but Lucille realises that he meant Edith will be with them as well. Upset and jealous that Thomas loves Edith (after he promised not to fall in love with any of his wives and only love Lucille) she kills him in a blind rage and then pursues Edith. Aided by Thomas's ghost, Edith kills Lucille with a shovel and silently says farewell to Thomas before he vanishes.\n\nEdith and Alan are rescued by the villagers, whereas Lucille becomes the black ghost of Allerdale, doomed to remain alone and trapped in the mansion while playing her favorite piano for all eternity. The beginning of the end credits implies that Edith has written a novel titled ''Crimson Peak'' based on her experiences.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n*[[Mia Wasikowska]] as Edith Cushing\n**Sofia Wells as young Edith\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Lucille Sharpe\n*[[Tom Hiddleston]] as Thomas Sharpe\n*[[Charlie Hunnam]] as Dr. Alan McMichael\n*[[Jim Beaver]] as Carter Cushing\n*[[Burn Gorman]] as Holly\n*[[Leslie Hope]] as Mrs. McMichael, Alan's mother\n*[[Jonathan Hyde]] as Ogilvie\n*[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the ghosts of Edith's mother and Lady Sharpe\n*[[Javier Botet]] as the ghosts of Enola Sciotti, Margaret McDermott, and Pamela Upton\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=225px|quote=But basically what it is, is a really, really, almost classical gothic romance ghost story, but then it has two or three scenes that are really, really disturbing in a very, very modern way.

It was sold quietly to Donna Langley at Universal. Del Toro planned to direct the film, but postponed the project to make ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', and then again to work on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' films. Langley suggested that del Toro produce the film for another director, but he could not find one he deemed suitable. While directing ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', del Toro developed a good working relationship with [[Legendary Pictures]]' [[Thomas Tull]] and Jon Jashni, who asked what he wanted to do next. Del Toro sent them his screenplays for a film adaptation of ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', a Western adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', and ''Crimson Peak''. The producers deemed the last of these \"the best project for us, just the right size\". Universal allowed del Toro to move the project to Legendary, with the caveat that they could put up money for a stake in the film.<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2012/12/guillermo-del-toro-to-helm-crimson-peak-as-next-feature-with-legendary-pictures/|title=Guillermo Del Toro To Helm 'Crimson Peak' As Next Feature, With Legendary Pictures|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDel Toro called the film a \"ghost story and gothic romance\".

I wanted this to feel like a throwback.\"<ref name=\"total\" />\n\nDel Toro wanted the film to honor the \"grand dames\" of the haunted house genre, namely [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' and [[Jack Clayton]]'s ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''. The director intended to make a large-scale horror film in the tradition of those he grew up watching, such as ''[[The Omen]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. He cited the latter as \"another Mount Everest of the haunted house movie\", praising the high production values and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s control over the large sets.<ref name=\"deadline\" />\n\nBritish playwright [[Lucinda Coxon]] was enlisted to rewrite the script with del Toro, in hopes of bringing it a \"proper degree of perversity and intelligence\", but she is not credited on the finished film.<ref name=\"total\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/guillermo-del-toro-updates-on-crimson-peak-and-pacific-rim-2|title=Guillermo del Toro updates on Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim 2|author=Total Film|magazine=[[Total Film]]|date=February 17, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] and [[Emma Stone]] were originally cast, but both dropped out of the production.

The film stars [[Mia Wasikowska]], [[Tom Hiddleston]], [[Jessica Chastain]], [[Charlie Hunnam]], and [[Jim Beaver]]. The story, set in [[Victorian era]] [[England]], follows an aspiring author who travels to a remote Gothic mansion in the English hills with her new husband and his sister. There, she must decipher the mystery behind the ghostly visions that haunt her new home.\n\nIn 2006, a [[spec script]] written by Del Toro and Robbins was sold to [[Universal Pictures]], with Del Toro set to direct. Development was delayed due to scheduling conflicts. The film was described as a \"ghost story and gothic romance\" heavily inspired by other horror films, such as ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'', ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]'' and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. [[Principal photography]] began at [[Pinewood Toronto Studios]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]] on February 10, 2014, with additional filming in [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], and ended on May 16 that year. The film was produced by [[Legendary Pictures]] and Del Toro's production company, [[Guillermo del Toro|DDY Productions]].\n\n''Crimson Peak'' premiered at [[Fantastic Fest]] on September 25, 2015, and was released in the United States on October 16, 2015 in standard and [[IMAX]] formats. The film received generally positive reviews from critics, with many praising the production values, performances and direction, but criticized the plot and characters. It grossed $74 million worldwide against its $55 million budget. The film received three nominations at the [[21st Empire Awards]], including [[Empire Award for Best Horror|Best Horror]]. It received nine nominations at the [[42nd Saturn Awards]], winning three, including [[Saturn Award for Best Horror Film|Best Horror Film]], [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Chastain and Best Production Design for [[Thomas E. Sanders]].\n\n== Plot ==\nIn [[Buffalo, New York]], 1887, [[List of American heiresses|American heiress]] Edith Cushing, the young daughter of wealthy businessman Carter Cushing, is visited by her deceased mother's black, disfigured ghost who warns her, \"Beware of Crimson Peak.\"\n\nIn 1901, Edith, now a budding young author, meets Sir Thomas Sharpe, an English [[baronet]] who has come to the United States with his sister, Lucille, to seek investors for his clay-mining invention. Unimpressed with Sharpe's previous failures to raise capital, Mr. Cushing rejects Thomas's proposal.\n\nWhen Thomas and Edith become romantically involved, both Edith's father and her childhood friend, Dr. Alan McMichael, disapprove. Mr. Cushing hires a private detective who uncovers unsavory facts about the Sharpes. Mr. Cushing then bribes the siblings to have Thomas end his relationship with Edith. Thomas, however, sends Edith a note explaining his actions. After Mr. Cushing is brutally murdered, Edith and Thomas marry and return to England. They arrive at Allerdale Hall, the Sharpes' dilapidated mansion in [[Cumberland]], which is steadily sinking into the [[red clay]] mine it sits atop. Much to her confusion, Edith finds that Lucille is cold toward her while Thomas is physically distant, their marriage remaining unconsummated.\n\nGruesome red ghosts begin appearing to Edith throughout the mansion, frightening her. Thomas decides taking her out of the house for fresh air will help her, and has her accompany him to the local post office. There, Edith discovers that Thomas had some connection to an Italian woman. They are snowed in for the night and take the opportunity to finally make love. Lucille angrily lashes out after their return, seemingly upset that Edith and Thomas were together, which disturbs Edith. By the time Thomas mentions that the estate is referred to as \"Crimson Peak\" due to the warm red clay seeping through the snow, Edith is growing weak and coughing up blood.\n\nEdith explores the mansion and pieces clues together, discovering that Thomas previously married three wealthy women, one of whom was an Italian woman named Enola Schotti. A ghost lures her to a closet where she discovers [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinders]] on which one of Thomas's previous wives recorded a message, explaining that the Sharpes are poisoning her for her inheritance. Edith realizes she, too, is being poisoned through the tea that Lucille gives her every day and that the siblings have had an [[incest]]uous relationship for years. Lucille, the more deranged of the two, also murdered their mother after she had discovered her children's incest, and later the child that had resulted of their relationship. Thomas inherited the family manor that, like many aristocratic estates of the era, is no longer profitable; the Sharpes are virtually penniless. The siblings thus began a \"marriage and murder\" scheme to support themselves and finance Thomas's inventions.\n\nBack in the United States, Alan learns what Mr. Cushing had uncovered about the Sharpes prior to his death: Thomas's multiple marriages and Lucille's time in a mental institution. He travels to Allerdale Hall to rescue Edith. When Alan arrives, Lucille demands that Thomas kill him. By now, Thomas feels suffocated by Lucille, wants to leave all this behind, and has fallen in love with Edith. Wishing to protect her, he inflicts a non-fatal stab wound to Alan and hides him. Lucille forces Edith to sign a transfer deed granting the Sharpes ownership of her estate and also confesses that she was the one who murdered Edith's father. Edith stabs Lucille and attempts to flee. Thomas burns the transfers and tells his sister that they can leave the house and they can all be together but Lucille realises that he meant Edith will be with them as well. Upset and jealous that Thomas loves Edith (after he promised not to fall in love with any of his wives and only love Lucille) she kills him in a blind rage and then pursues Edith. Aided by Thomas's ghost, Edith kills Lucille with a shovel and silently says farewell to Thomas before he vanishes.\n\nEdith and Alan are rescued by the villagers, whereas Lucille becomes the black ghost of Allerdale, doomed to remain alone and trapped in the mansion while playing her favorite piano for all eternity. The beginning of the end credits implies that Edith has written a novel titled ''Crimson Peak'' based on her experiences.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!-- Cast and order per closing tombstone credits, roles per closing credits scroll -->\n*[[Mia Wasikowska]] as Edith Cushing\n**Sofia Wells as young Edith\n*[[Jessica Chastain]] as Lucille Sharpe\n*[[Tom Hiddleston]] as Thomas Sharpe\n*[[Charlie Hunnam]] as Dr. Alan McMichael\n*[[Jim Beaver]] as Carter Cushing\n*[[Burn Gorman]] as Holly\n*[[Leslie Hope]] as Mrs. McMichael, Alan's mother\n*[[Jonathan Hyde]] as Ogilvie\n*[[Doug Jones (actor)|Doug Jones]] as the ghosts of Edith's mother and Lady Sharpe\n*[[Javier Botet]] as the ghosts of Enola Sciotti, Margaret McDermot, and Pamela Upton\n\n== Production ==\n=== Pre-production ===\n{{quote box|width=225px|quote=But basically what it is, is a really, really, almost classical gothic romance ghost story, but then it has two or three scenes that are really, really disturbing in a very, very modern way.

It was sold quietly to Donna Langley at Universal. Del Toro planned to direct the film, but postponed the project to make ''[[Hellboy II: The Golden Army]]'', and then again to work on ''[[The Hobbit (film series)|The Hobbit]]'' films. Langley suggested that del Toro produce the film for another director, but he could not find one he deemed suitable. While directing ''[[Pacific Rim (film)|Pacific Rim]]'', del Toro developed a good working relationship with [[Legendary Pictures]]' [[Thomas Tull]] and Jon Jashni, who asked what he wanted to do next. Del Toro sent them his screenplays for a film adaptation of ''[[At the Mountains of Madness]]'', a Western adaptation of ''[[The Count of Monte Cristo]]'', and ''Crimson Peak''. The producers deemed the last of these \"the best project for us, just the right size\". Universal allowed del Toro to move the project to Legendary, with the caveat that they could put up money for a stake in the film.<ref name=\"deadline\">{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2012/12/guillermo-del-toro-to-helm-crimson-peak-as-next-feature-with-legendary-pictures/|title=Guillermo Del Toro To Helm 'Crimson Peak' As Next Feature, With Legendary Pictures|last=Fleming Jr|first=Mike|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=December 3, 2012|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\nDel Toro called the film a \"ghost story and gothic romance\". He has described it as \"a very set-oriented, classical but at the same time modern take on the ghost story\", and said that it would allow him to play with the genres' conventions while subverting their rules.<ref name=\"deadline\" /> He stated, \"I think people are getting used to horror subjects done as [[Found footage (film technique)|found footage]] or [[B movie|B-value]] budgets. I wanted this to feel like a throwback.\"<ref name=\"total\" />\n\nDel Toro wanted the film to honor the \"grand dames\" of the haunted house genre, namely [[Robert Wise]]'s ''[[The Haunting (1963 film)|The Haunting]]'' and [[Jack Clayton]]'s ''[[The Innocents (1961 film)|The Innocents]]''. The director intended to make a large-scale horror film in the tradition of those he grew up watching, such as ''[[The Omen]]'', ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', and ''[[The Shining (film)|The Shining]]''. He cited the latter as \"another Mount Everest of the haunted house movie\", praising the high production values and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s control over the large sets.<ref name=\"deadline\" />\n\nBritish playwright [[Lucinda Coxon]] was enlisted to rewrite the script with del Toro, in hopes of bringing it a \"proper degree of perversity and intelligence\", but she is not credited on the finished film.<ref name=\"total\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.totalfilm.com/news/guillermo-del-toro-updates-on-crimson-peak-and-pacific-rim-2|title=Guillermo del Toro updates on Crimson Peak and Pacific Rim 2|author=Total Film|magazine=[[Total Film]]|date=February 17, 2013|accessdate=December 15, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Benedict Cumberbatch]] and [[Emma Stone]] were originally cast, but both dropped out of the production.

The [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] champion [[2015\u201316 Cleveland Cavaliers season|Cleveland Cavaliers]] defeated the defending NBA champion and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] champion [[2015\u201316 Golden State Warriors season|Golden State Warriors]] 4\u20133 in a rematch of the [[2015 NBA Finals]]. It was the 14th rematch of the previous NBA Finals in history, and the first Finals since [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]] in which the number one [[Seed (sports)|seed]] in each conference met. It was the second straight rematch in back-to-back years, as the [[Miami Heat]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]] played each other in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]] and [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]].\n\nGolden State, which earned [[home-court advantage]] with setting the NBA regular season wins record (73\u20139), jumped to a 2\u20130 lead in the series while recording the largest combined margin of victory (48) through two games in NBA Finals history. Cleveland returned home and responded with a 120\u201390 win in Game 3, but the Warriors won Game 4 to take a 3\u20131 series lead. The Cavaliers won the next three games to become the first team in Finals history to successfully overcome a 3\u20131 deficit. It also marked the first time since [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]] that Game 7 was won by the road team.\n\nFor the first time since {{nbafy|2004}}, a new scheduling format was instituted for the Finals. In previous years, the Finals were played in a Thursday\u2013Sunday\u2013Tuesday scheme. However, the league changed its scheduling to ensure an extra day off for both teams, which have to travel from one city to another during the series. This, along with the designated travel day, took place after Games 2, 4, 5, and 6. Coincidentally, the [[National Hockey League]] adopted this similar practice during [[2016 Stanley Cup Finals|that year's Stanley Cup Finals]]; however the NBA chose to schedule an extra day off between Games 1 and 2 so as to avoid competing with Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals (which normally takes place on the first Saturday of June).\n\nThe win by the Cavaliers was the first major professional sports championship won by a team based in [[Cleveland]] since [[Cleveland sports curse|1964]], and the first-ever championship won by the Cavaliers franchise.

Immediately after Irving's 3-pointer, Golden State brought the ball up-court, opting not to call a timeout, and although Golden State got a preferred switch and matchup of Curry on [[Kevin Love]], Love made arguably \"the biggest defensive stop of the entire NBA season\", and forced Curry into a contested 3-pointer, which he missed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ftw.usatoday.com/2016/06/kevin-love-defensive-stop-stephen-curry-nba-finals|title=Kevin Love came up with the biggest defensive stop of the entire NBA season|access-date=2017-03-01}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.si.com/nba/2016/10/20/kevin-love-cleveland-cavaliers-stephen-curry-nba-season-preview|title=The Biggest Stop Of Kevin Love's Life?

The Cavaliers fouled Draymond Green with 6.5 seconds remaining. Stephen Curry received the ensuing inbounds pass, pump faked and shot a three-pointer over Cavaliers guard Iman Shumpert. The attempt missed, and was rebounded by Marreese Speights of the Warriors who then missed a three-point attempt as time expired.

It was the 14th rematch of the previous NBA Finals in history, and the first Finals since [[2008 NBA Finals|2008]] in which the number one [[Seed (sports)|seed]] in each conference met. It was the second straight rematch in back-to-back years, as the [[Miami Heat]] and [[San Antonio Spurs]] played each other in [[2013 NBA Finals|2013]] and [[2014 NBA Finals|2014]].\n\nGolden State, which earned [[home-court advantage]] with setting the NBA regular season wins record (73\u20139), jumped to a 2\u20130 lead in the series while recording the largest combined margin of victory (48) through two games in NBA Finals history. Cleveland returned home and responded with a 120\u201390 win in Game 3, but the Warriors won Game 4 to take a 3\u20131 series lead. The Cavaliers won the next three games to become the first team in Finals history to successfully overcome a 3\u20131 deficit. It also marked the first time since [[1978 NBA Finals|1978]] that Game 7 was won by the road team.\n\nFor the first time since {{nbafy|2004}}, a new scheduling format was instituted for the Finals. In previous years, the Finals were played in a Thursday\u2013Sunday\u2013Tuesday scheme. However, the league changed its scheduling to ensure an extra day off for both teams, which have to travel from one city to another during the series. This, along with the designated travel day, took place after Games 2, 4, 5, and 6. Coincidentally, the [[National Hockey League]] adopted this similar practice during [[2016 Stanley Cup Finals|that year's Stanley Cup Finals]]; however the NBA chose to schedule an extra day off between Games 1 and 2 so as to avoid competing with Game 3 of the Stanley Cup Finals (which normally takes place on the first Saturday of June).\n\nThe win by the Cavaliers was the first major professional sports championship won by a team based in [[Cleveland]] since [[Cleveland sports curse|1964]], and the first-ever championship won by the Cavaliers franchise.

The game was notable for shattering a number of NBA Finals records. The Cavs scored 49 points in the first quarter, the most points of any period in a Finals game, en route to scoring 86 points for the first half, which was the most points scored in a half. They also hit 13 three-pointers in the first half, which broke the Finals record for most threes in a half set last game by the Warriors. The Cavaliers finished the game with 24 three-pointers, which easily broke the Finals record for the most threes in a game set by the Warriors in Game 2. Both the Cavaliers and Warriors combined to score a total of 154 points in the first half, which is another Finals record for most points by any two teams in a half.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/sports/basketball/cleveland-cavaliers-win-game-3-warriors.html?_r=0|title=Cavaliers Explode, Refusing to Go Quietly Against the Warriors|date=10 June 2017|work=New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>\t\n\n[[LeBron James]] tallied his ninth [[triple-double]] of the Finals (31 points, 10 rebounds, 11 assists), surpassing [[Magic Johnson]] for the most triple-doubles in a championship series. His highlight reel came three minutes into the third quarter when he threw a pass off the backboard to himself, finishing with a powerful dunk. James also passed [[Michael Jordan]] for third all-time in points scored in the Finals. [[Kyrie Irving]] led all scorers with 40 points, breaking out of a shooting slump from behind the arc by going 7-for-12. [[Kevin Love]] added 23 points on 6-of-8 from downtown, and [[J. R. Smith]] had 15 points, all on 5-of-9 from three-point range, including a deep shot from 30 feet in the second quarter to beat the shot clock buzzer. [[Kevin Durant]] scored 35 points to lead the Warriors, but their other three superstars were held to under 20 points each as [[Stephen Curry]], [[Klay Thompson]], and [[Draymond Green]] managed 14, 13, and 16 points respectively.

As the teams prepared for a jump ball with 1:56 left in the first quarter, Green was called for a hard foul for throwing an elbow at [[Iman Shumpert]]. Green was trying to plead his case when Warriors head coach [[Steve Kerr]] simultaneously argued with the officials, who then called a [[technical foul]] on Kerr, although it was mistakenly recorded as a foul on Green. With 7:19 remaining in the second quarter, [[Dahntay Jones]] was inexplicably whistled for a technical foul sitting on the Cavaliers bench for trash talking at Durant, who was on the floor. With 7:26 remaining in the third quarter, Love fouled Durant from behind on a layup attempt. Durant claimed he was hit hard in the forehead, and James exchanged words with him, leading to a double-technical on the pair as well as a type 1 [[flagrant foul]] on Kevin Love.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.espn.com/nba/recap?gameId=400954513|title= LeBron, Cavs end Warriors' perfect postseason run in Game 4|date=10 June 2017|work=ESPN|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref> About a minute later, Green picked up what appeared to be his second technical foul of the game, which would have forced an [[Ejection (sports)|ejection]]. However, the officials confirmed that the first technical was on coach Kerr, not Green as originally recorded. Late in the third, Shumpert and [[Zaza Pachulia]] got involved in a mini scuffle when battling for the loose ball, with Pachulia hitting in the direction of Shumpert's groin and Shumpert retaliating. At the same time, a Cavaliers fan, charged onto the court to shout at [[Matt Barnes]] during the Warriors huddle as the officials were replaying the incident. Shumpert and Pachulia were assessed double technicals, and the fan was escorted out of the arena by security personnel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.latimes.com/sports/nba/la-sp-cavaliers-warriors-20170609-story.html|title=LeBron James and the Cavaliers avoid a sweep with 137-116 rout of Warriors|date=10 June 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=14 June 2017}}</ref>\n\nMany in the media and on [[Twitter]] commented on the refereeing in this game, calling it \"a disaster\" and \"a sideshow\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theringer.com/nba-finals-game-4-refereeing-mistakes-5585cc641968|title=The Refs Really Screwed Up Game 4 \u2013 The Ringer|date=2017-06-10|work=The Ringer|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/nba-officiating-was-at-its-worst-in-game-4-and-thats-a-huge-problem-061017|title=NBA officiating was at its worst in Game 4, and that's a huge problem|date=2017-06-10|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2017-08-07|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2017/6/10/15772762/game-4-cavs-warriors-refs|title=The referees were a disaster in Game 4|work=SBNation.com|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/warriors/article/Warriors-fans-turn-to-memes-to-vent-frustration-11209815.php|title=Game 4 refs roasted on Twitter for controversial calls|work=SFGate|access-date=2017-08-07}}</ref>\n\n===Game 5===\n{{Basketballbox|bg=#eee |date=June 12 |time=9:00 pm |place=[[Oracle Arena]], [[Oakland, California]] |TV=[[NBA on ABC|ABC]]\n|team1=[[Cleveland Cavaliers]] |score1=120\n|team2='''[[Golden State Warriors]]''' |score2='''129'''\n|report=[http://www.nba.com/games/20170612/CLEGSW#/boxscore Boxscore]\n|Q1='''37'''\u201333 |Q2=23\u2013'''38''' |Q3='''33'''\u201327 |Q4=27\u2013'''31'''\n|points1=[[LeBron James]] 41|points2=[[Kevin Durant]] 39 \n|rebounds1=[[LeBron James]] 13 |rebounds2=[[Draymond Green]] 12 \n|assist1=[[LeBron James]] 8 |assist2=[[Stephen Curry]] 10\n|attendance=19,596\n|referee=[[Danny Crawford]], Ed Malloy, Derrick Stafford\n|series=Golden State wins series, 4\u20131\n}}\nThe [[Golden State Warriors|Warriors]] defeated the [[Cleveland Cavaliers|Cavaliers]] with a score of 129\u2013120 to win the series 4\u20131.
