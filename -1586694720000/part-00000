The series was loosely based on the 1979 two-part episode \"You're in the Army, Now,\" in which Laverne and Shirley enlisted in the Army.\n\nThe following year, the half-hour show was combined with a half-hour adaptation of the 1978-1982 sitcom ''[[Mork & Mindy]]'' to form the ''[[Mork & Mindy/Laverne & Shirley/Fonz Hour]]'', which also lasted for one season. In this second season, Laverne and Shirley were joined by [[Fonzie|The Fonz]] and his dog Mr. Cool, from the 1980-1981 animated show ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]''. The new half-hour was re-titled ''Laverne & Shirley with Special Guest Star The Fonz''.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=352}}</ref>\n\n==Summary==\nThe series, set at Camp Fillmore, follows the comedic antics of roommates Laverne DeFazio and Shirley Feeney as privates with the U.S. Army.
