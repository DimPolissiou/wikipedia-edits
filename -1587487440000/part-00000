Between 6 and 11 May 1111 she was crowned Imperial Vicar and Vice-Queen of Italy by [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] at the Castle of Bianello ([[Quattro Castella]], [[Reggio Emilia]]).<ref>Every year, usually in the last Sunday of May, this episode is recreated in the [[Corteo Storico Matildico]].</ref>\n\nSometimes called '''''la Gran Contessa''''' (\"the Great Countess\") or '''Matilda of Canossa''' after her [[Count of Canossa|ancestral]] castle of [[Canossa]], Matilda was one of the most important figures of the [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian Middle Ages]]. She lived in a period of constant battles, intrigues and [[excommunication]]s, and was able to demonstrate an extraordinary force,{{Unclear inline|reason=\"demonstrate an extraordinary force\"?|date=June 2018}} even enduring great pain and humiliation, showing an innate leadership ability.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Boniface III of Tuscany.png\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = A bearded man sitting on a cushion\n | image2 = Beatrice of Bar.png Why do people get to do this???\n\n | width2 = 195\n | alt2 = A veiled woman sitting on a cushion\n | footer = Matilda's parents, Boniface (l) and Beatrice (r)\nIn a miniature in the early twelfth-century ''Vita Mathildis'' by the monk [[Donizo]] (or, in Italian, Donizone), Matilda is referred to as 'Resplendent Matilda' (''Mathildis Lucens''). Since the Latin word ''lucens'' is similar to ''lucensis'' (of/from [[Lucca]]), this may also be a reference to Matilda's origins. She was descended from the nobleman [[Sigifred of Lucca]],\nand was the youngest of the three children of [[Boniface III, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany]], ruler of a substantial territory in Northern Italy and one of the most powerful vassals of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]. Matilda's mother, [[Beatrice of Lorraine]], was the Emperor's first cousin and closely connected to the imperial household.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}} Renowned for her learning, Matilda was literate in [[Latin language|Latin]], as well as reputed to speak [[Middle High German|German]] and [[Old French|French]].{{sfn|Ferrante|1997|p=88}} The extent of Matilda's education in military matters is debated. It has been asserted that she was taught strategy, tactics, riding and wielding weapons,{{sfn|Beeler|1971|p=206}} but recent scholarship challenges these claims.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}}\n\nFollowing the death of their father in 1052, Matilda's brother, [[Frederick, Margrave of Tuscany|Frederick]], inherited the family lands and titles under the [[regency]] of their mother.{{sfn|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=78-79}} Matilda's sister, Beatrice, died the next year, making Matilda [[heir presumptive]] to Frederick's personal holdings. In 1054, determined to safeguard the interests of her children as well as her own,{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}} her mother married [[Godfrey, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Godfrey the Bearded]], a distant kinsman who had been stripped of the [[Duchy of Upper Lorraine]] after openly rebelling against Emperor Henry III.{{sfn|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=78-79}}\n\nHenry was enraged by Beatrice of Lorraine's unauthorised union with his most vigorous adversary and took the opportunity to have her arrested, along with Matilda, when he marched south to attend a [[synod]] in Florence on [[Pentecost]] in 1055.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}} Frederick's rather suspicious death soon thereafter{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=34}} made Matilda the last member of the [[House of Canossa]]. Mother and daughter were taken to Germany,{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}} but Godfrey successfully avoided capture. Unable to defeat him, Henry sought a rapproachment. The Emperor's death in October 1056, which brought to throne the underage [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], seems to have accelerated the negotiations. Godfrey was reconciled with the crown and recognized as Margrave of Tuscany in December, while Beatrice and Matilda were released. By the time she and her mother returned to Italy, in the company of [[Pope Victor II]], Matilda was formally acknowledged as heir to the greatest territorial lordship in the southern part of the Empire.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=34}}\n\nMatilda's mother and stepfather became heavily involved in the series of disputed papal elections during their regency, supporting the [[Gregorian Reforms]]. Godfrey's brother Frederick became [[Pope Stephen IX]], while both of the following two popes, [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]], had been Tuscan bishops. Matilda made her first journey to [[Rome]] with her family in the entourage of Nicholas in 1059. Godfrey and Beatrice actively assisted them in dealing with [[antipope]]s, while the adolescent Matilda's role remains unclear. A contemporary account of her stepfather's 1067 expedition against [[Richard I of Capua|Prince Richard I of Capua]] on behalf of the papacy mentions Matilda's participation in the campaign, describing it as the \"first service that the most excellent daughter of Boniface offered to the blessed prince of the apostles.\"{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=49}}\n\n==First marriage==\n[[File:Italy 1050.jpg|thumb|The states of the [[Apennine Peninsula]] in the second half of the 11th century]]\nIn 1069, as Godfrey the Bearded lay dying in [[Verdun]], Beatrice and Matilda hastened to reach Lorraine, anxious to ensure a smooth transition of power. Matilda was present at her stepfather's deathbed, and on that occasion she is for the first time clearly mentioned as the wife of her stepbrother, [[Godfrey the Hunchback]],{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} to whom she had been betrothed since childhood.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} The marriage proved a failure; the death of their only child (a daughter called Beatrice) shortly after birth in August 1071 and Godfrey's physical deformity may have helped fuel deep animosity between the spouses.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}}\n\nBy the end of 1071, Matilda had left her husband and returned to Tuscany.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} Matilda's bold decision to repudiate her husband came at a cost, but ensured her independence. Beatrice started preparing Matilda for rule by holding court jointly with her{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} and, eventually, encouraging her to issue charters on her own as countess (''comitissa'') and duchess (''ducatrix'').{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}}\n\nGodfrey fiercely protested the separation and demanded that Matilda come back to him, which she repeatedly refused.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} The Duke descended into Italy in 1072, determined to enforce the marriage.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} He sought the help of both Matilda's mother and her ally, the newly elected [[Pope Gregory VII]], promising military aid to the latter.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} Matilda's resolution was unshakable,{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} and Godfrey returned to Lorraine alone,{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} losing all hope by 1074. Rather than supporting the Pope as promised, Godfrey turned his attention to imperial affairs. Meanwhile, the conflict later known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] was brewing between Gregory and Henry, with both men claiming the right to appoint bishops and abbots within the Empire. Matilda and Godfrey soon found themselves on opposing sides of the dispute, leading to a further detoriation of their difficult relationship. German chroniclers, writing of the [[Synod of Worms|synod held at Worms]] in January 1076, even suggested that Godfrey inspired Henry's allegation of a licentious affair between Gregory and Matilda.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}}<!--- \"Matilda would finally gain her vengeance at the Council of Piacenza...\"--->\n\n== Widowhood ==\n\nMatilda became a widow on 26 February 1076. Godfrey the Hunchback was assassinated in Flanders while \"[[excretion|answering the call of nature]]\".  Having been accused of adultery with the Pope the previous month, Matilda was suspected of ordering her estranged husband's death.  She could not have known about the proceedings at the Synod of Worms at the time, however, since the news took three months to reach the Pope himself, and it is more likely that Godfrey was killed at the instigation of an enemy nearer to him. Within two months, Beatrice was dead as well. Matilda's power was considerably augmented by these deaths; she was now the undisputed heir of all her parents' [[allodial land]]s. Her inheritance would have been threatened had Godfrey survived her mother, but she now enjoyed the privileged status of a widow. It seemed unlikely, however, that Henry would formally invest her with the margraviate.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=65}}\n\nBetween 1076 and 1080, Matilda travelled to Lorraine to lay claim to her husband's estate in [[Verdun]], which he had willed (along with the rest of his patrimony) to his sister [[Ida of Lorraine|Ida]]'s son, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]].{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=67}} Godfrey of Bouillon also disputed her right to [[Stenay]] and [[Mosay]], which her mother had received as [[dowry]]. The quarrel between aunt and nephew over the episcopal county of Verdun was eventually settled by [[Theoderic of Verdun|Theoderic]], [[Bishop of Verdun]], who enjoyed the right to nominate the counts. He easily found in favor of Margravine Matilda, as such verdict happened to please both Pope Gregory and King Henry. Matilda then proceeded to [[Feoffment|enfeoff]] Verdun to her husband's pro-reform cousin, [[Albert III, Count of Namur|Albert III of Namur]].{{sfn|Healey|2013|p=55-56}} The deep animosity between Matilda and her nephew is thought to have prevented her from travelling to [[Jerusalem]] during the [[First Crusade]], led by him in the late 1090s.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=164}}\n\n==Investiture Controversy==\n{{main|Walk to Canossa}}\n[[File:Vatican Codex 4922 Matilda.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature of Matilda from the frontispiece of [[Donizo]]\u2019s ''Vita Mathildis'' (Codex Vat. Lat. 4922, fol. 7v.). Matilda is depicted seated. On her right, Donizo is presenting her with a copy of the ''Vita Mathildis'', on her left is a man with a sword (possibly her man-at-arms). The script underneath reads: ''Mathildis lucens, precor hoc cape cara volumen'' (Resplendent Matilda, please accept this book, oh you dear one.)]]\n\nThe disagreement between Pope Gregory VII and King Henry IV culminated in the aftermath of the Synod of Worms in February 1076. Gregory declared Henry [[excommunicated]], releasing all his subjects from allegiance to him and providing the perfect reason for rebellion against his rule.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=65}} Insubordinate southern German princes gathered in [[Trebur]], awaiting the Pope. Matilda's first military endeavor, as well as the first major task altogether as ruler, turned out to be protecting the Pope during his perilous journey north. Gregory could rely on nobody else; as the sole heir to the Attonid patrimony, Matilda controlled all the Apennine [[mountain pass|passes]] and nearly all the rest that connected [[central Italy]] to the [[northern Italy|north]]. The Lombard bishops, who were also excommunicated for taking part in the synod and whose sees bordered Matilda's domain, were keen to capture Gregory. Gregory was aware of the danger, and recorded that all his advisors except Matilda counselled him against travelling to Trebur.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=68}}\n\nHenry had other plans, however. He decided to descend into Italy and intercept Gregory, who was thus delayed. The German dukes held a council by themselves and informed the King that he had to submit to the Pope or be replaced. Henry's predecessors dealt easily with troublesome pontiffs - they simply deposed them, and the excommunicated Lombard bishops rejoiced at this prospect. When Matilda heard about Henry's approach, she urged Gregory to take refuge in the [[Castle of Canossa]], her family's eponymous stronghold. Gregory took her advice. It soon became clear that the intention behind Henry's [[walk to Canossa]] was to show [[penance]]. By 25 January 1077, the King stood barefoot in the snow before the gates of Matilda's castle, accompanied by his mother-in-law, Margravine [[Adelaide of Susa]]. He remained there, humbled, until 28 January, when Matilda convinced the Pope to see him. Matilda and Adelaide brokered a deal between the men.<ref>[https://storicamente.org/creber-women-canossa Creber, \u2018Women at Canossa'.]</ref> Henry was taken back into the Church, with the margravines acting as sponsors and formally swearing to the agreement.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=70}}\n\nIn 1079, Matilda gave the Pope all her domains, in open defiance of Henry IV's claims both as the overlord of some of those domains, and as her close relative. Two years later the fortunes of Papacy and Empire turned again: in 1080 Henry IV summoned a council in [[Brixen]], which deposed Gregory VII. The following year the Emperor decided to travel again to Italy to reinstate his overlordship over his territories. He also declared Matilda, on account of her 1079 donation to the Church, forfeit and be banned from the Empire; although this wasn't enough to eliminate her as a source of trouble, for she retained substantial [[allodial]] holdings. On 15 October 1080 near [[Volta Mantovana]] the Imperial troops (with Guibert of Ravenna as the newly elected [[Antipope Clement III]]) defeated the troops loyal to Gregory VII and controlled by Matilda. This was the first serious military defeat of Matilda (Battle of Volta Mantovana).<ref>Paolo Golinelli: ''Sant\u2019Anselmo, Mantova e la lotta per le investiture'', 1987.</ref>\n\nMatilda, however, didn't surrender. While Gregory VII was forced into exile, she, retaining control over all the western passes in the Apennines, could force Henry IV to approach Rome via [[Ravenna]]; even with this route open, the Emperor would find it hard to besiege Rome with a hostile territory at his back. In December 1080 the citizens of Lucca, then the capital of Tuscany, had revolted and driven out her ally Bishop [[Anselm of Lucca|Anselm]]. She is believed to have commissioned the renowned [[Ponte della Maddalena]] where the [[Via Francigena]] crosses the river [[Serchio]] at [[Borgo a Mozzano]] just north of [[Lucca]].\n\nMatilda remained Pope Gregory VII's chief intermediary for communication with northern Europe even as he lost control of Rome and was holed up in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. After Henry caught hold of the Pope's seal, Matilda wrote to supporters in Germany only to trust papal messages that came through her.\n\nHenry IV's control of Rome enabled him to enthrone Antipope Clement III, who, in turn, crowned him Emperor. After this, Henry IV returned to Germany, leaving it to his allies to attempt Matilda's dispossession. These attempts floundered after Matilda (with help of the city of [[Bologna]]) defeated them at [[Bomporto|Sorbara]] near [[Modena]] on 2 July 1084.\n\nGregory VII died in 1085, and Matilda's forces, with those of Prince [[Jordan I of Capua]] (her off and on again enemy), took to the field in support of a new pope, [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]]. In 1087, Matilda led an expedition to Rome in an attempt to install Victor, but the strength of the imperial counterattack soon convinced the pope to withdraw from the city.\n\n==Second marriage==\n\nIn 1088 Matilda was facing a new attempt at invasion by Henry IV, and decided to pre-empt it by means of a political marriage. In 1089 Matilda (in her early forties) married [[Welf II, Duke of Bavaria|Welf V]], who was probably fifteen to seventeen years old.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=124-129}} Welf was heir to the Duchy of Bavaria. He was also a member of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] dynasty: the Welfs/Guelphs were important papal supporters from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries in their conflict with the German emperors (see [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]). Matilda and Welf's wedding was part of a network of alliances approved by the new pope, [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], in order to effectively counter Henry IV.\n\n[[Cosmas of Prague]] (writing in the early twelfth century), included a letter in his ''Chronica Boemorum'', which he claimed that Matilda sent to her future husband, but which is now thought to be spurious:<ref>W.

The third day, Matilda appeared naked on a table especially prepared on sawhorses, and told him that ''everything is in front of you and there is no hidden malice''. But the Duke was dumbfounded; Matilda, furious, slapped him and spat in his face, taunting him: ''Get out of here, monster, you don't deserve our kingdom, you vile thing, viler than a worm or a rotten seaweed, don't let me see you again, or you'll die a miserable death...''.<ref>Cosmas of Prague, ''Chronica Boemorum'', II, ch.32, in \nB.

This forced Henry to return to Italy, where he chased Matilda into the mountains. He was humbled before Canossa, this time in a military defeat in October 1092, from which his influence in Italy never recovered.{{sfn|Eads|2010|p=23-68}}\n\n==The final victory against Henry IV==\n[[Image:Matilde di Canossa - signature.jpg|thumb|280px|Matilda's signature (\"Matilda, Dei gratia si quid est\"), quite tremulous due to her old age. ''Notitia Confirmationis (Prato, June 1107), Archivio Storico Diocesano of Lucca, Diplomatico Arcivescovile, perg. ++ I29'']]\n\nAfter several victories, including one against the [[Saxons]], Henry IV prepared in 1090 his third descent to Italy, in order to inflict the final defeat on the Church. His route was the usual one, [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]] and [[Verona]], along the border of Matilda's possessions, which began outside the cities' gates. The opposing armies would meet near Mantua. Matilda secured the loyalty of the townspeople by exempting them from some taxes, such as ''teloneo'' and ''ripatico'', and with the promise of Lombard franchise, entailing the rights to hunt, fish and cut wood on both banks of the [[Tartaro-Canalbianco-Po di Levante|Tartaro]] river.\n\nThe Mantua people stood by Matilda until the so-called \"Holy Thursday betrayal\", when the townspeople, won over by additional concessions from Henry, who had meanwhile besieged the city, sided with him. In 1092 Matilda escaped to the Reggiano [[Apennines]] and her most inexpugnable [[stronghold]]s. Since the times of [[Adalbert Atto]] the power of the Canossa family had been based on a network of castles, fortresses and fortified villages in the Val d'Enza, forming a complex polygonal defense that had always resisted all attack from the Apennines. After several bloody battles with mutual defeats, the powerful imperial army was surrounded.\n\nIn spite of its fearful power, the Imperial army was defeated by Matilda's liegemen.  Among them were small landowners and holders of fortified villages, which remained completely loyal to the Canossas even against the Holy Roman Emperor. Their familiarity with the territory, their quick communications and maneuvering to all the high places of the Val d'Enza gave them victory over Henry's might. It seems that Matilda personally participated, with a handful of chosen faithful men, to the battle, galvanizing the allies with the cry of Just War. The Imperial army was taken as in a vice in the meandering mountain creek. The overall import of Henry's rout was more than a military defeat. The Emperor realized it was impossible to penetrate those places, wholly different from the plains of the Po Valley or of Saxe. There he faced not boundaries drawn by the rivers of Central Europe, but steep trails, ravines, inaccessible places protecting Matilda's fortresses, and high [[tower house]]s, whence the defenders could unload on anyone approaching missiles of all kinds: spears, arrows, perhaps even boiling oil,<ref>At the time, the oil was obtained only by cold pressing of the olives; was therefore very rare and expensive.</ref> javelins, stones.\n\nAfter Matilda's victory several cities, such as [[Milan]], [[Cremona]], [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] and [[Piacenza]], sided with her to free themselves of Imperial rule. In 1093 the Emperor's eldest son, Conrad, supported by the Pope, Matilda and a group of Lombard cities, was crowned King of Italy. Matilda freed and even gave refuge to Henry IV's wife, [[Eupraxia of Kiev]], who, at the urging of [[Pope Urban II]], made a public confession before the church [[Council of Piacenza]].{{sfn|Althoff|2006|p=213}} She accused her husband of imprisoning her in Verona{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=289}} after forcing her to participate in orgies, and, according to some later accounts, of attempting a [[black mass]] on her naked body.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=289ff.}}<ref>[http://bibliotekar.ru/polk-11/5.htm  ''Women of Ancient Rus (In Russian)''].</ref> Thanks to these scandals and division within the Imperial family, the prestige and power of Henry IV was increasingly weakened.\n\nIn 1095, Henry attempted to reverse his fortunes by seizing Matilda's castle of Nogara, but the countess's arrival at the head of an army forced him to retreat. In 1097, Henry withdrew from Italy altogether, after which Matilda reigned virtually unchallenged, although she did continue to launch military operations to restore her authority and regain control of the towns that had remained loyal to the emperor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  With the assistance of the French armies heading off to the [[First Crusade]], she was finally able to restore Urban to [[Rome]].{{sfn|Peters|1971|p=34}} She ordered or led successful expeditions against [[Ferrara]] (1101), [[Parma]] (1104), [[Prato]] (1107) and [[Mantua]] (1114).\n\n==Vice-Queen of Italy==\n\nHenry IV died now defeated in 1106; and after the deposition and death of Conrad (1101), his second son and new Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, began to turn the fight against the Church and Italy. This time the attitude of Matilda against the imperial house had to change and she accepted the will of the Emperor. In 1111, on his way back to Germany, Henry V met her at the Castle of Bianello, near [[Reggio Emilia]]. Matilda confirmed him the inheritance rights over the fiefs that Henry IV disputed her, thus ending a fight that had lasted over twenty years. Henry V gave Matilda a new title: between 6 and 11 May 1111, the Emperor crowned Matilda as '''Imperial Vicar and Vice-Queen of Italy'''. This episode was the decisive step towards the [[Concordat of Worms]].\n\n==Foundation of churches==\nBy legend Matilda of Canossa is said to have founded one hundred churches.  Documents and local legend identify well over one hundred churches, monasteries, hospices, and bridges built or restored between the Alps and Rome by Matilda and her mother, Beatrice.   Today, churches and monasteries in the regions of Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, and even the Veneto attribute their foundation to her.  Built originally with hospices for travelers attached, these churches created a network that united the supporters of the Gregorian reform of the Roman Church which Matilda supported.<ref>Spike, 2015, Bologna</ref>  This network also provided protection for pilgrims, merchants and travelers assisting the Renaissance in culture that occurred in the centuries after Matilda's death.\n\nMost of these churches continue today to be vital centers of their communities.  They include rural churches located along the Po and Arno rivers, and their tributaries;  churches built along the Apennine mountain passes which Matilda's family controlled and those along the ancient highways of the via Emilia, the via Cassia, the via Aurelia and the via Francigena. Among these are monuments listed by UNESCO as among the heritage of our world, including churches in Florence, Ferrara, Lucca, Mantua, Modena, Pisa, Verona and Volterra.  Her cultural legacy is enormous throughout Northern Italy.<ref>Spike, 2015, Florence</ref>\n\nSome churches traditionally said to have been founded by Matilda include:\n\n* Sant'Andrea Apostolo of Vitriola, at [[Montefiorino]] ([[Province of Modena|Modena]]).<ref>[http://www.provincia.modena.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=305&IDSezione=7180&ID=69399 ''Provincia di Modena.

It is widely reported that she bequeathed her [[Allodial title|allodial property]] to the Pope. Unaccountably, however, this donation was never officially recognized in Rome and no record exists of it.  Henry V had promised some of the cities in her territory that he would appoint no successor after he deposed her. In her place the leading citizens of these cities took control, and the era of the [[Italian city-states|city-states in northern Italy]] began.\n\nMatilda was at first buried in the [[Polirone Abbey|Abbey of San Benedetto in Polirone]], located in the town of [[San Benedetto Po]]; then, in 1633, at the behest of [[Pope Urban VIII]], her body was moved to [[Rome]] and placed in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. Finally, in 1645 her remains were definitely deposited in the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican]], where they now lie in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. She is one of only six women who have the honor of being buried in the Basilica, the others being Queen [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Christina of Sweden]], [[Maria Clementina Sobieska]] (wife of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]), [[St. Petronilla]], [[Queen Charlotte of Cyprus]] and Agnesina Colonna Caetani.\n\nA [[Tomb of Countess Matilda of Tuscany|memorial tomb for Matilda]], commissioned by [[Pope Urban VIII]] and designed by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], marks her burial place in St Peter's and is often called the ''Honor and Glory of Italy''.\n\nAfter her death, an aura of legend came to surround Matilda. Church historians gave her the character of a semi-nun, solely dedicated to contemplation and faith. Some argue, instead, that she was a woman of strong passions of both spiritual and carnal nature (indicated by her supposed affairs with Popes Gregory VII and Urban II).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nShe has been posited by some critics as the origin of the mysterious \"Matilda\" who appears to Dante gathering flowers in the [[Purgatorio#The Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] in Dante's ''[[Purgatorio (Dante)|Purgatorio]]''.{{sfn|Binyon|1978}}\n\nThe story of Matilda and Henry IV is the main plot device in [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s play ''[[Enrico IV]]''.

Between 6 and 11 May 1111 she was crowned Imperial Vicar and Vice-Queen of Italy by [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor]] at the Castle of Bianello ([[Quattro Castella]], [[Reggio Emilia]]).<ref>Every year, usually in the last Sunday of May, this episode is recreated in the [[Corteo Storico Matildico]].</ref>\n\nSometimes called '''''la Gran Contessa''''' (\"the Great Countess\") or '''Matilda of Canossa''' after her [[Count of Canossa|ancestral]] castle of [[Canossa]], Matilda was one of the most important figures of the [[Italy in the Middle Ages|Italian Middle Ages]]. She lived in a period of constant battles, intrigues and [[excommunication]]s, and was able to demonstrate an extraordinary force,{{Unclear inline|reason=\"demonstrate an extraordinary force\"?|date=June 2018}} even enduring great pain and humiliation, showing an innate leadership ability.\n\n==Childhood==\n{{Multiple image\n | image1 = Boniface III of Tuscany.png\n | width1 = 150\n | alt1 = A bearded man sitting on a cushion\n | image2 = Beatrice of Bar.png\n | width2 = 195\n | alt2 = A veiled woman sitting on a cushion\n | footer = Matilda's parents, Boniface (l) and Beatrice (r)\n}}\nIn a miniature in the early twelfth-century ''Vita Mathildis'' by the monk [[Donizo]] (or, in Italian, Donizone), Matilda is referred to as 'Resplendent Matilda' (''Mathildis Lucens''). Since the Latin word ''lucens'' is similar to ''lucensis'' (of/from [[Lucca]]), this may also be a reference to Matilda's origins. She was descended from the nobleman [[Sigifred of Lucca]],\nand was the youngest of the three children of [[Boniface III, Margrave of Tuscany|Margrave Boniface III of Tuscany]], ruler of a substantial territory in Northern Italy and one of the most powerful vassals of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry III]]. Matilda's mother, [[Beatrice of Lorraine]], was the Emperor's first cousin and closely connected to the imperial household.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}} Renowned for her learning, Matilda was literate in [[Latin language|Latin]], as well as reputed to speak [[Middle High German|German]] and [[Old French|French]].{{sfn|Ferrante|1997|p=88}} The extent of Matilda's education in military matters is debated. It has been asserted that she was taught strategy, tactics, riding and wielding weapons,{{sfn|Beeler|1971|p=206}} but recent scholarship challenges these claims.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}}\n\nFollowing the death of their father in 1052, Matilda's brother, [[Frederick, Margrave of Tuscany|Frederick]], inherited the family lands and titles under the [[regency]] of their mother.{{sfn|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=78-79}} Matilda's sister, Beatrice, died the next year, making Matilda [[heir presumptive]] to Frederick's personal holdings. In 1054, determined to safeguard the interests of her children as well as her own,{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}} her mother married [[Godfrey, Duke of Upper Lorraine|Godfrey the Bearded]], a distant kinsman who had been stripped of the [[Duchy of Upper Lorraine]] after openly rebelling against Emperor Henry III.{{sfn|Luscombe|Riley-Smith|2004|p=78-79}}\n\nHenry was enraged by Beatrice of Lorraine's unauthorised union with his most vigorous adversary and took the opportunity to have her arrested, along with Matilda, when he marched south to attend a [[synod]] in Florence on [[Pentecost]] in 1055.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=358}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}} Frederick's rather suspicious death soon thereafter{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=34}} made Matilda the last member of the [[House of Canossa]]. Mother and daughter were taken to Germany,{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=35}} but Godfrey successfully avoided capture. Unable to defeat him, Henry sought a rapproachment. The Emperor's death in October 1056, which brought to throne the underage [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]], seems to have accelerated the negotiations. Godfrey was reconciled with the crown and recognized as Margrave of Tuscany in December, while Beatrice and Matilda were released. By the time she and her mother returned to Italy, in the company of [[Pope Victor II]], Matilda was formally acknowledged as heir to the greatest territorial lordship in the southern part of the Empire.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=34}}\n\nMatilda's mother and stepfather became heavily involved in the series of disputed papal elections during their regency, supporting the [[Gregorian Reforms]]. Godfrey's brother Frederick became [[Pope Stephen IX]], while both of the following two popes, [[Pope Nicholas II|Nicholas II]] and [[Pope Alexander II|Alexander II]], had been Tuscan bishops. Matilda made her first journey to [[Rome]] with her family in the entourage of Nicholas in 1059. Godfrey and Beatrice actively assisted them in dealing with [[antipope]]s, while the adolescent Matilda's role remains unclear. A contemporary account of her stepfather's 1067 expedition against [[Richard I of Capua|Prince Richard I of Capua]] on behalf of the papacy mentions Matilda's participation in the campaign, describing it as the \"first service that the most excellent daughter of Boniface offered to the blessed prince of the apostles.\"{{sfn|Robinson|2004|p=49}}\n\n==First marriage==\n[[File:Italy 1050.jpg|thumb|The states of the [[Apennine Peninsula]] in the second half of the 11th century]]\nIn 1069, as Godfrey the Bearded lay dying in [[Verdun]], Beatrice and Matilda hastened to reach Lorraine, anxious to ensure a smooth transition of power. Matilda was present at her stepfather's deathbed, and on that occasion she is for the first time clearly mentioned as the wife of her stepbrother, [[Godfrey the Hunchback]],{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} to whom she had been betrothed since childhood.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} The marriage proved a failure; the death of their only child (a daughter called Beatrice) shortly after birth in August 1071 and Godfrey's physical deformity may have helped fuel deep animosity between the spouses.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}}\n\nBy the end of 1071, Matilda had left her husband and returned to Tuscany.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} Matilda's bold decision to repudiate her husband came at a cost, but ensured her independence. Beatrice started preparing Matilda for rule by holding court jointly with her{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} and, eventually, encouraging her to issue charters on her own as countess (''comitissa'') and duchess (''ducatrix'').{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}}\n\nGodfrey fiercely protested the separation and demanded that Matilda come back to him, which she repeatedly refused.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} The Duke descended into Italy in 1072, determined to enforce the marriage.{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}}{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} He sought the help of both Matilda's mother and her ally, the newly elected [[Pope Gregory VII]], promising military aid to the latter.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} Matilda's resolution was unshakable,{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=43}} and Godfrey returned to Lorraine alone,{{sfn|Villalon|2003|p=361}} losing all hope by 1074. Rather than supporting the Pope as promised, Godfrey turned his attention to imperial affairs. Meanwhile, the conflict later known as the [[Investiture Controversy]] was brewing between Gregory and Henry, with both men claiming the right to appoint bishops and abbots within the Empire. Matilda and Godfrey soon found themselves on opposing sides of the dispute, leading to a further detoriation of their difficult relationship. German chroniclers, writing of the [[Synod of Worms|synod held at Worms]] in January 1076, even suggested that Godfrey inspired Henry's allegation of a licentious affair between Gregory and Matilda.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=44}}<!--- \"Matilda would finally gain her vengeance at the Council of Piacenza...\"--->\n\n== Widowhood ==\n\nMatilda became a widow on 26 February 1076. Godfrey the Hunchback was assassinated in Flanders while \"[[excretion|answering the call of nature]]\".  Having been accused of adultery with the Pope the previous month, Matilda was suspected of ordering her estranged husband's death.  She could not have known about the proceedings at the Synod of Worms at the time, however, since the news took three months to reach the Pope himself, and it is more likely that Godfrey was killed at the instigation of an enemy nearer to him. Within two months, Beatrice was dead as well. Matilda's power was considerably augmented by these deaths; she was now the undisputed heir of all her parents' [[allodial land]]s. Her inheritance would have been threatened had Godfrey survived her mother, but she now enjoyed the privileged status of a widow. It seemed unlikely, however, that Henry would formally invest her with the margraviate.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=65}}\n\nBetween 1076 and 1080, Matilda travelled to Lorraine to lay claim to her husband's estate in [[Verdun]], which he had willed (along with the rest of his patrimony) to his sister [[Ida of Lorraine|Ida]]'s son, [[Godfrey of Bouillon]].{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=67}} Godfrey of Bouillon also disputed her right to [[Stenay]] and [[Mosay]], which her mother had received as [[dowry]]. The quarrel between aunt and nephew over the episcopal county of Verdun was eventually settled by [[Theoderic of Verdun|Theoderic]], [[Bishop of Verdun]], who enjoyed the right to nominate the counts. He easily found in favor of Margravine Matilda, as such verdict happened to please both Pope Gregory and King Henry. Matilda then proceeded to [[Feoffment|enfeoff]] Verdun to her husband's pro-reform cousin, [[Albert III, Count of Namur|Albert III of Namur]].{{sfn|Healey|2013|p=55-56}} The deep animosity between Matilda and her nephew is thought to have prevented her from travelling to [[Jerusalem]] during the [[First Crusade]], led by him in the late 1090s.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=164}}\n\n==Investiture Controversy==\n{{main|Walk to Canossa}}\n[[File:Vatican Codex 4922 Matilda.jpg|thumb|right|Miniature of Matilda from the frontispiece of [[Donizo]]\u2019s ''Vita Mathildis'' (Codex Vat. Lat. 4922, fol. 7v.). Matilda is depicted seated. On her right, Donizo is presenting her with a copy of the ''Vita Mathildis'', on her left is a man with a sword (possibly her man-at-arms). The script underneath reads: ''Mathildis lucens, precor hoc cape cara volumen'' (Resplendent Matilda, please accept this book, oh you dear one.)]]\n\nThe disagreement between Pope Gregory VII and King Henry IV culminated in the aftermath of the Synod of Worms in February 1076. Gregory declared Henry [[excommunicated]], releasing all his subjects from allegiance to him and providing the perfect reason for rebellion against his rule.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=65}} Insubordinate southern German princes gathered in [[Trebur]], awaiting the Pope. Matilda's first military endeavor, as well as the first major task altogether as ruler, turned out to be protecting the Pope during his perilous journey north. Gregory could rely on nobody else; as the sole heir to the Attonid patrimony, Matilda controlled all the Apennine [[mountain pass|passes]] and nearly all the rest that connected [[central Italy]] to the [[northern Italy|north]]. The Lombard bishops, who were also excommunicated for taking part in the synod and whose sees bordered Matilda's domain, were keen to capture Gregory. Gregory was aware of the danger, and recorded that all his advisors except Matilda counselled him against travelling to Trebur.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=68}}\n\nHenry had other plans, however. He decided to descend into Italy and intercept Gregory, who was thus delayed. The German dukes held a council by themselves and informed the King that he had to submit to the Pope or be replaced. Henry's predecessors dealt easily with troublesome pontiffs - they simply deposed them, and the excommunicated Lombard bishops rejoiced at this prospect. When Matilda heard about Henry's approach, she urged Gregory to take refuge in the [[Castle of Canossa]], her family's eponymous stronghold. Gregory took her advice. It soon became clear that the intention behind Henry's [[walk to Canossa]] was to show [[penance]]. By 25 January 1077, the King stood barefoot in the snow before the gates of Matilda's castle, accompanied by his mother-in-law, Margravine [[Adelaide of Susa]]. He remained there, humbled, until 28 January, when Matilda convinced the Pope to see him. Matilda and Adelaide brokered a deal between the men.<ref>[https://storicamente.org/creber-women-canossa Creber, \u2018Women at Canossa'.]</ref> Henry was taken back into the Church, with the margravines acting as sponsors and formally swearing to the agreement.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=70}}\n\nIn 1079, Matilda gave the Pope all her domains, in open defiance of Henry IV's claims both as the overlord of some of those domains, and as her close relative. Two years later the fortunes of Papacy and Empire turned again: in 1080 Henry IV summoned a council in [[Brixen]], which deposed Gregory VII. The following year the Emperor decided to travel again to Italy to reinstate his overlordship over his territories. He also declared Matilda, on account of her 1079 donation to the Church, forfeit and be banned from the Empire; although this wasn't enough to eliminate her as a source of trouble, for she retained substantial [[allodial]] holdings. On 15 October 1080 near [[Volta Mantovana]] the Imperial troops (with Guibert of Ravenna as the newly elected [[Antipope Clement III]]) defeated the troops loyal to Gregory VII and controlled by Matilda. This was the first serious military defeat of Matilda (Battle of Volta Mantovana).<ref>Paolo Golinelli: ''Sant\u2019Anselmo, Mantova e la lotta per le investiture'', 1987.</ref>\n\nMatilda, however, didn't surrender. While Gregory VII was forced into exile, she, retaining control over all the western passes in the Apennines, could force Henry IV to approach Rome via [[Ravenna]]; even with this route open, the Emperor would find it hard to besiege Rome with a hostile territory at his back. In December 1080 the citizens of Lucca, then the capital of Tuscany, had revolted and driven out her ally Bishop [[Anselm of Lucca|Anselm]]. She is believed to have commissioned the renowned [[Ponte della Maddalena]] where the [[Via Francigena]] crosses the river [[Serchio]] at [[Borgo a Mozzano]] just north of [[Lucca]].\n\nMatilda remained Pope Gregory VII's chief intermediary for communication with northern Europe even as he lost control of Rome and was holed up in the [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. After Henry caught hold of the Pope's seal, Matilda wrote to supporters in Germany only to trust papal messages that came through her.\n\nHenry IV's control of Rome enabled him to enthrone Antipope Clement III, who, in turn, crowned him Emperor. After this, Henry IV returned to Germany, leaving it to his allies to attempt Matilda's dispossession. These attempts floundered after Matilda (with help of the city of [[Bologna]]) defeated them at [[Bomporto|Sorbara]] near [[Modena]] on 2 July 1084.\n\nGregory VII died in 1085, and Matilda's forces, with those of Prince [[Jordan I of Capua]] (her off and on again enemy), took to the field in support of a new pope, [[Pope Victor III|Victor III]]. In 1087, Matilda led an expedition to Rome in an attempt to install Victor, but the strength of the imperial counterattack soon convinced the pope to withdraw from the city.\n\n==Second marriage==\n\nIn 1088 Matilda was facing a new attempt at invasion by Henry IV, and decided to pre-empt it by means of a political marriage. In 1089 Matilda (in her early forties) married [[Welf II, Duke of Bavaria|Welf V]], who was probably fifteen to seventeen years old.{{sfn|Hay|2008|p=124-129}} Welf was heir to the Duchy of Bavaria. He was also a member of the [[House of Welf|Welf]] dynasty: the Welfs/Guelphs were important papal supporters from the eleventh to the fifteenth centuries in their conflict with the German emperors (see [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]). Matilda and Welf's wedding was part of a network of alliances approved by the new pope, [[Pope Urban II|Urban II]], in order to effectively counter Henry IV.\n\n[[Cosmas of Prague]] (writing in the early twelfth century), included a letter in his ''Chronica Boemorum'', which he claimed that Matilda sent to her future husband, but which is now thought to be spurious:<ref>W. Goez and E.

The third day, Matilda appeared naked on a table especially prepared on sawhorses, and told him that ''everything is in front of you and there is no hidden malice''. But the Duke was dumbfounded; Matilda, furious, slapped him and spat in his face, taunting him: ''Get out of here, monster, you don't deserve our kingdom, you vile thing, viler than a worm or a rotten seaweed, don't let me see you again, or you'll die a miserable death...''.<ref>Cosmas of Prague, ''Chronica Boemorum'', II, ch.32, in \nB.

This forced Henry to return to Italy, where he chased Matilda into the mountains. He was humbled before Canossa, this time in a military defeat in October 1092, from which his influence in Italy never recovered.{{sfn|Eads|2010|p=23-68}}\n\n==The final victory against Henry IV==\n[[Image:Matilde di Canossa - signature.jpg|thumb|280px|Matilda's signature (\"Matilda, Dei gratia si quid est\"), quite tremulous due to her old age. ''Notitia Confirmationis (Prato, June 1107), Archivio Storico Diocesano of Lucca, Diplomatico Arcivescovile, perg. ++ I29'']]\n\nAfter several victories, including one against the [[Saxons]], Henry IV prepared in 1090 his third descent to Italy, in order to inflict the final defeat on the Church. His route was the usual one, [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]] and [[Verona]], along the border of Matilda's possessions, which began outside the cities' gates. The opposing armies would meet near Mantua. Matilda secured the loyalty of the townspeople by exempting them from some taxes, such as ''teloneo'' and ''ripatico'', and with the promise of Lombard franchise, entailing the rights to hunt, fish and cut wood on both banks of the [[Tartaro-Canalbianco-Po di Levante|Tartaro]] river.\n\nThe Mantua people stood by Matilda until the so-called \"Holy Thursday betrayal\", when the townspeople, won over by additional concessions from Henry, who had meanwhile besieged the city, sided with him. In 1092 Matilda escaped to the Reggiano [[Apennines]] and her most inexpugnable [[stronghold]]s. Since the times of [[Adalbert Atto]] the power of the Canossa family had been based on a network of castles, fortresses and fortified villages in the Val d'Enza, forming a complex polygonal defense that had always resisted all attack from the Apennines. After several bloody battles with mutual defeats, the powerful imperial army was surrounded.\n\nIn spite of its fearful power, the Imperial army was defeated by Matilda's liegemen.  Among them were small landowners and holders of fortified villages, which remained completely loyal to the Canossas even against the Holy Roman Emperor. Their familiarity with the territory, their quick communications and maneuvering to all the high places of the Val d'Enza gave them victory over Henry's might. It seems that Matilda personally participated, with a handful of chosen faithful men, to the battle, galvanizing the allies with the cry of Just War. The Imperial army was taken as in a vice in the meandering mountain creek. The overall import of Henry's rout was more than a military defeat. The Emperor realized it was impossible to penetrate those places, wholly different from the plains of the Po Valley or of Saxe. There he faced not boundaries drawn by the rivers of Central Europe, but steep trails, ravines, inaccessible places protecting Matilda's fortresses, and high [[tower house]]s, whence the defenders could unload on anyone approaching missiles of all kinds: spears, arrows, perhaps even boiling oil,<ref>At the time, the oil was obtained only by cold pressing of the olives; was therefore very rare and expensive.</ref> javelins, stones.\n\nAfter Matilda's victory several cities, such as [[Milan]], [[Cremona]], [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]] and [[Piacenza]], sided with her to free themselves of Imperial rule. In 1093 the Emperor's eldest son, Conrad, supported by the Pope, Matilda and a group of Lombard cities, was crowned King of Italy. Matilda freed and even gave refuge to Henry IV's wife, [[Eupraxia of Kiev]], who, at the urging of [[Pope Urban II]], made a public confession before the church [[Council of Piacenza]].{{sfn|Althoff|2006|p=213}} She accused her husband of imprisoning her in Verona{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=289}} after forcing her to participate in orgies, and, according to some later accounts, of attempting a [[black mass]] on her naked body.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=289ff.}}<ref>[http://bibliotekar.ru/polk-11/5.htm  ''Women of Ancient Rus (In Russian)''].</ref> Thanks to these scandals and division within the Imperial family, the prestige and power of Henry IV was increasingly weakened.\n\nIn 1095, Henry attempted to reverse his fortunes by seizing Matilda's castle of Nogara, but the countess's arrival at the head of an army forced him to retreat. In 1097, Henry withdrew from Italy altogether, after which Matilda reigned virtually unchallenged, although she did continue to launch military operations to restore her authority and regain control of the towns that had remained loyal to the emperor.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}  With the assistance of the French armies heading off to the [[First Crusade]], she was finally able to restore Urban to [[Rome]].{{sfn|Peters|1971|p=34}} She ordered or led successful expeditions against [[Ferrara]] (1101), [[Parma]] (1104), [[Prato]] (1107) and [[Mantua]] (1114).\n\n==Vice-Queen of Italy==\n\nHenry IV died now defeated in 1106; and after the deposition and death of Conrad (1101), his second son and new Holy Roman Emperor, Henry V, began to turn the fight against the Church and Italy. This time the attitude of Matilda against the imperial house had to change and she accepted the will of the Emperor. In 1111, on his way back to Germany, Henry V met her at the Castle of Bianello, near [[Reggio Emilia]]. Matilda confirmed him the inheritance rights over the fiefs that Henry IV disputed her, thus ending a fight that had lasted over twenty years. Henry V gave Matilda a new title: between 6 and 11 May 1111, the Emperor crowned Matilda as '''Imperial Vicar and Vice-Queen of Italy'''. This episode was the decisive step towards the [[Concordat of Worms]].\n\n==Foundation of churches==\nBy legend Matilda of Canossa is said to have founded one hundred churches.  Documents and local legend identify well over one hundred churches, monasteries, hospices, and bridges built or restored between the Alps and Rome by Matilda and her mother, Beatrice.   Today, churches and monasteries in the regions of Lombardy, Emilia Romagna, Tuscany, and even the Veneto attribute their foundation to her.  Built originally with hospices for travelers attached, these churches created a network that united the supporters of the Gregorian reform of the Roman Church which Matilda supported.<ref>Spike, 2015, Bologna</ref>  This network also provided protection for pilgrims, merchants and travelers assisting the Renaissance in culture that occurred in the centuries after Matilda's death.\n\nMost of these churches continue today to be vital centers of their communities.  They include rural churches located along the Po and Arno rivers, and their tributaries;  churches built along the Apennine mountain passes which Matilda's family controlled and those along the ancient highways of the via Emilia, the via Cassia, the via Aurelia and the via Francigena. Among these are monuments listed by UNESCO as among the heritage of our world, including churches in Florence, Ferrara, Lucca, Mantua, Modena, Pisa, Verona and Volterra.  Her cultural legacy is enormous throughout Northern Italy.<ref>Spike, 2015, Florence</ref>\n\nSome churches traditionally said to have been founded by Matilda include:\n\n* Sant'Andrea Apostolo of Vitriola, at [[Montefiorino]] ([[Province of Modena|Modena]]).<ref>[http://www.provincia.modena.it/page.asp?IDCategoria=305&IDSezione=7180&ID=69399 ''Provincia di Modena. Chiesa Sant\u2019Andrea Apostolo di Vitriola''] [retrieved 13 April 2015].</ref>\n* Sant'Anselmo, Pieve di Coriano (Province of Mantua).\n* San Giovanni Decollato, at [[Pescarolo ed Uniti]] ([[Province of Cremona|Cremona]]).<ref>[http://www.rup.cr.it/comune/view_monumenti.do?idComune=39 ''Comune di Pescarolo ed Uniti. Pieve di San Giovanni Decollato''] [retrieved 13 April 2015].</ref>\n* Santa Maria Assunta, at [[Monteveglio]] ([[Province of Bologna|Bologna]]).\n* San Martino in Barisano, near [[Forl\u00ec]].\n* San Zeno, at [[Cerea]] ([[Province of Verona|Verona]]).\n\nIt seems that even the foundation of the Church of San Salvaro in [[Legnago]] ([[Verona]]) was made by Matilda.\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Tomb of Countess Matilda of Tuscany by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.JPG|thumbnail|right|Matilda's tombstone at St. Peter's Basilica, by Bernini.]]\nMatilda's death from [[gout]] in 1115 at [[Bondeno di Roncore]] marked the end of an era in Italian politics. It is widely reported that she bequeathed her [[Allodial title|allodial property]] to the Pope. Unaccountably, however, this donation was never officially recognized in Rome and no record exists of it.  Henry V had promised some of the cities in her territory that he would appoint no successor after he deposed her. In her place the leading citizens of these cities took control, and the era of the [[Italian city-states|city-states in northern Italy]] began.\n\nMatilda was at first buried in the [[Polirone Abbey|Abbey of San Benedetto in Polirone]], located in the town of [[San Benedetto Po]]; then, in 1633, at the behest of [[Pope Urban VIII]], her body was moved to [[Rome]] and placed in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]]. Finally, in 1645 her remains were definitely deposited in the [[Vatican Hill|Vatican]], where they now lie in [[St. Peter's Basilica]]. She is one of only six women who have the honor of being buried in the Basilica, the others being Queen [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Christina of Sweden]], [[Maria Clementina Sobieska]] (wife of [[James Francis Edward Stuart]]), [[St. Petronilla]], [[Queen Charlotte of Cyprus]] and Agnesina Colonna Caetani.\n\nA [[Tomb of Countess Matilda of Tuscany|memorial tomb for Matilda]], commissioned by [[Pope Urban VIII]] and designed by [[Gianlorenzo Bernini]], marks her burial place in St Peter's and is often called the ''Honor and Glory of Italy''.\n\nAfter her death, an aura of legend came to surround Matilda. Church historians gave her the character of a semi-nun, solely dedicated to contemplation and faith. Some argue, instead, that she was a woman of strong passions of both spiritual and carnal nature (indicated by her supposed affairs with Popes Gregory VII and Urban II).{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Legacy==\n\nShe has been posited by some critics as the origin of the mysterious \"Matilda\" who appears to Dante gathering flowers in the [[Purgatorio#The Earthly Paradise|earthly paradise]] in Dante's ''[[Purgatorio (Dante)|Purgatorio]]''.{{sfn|Binyon|1978}}\n\nThe story of Matilda and Henry IV is the main plot device in [[Luigi Pirandello]]'s play ''[[Enrico IV]]''. She is the main historical character in [[Kathleen McGowan]]'s novel ''The Book of Love'' (Simon & Schuster, 2009).\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|title=Ancestors of Matilda of Tuscany\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Though its main focus is to support the migration of containers, allowing users to check-point and restore the current state of running processes and process groups. The tool can currently be used on [[X86 64|x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] systems and supports the following features:\n\n* [[Process (computing)|Processes]]: their [[Process group|hierarchy]], [[Process identifier|PIDs]], user and group authenticators ([[User identifier|UID]], [[Group identifier|GID]], [[Session ID|SID]], etc.), [[Capability-based security|system capabilities]], threads, and running and stopped states\n* Application memory: [[Memory-mapped file|memory-mapped]] files and [[shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]]\n* Open files\n* [[Pipeline (Unix)|Pipes]] and [[Named pipe|FIFOs]]\n* [[Unix domain sockets]]\n* [[Network socket]]s, including [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] sockets in ESTABLISHED state (see below)\n* [[ipcs|System V IPC]]\n* Timers\n* Signals\n* Terminals\n* Linux kernel-specific system calls: <code>[[inotify]]</code>, <code>[[signalfd]]</code>, <code>[[eventfd]]</code> and <code>[[epoll]]</code>\n\n{{As of|2013|September}}, no kernel patching is required because all of the required functionality has already been merged into the [[Linux kernel mainline]] since kernel version 3.11, which was released on September 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://criu.org/Installation#Linux_Kernel\n| title=Installation: Linux Kernel\n| quote=Linux kernel v3.11 or newer is required, with some specific options set}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.11#head-ff32cf9e48e9c426fd0bb9dcff21c19af1dd2fd3\n | title = Linux kernel 3.11, Section 1.5.

This was necessary for performing the live migration of containers (along with all their active network connections) between physical servers, the main scenario of using the checkpoint/restore feature in OpenVZ. To cope with this problem, a new feature, \"TCP repair mode\", was implemented. The feature was included in version 3.5 of the [[Linux kernel mainline]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://lwn.net/Articles/484472/\n| title=TCP connection repair\n| author=Pavel Emelyanov\n| date=2012-02-29\n| work=Linux Netdev Mailing List}}</ref> and provides users with additional means to disassemble and reconstruct TCP sockets without the necessity of exchanging network packets with the opposite side of the connection.\n\n== Similar projects ==\nThe following projects provide functionality similar to CRIU:\n* OpenVZ\n* DMTCP<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net\n | title=DMTCP: Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing\n | publisher=[[SourceForge]]}}</ref>\n* BLCR<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/CLaSS/research/BLCR/\n | title=Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) for LINUX\n | work=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n* Linux C/R<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://ckpt.wiki.kernel.org/\n | title=Linux Checkpoint/Restart\n | publisher=[[kernel.org]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://sslab.gtisc.gatech.edu/pages/kup.html\n| title=Rebootless Kernel Update and Validation\n| author=Sanidhya Kashyap}}\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/295986_d5059f95a78e451db5de3d54f711e45d.pdf\n| title=Linux Containers and the Future Cloud\n| author=Rami Rosen}}\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://criu.org/Comparison_to_other_CR_projects\n| title=Comparison to other CR projects\n| author=CRIU Team}} \n{{Linux}}\n{{Linux kernel}}\n\n[[Category:Linux software]]\n[[Category:Linux-only software]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=August 2014}}\n{{Infobox software\n| logo                   = CRIU.svg\n| name                   = CRIU\n| developer              = [[OpenVZ]] Team at [[Virtuozzo, Inc.|Virtuozzo]]\n| released               = {{Start date and age|df=yes|2012|07|23}}<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://lists.openvz.org/pipermail/criu/2012-July/003772.html\n | title=Checkpoint-restore tool v0.1\n | author=Pavel Emelyanov\n | date=2012-07-23}}</ref>\n| programming_language   = [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Assembly language|Assembler]]\n| operating system       = [[Linux]]\n| platform               = [[x86-64]], [[ARM architecture|ARM]], [[Power ISA]], [[IBM System/390]]\n| license                = [[GNU GPL]] v.2\n| website                = {{URL|https://criu.org/}}\n| genre                  = [[Application checkpointing]]\n}}\n\n'''Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace''' ('''CRIU''') (pronounced ''kree-oo'', {{IPA|/kr\u026a\u028a/}}), is a software tool for the [[Linux]] operating system.

However I'm less confident than the developers that it will all eventually work! So what I'm asking them to do is to wrap each piece of new code inside CONFIG_CHECKPOINT_RESTORE.

Though its main focus is to support the migration of containers, allowing users to check-point and restore the current state of running processes and process groups. The tool can currently be used on [[X86 64|x86-64]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] systems and supports the following features:\n\n* [[Process (computing)|Processes]]: their [[Process group|hierarchy]], [[Process identifier|PIDs]], user and group authenticators ([[User identifier|UID]], [[Group identifier|GID]], [[Session ID|SID]], etc.), [[Capability-based security|system capabilities]], threads, and running and stopped states\n* Application memory: [[Memory-mapped file|memory-mapped]] files and [[shared memory (interprocess communication)|shared memory]]\n* Open files\n* [[Pipeline (Unix)|Pipes]] and [[Named pipe|FIFOs]]\n* [[Unix domain sockets]]\n* [[Network socket]]s, including [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] sockets in ESTABLISHED state (see below)\n* [[ipcs|System V IPC]]\n* Timers\n* Signals\n* Terminals\n* Linux kernel-specific system calls: <code>[[inotify]]</code>, <code>[[signalfd]]</code>, <code>[[eventfd]]</code> and <code>[[epoll]]</code>\n\n{{As of|2013|September}}, no kernel patching is required because all of the required functionality has already been merged into the [[Linux kernel mainline]] since kernel version 3.11, which was released on September 2, 2013.<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://criu.org/Installation#Linux_Kernel\n| title=Installation: Linux Kernel\n| quote=Linux kernel v3.11 or newer is required, with some specific options set}}</ref><ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_3.11#head-ff32cf9e48e9c426fd0bb9dcff21c19af1dd2fd3\n | title = Linux kernel 3.11, Section 1.5.

This was necessary for performing the live migration of containers (along with all their active network connections) between physical servers, the main scenario of using the checkpoint/restore feature in OpenVZ. To cope with this problem, a new feature, \"TCP repair mode\", was implemented. The feature was included in version 3.5 of the [[Linux kernel mainline]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url=https://lwn.net/Articles/484472/\n| title=TCP connection repair\n| author=Pavel Emelyanov\n| date=2012-02-29\n| work=Linux Netdev Mailing List}}</ref> and provides users with additional means to disassemble and reconstruct TCP sockets without the necessity of exchanging network packets with the opposite side of the connection.\n\n== Similar projects ==\nThe following projects provide functionality similar to CRIU:\n* OpenVZ\n* DMTCP<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://dmtcp.sourceforge.net\n | title=DMTCP: Distributed MultiThreaded CheckPointing\n | publisher=[[SourceForge]]}}</ref>\n* BLCR<ref>{{cite web\n | url=http://crd.lbl.gov/departments/computer-science/CLaSS/research/BLCR/\n | title=Berkeley Lab Checkpoint/Restart (BLCR) for LINUX\n | work=[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]]}}</ref>\n* Linux C/R<ref>{{cite web\n | url=https://ckpt.wiki.kernel.org/\n | title=Linux Checkpoint/Restart\n | publisher=[[kernel.org]]}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading==\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://sslab.gtisc.gatech.edu/pages/kup.html\n| title=Rebootless Kernel Update and Validation\n| author=Sanidhya Kashyap}}\n* {{cite web\n| url=http://media.wix.com/ugd/295986_d5059f95a78e451db5de3d54f711e45d.pdf\n| title=Linux Containers and the Future Cloud\n| author=Rami Rosen}}\n* {{cite web\n| url=https://criu.org/Comparison_to_other_CR_projects\n| title=Comparison to other CR projects\n| author=CRIU Team}} \n{{Linux}}\n{{Linux kernel}}\n\n[[Category:Linux software]]\n[[Category:Linux-only software]]\n", "name_user": "LudwikSzymonJaniuk", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:Fix link to linux plumbers conf", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIU"}

Approached by the elderly and blind ninja [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], Murdock trains to hone his senses so he can 'see' using them, and also learns martial arts, with Stick wanting a soldier for his secret war. Stick leaves Murdock when he realizes that the boy wants a father figure, and Murdock eventually attends [[Columbia University]] School of Law. Meeting [[Foggy Nelson]], the two graduate and intern at the law firm Landman and Zack, but Murdock grows uncomfortable with the firm's lack of morals, just as he begins to take vigilante action against those he knows the law cannot prosecute. Murdock and Nelson decide to start their own law firm, and through their first client, [[Karen Page]] become embroiled in the politics of post [[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|Incident]] Hell's Kitchen. Murdock and his allies are able to take down crime lord [[#Wilson Fisk / Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]] using the law, and when Fisk escapes custody, Murdock defeats him as the vigilante, who is christened 'Daredevil' by the media.\n\nAt the end of May 2014, Cox was cast as Murdock.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> The idea of casting Cox as Daredevil came from Marvel's Chief Creative Officer [[Joe Quesada]] in 2012, before Marvel Studios gained the rights to the character from [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"Cox3\" /> Cox wanted to be involved with the series after reading the first two scripts for the series, telling his agent \"These are two of the best TV scripts I've read\".<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Season one showrunner [[Steven DeKnight]] stated that \"He's not super strong. He's not invulnerable. In every aspect, he's a man that's just pushed himself to the limits, he just has senses that are better than a normal human's. He is human.\" On the character's \"grey\" morals, he said, \"He's a lawyer by day, and he's taken this oath. But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does very violent things. I really liked the flawed heroes, the human heroes.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> The character's [[Catholicism]] plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling him \"one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe\".<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Cox, who was raised Catholic, found that helpful, saying, \"You grow up steeped in that. If you're in church, standing in front of the altar, you sort of automatically know how to respond. It all kicks in \u2013 you genuflect, you sit in the pew. I didn't have to pretend any of that.\"<ref name=\"IrishExaminer\" /> On how the name Daredevil is revealed in the series, DeKnight explained that \"We talked about, do we do one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil, but that didn't quite feel like our world. At one point we were going to have Ben Urich (Vondie Curtis-Hall) give him the name, but the timing wasn't right from where he's in his black outfit and then gets his suit, which is after Ben's untimely demise. There was something technically tricky of somebody actually saying the words, \"Hey you're some kind of Daredevil.\" The solution was to play that off-screen and then hit it in the paper that he's been given this name Daredevil.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock.<ref name=\"Gaertner\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=Matt Murdock disguised himself at night. One might say he also disguised himself during the day. Dark glasses or a mask always cover his eyes. The two looks have nothing in common on the face of it. However, consider that both are \"uniforms\" --practical, functional, and protective. Matt maintains a professional distance dressed as attorney. His vigilante uniform does much the same, although in disguise.  He does his best not to get involved with the people he helps or who help him, with limited degrees of success.|source= \u2014 Costume designer Stephanie Maslansky on the ideas behind Murdock's lawyer and vigilante costumes.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />}}\n\nMurdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, \"Because, obviously, he can't see his colors, but he has to know anything he chooses is going to coordinate with one another.\" Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that had to \"be correct for this current, modern date and it also had to pay homage to what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nMurdock begins the season wearing a black costume (called the \"vigilante outfit\" by production), inspired by the one worn by the character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[List of Daredevil titles#One-shots and limited series|The Man Without Fear]]'', rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town. ... I went to army/navy stores. I went online. I looked at athletic clothing, compression clothing, military stuff and construction stuff....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that \"It's made out of a cotton mesh. Layers and layers of it. It has to really conform to his head, but at the same time, he had to be able to see through it.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit that Murdock gets at the end of the first season, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes as a reference to the creation of New York City. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], \"There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [and his stunt double] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left.\"<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" />\n\nTalking about why the traditional 'DD' doesn't appear on Murdock's red suit, and other difficulties with adapting the suit to live action, DeKnight explained that \"he got the suit before he got the name. We talked a lot about DD on the suit, which is one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom. It's a little wonky. His suit in the comics is very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty. There are some practical difficulties. The Daredevil outfit in the comics, his mask only covers half his nose. It doesn't come all the way down to the tip. We discovered when we were trying to design it that if you didn't bring it all the way down, you could clearly tell it was Charlie. Not only did we have the suspension of belief that nobody would know \"hey, that's Matt Murdock\" we also had the practical problem of it becoming almost impossible when it came to switching in and out our stunt double. So we had to make that adjustment.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=There was this issue of Daredevil, near the end of [writer-artist] Frank Miller's run. Our hero is fighting with a professional assassin named [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on a wire. The bad guy starts to fall; Daredevil catches him. He has him by the hand, high above the city....and then he decides to let him go. Daredevil drops him to his death\u2014or what he thinks is his death\u2014because he doesn't ever want this guy to kill again. I remember reading that when I was a kid and thinking, Oh my god. When we started working on our show, that scene from the comics kept coming up. We all thought, this is a hero who is one bad day away from permanently crossing a line.|source= \u2014 Steven S. DeKnight on the version of Daredevil that he wanted to create.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" />}}\n\nOn portraying the character, Cox said, \"There are so many aspects. There's the blindness and physicality. Making a show is about human emotion, conflict and turmoil. When meeting a man who's a lawyer by day and believes in law and justice and then a man by night is someone who takes the law into his own hands. He deals with battles dealing with that concept.\"<ref name=\"Cox2\" /> Elaborating on the difficulties of playing the character, Cox said, \"I put on a shirt but I can't look where the buttons are, because Daredevil wouldn't know where the buttons are, but I also can't fumble.\"<ref name=\"EW2015Preview\" /> Cox worked with blind consultant Joe Strechay,<ref name=\"CoxConsultant\" /> and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they would not look at or react to something unlike a blind person.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Cox later explained that, unlike the Marvel comic book character, his version of Daredevil would not be a \"man without fear\", saying \"Someone who does not have fear \u2013 literally does not experience fear \u2013 is not that interesting. The way I like to think about it is that he is a man with fear, but he on a daily basis decides to confront that fear and to overcome it. So the title of 'the man without fear' is almost a title that the public in his world gives him just because of what he does. But inside himself, he's very afraid at times. And he finds a way to confront those fears and punch through it.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Cox \"had to do a lot of gym work\" to change his physique to equal that of the more muscular character as drawn in the comics.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" />\n\nWith the introduction of [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] in season two, Loeb talked about how [[\u00c9lodie Yung]]'s portrayal of the character, with which \"you never quite know if Elektra's telling you the truth\", would affect Murdock, saying, \"Matt, who has this sort of ability to be a human lie detector, because he's emotionally attached to her, it skews his ability to be able to know whether or not she's telling the truth or he's being manipulated, or is she actually not manipulating him? That kind of interaction, and I think the natural emotion that was going on between Charlie and Elodie that we captured on film, added a great deal of spark to it.\"<ref name=\"LoebPunisherResponse\" /> Cox called Murdock's relationship with Elecktra \"the superhero version of the very toxic love relationship you have in your 20s, where you're on-again off-again for two years, and you never quite get over that person. Part of you is always with that one great true love you had, even though it was always doomed and it was never going to work.\" Ahead of the third season, Cox felt that after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', where Murdock is presumed dead, it would present Murdock \"with some pretty interesting options when he reengages with life. Will he reconnect with people? Will he find Foggy and let him know he's okay? Will he not? I'm very excited to find out what his game plan is going to be, once he gets his shit together.\"<ref name=\"CoxTHRAug2017\" />\n\n===Karen Page===\n{{further|Karen Page}}\n[[File:Deborah Ann Woll by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Deborah Ann Woll]]]]\n\nKaren Page (portrayed by [[Deborah Ann Woll]]) discovers corruption in her place of employment, Union Allied, and is subsequently framed for murder, and then subject of attempted murder, with Murdock and Nelson helping her with the former, and the vigilante with the latter. Joining Murdock and Nelson, Page is determined to take down the corruption in Hell's Kitchen, and works with reporter [[Ben Urich]] to expose Fisk. When Fisk's assistant James Wesley discovers their investigation, which lead to Fisk's beloved mother, Wesley kidnaps Page and attempts to blackmail her. Page kills Wesley with his own gun in self-defense and escapes, but becomes traumatized by the incident enough to sympathize Punisher's goals.\n\nWoll was cast as Page in July 2014.<ref name=\"Woll\" /> On creating the character of Karen Page, after portraying [[Jessica Hamby]] in ''[[True Blood]]'' from 2008\u201314, Woll said, \"I'm already starting to notice huge differences between the two characters ... I can feel myself go, 'Oh, if this was Jessica she would do this,' but wanting to kind of steer differently than that. It's always going to be me in some way. I think, as an actor, that's part of it.\"<ref name=\"WollQuote\" /> Woll had not previously read any Daredevil comics, and turned to her boyfriend who is \"a huge comic book fan\" for guidance. She also added that Page's backstory would be different than the one from the comics, saying, \"In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then towards the end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her both of those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit attracted to danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually looking for it, and she won't let her fear stop her from finding the truth.\"<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Woll does not watch the series, which helped in the second season where Page was unaware of Murdoch's role as Daredevil, as she never saw Cox acting as Daredevil in the costume.<ref name=\"WollNoWatching\" />\n\nMaslansky looked to Page's backstory within the show when designer her costumes, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\").<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Maslansky also said that \"Page embodies innocence and knowingness. We referenced the comic illustrations and updated them, then built her wardrobe with the same retro nod as for the other characters....Her look is body conscious and professional.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nExplaining why Page does not tell Murdock and Nelson that she has killed Wesley, DeKnight said, \"There's something that happened in Karen's past \u2014 we allude to it, Ben alludes to it \u2014 and when she grabs the gun she says, \"You think this is the first time I've ever shot somebody?\" That's a secret from her past that she doesn't want anyone to know. The fact that she shot him once, you can explain that as self-defense; but then she pretty much unloaded the gun into him. That crosses a bit of a line. The last thing she would want is for those two to be horrified by what she's done.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Foggy Nelson===\n{{further|Foggy Nelson}}\n[[File:Elden Henson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elden Henson]]]]\n\nFranklin \"Foggy\" Percy Nelson (portrayed by [[Elden Henson]]) met Matt Murdock at law school and became best friends with him. After interning together at Landman and Zack, Nelson and Murdock start their own law firm in Hell's Kitchen, where Nelson wants to fight for 'the little guy'. His friendship with Murdock falters after he discovers the latter's vigilante activities, but they become close again following their defeat of Fisk.\n\nHenson joined the cast as Nelson in June 2014,<ref name=\"Henson\" /> and in April 2015 he spoke of his excitement for the character's role in the series, saying \"I was really excited as I was getting the scripts and reading that Foggy wasn't just a useless sidekick. He's not just comic relief. I mean, he is some of those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters would have their own path and their own things that they're dealing with.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> Maslansky noted that \"In the original comics illustrations Foggy wears a bowtie and his color palette is lively. We updated his look but didn't stray from his overall distinctive style\u2014quirky but not flamboyant. He favors warm colors and printed shirts.  His ties are patterned with animals or objects.  Even his socks are patterned and colorful.  The audience may never see them, but the actor does. Foggy has one particular accessory that helps define his look, a vintage tie-bar w/ the letter 'F'. We imagine it was a gift from his father.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\n===James Wesley===\n{{further|James Wesley (comics)}}\nJames Wesley (portrayed by [[Toby Leonard Moore]]) is Wilson Fisk's right-hand man and friend who does a lot of his hands-on work. After discovering that Page met with Fisk's beloved mother while investigating Fisk, Wesley confronts Page in an attempt to blackmail her and is killed by Page with his own gun in self-defense.\n\nMoore was announced as cast in the role of Wesley in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Moore described Wesley as an \"interesting character to play, because in one moment he can be incredibly charming, and in the next, dastardly as all hell, manipulative and Machiavellian, but always loyal to Wilson Fisk.\"<ref name=\"MooreCBR\" /> Talking about the killing of Wesley by Page, and if it was due to carelessness on the behalf of the former, DeKnight said \"It was a moment of underestimating Karen Page. We always knew he was going to die; that was decided at the beginning of the season that Karen was going to kill Wesley at some point but the mechanics of \"how\" were tricky. It's not so much a moment of carelessness as it was underestimating Karen. He dies because Wilson Fisk is worried about him. That moment when Fisk calls him is the split-second distraction that allows Karen to grab the gun.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Ben Urich===\n{{further|Ben Urich}}\nBenjamin \"Ben\" Urich (portrayed by [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]) is an investigative journalist for the ''New York Bulletin'', struggling with the lack of interest in the crime pieces that made him successful during his youth, and with his sick wife for whom he can barely afford to keep in hospital or move to a retirement home. He agrees to work with Page in her investigation of Fisk, but after Fisk learns that Urich met with his mother while investigating him, he breaks into Urich's apartment and strangles him to death.\n\nCurtis-Hall joined the series as Urich in October 2015.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> The decision to kill off Urich, an iconic comic book character, was made by Marvel before DeKnight joined the show. He explained that Marvel \"really wanted to show that toward the end of the season because we knew we'd get some sympathy for Fisk, to have him do something truly terrible that would propel Matt into that final endgame in the confrontation with Fisk. And to let the audience know that the gloves were off: just because he was a beloved character in the comics, doesn't mean he's safe....Urich gets murdered because he committed the unforgivable sin in Fisk's mind: he went to Fisk's mother. The last thing you want to do with Fisk is at all involve, insult, drag through the mud the women in his life he loves. That will be a serious trigger for him.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Leland Owlsley===\n{{further|Owl (Marvel Comics)}}\nLeland Owlsley (portrayed by [[Bob Gunton]]) is an accountant who works for Fisk, controlling the money for all of Fisk's allies as well. Owlsley disapproves of Fisk's relationship with [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]], and he works with Madame Gao to have the former killed in an assassination attempt made to look like an attempt on Fisk. Though the attempt fails, Fisk is extremely angered by the event, and when he discovers that Owlsley has been taking Fisk's money for himself, Fisk throws Owlsley down an elevator shaft, killing him.\n\nGunton was added to the cast in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n\n===Vanessa Marianna-Fisk===\n{{further|Vanessa Fisk}}\n[[File:\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e8.png|thumb|upright|[[Ayelet Zurer]]]]\n\nVanessa Marianna-Fisk (portrayed by [[Ayelet Zurer]]) is an art gallery curator who catches the eye of Fisk, and is acceptive of his line of work. Growing close with Fisk, Marianna helps him come out to New York as an apparently legitimate businessman, and when Fisk's true dealings are revealed, she accepts his offer of marriage. When Fisk is defeated by Daredevil and imprisoned, Marianna leaves the country on her own. After Fisk makes a deal with the FBI to ensure Marianna would not be charged as an accessory for his crimes, she returns to New York and marries Fisk.\n\nZurer joined the cast as Marianna in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Clinical psychologist Dr. Andrea Letamendi noted that Marianna \"allows us to see the compassion Fisk has, and it's genuine that he's so loving and heartfelt and compassionate\u2014he has this sense of connection to humanity. It's so interesting to have that dynamic and that this incredibly intelligent, powerful woman brings it out in him.\"<ref name=\"CBRSep2015\" /> Maslansky looked to Marianna's backstory in the show, with the character coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn't go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Claire Temple===\n{{main|Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n[[File:Rosario Dawson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosario Dawson]]]]\n\nClaire Temple (portrayed by [[Rosario Dawson]]) is a nurse who helps Murdock when she finds him beaten and injured, and after he saves her from some Russians who are using her to get to him, she becomes his confidant and near-full-time nurse. The two have a falling out when Murdock explains that a relationship between the two would not work, but she still helps him on occasion when needed.\n\nRosario Dawson joined the cast in June 2014,<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /> and her role was revealed to be that of Temple in October of that year.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> The character is an amalgam of Temple and [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]].<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> DeKnight noted that the character was originally \"going to be the actual Night Nurse from the comics...we had her name in a script and it came back that it was possible [the feature side] were going to use her\" and \"had plans for her down the road,\" necessitating the team to use the more obscure comics character Claire Temple as her name.<ref name=\"DeKnightNightNurse\" /> Maslansky revealed that \"Claire Temple's look is effortless and casual; she exudes an unstudied sensuality. She wears slim boyfriend jeans and shirts that skim rather than hug the body. Her clothing might indicate a woman who has travelled or at least has an interest in cultures other than her own.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nDawson explained that \"[her] character is a normal person and she becomes more heroic in a way that she maybe didn't expect\",<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> and went on to state that \"She's not a love interest \u2013 she's this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation. She's the one who can be like, \"You're not really good at this.\" That makes it feel more real.\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> On her character's relationship to Murdock, Dawson said that \"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that's going to be able to see that transition for him. For her, she's someone who also throws herself into the fray and had made it her life mission to help, even if that means risking her own life. But she gets confronted with the question: {{em|How far will you go?}} What does it mean if you're helping someone who is maybe going to hurt other people?\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" />\n\n===Wilson Fisk / Kingpin===\n{{further|Kingpin (character)}}\n[[File:Vincent D'Onofrio TIFF 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vincent D'Onofrio]]]]\n\nWilson Fisk (portrayed by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) was abused alongside his mother by his father, until he killed him as a boy and his mother helped him cover it up. Fisk grew up wanting to make Hell's Kitchen a better place, where there are no people like his father, and planned to buy the entire neighborhood, demolish it, and build a new and better Hell's Kitchen. He received opposition from Murdock as both a lawyer and a vigilante, and began to lose the trust of his allies after he began seeing Marianna. His dealings are exposed to the FBI by a whistle-blower that Murdock protected, and when he attempts to escape custody he is defeated in combat by Murdock as Daredevil and incarcerated at Ryker's Island. During his incarceration, Wilson Fisk works to gain control of the inmates while being visited by his lawyer Benjamin Donovan. When Punisher is sent to Ryker's Island, Wilson Fisk manipulates Punisher into killing a rival inmate and later orchestrates Punisher's escape.\n\nIn season three, he cuts a deal with the FBI to become their informant in exchange for a house arrest deal at the Presidential Hotel and for Vanessa to no be incriminated for Wilson Fisk's crimes. When he starts swaying some of the FBI to his side including Benjamin Poindexter, Wilson Fisk took up the name of Kingpin. When Ray Nadeem did a posthumously testimony where he fought Daredevil and broke Dex's spine, Kingpin had no choice but to return to Ryker's Island in exchange that he doesn't harm Karen, Foggy, or anybody Matt knows as a way to keep the public from knowing that Vanessa orchestrated Ray's death.\n\nD'Onofrio, who was cast as Fisk in June 2014,<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> stated that he hoped his portrayal of Fisk was a new way to look at the character, and that it would be the definitive portrayal of the character.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal\" /> \"Our Fisk, he's a child and he's a monster,\" D'Onofrio said. \"Every move that he makes and everything that he does in our story comes from his foundation of morality inside himself.\"<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal2\" /> In December 2014, DeKnight detailed that \"Fisk has very many different aspects so it's not all, \"I want to conquer the city and make a lot of money\". In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love \u2013 our antagonist actually has a love story. That's the love story you're following, the one you're invested in, and seeing how that affects him and changes him.\" He also said that \"if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ... [he] really felt like the right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Concerning Fisk not being called Kingpin during the first season, like he is in the comics, DeKnight explained that \"I think there is a, dare I say, critical mass where things get a little bit silly. You know if in the last five minutes we went, \"Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!\" It's a little too much. Also there was no real natural way to get to Kingpin. It felt a little off. There is a point down the line to get there.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> Discussing Fisk's fighting style, compared to Daredevil's, series stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera said that, \"I feel like they're almost two sides to the same coin. They're both doing things for their city. And it's a tricky thing with their two characters. I think when you get the Fisk character to a certain point, it just becomes pure rage, and all thought process is out the window. ... The brutality is just relentless with him. When he gets into this mode, he just keeps going until he's done. And that's it. He will drive for you. That is the Kingpin, that is D'Onofrio. He's a very smooth, calculating individual, but when you bring the rage out in him, he's like a bulldozer.\"<ref name=\"Stunts\" /> Cole Jensen plays a young Wilson Fisk.<ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nMaslansky explained that \"Wilson Fisk has a specific look. His choices reflect the man he is and the man he's become. As with Matt Murdock's costumes, I was influenced by the comics with the same stipulation that they feel authentic and modern. We dressed Fisk in current style, embracing a slim silhouette.  It's classic and consistent.  His clothing was custom-made by a highly skilled tailor, Michael Andrews who's well versed in modern design details.\" Significant props used for Fisk in the series are his father's cufflinks, on which Maslansky said, \"[Fisk's father] would have bought them in the 1950s or '60s\u2014a mid-century design. We searched for the perfect vintage cufflinks.  We finally landed on a sterling silver pair with interesting negative space. We knew from reading ahead we'd need many duplicates. I redesigned them, adding more detail\u2014a tiger's eye stone and a portion of it cast in gold. They retained a mid-century look, enhanced to become unique in the world.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\n===Frank Castle / Punisher===\n{{further|Punisher}}\n[[File:Crop of Jon Bernthal by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jon Bernthal]]]]\n\nFrancis \"Frank\" Castle Sr. (portrayed by [[Jon Bernthal]]) is a vigilante who aims to clean up Hell's Kitchen by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results,<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /> which earns him the name 'The Punisher' from the media.<ref name=\"ColliderS2Review\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Marvel announced that Jon Bernthal was cast as Castle for the second season.<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /><ref name=\"Yung\" /> DeKnight and the writers had discussed introducing the character in a [[post-credits scene]] during the first-season finale, but were unable due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one. The scene would have seen Owlsley escape rather than be killed by Fisk, only to be killed by Castle, whose face would not be revealed, but whose iconic skull insignia would have been featured. DeKnight felt that this \"was the right decision. I think there's a better, more organic way to introduce him to the world.\"<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" /> DeKnight also noted that this version of Punisher would be \"completely the Marvel version,\" as previous portrayals did not appear under the [[Marvel Studios]] / [[Marvel Television]] banner. He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as \"graphically violent\" as in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''.<ref name=\"DeKnightPunisher\" /> Goddard felt that television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are \"able to do things on the small screen that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Season two showrunners [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez talked about creating their version of the character following the film versions, with Ramirez saying, \"even if you know the character, you've never seen him like this. That was the big thing we wanted. There are four movies, eight hours and four actors. We've seen this guy. We think we know who he is, but even we learned that he's so much more.\" Petrie said, \"We hope to make people forget what they've seen before, whether they've loved it or not.\"<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherJan2016\" />\n\nPetrie stated that [[Son of Sam]], [[Bernard Goetz]], and [[Travis Bickle]] from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' were influences on the character,<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherJan2016\" /> as well as current events, saying, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\" He added that the writers hoped to \"stir the pot\" and \"get people to think\" when watching Punisher. Bernthal added that \"This character has resonated with law enforcement and military....and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> In order to get in the correct mindset to portray Castle, Bernthal trained with military members, along with receiving weapon training. Bernthal also \"had to put myself in as dark of place as possible\" to connect with \"the emptiness inside\" Castle, and isolate himself, including walking across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to get to set \"to shed any outside influence of joy.\"<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" />\n\nRosario Dawson, who felt Matt Murdock behaved like the Punisher in season one, felt it would \"be really interesting to see how [the writers] differentiate\" the two in the second season.<ref name=\"DawsonPunisher\" /> Describing the character, Bernthal said, \"As a man who put his [life] on the line and really went through the ultimate sacrifice for this country in his involvement in the military. He's a guy who brought the war home with him [in] the worst possible way. There are a lot of iterations of this character and in all of them it's a man who's gone through this unbelievable trauma and what's interesting about our take on him is how this trauma reshapes his own philosophy.\"<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" /> Bernthal also talked about the character's 'superpowers', saying, \"If I got one thing from the comics, I think, as far as superpowers... his superpower is his rage. His superpower is that he is not going to quit, and he is going to go forward no matter what. And that's as human and grounded a quality as I think as this sort of genre could have\".<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" />\n\n===Elektra Natchios===\n{{further|Elektra (comics)}}\n[[File:Elodie Yung by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[\u00c9lodie Yung]]]]\n\nElektra Natchios (portrayed by [[\u00c9lodie Yung]]) is a mysterious and dangerous woman from Murdock's past.<ref name=\"Yung\" />\n\nIn July 2015, Marvel announced that Yung had been cast as Elektra for the second season, after the character had initially been referred to in the first season.<ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"GlennS2\" /> Describing Elektra's effect on Murdock, Petrie called her \"the best bad girlfriend you can possibly have.

He's both repulsed and deeply drawn to that.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Talking about the character, Yung said, \"What I tried to capture by reading the comics is I wanted to keep the coldness that Elektra has. And I had conversations at length with Doug [Petrie] and Marco [Ramirez]. We think Elektra is kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her. It's like a chess game, and what motivates her is what she wants.

Approached by the elderly and blind ninja [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], Murdock trains to hone his senses so he can 'see' using them, and also learns martial arts, with Stick wanting a soldier for his secret war. Stick leaves Murdock when he realizes that the boy wants a father figure, and Murdock eventually attends [[Columbia University]] School of Law. Meeting [[Foggy Nelson]], the two graduate and intern at the law firm Landman and Zack, but Murdock grows uncomfortable with the firm's lack of morals, just as he begins to take vigilante action against those he knows the law cannot prosecute. Murdock and Nelson decide to start their own law firm, and through their first client, [[Karen Page]] become embroiled in the politics of post [[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|Incident]] Hell's Kitchen. Murdock and his allies are able to take down crime lord [[#Wilson Fisk / Kingpin|Wilson Fisk]] using the law, and when Fisk escapes custody, Murdock defeats him as the vigilante, who is christened 'Daredevil' by the media.\n\nAt the end of May 2014, Cox was cast as Murdock.<ref name=\"Cox\" /> The idea of casting Cox as Daredevil came from Marvel's Chief Creative Officer [[Joe Quesada]] in 2012, before Marvel Studios gained the rights to the character from [[20th Century Fox]].<ref name=\"Cox3\" /> Cox wanted to be involved with the series after reading the first two scripts for the series, telling his agent \"These are two of the best TV scripts I've read\".<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Season one showrunner [[Steven DeKnight]] stated that \"He's not super strong. He's not invulnerable. In every aspect, he's a man that's just pushed himself to the limits, he just has senses that are better than a normal human's. He is human.\" On the character's \"grey\" morals, he said, \"He's a lawyer by day, and he's taken this oath. But every night he breaks that oath, and goes out and does very violent things. I really liked the flawed heroes, the human heroes.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> The character's [[Catholicism]] plays a large role in the series, with DeKnight calling him \"one of the most, if not the most, religious characters in the Marvel Universe\".<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Cox, who was raised Catholic, found that helpful, saying, \"You grow up steeped in that. If you're in church, standing in front of the altar, you sort of automatically know how to respond. It all kicks in \u2013 you genuflect, you sit in the pew. I didn't have to pretend any of that.\"<ref name=\"IrishExaminer\" /> On how the name Daredevil is revealed in the series, DeKnight explained that \"We talked about, do we do one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil, but that didn't quite feel like our world. At one point we were going to have Ben Urich (Vondie Curtis-Hall) give him the name, but the timing wasn't right from where he's in his black outfit and then gets his suit, which is after Ben's untimely demise. There was something technically tricky of somebody actually saying the words, \"Hey you're some kind of Daredevil.\" The solution was to play that off-screen and then hit it in the paper that he's been given this name Daredevil.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> Skylar Gaertner plays a young Matt Murdock.<ref name=\"Gaertner\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|quote=Matt Murdock disguised himself at night. One might say he also disguised himself during the day. Dark glasses or a mask always cover his eyes. The two looks have nothing in common on the face of it. However, consider that both are \"uniforms\" --practical, functional, and protective. Matt maintains a professional distance dressed as attorney. His vigilante uniform does much the same, although in disguise.  He does his best not to get involved with the people he helps or who help him, with limited degrees of success.|source= \u2014 Costume designer Stephanie Maslansky on the ideas behind Murdock's lawyer and vigilante costumes.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />}}\n\nMurdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, \"Because, obviously, he can't see his colors, but he has to know anything he chooses is going to coordinate with one another.\" Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that had to \"be correct for this current, modern date and it also had to pay homage to what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nMurdock begins the season wearing a black costume (called the \"vigilante outfit\" by production), inspired by the one worn by the character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[List of Daredevil titles#One-shots and limited series|The Man Without Fear]]'', rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town. ... I went to army/navy stores. I went online. I looked at athletic clothing, compression clothing, military stuff and construction stuff....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that \"It's made out of a cotton mesh. Layers and layers of it. It has to really conform to his head, but at the same time, he had to be able to see through it.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit that Murdock gets at the end of the first season, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes as a reference to the creation of New York City. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor's face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], \"There was a discussion early in the process, because Charlie Cox [and his stunt double] Chris Brewster are both right handed, of having the billy clubs holster on the right leg. But Daredevil wears those billy clubs on the left hand side. So while it would have been easier to place the holster on the right we all felt that we had to keep to the classic profile and keep them on the left.\"<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" />\n\nTalking about why the traditional 'DD' doesn't appear on Murdock's red suit, and other difficulties with adapting the suit to live action, DeKnight explained that \"he got the suit before he got the name. We talked a lot about DD on the suit, which is one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom. It's a little wonky. His suit in the comics is very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty. There are some practical difficulties. The Daredevil outfit in the comics, his mask only covers half his nose. It doesn't come all the way down to the tip. We discovered when we were trying to design it that if you didn't bring it all the way down, you could clearly tell it was Charlie. Not only did we have the suspension of belief that nobody would know \"hey, that's Matt Murdock\" we also had the practical problem of it becoming almost impossible when it came to switching in and out our stunt double. So we had to make that adjustment.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=left|quote=There was this issue of Daredevil, near the end of [writer-artist] Frank Miller's run. Our hero is fighting with a professional assassin named [[Bullseye (comics)|Bullseye]], on a wire. The bad guy starts to fall; Daredevil catches him. He has him by the hand, high above the city....and then he decides to let him go. Daredevil drops him to his death\u2014or what he thinks is his death\u2014because he doesn't ever want this guy to kill again. I remember reading that when I was a kid and thinking, Oh my god. When we started working on our show, that scene from the comics kept coming up. We all thought, this is a hero who is one bad day away from permanently crossing a line.|source= \u2014 Steven S. DeKnight on the version of Daredevil that he wanted to create.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" />}}\n\nOn portraying the character, Cox said, \"There are so many aspects. There's the blindness and physicality. Making a show is about human emotion, conflict and turmoil. When meeting a man who's a lawyer by day and believes in law and justice and then a man by night is someone who takes the law into his own hands. He deals with battles dealing with that concept.\"<ref name=\"Cox2\" /> Elaborating on the difficulties of playing the character, Cox said, \"I put on a shirt but I can't look where the buttons are, because Daredevil wouldn't know where the buttons are, but I also can't fumble.\"<ref name=\"EW2015Preview\" /> Cox worked with blind consultant Joe Strechay,<ref name=\"CoxConsultant\" /> and was conscious of what his eyes were doing at all times, to ensure they would not look at or react to something unlike a blind person.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Cox later explained that, unlike the Marvel comic book character, his version of Daredevil would not be a \"man without fear\", saying \"Someone who does not have fear \u2013 literally does not experience fear \u2013 is not that interesting. The way I like to think about it is that he is a man with fear, but he on a daily basis decides to confront that fear and to overcome it. So the title of 'the man without fear' is almost a title that the public in his world gives him just because of what he does. But inside himself, he's very afraid at times. And he finds a way to confront those fears and punch through it.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Cox \"had to do a lot of gym work\" to change his physique to equal that of the more muscular character as drawn in the comics.<ref name=\"NZHerald\" />\n\nWith the introduction of [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]] in season two, Loeb talked about how [[\u00c9lodie Yung]]'s portrayal of the character, with which \"you never quite know if Elektra's telling you the truth\", would affect Murdock, saying, \"Matt, who has this sort of ability to be a human lie detector, because he's emotionally attached to her, it skews his ability to be able to know whether or not she's telling the truth or he's being manipulated, or is she actually not manipulating him? That kind of interaction, and I think the natural emotion that was going on between Charlie and Elodie that we captured on film, added a great deal of spark to it.\"<ref name=\"LoebPunisherResponse\" /> Cox called Murdock's relationship with Elecktra \"the superhero version of the very toxic love relationship you have in your 20s, where you're on-again off-again for two years, and you never quite get over that person. Part of you is always with that one great true love you had, even though it was always doomed and it was never going to work.\" Ahead of the third season, Cox felt that after the events of ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'', where Murdock is presumed dead, it would present Murdock \"with some pretty interesting options when he reengages with life.

Joining Murdock and Nelson, Page is determined to take down the corruption in Hell's Kitchen, and works with reporter [[Ben Urich]] to expose Fisk. When Fisk's assistant James Wesley discovers their investigation, which lead to Fisk's beloved mother, Wesley kidnaps Page and attempts to blackmail her. Page kills Wesley with his own gun in self-defense and escapes, but becomes traumatized by the incident enough to sympathize Punisher's goals.\n\nWoll was cast as Page in July 2014.<ref name=\"Woll\" /> On creating the character of Karen Page, after portraying [[Jessica Hamby]] in ''[[True Blood]]'' from 2008\u201314, Woll said, \"I'm already starting to notice huge differences between the two characters ... I can feel myself go, 'Oh, if this was Jessica she would do this,' but wanting to kind of steer differently than that. It's always going to be me in some way. I think, as an actor, that's part of it.\"<ref name=\"WollQuote\" /> Woll had not previously read any Daredevil comics, and turned to her boyfriend who is \"a huge comic book fan\" for guidance. She also added that Page's backstory would be different than the one from the comics, saying, \"In the comic books, in the beginning Karen is very innocent, and then towards the end she's really swung a full 180, she's in a lot of trouble, so I wanted to find a way to make her both of those things at the same time. Can she be a really wonderful, kind person who is a little bit attracted to danger? She's not just always getting into trouble because 'Oh, silly woman!' Karen is actually looking for it, and she won't let her fear stop her from finding the truth.\"<ref name=\"NZHerald\" /> Woll does not watch the series, which helped in the second season where Page was unaware of Murdoch's role as Daredevil, as she never saw Cox acting as Daredevil in the costume.<ref name=\"WollNoWatching\" />\n\nMaslansky looked to Page's backstory within the show when designer her costumes, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\").<ref name=\"Fashionista\" /> Maslansky also said that \"Page embodies innocence and knowingness. We referenced the comic illustrations and updated them, then built her wardrobe with the same retro nod as for the other characters....Her look is body conscious and professional.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nExplaining why Page does not tell Murdock and Nelson that she has killed Wesley, DeKnight said, \"There's something that happened in Karen's past \u2014 we allude to it, Ben alludes to it \u2014 and when she grabs the gun she says, \"You think this is the first time I've ever shot somebody?\" That's a secret from her past that she doesn't want anyone to know. The fact that she shot him once, you can explain that as self-defense; but then she pretty much unloaded the gun into him. That crosses a bit of a line. The last thing she would want is for those two to be horrified by what she's done.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Foggy Nelson===\n{{further|Foggy Nelson}}\n[[File:Elden Henson by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Elden Henson]]]]\n\nFranklin \"Foggy\" Percy Nelson (portrayed by [[Elden Henson]]) met Matt Murdock at law school and became best friends with him. After interning together at Landman and Zack, Nelson and Murdock start their own law firm in Hell's Kitchen, where Nelson wants to fight for 'the little guy'. His friendship with Murdock falters after he discovers the latter's vigilante activities, but they become close again following their defeat of Fisk.\n\nHenson joined the cast as Nelson in June 2014,<ref name=\"Henson\" /> and in April 2015 he spoke of his excitement for the character's role in the series, saying \"I was really excited as I was getting the scripts and reading that Foggy wasn't just a useless sidekick. He's not just comic relief. I mean, he is some of those things. He does have comic relief, but it was exciting to know that these other characters would have their own path and their own things that they're dealing with.\"<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> Maslansky noted that \"In the original comics illustrations Foggy wears a bowtie and his color palette is lively. We updated his look but didn't stray from his overall distinctive style\u2014quirky but not flamboyant. He favors warm colors and printed shirts.  His ties are patterned with animals or objects.  Even his socks are patterned and colorful.  The audience may never see them, but the actor does. Foggy has one particular accessory that helps define his look, a vintage tie-bar w/ the letter 'F'. We imagine it was a gift from his father.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\n===James Wesley===\n{{further|James Wesley (comics)}}\nJames Wesley (portrayed by [[Toby Leonard Moore]]) is Wilson Fisk's right-hand man and friend who does a lot of his hands-on work. After discovering that Page met with Fisk's beloved mother while investigating Fisk, Wesley confronts Page in an attempt to blackmail her and is killed by Page with his own gun in self-defense.\n\nMoore was announced as cast in the role of Wesley in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Moore described Wesley as an \"interesting character to play, because in one moment he can be incredibly charming, and in the next, dastardly as all hell, manipulative and Machiavellian, but always loyal to Wilson Fisk.\"<ref name=\"MooreCBR\" /> Talking about the killing of Wesley by Page, and if it was due to carelessness on the behalf of the former, DeKnight said \"It was a moment of underestimating Karen Page. We always knew he was going to die; that was decided at the beginning of the season that Karen was going to kill Wesley at some point but the mechanics of \"how\" were tricky. It's not so much a moment of carelessness as it was underestimating Karen. He dies because Wilson Fisk is worried about him. That moment when Fisk calls him is the split-second distraction that allows Karen to grab the gun.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Ben Urich===\n{{further|Ben Urich}}\nBenjamin \"Ben\" Urich (portrayed by [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]) is an investigative journalist for the ''New York Bulletin'', struggling with the lack of interest in the crime pieces that made him successful during his youth, and with his sick wife for whom he can barely afford to keep in hospital or move to a retirement home. He agrees to work with Page in her investigation of Fisk, but after Fisk learns that Urich met with his mother while investigating him, he breaks into Urich's apartment and strangles him to death.\n\nCurtis-Hall joined the series as Urich in October 2015.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> The decision to kill off Urich, an iconic comic book character, was made by Marvel before DeKnight joined the show. He explained that Marvel \"really wanted to show that toward the end of the season because we knew we'd get some sympathy for Fisk, to have him do something truly terrible that would propel Matt into that final endgame in the confrontation with Fisk. And to let the audience know that the gloves were off: just because he was a beloved character in the comics, doesn't mean he's safe....Urich gets murdered because he committed the unforgivable sin in Fisk's mind: he went to Fisk's mother. The last thing you want to do with Fisk is at all involve, insult, drag through the mud the women in his life he loves. That will be a serious trigger for him.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Leland Owlsley===\n{{further|Owl (Marvel Comics)}}\nLeland Owlsley (portrayed by [[Bob Gunton]]) is an accountant who works for Fisk, controlling the money for all of Fisk's allies as well. Owlsley disapproves of Fisk's relationship with [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]], and he works with Madame Gao to have the former killed in an assassination attempt made to look like an attempt on Fisk. Though the attempt fails, Fisk is extremely angered by the event, and when he discovers that Owlsley has been taking Fisk's money for himself, Fisk throws Owlsley down an elevator shaft, killing him.\n\nGunton was added to the cast in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" />\n\n===Vanessa Marianna-Fisk===\n{{further|Vanessa Fisk}}\n[[File:\u05d0\u05d9\u05d9\u05dc\u05ea \u05d6\u05d5\u05e8\u05e8.png|thumb|upright|[[Ayelet Zurer]]]]\n\nVanessa Marianna-Fisk (portrayed by [[Ayelet Zurer]]) is an art gallery curator who catches the eye of Fisk, and is acceptive of his line of work. Growing close with Fisk, Marianna helps him come out to New York as an apparently legitimate businessman, and when Fisk's true dealings are revealed, she accepts his offer of marriage. When Fisk is defeated by Daredevil and imprisoned, Marianna leaves the country on her own. After Fisk makes a deal with the FBI to ensure Marianna would not be charged as an accessory for his crimes, she returns to New York and marries Fisk.\n\nZurer joined the cast as Marianna in October 2014.<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> Clinical psychologist Dr. Andrea Letamendi noted that Marianna \"allows us to see the compassion Fisk has, and it's genuine that he's so loving and heartfelt and compassionate\u2014he has this sense of connection to humanity. It's so interesting to have that dynamic and that this incredibly intelligent, powerful woman brings it out in him.\"<ref name=\"CBRSep2015\" /> Maslansky looked to Marianna's backstory in the show, with the character coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn't go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Claire Temple===\n{{main|Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)}}\n[[File:Rosario Dawson by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosario Dawson]]]]\n\nClaire Temple (portrayed by [[Rosario Dawson]]) is a nurse who helps Murdock when she finds him beaten and injured, and after he saves her from some Russians who are using her to get to him, she becomes his confidant and near-full-time nurse. The two have a falling out when Murdock explains that a relationship between the two would not work, but she still helps him on occasion when needed.\n\nRosario Dawson joined the cast in June 2014,<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /> and her role was revealed to be that of Temple in October of that year.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> The character is an amalgam of Temple and [[Night Nurse (comics)|Night Nurse]].<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> DeKnight noted that the character was originally \"going to be the actual Night Nurse from the comics...we had her name in a script and it came back that it was possible [the feature side] were going to use her\" and \"had plans for her down the road,\" necessitating the team to use the more obscure comics character Claire Temple as her name.<ref name=\"DeKnightNightNurse\" /> Maslansky revealed that \"Claire Temple's look is effortless and casual; she exudes an unstudied sensuality. She wears slim boyfriend jeans and shirts that skim rather than hug the body. Her clothing might indicate a woman who has travelled or at least has an interest in cultures other than her own.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nDawson explained that \"[her] character is a normal person and she becomes more heroic in a way that she maybe didn't expect\",<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" /> and went on to state that \"She's not a love interest \u2013 she's this skeptical eye looking at this strange situation. She's the one who can be like, \"You're not really good at this.\" That makes it feel more real.\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" /> On her character's relationship to Murdock, Dawson said that \"The show explores how necessary it is for two people to finally have their masks off with each other. For Matt Murdock, this is the first person he has that's going to be able to see that transition for him. For her, she's someone who also throws herself into the fray and had made it her life mission to help, even if that means risking her own life. But she gets confronted with the question: {{em|How far will you go?}} What does it mean if you're helping someone who is maybe going to hurt other people?\"<ref name=\"DawsonTime\" />\n\n===Wilson Fisk / Kingpin===\n{{further|Kingpin (character)}}\n[[File:Vincent D'Onofrio TIFF 2014.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vincent D'Onofrio]]]]\n\nWilson Fisk (portrayed by [[Vincent D'Onofrio]]) was abused alongside his mother by his father, until he killed him as a boy and his mother helped him cover it up. Fisk grew up wanting to make Hell's Kitchen a better place, where there are no people like his father, and planned to buy the entire neighborhood, demolish it, and build a new and better Hell's Kitchen. He received opposition from Murdock as both a lawyer and a vigilante, and began to lose the trust of his allies after he began seeing Marianna. His dealings are exposed to the FBI by a whistle-blower that Murdock protected, and when he attempts to escape custody he is defeated in combat by Murdock as Daredevil and incarcerated at Ryker's Island. During his incarceration, Wilson Fisk works to gain control of the inmates while being visited by his lawyer Benjamin Donovan. When Punisher is sent to Ryker's Island, Wilson Fisk manipulates Punisher into killing a rival inmate and later orchestrates Punisher's escape.\n\nIn season three, he cuts a deal with the FBI to become their informant in exchange for a house arrest deal at the Presidential Hotel and for Vanessa to no be incriminated for Wilson Fisk's crimes. When he starts swaying some of the FBI to his side including Benjamin Poindexter, Wilson Fisk took up the name of Kingpin. When Ray Nadeem did a posthumously testimony where he fought Daredevil and broke Dex's spine, Kingpin had no choice but to return to Ryker's Island in exchange that he doesn't harm Karen, Foggy, or anybody Matt knows as a way to keep the public from knowing that Vanessa orchestrated Ray's death.\n\nD'Onofrio, who was cast as Fisk in June 2014,<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> stated that he hoped his portrayal of Fisk was a new way to look at the character, and that it would be the definitive portrayal of the character.<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal\" /> \"Our Fisk, he's a child and he's a monster,\" D'Onofrio said. \"Every move that he makes and everything that he does in our story comes from his foundation of morality inside himself.\"<ref name=\"D'OnofrioPortrayal2\" /> In December 2014, DeKnight detailed that \"Fisk has very many different aspects so it's not all, \"I want to conquer the city and make a lot of money\". In our story, we tell the story of how he met his wife Vanessa and how they fell in love \u2013 our antagonist actually has a love story. That's the love story you're following, the one you're invested in, and seeing how that affects him and changes him.\" He also said that \"if you're looking for a juicy, multi-faceted crime drama, Wilson Fisk was the obvious choice to play the antagonist ... [he] really felt like the right yin to the yang for Matt, and for what we wanted to do this season.\"<ref name=\"EW7Things\" /> Concerning Fisk not being called Kingpin during the first season, like he is in the comics, DeKnight explained that \"I think there is a, dare I say, critical mass where things get a little bit silly. You know if in the last five minutes we went, \"Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!\" It's a little too much. Also there was no real natural way to get to Kingpin. It felt a little off. There is a point down the line to get there.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> Discussing Fisk's fighting style, compared to Daredevil's, series stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera said that, \"I feel like they're almost two sides to the same coin. They're both doing things for their city. And it's a tricky thing with their two characters. I think when you get the Fisk character to a certain point, it just becomes pure rage, and all thought process is out the window. ... The brutality is just relentless with him. When he gets into this mode, he just keeps going until he's done. And that's it. He will drive for you. That is the Kingpin, that is D'Onofrio. He's a very smooth, calculating individual, but when you bring the rage out in him, he's like a bulldozer.\"<ref name=\"Stunts\" /> Cole Jensen plays a young Wilson Fisk.<ref name=\"Jensen\" />\n\nMaslansky explained that \"Wilson Fisk has a specific look. His choices reflect the man he is and the man he's become. As with Matt Murdock's costumes, I was influenced by the comics with the same stipulation that they feel authentic and modern. We dressed Fisk in current style, embracing a slim silhouette.  It's classic and consistent.  His clothing was custom-made by a highly skilled tailor, Michael Andrews who's well versed in modern design details.\" Significant props used for Fisk in the series are his father's cufflinks, on which Maslansky said, \"[Fisk's father] would have bought them in the 1950s or '60s\u2014a mid-century design. We searched for the perfect vintage cufflinks.  We finally landed on a sterling silver pair with interesting negative space. We knew from reading ahead we'd need many duplicates. I redesigned them, adding more detail\u2014a tiger's eye stone and a portion of it cast in gold. They retained a mid-century look, enhanced to become unique in the world.\"<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\n===Frank Castle / Punisher===\n{{further|Punisher}}\n[[File:Crop of Jon Bernthal by Gage Skidmore 3.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jon Bernthal]]]]\n\nFrancis \"Frank\" Castle Sr. (portrayed by [[Jon Bernthal]]) is a vigilante who aims to clean up Hell's Kitchen by any means necessary, no matter how lethal the results,<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /> which earns him the name 'The Punisher' from the media.<ref name=\"ColliderS2Review\" />\n\nIn June 2015, Marvel announced that Jon Bernthal was cast as Castle for the second season.<ref name=\"Bernthal\" /><ref name=\"Yung\" /> DeKnight and the writers had discussed introducing the character in a [[post-credits scene]] during the first-season finale, but were unable due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one. The scene would have seen Owlsley escape rather than be killed by Fisk, only to be killed by Castle, whose face would not be revealed, but whose iconic skull insignia would have been featured. DeKnight felt that this \"was the right decision. I think there's a better, more organic way to introduce him to the world.\"<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" /> DeKnight also noted that this version of Punisher would be \"completely the Marvel version,\" as previous portrayals did not appear under the [[Marvel Studios]] / [[Marvel Television]] banner. He also felt Bernthal's Punisher would not be as \"graphically violent\" as in ''[[Punisher: War Zone]]''.<ref name=\"DeKnightPunisher\" /> Goddard felt that television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are \"able to do things on the small screen that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Season two showrunners [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez talked about creating their version of the character following the film versions, with Ramirez saying, \"even if you know the character, you've never seen him like this. That was the big thing we wanted. There are four movies, eight hours and four actors. We've seen this guy. We think we know who he is, but even we learned that he's so much more.\" Petrie said, \"We hope to make people forget what they've seen before, whether they've loved it or not.\"<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherJan2016\" />\n\nPetrie stated that [[Son of Sam]], [[Bernard Goetz]], and [[Travis Bickle]] from ''[[Taxi Driver]]'' were influences on the character,<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherJan2016\" /> as well as current events, saying, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\" He added that the writers hoped to \"stir the pot\" and \"get people to think\" when watching Punisher. Bernthal added that \"This character has resonated with law enforcement and military....and the best thing about him is that if he offends you, he just doesn't care.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> In order to get in the correct mindset to portray Castle, Bernthal trained with military members, along with receiving weapon training. Bernthal also \"had to put myself in as dark of place as possible\" to connect with \"the emptiness inside\" Castle, and isolate himself, including walking across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to get to set \"to shed any outside influence of joy.\"<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" />\n\nRosario Dawson, who felt Matt Murdock behaved like the Punisher in season one, felt it would \"be really interesting to see how [the writers] differentiate\" the two in the second season.<ref name=\"DawsonPunisher\" /> Describing the character, Bernthal said, \"As a man who put his [life] on the line and really went through the ultimate sacrifice for this country in his involvement in the military. He's a guy who brought the war home with him [in] the worst possible way. There are a lot of iterations of this character and in all of them it's a man who's gone through this unbelievable trauma and what's interesting about our take on him is how this trauma reshapes his own philosophy.\"<ref name=\"BernthalEWJan2016\" /> Bernthal also talked about the character's 'superpowers', saying, \"If I got one thing from the comics, I think, as far as superpowers... his superpower is his rage. His superpower is that he is not going to quit, and he is going to go forward no matter what. And that's as human and grounded a quality as I think as this sort of genre could have\".<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" />\n\n===Elektra Natchios===\n{{further|Elektra (comics)}}\n[[File:Elodie Yung by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|upright|[[\u00c9lodie Yung]]]]\n\nElektra Natchios (portrayed by [[\u00c9lodie Yung]]) is a mysterious and dangerous woman from Murdock's past.<ref name=\"Yung\" />\n\nIn July 2015, Marvel announced that Yung had been cast as Elektra for the second season, after the character had initially been referred to in the first season.<ref name=\"Yung\" /><ref name=\"GlennS2\" /> Describing Elektra's effect on Murdock, Petrie called her \"the best bad girlfriend you can possibly have. She does everything wrong and attractive, she's [Matt's] id, the wild side. Matt is always taming his wild side. Elektra just lets it out. He's both repulsed and deeply drawn to that.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Talking about the character, Yung said, \"What I tried to capture by reading the comics is I wanted to keep the coldness that Elektra has. And I had conversations at length with Doug [Petrie] and Marco [Ramirez]. We think Elektra is kind of a sociopath. This world is a game for her. It's like a chess game, and what motivates her is what she wants. She'll use anything she needs to use to get to her goal, and if she needs to kill people, she would.\" However, \"we wanted to create a character with different layers.

A taxi driver finds Matt and gets him to Father Paul Lantom, who entrusts Matt to the care of [[Maggie Murdock|Sister Maggie]] at the Saint Agnes Orphanage, where Matt was raised. As he slowly recovers, Matt has a crisis of faith and decides that he would rather put his life in danger and continue fighting as Daredevil than return to his civilian life. He begins training to fight again. One night he stops a kidnapping and is badly beaten. Matt's friends, [[Karen Page]] (now a reporter for the ''New York Bulletin'') and [[Foggy Nelson]], start to lose hope that he may still be alive. In prison, criminal [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] decides to make a deal with the FBI to protect his love Vanessa Mariana, who can be charged as an accessory to his crimes. The case is assigned to Agent Ray Nadeem, who is struggling with being unable to receive a promotion due to financial troubles after he paid for his sister-in-law's cancer treatment.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Please\n| DirectedBy      = [[Lukas Ettlin]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jim Dunn\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Fisk's intel leads to the arrest of the elusive Albanian syndicate's leaders, and Nadeem convinces his superiors to let him continue to work with Fisk despite his financial troubles making him a target for bribery. News of Fisk's cooperation with the FBI spreads fast, and in retaliation he is attacked in prison by a fellow inmate. Nadeem agrees to move Fisk out of prison and into home detention, but their convoy is attacked by the Albanians on the way, and most of the FBI agents are killed. Fisk is saved by Agent [[Bullseye (comics)|\"Dex\" Poindexter]], who has incredibly accurate shooting skills and executes some of the attackers even after they surrender. Matt tracks down the attempted kidnappers and beats them, leaving them to be arrested. Karen is assigned to report on the attempted kidnapping, which involved the well-known Neda Kazemi; after hearing about the death of Karen's brother Kevin, Neda opens up to Karen about the attack and leads Karen to believe that Matt is still alive, but Foggy, who is considering leaving the law to help his brother Theo run the family business, is skeptical of this.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = No Good Deed\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jennifer Getzinger]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sonay Hoffman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = The FBI house Fisk in the penthouse suite of a hotel they use as a safehouse. News of his release from prison becomes public, prompting protests outside of the hotel and interest from reporters, including Karen, who learns that the hotel had belonged to Neda's father Rostom, who sold it to a company represented by Fisk's lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]]. Foggy goes to district attorney [[Blake Tower]] to offer his help in returning Fisk to prison, but Tower is reluctant to go against the wishes of the FBI, especially since he is running for re-election. Matt investigates the hotel, and begins to hallucinate Fisk as a \"[[Shoulder angel|devil on his shoulder]]\". Matt interrogates Donovan and learns of the situation with Vanessa. He vows to stop Fisk and return him to prison, revealing to Foggy that he is alive but only to warn him and Karen to stay away from Fisk. During a routine psychological evaluation to determine his fitness for duty, Dex talks about the emotional support that he receives from his girlfriend Julie.

Despite the fact that Fisk saw him kill them in cold blood, he conceals this by falsely corroborating Dex's rationale to the FBI. Foggy, unhappy with Matt's demands, tells Karen that Matt is alive and then is convinced by his girlfriend Marci Stahl to run for district attorney against Tower in order to ensure that Fisk is brought to justice. Foggy gains the support of the NYPD, who view Fisk as a cop killer. Karen continues her investigation, and finds that a prison convict [[Felix Manning]] was involved in the company that bought the hotel in which the FBI is housing Fisk. Matt impersonates Foggy to infiltrate the prison housing Jasper Evans, whom he learns was paid by Fisk to attack Fisk in order to convince the FBI to move him. With the Albanians' help, Matt fights off inmates and guards working for Fisk and escapes the prison, but is driven off a dock by an unknown taxi driver.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = The Perfect Game\n| DirectedBy      = Julian Holmes\n| WrittenBy       = Tonya Kong\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = When Fisk learns that Matt survived the submerged taxi, he tells the FBI that he has a criminal [[fixer (person)|fixer]] named Matt Murdock. Karen confronts Fisk's actual fixer, Manning, but he threatens her with his knowledge of her family, including her brother's death. Nadeem questions both Karen and Foggy about Matt, and both try to direct him towards Fisk and his crimes. Fisk reviews a file from Manning on Dex, and learns that he used his skillful aim to kill his baseball coach as a child. He was taught to be more empathetic through therapy as he grew up, but he feigned this to conceal his psychopathic tendencies. In one incident when he worked for a suicide prevention hotline, he encouraged a caller to kill someone else rather than himself. It was there that he met and fell in love with Julie, whom he now he finds working at the hotel. He accidentally reveals to her that he has been stalking her.

Dex confronts Fisk, who confirms that he was behind Julie's hiring at the hotel, and that he had intended to show Dex that life with Julie was not going to work, as she would never understand Dex. Fisk, however, tells him that he, Fisk, does understand Dex, in light of his own boyhood murder of his father. Matt visits Karen to ask for her help in finding Evans, and offers to testify against Fisk. Foggy arranges a meeting between a newly-promoted Nadeem and Karen at the ''New York Bulletin'', where she will interview Evans about Fisk's plans. In exchange for Nadeem considering Evans' testimony, Matt agrees to turn himself into the FBI in order to clear his name. Distraught over Julie, Dex considers committing suicide, but is interrupted by Fisk, who proposes an alternative. Dex instead goes to the ''Bulletin'' dressed as Daredevil, fights off Matt, and kills Evans before he can talk.

When she tries to do the same with her boss Mitchell Ellison, he orders her to reveal who Daredevil is or quit. Karen later asks her father Paxton if she could go spend some time at home with him, but he says the timing isn't great. Foggy believes that he has worked out what Fisk is planning. Matt, angry that he put his friends in harm's way and worried about the skill of the pretend Daredevil, visits [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], the man who created the Daredevil suit. Potter confirms that Fisk forced him to create a copy of the suit, and reveals that the pretender was an FBI agent. Potter then tries to frame Matt as the Daredevil who attacked the Bulletin, but Matt manages to escape the arriving FBI agents. After investigating Evans, Nadeem begins to believe that Fisk is manipulating them, but has no proof of this. At home, he is confronted by Matt who explains that the Daredevil attacker was a pretender and an FBI agent.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 34\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Upstairs/Downstairs\n| DirectedBy      = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Dara Resnik]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Nadeem realizes that Dex is the attacker. Dex attempts to reconcile with Julie, believing that he needs her to replace his therapist who died when he was younger. She reluctantly agrees to start talking with him, but Fisk later has her killed. Believing that Julie has abandoned him, Dex continues to mentally deteriorate. Matt and Nadeem break into Dex's apartment but cannot find proof that he was the attacker, only some recordings of his therapy sessions which reveal his psychopathic tendencies. Dex arrives home and catches them, injuring Nadeem but they manage to escape. Foggy thinks that he can prove Fisk is still working as a criminal, and that this will get him sent back to prison. He decides to raise these points in a debate with Tower and let Karen write about it, but instead she goes to confront Fisk. She reveals that she knows he killed his father, and that she had killed Wesley, while accidentally confirming that Matt is Daredevil.

Manning threatens Foggy's family unless he publicly apologizes for speaking out against Fisk at the debate. Karen decides to run from Fisk, and Maggie offers to help hide her. Nadeem tells his superiors, Tammy Hattley and Winn, about the FBI conspiracy involving Fisk and Dex. In a turn of events, Hattley kills Winn with Nadeems gun, revealing that she works for Fisk. She then fabricates evidence with which she can frame Nadeem for Winn's murder, blackmailing him into working for Fisk with help from Manning. She explains that Fisk had been manipulating Nadeem for the last year, and was behind the need for Nadeem to help pay for his sister-in-law's treatment. Fisk has Nadeem and Dex arrest several gang leaders across New York and bring them to a restaurant where Fisk offers to protect them from FBI charges in exchange for payment. Fisk coerces Nadeem into luring Matt to the meeting, but Matt knows it is a trap, and instead goes to the hotel to wait for Fisk.

One day, Kevin reveals to Karen that he has re-enrolled her in college, which Paxton celebrates with a family dinner, but this leads to an argument, and Karen runs off with Todd. After getting drunk and high together, they return to the [[travel trailer]] where Todd lives to find that Kevin is burning it down. Todd attacks Kevin, and Karen injures Todd with his own gun to stop him. She quickly drives Kevin away, but crashes, and Kevin dies. The local sheriff covers up Karen's involvement, and Paxton asks her to leave. In the present, Karen attends a service at Clinton Church when Dex, dressed as Daredevil, arrives and kills Lantom, intending to then kill Karen.

With Vanessa on her way back to New York City, Fisk goes to retrieve the painting she gave him when they first met; it is in the possession of Esther Falb, a [[Holocaust]] survivor whose family were the original owners of the painting. Fisk decides to let her keep it. Foggy considers reading a statement apologizing to Fisk, until he is called by Matt to help them escape the church: Foggy goes and surrenders Karen to the NYPD, which Nadeem allows, which distract the FBI long enough for Matt to escape as well. Matt, Foggy, and Karen plan their next moves against Fisk, and know they will need help. Later, Nadeem and his family are attacked by FBI agents loyal to Fisk.

Matt agrees to carry out Foggy's plan\u2014working together as lawyers as they once had, they take Nadeem on as a client and organize with Tower to have Nadeem testify against Fisk in front of a grand jury. Foggy also offers to withdraw from the race for district attorney, and they get Nadeem's family to safety. Meanwhile, Karen calls a press conference to announce what Nadeem is doing so the public is aware given that his testimony would be sealed. Matt and Foggy celebrate after the hearing, with Foggy hinting that he would like to continue working with Matt like this. However, Fisk controls the jury and so the hearing has no effect. Nadeem is convinced that Fisk cannot be stopped, and returns to his home. Fisk decides it would be better not to kill Nadeem now that he is a public figure, but Vanessa convinces him otherwise.

Netflix VP Cindy Holland responded that the scheduling of the various Marvel Netflix series, especially the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' which required cast members from all of the series to come together, was to blame for the delay, and that the company had no issue with the quality of the season; on the contrary, Holland described the season as \"fantastic\" and felt it was a \"real return to form\" for the series.<ref name=\"HollandJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ending of the miniseries ''The Defenders'', which sees [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] waking up in a convent surrounded by nuns after being presumed dead, implied elements of the season would be inspired by the \"[[Born Again (comics)|Born Again]]\" story arc.<ref name=\"DefendersEnding\" /><ref name=\"DefendersEnding2\" /> [[Charlie Cox]] was excited to adapt \"Born Again\", calling it \"an amazing story\" and that the implications of the story on the season \"would be {{em|very}} exciting\". He cautioned, however, that it would not be a \"page-for-page\" adaptation, \"because if you do [that], then you become a foregone conclusion. There may be elements from \"Born Again\", but I'm sure there will be elements that are unfamiliar and surprising and different in order for the show to be compelling to fans who know the comics very well.\"<ref name=\"CoxTHRAug2017\" /> Oleson crafted an original story for the season, taking \"pieces of some of my favorite comic book runs, that told a larger story\". When pitching his ideas to Marvel, Oleson expected \"more pushback\" from them, but said \"Marvel was incredibly excited about the storyline\" and gave him \"complete freedom\". Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] did note that despite this apparent freedom, Oleson was still required to deal with Murdock's death in ''The Defenders'' which was part of \"a fairly good idea as to what [Marvel] wanted to tackle in terms of story\" before Oleson presented his ideas.<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> Oleson drew inspiration from \"Born Again\" and \"[[Guardian Devil]]\" for the tone of the season.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> Building the season structurally, Oleson felt if any viewer was \"a devout Catholic... you could read into the events of the early episodes as a message from god to Matt\".<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\nAt the start of the season, Oleson noted that Murdock would be \"broken physically, broken emotionally, and broken spiritually\", with his heightened senses failing him. Oleson added, \"He's angry at God, he's angry at the fact that he had risked his life to do God's work, and he's questioning whether or not he was a fool.\" This results in Murdock donning his original black suit, similar to the one he wore in season one, since he \"goes to pretty much the darkest place you can\" and is at a point, Oleson notes, \"[w]hen he realizes that he's incapable of being Daredevil, [and] he would rather just end it than go forward in his life without abilities.\"<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> This also allowed Oleson to return the character \"to the core idea\" of being a boxer's son, \"where his fighting style was more brutal and kind of close in combat\".<ref name=\"OlesonWashingtonPost\" /> Oleson also wanted \"to make the action sequences matter in ways that reflected on characters, or had real stakes\". He added, \"the best writing is one where the action sequences are an inherent part of the story and you cannot predict that the action is going to turn out a certain way.\"<ref name=\"EWSingleTakeFight\" />\n\nRegarding the return of [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]], Oleson called him \"smarter, more calculated, and more manipulative,\" and felt his inclusion allowed the ability to \"tell a story that\u2019s relevant to the world around us. I looked at the show as a way to examine how tyrants manipulate in order to push their own agenda and cause fear and distrust.\" Loeb felt the season went \"back to the world of the crime story\".<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> [[Karen Page]]'s backstory is further explored in the season, with Woll explaining it reveals \"why shooting someone [James Wesley] and covering it up is a bit more in her wheelhouse,\" while [[Foggy Nelson]]'s family and additional backstory is also seen.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> All of the supporting characters in the season were treated \"as emotionally real people as opposed to treating them as props or devices\". Oleson wanted them to be \"the protagonist of their own journey\", modeling this approach after the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\n[[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter]] does not go by Bullseye in the season. In the season's final sequence, Dex's spine is being operated on before the camera zooms into his face and a bullseye appears in his eye.<ref name=\"NewsweekBullseye\" /> Oleson \"was very interested in telling an origin story not only about how a character we know from the comics as a full-blown psychopath and killer, but how somebody in real life could be turned into something like that.\" This origin also spoke to the overall theme for the season of fear, which touched the story arcs of Murdock, Page, and Fisk as well. Psychiatrists and psychologists were consulted to help create \"a realistic portrait of Dex and how he might be able to turn into Bullseye\".<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\n===Casting===\nCox, Woll, Henson, and D'Onofrio all return in the season, reprising their roles as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Karen Page, Foggy Nelson, and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, respectively.<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> Rider also returns as Blake Tower.<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\"/> In November 2017, [[Wilson Bethel]] was cast as a new series regular, Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter,<ref name=\"Bethel\"/><ref name=\"Bullseye\"/> and in January 2018, [[Joanne Whalley]] was revealed to have been cast as [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]], a nun who cares deeply about Murdock's safety,<ref name=\"Whalley\"/><ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\"/> and was mentioned at the end of ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DefendersEnding\"/> [[Jay Ali]] was cast as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem, another FBI agent, by March.<ref name=\"Ali\"/>\n\nRecurring characters in the season include [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Paul Lantom]],<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\"/> Danny Johnson as [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]],<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> [[Geoffrey Cantor (actor)|Geoffrey Cantor]] as [[Mitchell Ellison]],<ref name=\"Cantor\"/> [[Amy Rutberg]] as Marci Stahl,<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> and [[Royce Johnson]] as [[Brett Mahoney]],<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> all of whom are reprising their roles from earlier seasons. Other recurring characters include Stephen Rowe as Nicholas Lee, one of Fisk's lawyers; Kate Udall as Tammy Hattley, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI; Sunita Deshpande as Seema Nadeem and Noah Huq as Sami Nadeem, Ray's wife and son, respectively; Peter Halpin as Theo Nelson, Foggy's brother created for the series;<ref name=\"TheoHalpin\"/> Holly Cinnamon as Julie Barnes, a friend of Dex; Joe Jones as Felix Manning, Fisk's [[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]]; Kelly McAndrews as Mrs. Shelby, Fisk's surveillance technician; and Matthew McCurdy, Don Castro, Scotty Crow, Richard Prioleau, David Anthony Buglione, Sam Slater, and Andrew Sensenig as FBI agents Wellers, Arinori, Lim, Doyle, Johnson, O'Connor, and Winn, respectively.\n\nCharacters making guest appearances from the first two seasons and other MCU media include [[Matt Gerald]] as [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], John Patrick Hayden as [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]], [[Annabella Sciorra]] as [[Rosalie Carbone]], following up on her character's introduction in the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'',<ref name=\"Sciorra\"/> [[Ron Simons]] as NYPD captain Strieber, following his appearance in ''The Defenders'', and former main cast member [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna-Fisk]].\n\nFormer ''Daredevil'' comic writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] has a cameo appearance as prison inmate in episode 4.<ref>{{Cite web|author=[[Johnston, Rich]]|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/11/01/roy-thomas-cameo-marvel-daredevil-season-3/|title=Roy Thomas Talks at Length About His Cameo on Marvel's Daredevil Season 3|date=2018-11-01|website=Bleeding Cool|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nCostume designer Liz Vastola noted Daredevil's black suit was \"purposely ripped and jagged to highlight Matt\u2019s state of mind\" throughout the season. Vastola described Page's wardrobe as \"fucking fierce\" as Page transitions into more of an investigative journalist. Foggy Nelson's look is a \"complete 180\" from what he was wearing in season one, with the character now wearing suits made by [[Martin Greenfield]] Clothiers.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season began on November 13, 2017, in New York City.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> A week of filming for the season in March 2018 took place in the town of [[Windham, New York]], with set photos revealing that the town was representing Fagan Corners, Vermont,<ref name=\"WindhamFilming\" /> the hometown of Karen Page in the comics.<ref name=\"FaganCorners\" /> The production paid for the renovation of a local store to portray a diner for the series, and used the town's emergency helicopter pad. Additional filming locations for the week included nearby ski areas and a country club.<ref name=\"WindhamFilming\" /> The exterior of the [[Lotte New York Palace Hotel]] served as the building of Fisk's penthouse while under FBI surveillance.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> An abandoned prison in Staten Island was used for the riot sequence in episode four.<ref>https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/daredevil-season-3-one-take-fight-scene.html</ref> Filming for the season was completed by mid-June 2018.<ref name=\"SDCCPlans\" />\n\n\"Blindsided\" features a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. Oleson credited the episode's director Alex Garcia Lopez, writer Lewaa Nasserdeen, and the stunt team for conceiving the idea. Once the sequence was decided, Oleson asked Marvel to give them a full day to rehearse the sequence, which \"no one had ever done before\", since \"it required every single member of the crew to work in perfect sync.\" Oleson said once \"the crew finally pulled it off, it was something spectacular that injected adrenaline into the crew for the remainder of the season.\" The sequence, which does not feature any hidden edit cuts, was meant to be a \"homage, and then one-upping\" of the sequence from season one. Several moments were included in the sequence where the editing team could add a cut if needed, though they did not need them. While editing the episode, Oleson increased the lighting in certain shots \"so that the audience could see that we never cut the camera\".<ref name=\"EWSingleTakeFight\" /> Cox called the completed sequence \"amazing\", adding it was \"a real testament to the stunt team\".<ref name=\"CoxSingleTakeFight\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] once again returns for the season. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on October 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = \n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano and Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:05\n\n| title2          = Subway Feels\n| length2         = 2:37\n\n| title3          = The Motorcade\n| length3         = 2:43\n\n| title4          = Tazin' in the Dark\n| length4         = 1:53\n\n| title5          = Checking Mail\n| length5         = 3:36\n\n| title6          = To the Nest\n| length6         = 1:36\n\n| title7          = Agent Nadeem\n| length7         = 2:01\n\n| title8          = Not Another Hallway\n| length8         = 5:22\n\n| title9          = Returning Home\n| length9         = 2:04\n\n| title10         = All Star Pitcher\n| length10        = 8:22\n\n| title11         = Ricochet Neighbor\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = The Murdocks\n| length12        = 2:38\n\n| title13         = Trading Judgement\n| length13        = 4:42\n\n| title14         = Fagan Corners\n| length14        = 3:41\n\n| title15         = Elevated Hubbies\n| length15        = 2:35\n\n| title16         = Leading the Blind\n| length16        = 3:24\n\n| title17         = Perp Walk\n| length17        = 2:49\n\n| title18         = Wedding Day Jitters\n| length18        = 4:36\n\n| title19         = Dex Plus One\n| length19        = 5:29\n\n| title20         = The Funeral\n| length20        = 4:08\n\n| title21         = Still Stapled Together\n| length21        = 3:42\n\n| title22         = Nelson Murdock and Page\n| length22        = 2:26\n\n| title23         = End Credits\n| length23        = 1:06\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe third season of ''Daredevil'' was released on October 19, 2018 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]], worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> Initially thought to be releasing in 2017,<ref name=\"Season3\" /> Netflix COO [[Ted Sarandos]] stated in July 2016 that the season would not debut until 2018 at the earliest, after ''The Defenders'' released on August 18, 2017.<ref name=\"Sarandos2018Releases\" /><ref name=\"DefendersReleaseDate\" /> Cox was hopeful the season would debut in 2018,<ref name=\"CoxTHRAug2017\" /> and in October 2017, Marvel revealed the season was indeed expected to release in 2018.<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> In mid-September 2018, the season's release date was revealed.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nBy mid-June 2018, discussions were underway regarding the season being promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] that year.<ref name=\"SDCCPlans\" /> A teaser trailer for the season was included as a [[post-credits scene]] at the end of [[Iron Fist (season 2)|the second season of ''Iron Fist'']].<ref name=\"IFSeason2Teaser\" /> A full trailer for the season was released on October 4, 2018, which also confirmed Bethel's role as Benjamin Poindexter in the season.<ref name=\"Bullseye\" /> Cox, Henson, Woll, D'Onofrio, Whalley, Bethel, and Ali promoted the season at New York Comic Con on October 6, 2018.<ref name=\"NYCC2018Panel\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 97% approval rating based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 8.06/10.

The season is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. It is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Erik Oleson]] serving as [[showrunner]], and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] portrays Fisk, with [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], and [[Stephen Rider]] also returning from previous seasons; [[Joanne Whalley]], [[Jay Ali]], and [[Wilson Bethel]] join them. Former series regular [[Ayelet Zurer]] also returns in a guest role. The season was ordered in July 2016, with Oleson announced as new showrunner for the season in October 2017.

A taxi driver finds Matt and gets him to Father Paul Lantom, who entrusts Matt to the care of [[Maggie Murdock|Sister Maggie]] at the Saint Agnes Orphanage, where Matt was raised. As he slowly recovers, Matt has a crisis of faith and decides that he would rather put his life in danger and continue fighting as Daredevil than return to his civilian life. He begins training to fight again. One night he stops a kidnapping and is badly beaten. Matt's friends, [[Karen Page]] (now a reporter for the ''New York Bulletin'') and [[Foggy Nelson]], start to lose hope that he may still be alive. In prison, criminal [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk]] decides to make a deal with the FBI to protect his love Vanessa Mariana, who can be charged as an accessory to his crimes. The case is assigned to Agent Ray Nadeem, who is struggling with being unable to receive a promotion due to financial troubles after he paid for his sister-in-law's cancer treatment.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 28\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Please\n| DirectedBy      = [[Lukas Ettlin]]\n| WrittenBy       = Jim Dunn\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Fisk's intel leads to the arrest of the elusive Albanian syndicate's leaders, and Nadeem convinces his superiors to let him continue to work with Fisk despite his financial troubles making him a target for bribery. News of Fisk's cooperation with the FBI spreads fast, and in retaliation he is attacked in prison by a fellow inmate. Nadeem agrees to move Fisk out of prison and into home detention, but their convoy is attacked by the Albanians on the way, and most of the FBI agents are killed. Fisk is saved by Agent [[Bullseye (comics)|\"Dex\" Poindexter]], who has incredibly accurate shooting skills and executes some of the attackers even after they surrender. Matt tracks down the attempted kidnappers and beats them, leaving them to be arrested. Karen is assigned to report on the attempted kidnapping, which involved the well-known Neda Kazemi; after hearing about the death of Karen's brother Kevin, Neda opens up to Karen about the attack and leads Karen to believe that Matt is still alive, but Foggy, who is considering leaving the law to help his brother Theo run the family business, is skeptical of this.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 29\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = No Good Deed\n| DirectedBy      = [[Jennifer Getzinger]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sonay Hoffman\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = The FBI house Fisk in the penthouse suite of a hotel they use as a safehouse. News of his release from prison becomes public, prompting protests outside of the hotel and interest from reporters, including Karen, who learns that the hotel had belonged to Neda's father Rostom, who sold it to a company represented by Fisk's lawyer [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]]. Foggy goes to district attorney [[Blake Tower]] to offer his help in returning Fisk to prison, but Tower is reluctant to go against the wishes of the FBI, especially since he is running for re-election. Matt investigates the hotel, and begins to hallucinate Fisk as a \"[[Shoulder angel|devil on his shoulder]]\". Matt interrogates Donovan and learns of the situation with Vanessa. He vows to stop Fisk and return him to prison, revealing to Foggy that he is alive but only to warn him and Karen to stay away from Fisk. During a routine psychological evaluation to determine his fitness for duty, Dex talks about the emotional support that he receives from his girlfriend Julie.

Despite the fact that Fisk saw him kill them in cold blood, he conceals this by falsely corroborating Dex's rationale to the FBI. Foggy, unhappy with Matt's demands, tells Karen that Matt is alive and then is convinced by his girlfriend Marci Stahl to run for district attorney against Tower in order to ensure that Fisk is brought to justice. Foggy gains the support of the NYPD, who view Fisk as a cop killer. Karen continues her investigation, and finds that a prison convict [[Felix Manning]] was involved in the company that bought the hotel in which the FBI is housing Fisk. Matt impersonates Foggy to infiltrate the prison housing Jasper Evans, whom he learns was paid by Fisk to attack Fisk in order to convince the FBI to move him. With the Albanians' help, Matt fights off inmates and guards working for Fisk and escapes the prison, but is driven off a dock by an unknown taxi driver.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 31\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n| Title           = The Perfect Game\n| DirectedBy      = Julian Holmes\n| WrittenBy       = Tonya Kong\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = When Fisk learns that Matt survived the submerged taxi, he tells the FBI that he has a criminal [[fixer (person)|fixer]] named Matt Murdock. Karen confronts Fisk's actual fixer, Manning, but he threatens her with his knowledge of her family, including her brother's death. Nadeem questions both Karen and Foggy about Matt, and both try to direct him towards Fisk and his crimes. Fisk reviews a file from Manning on Dex, and learns that he used his skillful aim to kill his baseball coach as a child. He was taught to be more empathetic through therapy as he grew up, but he feigned this to conceal his psychopathic tendencies. In one incident when he worked for a suicide prevention hotline, he encouraged a caller to kill someone else rather than himself. It was there that he met and fell in love with Julie, whom he now he finds working at the hotel. He accidentally reveals to her that he has been stalking her.

Dex confronts Fisk, who confirms that he was behind Julie's hiring at the hotel, and that he had intended to show Dex that life with Julie was not going to work, as she would never understand Dex. Fisk, however, tells him that he, Fisk, does understand Dex, in light of his own boyhood murder of his father. Matt visits Karen to ask for her help in finding Evans, and offers to testify against Fisk. Foggy arranges a meeting between a newly-promoted Nadeem and Karen at the ''New York Bulletin'', where she will interview Evans about Fisk's plans. In exchange for Nadeem considering Evans' testimony, Matt agrees to turn himself into the FBI in order to clear his name. Distraught over Julie, Dex considers committing suicide, but is interrupted by Fisk, who proposes an alternative. Dex instead goes to the ''Bulletin'' dressed as Daredevil, fights off Matt, and kills Evans before he can talk. Dex is then confronted by the FBI, including Nadeem, and dispatches the agents before escaping, leading the FBI to believe that Daredevil assaulted them.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 33\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 7\n| Title           = Aftermath\n| DirectedBy      = [[Toa Fraser]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sarah Streicher\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Daredevil is attacked by the public and media, and Karen is unable to convince Nadeem that this was not the true Daredevil or that Fisk was behind the attack. When she tries to do the same with her boss Mitchell Ellison, he orders her to reveal who Daredevil is or quit. Karen later asks her father Paxton if she could go spend some time at home with him, but he says the timing isn't great. Foggy believes that he has worked out what Fisk is planning. Matt, angry that he put his friends in harm's way and worried about the skill of the pretend Daredevil, visits [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], the man who created the Daredevil suit. Potter confirms that Fisk forced him to create a copy of the suit, and reveals that the pretender was an FBI agent. Potter then tries to frame Matt as the Daredevil who attacked the Bulletin, but Matt manages to escape the arriving FBI agents. After investigating Evans, Nadeem begins to believe that Fisk is manipulating them, but has no proof of this. At home, he is confronted by Matt who explains that the Daredevil attacker was a pretender and an FBI agent.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 34\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 8\n| Title           = Upstairs/Downstairs\n| DirectedBy      = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[Dara Resnik]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Nadeem realizes that Dex is the attacker. Dex attempts to reconcile with Julie, believing that he needs her to replace his therapist who died when he was younger. She reluctantly agrees to start talking with him, but Fisk later has her killed. Believing that Julie has abandoned him, Dex continues to mentally deteriorate. Matt and Nadeem break into Dex's apartment but cannot find proof that he was the attacker, only some recordings of his therapy sessions which reveal his psychopathic tendencies. Dex arrives home and catches them, injuring Nadeem but they manage to escape. Foggy thinks that he can prove Fisk is still working as a criminal, and that this will get him sent back to prison. He decides to raise these points in a debate with Tower and let Karen write about it, but instead she goes to confront Fisk. She reveals that she knows he killed his father, and that she had killed Wesley, while accidentally confirming that Matt is Daredevil.

Manning threatens Foggy's family unless he publicly apologizes for speaking out against Fisk at the debate. Karen decides to run from Fisk, and Maggie offers to help hide her. Nadeem tells his superiors, Tammy Hattley and Winn, about the FBI conspiracy involving Fisk and Dex. In a turn of events, Hattley kills Winn with Nadeems gun, revealing that she works for Fisk. She then fabricates evidence with which she can frame Nadeem for Winn's murder, blackmailing him into working for Fisk with help from Manning. She explains that Fisk had been manipulating Nadeem for the last year, and was behind the need for Nadeem to help pay for his sister-in-law's treatment. Fisk has Nadeem and Dex arrest several gang leaders across New York and bring them to a restaurant where Fisk offers to protect them from FBI charges in exchange for payment. Fisk coerces Nadeem into luring Matt to the meeting, but Matt knows it is a trap, and instead goes to the hotel to wait for Fisk.

One day, Kevin reveals to Karen that he has re-enrolled her in college, which Paxton celebrates with a family dinner, but this leads to an argument, and Karen runs off with Todd. After getting drunk and high together, they return to the [[travel trailer]] where Todd lives to find that Kevin is burning it down. Todd attacks Kevin, and Karen injures Todd with his own gun to stop him. She quickly drives Kevin away, but crashes, and Kevin dies. The local sheriff covers up Karen's involvement, and Paxton asks her to leave. In the present, Karen attends a service at Clinton Church when Dex, dressed as Daredevil, arrives and kills Lantom, intending to then kill Karen. Choosing between saving Karen and lying in wait for Fisk, Matt races to the church where he confronts Dex, who badly beats Matt before Karen knocks Dex off a second story balcony, after which he escapes.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 37\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 11\n| Title           = Reunion\n| DirectedBy      = Jet Wilkinson\n| WrittenBy       = Jim Dunn & [[Dara Resnik]]\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Dex has Nadeem take control of the church crime scene, and the FBI searches for Matt and Karen. They remain hidden with Maggie's help. The [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] drops all charges against Fisk, who announces his freedom to the public with a speech that proclaims Daredevil as the public's enemy. With Vanessa on her way back to New York City, Fisk goes to retrieve the painting she gave him when they first met; it is in the possession of Esther Falb, a [[Holocaust]] survivor whose family were the original owners of the painting. Fisk decides to let her keep it. Foggy considers reading a statement apologizing to Fisk, until he is called by Matt to help them escape the church: Foggy goes and surrenders Karen to the NYPD, which Nadeem allows, which distract the FBI long enough for Matt to escape as well. Matt, Foggy, and Karen plan their next moves against Fisk, and know they will need help. Later, Nadeem and his family are attacked by FBI agents loyal to Fisk. Matt helps Nadeem fight them off, and reveals his identity to him.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 38\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 12\n| Title           = One Last Shot\n| DirectedBy      = [[Phil Abraham]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sam Ernst\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = Fisk is reunited with Vanessa, who convinces Fisk to let her into the criminal side of his life. Without asking Fisk, Dex retrieves the painting from Falb and Vanessa notices some of her blood on the frame. Matt agrees to carry out Foggy's plan\u2014working together as lawyers as they once had, they take Nadeem on as a client and organize with Tower to have Nadeem testify against Fisk in front of a grand jury. Foggy also offers to withdraw from the race for district attorney, and they get Nadeem's family to safety. Meanwhile, Karen calls a press conference to announce what Nadeem is doing so the public is aware given that his testimony would be sealed. Matt and Foggy celebrate after the hearing, with Foggy hinting that he would like to continue working with Matt like this. However, Fisk controls the jury and so the hearing has no effect. Nadeem is convinced that Fisk cannot be stopped, and returns to his home. Fisk decides it would be better not to kill Nadeem now that he is a public figure, but Vanessa convinces him otherwise. They send Dex, who kills Nadeem.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 3)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 39\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 13\n| Title           = A New Napkin\n| DirectedBy      = [[Sam Miller]]\n| WrittenBy       = Erik Oleson\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|10|19}}\n| ShortSummary    = With Foggy's plan foiled, Matt returns to his and intends to kill Fisk. He kidnaps and interrogates Manning, learning that Vanessa ordered Nadeem's death, and Fisk ordered Julie's. Foggy meets with Nadeem's wife Seema, to whom he sent a video message that serves as his [[dying declaration]], detailing all of Fisk's crimes. Matt tells Dex about Julie's death, which Dex investigates and finds her body. Fisk and Vanessa get married at the hotel, but their reception is interrupted when Karen distributes Nadeem's video on social media, followed by the arrival of Dex, who attacks Fisk and Vanessa. Matt soon joins the fight. Fisk defeats Dex, leaving him paralyzed, while Matt overpowers and beats Fisk but chooses to spare his life. Fisk agrees to return to prison and leave Karen and Foggy alone if Matt does not reveal Vanessa's involvement in Nadeem's death. With Fisk arrested, a funeral is held for Lantom. Foggy suggests to Matt and Karen that they all start working together again. Dex later goes through experimental surgery to fix his spine.\n| LineColor       = A91E1E\n}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Daredevil characters}}\n{{Columns-start|num=3}}\n\n===Main===\n* [[Charlie Cox]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]]<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n* [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]]<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n* [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]]<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n* [[Joanne Whalley]] as [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]]<ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\" />\n* [[Jay Ali]] as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem<ref name=\"Ali\" />\n* [[Wilson Bethel]] as [[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter]]<ref name=\"Bullseye\" />\n* [[Stephen Rider]] as [[Blake Tower]]<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\" />\n* [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]]<ref name=\"Oleson\" />\n{{column}}\n\n===Recurring===<!-- Appearing in 4 or more episodes -->\n* [[Peter McRobbie]] as Paul Lantom<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\" />\n* Danny Johnson as [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]]<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n* Stephen Rowe as Nicholas Lee\n* Kate Udall as Tammy Hattley\n* Sunita Deshpande as Seema Nadeem\n* Noah Huq as Sami Nadeem\n* [[Geoffrey Cantor (actor)|Geoffrey Cantor]] as [[Mitchell Ellison]]<ref name=\"Cantor\" />\n* Peter Halpin as Theo Nelson<ref name=\"TheoHalpin\" />\n* [[Amy Rutberg]] as Marci Stahl<ref name=\"Rutberg\" />\n* Holly Cinnamon as Julie Barnes\n* [[Royce Johnson]] as [[Brett Mahoney]]<ref name=\"Johnson\" />\n* Joe Jones as [[Felix Manning]]\n* Kelly McAndrews as Mrs. Shelby\n\n{{column}}\n\n===Notable guests===<!-- Only characters that have appeared previously in other MCU media -->\n* [[Matt Gerald]] as [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]]\n* John Patrick Hayden as [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]]\n* [[Annabella Sciorra]] as [[Rosalie Carbone]]<ref name=\"Sciorra\"/>\n* [[Ron Simons]] as Strieber\n* [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna-Fisk]]\n{{Columns-end}}\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nAt [[San Diego Comic-Con International]] 2016, Marvel and Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for a third season, with the expectation that [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez would return as showrunners from the second season.<ref name=\"Season3\" /> In October 2017, it was announced that [[Erik Oleson]] would replace Petrie and Ramirez as showrunner for the season.<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> The season had yet to be scheduled for release by the end of July 2018, and television critics wondered whether the quality of the season was to blame on this. Netflix VP Cindy Holland responded that the scheduling of the various Marvel Netflix series, especially the crossover miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]'' which required cast members from all of the series to come together, was to blame for the delay, and that the company had no issue with the quality of the season; on the contrary, Holland described the season as \"fantastic\" and felt it was a \"real return to form\" for the series.<ref name=\"HollandJul2018\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe ending of the miniseries ''The Defenders'', which sees [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] waking up in a convent surrounded by nuns after being presumed dead, implied elements of the season would be inspired by the \"[[Born Again (comics)|Born Again]]\" story arc.<ref name=\"DefendersEnding\" /><ref name=\"DefendersEnding2\" /> [[Charlie Cox]] was excited to adapt \"Born Again\", calling it \"an amazing story\" and that the implications of the story on the season \"would be {{em|very}} exciting\". He cautioned, however, that it would not be a \"page-for-page\" adaptation, \"because if you do [that], then you become a foregone conclusion. There may be elements from \"Born Again\", but I'm sure there will be elements that are unfamiliar and surprising and different in order for the show to be compelling to fans who know the comics very well.\"<ref name=\"CoxTHRAug2017\" /> Oleson crafted an original story for the season, taking \"pieces of some of my favorite comic book runs, that told a larger story\". When pitching his ideas to Marvel, Oleson expected \"more pushback\" from them, but said \"Marvel was incredibly excited about the storyline\" and gave him \"complete freedom\". Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] did note that despite this apparent freedom, Oleson was still required to deal with Murdock's death in ''The Defenders'' which was part of \"a fairly good idea as to what [Marvel] wanted to tackle in terms of story\" before Oleson presented his ideas.<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> Oleson drew inspiration from \"Born Again\" and \"[[Guardian Devil]]\" for the tone of the season.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> Building the season structurally, Oleson felt if any viewer was \"a devout Catholic... you could read into the events of the early episodes as a message from god to Matt\".<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\nAt the start of the season, Oleson noted that Murdock would be \"broken physically, broken emotionally, and broken spiritually\", with his heightened senses failing him. Oleson added, \"He's angry at God, he's angry at the fact that he had risked his life to do God's work, and he's questioning whether or not he was a fool.\" This results in Murdock donning his original black suit, similar to the one he wore in season one, since he \"goes to pretty much the darkest place you can\" and is at a point, Oleson notes, \"[w]hen he realizes that he's incapable of being Daredevil, [and] he would rather just end it than go forward in his life without abilities.\"<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> This also allowed Oleson to return the character \"to the core idea\" of being a boxer's son, \"where his fighting style was more brutal and kind of close in combat\".<ref name=\"OlesonWashingtonPost\" /> Oleson also wanted \"to make the action sequences matter in ways that reflected on characters, or had real stakes\". He added, \"the best writing is one where the action sequences are an inherent part of the story and you cannot predict that the action is going to turn out a certain way.\"<ref name=\"EWSingleTakeFight\" />\n\nRegarding the return of [[Kingpin (character)|Wilson Fisk / Kingpin]], Oleson called him \"smarter, more calculated, and more manipulative,\" and felt his inclusion allowed the ability to \"tell a story that\u2019s relevant to the world around us. I looked at the show as a way to examine how tyrants manipulate in order to push their own agenda and cause fear and distrust.\" Loeb felt the season went \"back to the world of the crime story\".<ref name=\"EWFirstLookSep2018\" /> [[Karen Page]]'s backstory is further explored in the season, with Woll explaining it reveals \"why shooting someone [James Wesley] and covering it up is a bit more in her wheelhouse,\" while [[Foggy Nelson]]'s family and additional backstory is also seen.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> All of the supporting characters in the season were treated \"as emotionally real people as opposed to treating them as props or devices\". Oleson wanted them to be \"the protagonist of their own journey\", modeling this approach after the series ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', and ''[[The Wire]]''.<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\n[[Bullseye (comics)|Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter]] does not go by Bullseye in the season. In the season's final sequence, Dex's spine is being operated on before the camera zooms into his face and a bullseye appears in his eye.<ref name=\"NewsweekBullseye\" /> Oleson \"was very interested in telling an origin story not only about how a character we know from the comics as a full-blown psychopath and killer, but how somebody in real life could be turned into something like that.\" This origin also spoke to the overall theme for the season of fear, which touched the story arcs of Murdock, Page, and Fisk as well. Psychiatrists and psychologists were consulted to help create \"a realistic portrait of Dex and how he might be able to turn into Bullseye\".<ref name=\"OlesonNewsweek\" />\n\n===Casting===\nCox, Woll, Henson, and D'Onofrio all return in the season, reprising their roles as Matt Murdock / Daredevil, Karen Page, Foggy Nelson, and Wilson Fisk / Kingpin, respectively.<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> Rider also returns as Blake Tower.<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\"/> In November 2017, [[Wilson Bethel]] was cast as a new series regular, Benjamin \"Dex\" Poindexter,<ref name=\"Bethel\"/><ref name=\"Bullseye\"/> and in January 2018, [[Joanne Whalley]] was revealed to have been cast as [[Maggie Murdock|Maggie Grace]], a nun who cares deeply about Murdock's safety,<ref name=\"Whalley\"/><ref name=\"WhalleyCollider\"/> and was mentioned at the end of ''The Defenders''.<ref name=\"DefendersEnding\"/> [[Jay Ali]] was cast as Rahul \"Ray\" Nadeem, another FBI agent, by March.<ref name=\"Ali\"/>\n\nRecurring characters in the season include [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Paul Lantom]],<ref name=\"RiderMcRobbie\"/> Danny Johnson as [[Big Ben Donovan|Benjamin Donovan]],<ref name=\"Johnson\"/> [[Geoffrey Cantor (actor)|Geoffrey Cantor]] as [[Mitchell Ellison]],<ref name=\"Cantor\"/> [[Amy Rutberg]] as Marci Stahl,<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> and [[Royce Johnson]] as [[Brett Mahoney]],<ref name=\"Johnson\" /> all of whom are reprising their roles from earlier seasons. Other recurring characters include Stephen Rowe as Nicholas Lee, one of Fisk's lawyers; Kate Udall as Tammy Hattley, the Special Agent in Charge of the FBI; Sunita Deshpande as Seema Nadeem and Noah Huq as Sami Nadeem, Ray's wife and son, respectively; Peter Halpin as Theo Nelson, Foggy's brother created for the series;<ref name=\"TheoHalpin\"/> Holly Cinnamon as Julie Barnes, a friend of Dex; Joe Jones as Felix Manning, Fisk's [[Cleaner (crime)|fixer]]; Kelly McAndrews as Mrs. Shelby, Fisk's surveillance technician; and Matthew McCurdy, Don Castro, Scotty Crow, Richard Prioleau, David Anthony Buglione, Sam Slater, and Andrew Sensenig as FBI agents Wellers, Arinori, Lim, Doyle, Johnson, O'Connor, and Winn, respectively.\n\nCharacters making guest appearances from the first two seasons and other MCU media include [[Matt Gerald]] as [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], John Patrick Hayden as [[Jack Murdock (comics)|Jack Murdock]], [[Annabella Sciorra]] as [[Rosalie Carbone]], following up on her character's introduction in the [[Luke Cage (season 2)|second season]] of ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'',<ref name=\"Sciorra\"/> [[Ron Simons]] as NYPD captain Strieber, following his appearance in ''The Defenders'', and former main cast member [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna-Fisk]].\n\nFormer ''Daredevil'' comic writer and editor [[Roy Thomas]] has a cameo appearance as prison inmate in episode 4.<ref>{{Cite web|author=[[Johnston, Rich]]|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2018/11/01/roy-thomas-cameo-marvel-daredevil-season-3/|title=Roy Thomas Talks at Length About His Cameo on Marvel's Daredevil Season 3|date=2018-11-01|website=Bleeding Cool|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-20}}</ref>\n\n===Design===\nCostume designer Liz Vastola noted Daredevil's black suit was \"purposely ripped and jagged to highlight Matt\u2019s state of mind\" throughout the season. Vastola described Page's wardrobe as \"fucking fierce\" as Page transitions into more of an investigative journalist. Foggy Nelson's look is a \"complete 180\" from what he was wearing in season one, with the character now wearing suits made by [[Martin Greenfield]] Clothiers.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" />\n\n===Filming===\nFilming for the season began on November 13, 2017, in New York City.<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> A week of filming for the season in March 2018 took place in the town of [[Windham, New York]], with set photos revealing that the town was representing Fagan Corners, Vermont,<ref name=\"WindhamFilming\" /> the hometown of Karen Page in the comics.<ref name=\"FaganCorners\" /> The production paid for the renovation of a local store to portray a diner for the series, and used the town's emergency helicopter pad. Additional filming locations for the week included nearby ski areas and a country club.<ref name=\"WindhamFilming\" /> The exterior of the [[Lotte New York Palace Hotel]] served as the building of Fisk's penthouse while under FBI surveillance.<ref name=\"Collider40Things\" /> An abandoned prison in Staten Island was used for the riot sequence in episode four.<ref>https://www.vulture.com/2018/10/daredevil-season-3-one-take-fight-scene.html</ref> Filming for the season was completed by mid-June 2018.<ref name=\"SDCCPlans\" />\n\n\"Blindsided\" features a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. Oleson credited the episode's director Alex Garcia Lopez, writer Lewaa Nasserdeen, and the stunt team for conceiving the idea. Once the sequence was decided, Oleson asked Marvel to give them a full day to rehearse the sequence, which \"no one had ever done before\", since \"it required every single member of the crew to work in perfect sync.\" Oleson said once \"the crew finally pulled it off, it was something spectacular that injected adrenaline into the crew for the remainder of the season.\" The sequence, which does not feature any hidden edit cuts, was meant to be a \"homage, and then one-upping\" of the sequence from season one. Several moments were included in the sequence where the editing team could add a cut if needed, though they did not need them. While editing the episode, Oleson increased the lighting in certain shots \"so that the audience could see that we never cut the camera\".<ref name=\"EWSingleTakeFight\" /> Cox called the completed sequence \"amazing\", adding it was \"a real testament to the stunt team\".<ref name=\"CoxSingleTakeFight\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] once again returns for the season. A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on October 19, 2018.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = \n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano and Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:05\n\n| title2          = Subway Feels\n| length2         = 2:37\n\n| title3          = The Motorcade\n| length3         = 2:43\n\n| title4          = Tazin' in the Dark\n| length4         = 1:53\n\n| title5          = Checking Mail\n| length5         = 3:36\n\n| title6          = To the Nest\n| length6         = 1:36\n\n| title7          = Agent Nadeem\n| length7         = 2:01\n\n| title8          = Not Another Hallway\n| length8         = 5:22\n\n| title9          = Returning Home\n| length9         = 2:04\n\n| title10         = All Star Pitcher\n| length10        = 8:22\n\n| title11         = Ricochet Neighbor\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = The Murdocks\n| length12        = 2:38\n\n| title13         = Trading Judgement\n| length13        = 4:42\n\n| title14         = Fagan Corners\n| length14        = 3:41\n\n| title15         = Elevated Hubbies\n| length15        = 2:35\n\n| title16         = Leading the Blind\n| length16        = 3:24\n\n| title17         = Perp Walk\n| length17        = 2:49\n\n| title18         = Wedding Day Jitters\n| length18        = 4:36\n\n| title19         = Dex Plus One\n| length19        = 5:29\n\n| title20         = The Funeral\n| length20        = 4:08\n\n| title21         = Still Stapled Together\n| length21        = 3:42\n\n| title22         = Nelson Murdock and Page\n| length22        = 2:26\n\n| title23         = End Credits\n| length23        = 1:06\n}}\n\n==Release==\nThe third season of ''Daredevil'' was released on October 19, 2018 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]], worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> Initially thought to be releasing in 2017,<ref name=\"Season3\" /> Netflix COO [[Ted Sarandos]] stated in July 2016 that the season would not debut until 2018 at the earliest, after ''The Defenders'' released on August 18, 2017.<ref name=\"Sarandos2018Releases\" /><ref name=\"DefendersReleaseDate\" /> Cox was hopeful the season would debut in 2018,<ref name=\"CoxTHRAug2017\" /> and in October 2017, Marvel revealed the season was indeed expected to release in 2018.<ref name=\"Oleson\" /> In mid-September 2018, the season's release date was revealed.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nBy mid-June 2018, discussions were underway regarding the season being promoted at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] that year.<ref name=\"SDCCPlans\" /> A teaser trailer for the season was included as a [[post-credits scene]] at the end of [[Iron Fist (season 2)|the second season of ''Iron Fist'']].<ref name=\"IFSeason2Teaser\" /> A full trailer for the season was released on October 4, 2018, which also confirmed Bethel's role as Benjamin Poindexter in the season.<ref name=\"Bullseye\" /> Cox, Henson, Woll, D'Onofrio, Whalley, Bethel, and Ali promoted the season at New York Comic Con on October 6, 2018.<ref name=\"NYCC2018Panel\" />\n\n==Critical response==\nThe review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 97% approval rating based on 62 reviews, with an average rating of 8.06/10.

Created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Tarzan first appeared in the [[novel]] ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (magazine publication [[1912 in literature|1912]], book publication [[1914 in literature|1914]]), and subsequently in 25 sequels, several authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized. The film version of Tarzan as the noble savage (''\"Me Tarzan, You Jane\"''), as acted by [[Johnny Weissmuller]], does not reflect the original character in the novels, who is gracious and highly sophisticated.\n\n==Character biography==\nTarzan is the son of a British lord and lady who were [[Marooning|marooned]] on the Atlantic coast of [[Africa]] by [[mutiny|mutineers]]. When Tarzan was an infant, his mother died, and his father was killed by [[Kerchak]], leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted. Soon after his parents' death, Tarzan became a feral child, and his tribe of apes are known as the [[Mangani]], [[Great Ape]]s of a species unknown to science. [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories occurring during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, ''[[Jungle Tales of Tarzan]]''. Tarzan is his ape name; his English name is John Clayton, [[Viscount]] Greystoke (according to Burroughs in ''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (novel)|Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]''; [[Earl]] of Greystoke in later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 film ''[[Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes|Greystoke]]''). In fact, Burroughs's narrator in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' describes both Clayton and Greystoke as fictitious names, implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different real name.\n\nAs an eighteen-year-old young adult, Tarzan meets a young American woman, [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]]. She, her father, and others of their party are marooned on the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's human parents were twenty years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In ''[[The Return of Tarzan]]'', Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books he lives with her for a time in England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name [[Korak (character)|Korak]] (\"the Killer\"). Tarzan is contemptuous of what he sees as the hypocrisy of civilization, and he and Jane return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.\n\nAs revealed in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', Tarzan, Jane, Tarzan's monkey friend Nkima, and their allies gained some of the Kavuru's pills that grant immortality to their consumer.\n\n==Characterization==\n[[File:John Charles Dollman - Mowgli made leader of the Bandar Log.jpg|alt=Mowgli reclining, surrounded by monkeys|thumb|Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli was a likely influence on Tarzan, including his ease with non-human [[primate]]s]]\nBurroughs created an elegant version of the [[wild man]] figure largely unalloyed with character flaws or faults. Tarzan is described as being tall, athletic, handsome, and tanned, with grey eyes and long black hair. He wears almost [[nudity|no clothes]], except for a  [[loincloth]]. Emotionally, he is courageous, intelligent, loyal, and steadfast. He is presented as behaving ethically in most situations, except when seeking vengeance under the motivation of grief, as when his ape mother Kala is killed in ''Tarzan of the Apes'', or when he believes Jane has been murdered in ''Tarzan the Untamed''. He is deeply in love with his wife and totally devoted to her; in numerous situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan politely but firmly declines their attentions. When presented with a situation where a weaker individual or party is being preyed upon by a stronger foe, Tarzan invariably takes the side of the weaker party. In dealing with other men, Tarzan is firm and forceful. With male friends, he is reserved but deeply loyal and generous. As a host, he is, likewise, generous and gracious. As a leader, he commands devoted loyalty.\n\nIn keeping with these noble characteristics, Tarzan's philosophy embraces an extreme form of \"return to nature\". Although he is able to pass within society as a civilized individual, he prefers to \"strip off the thin veneer of civilization\", as Burroughs often puts it.<ref name=\"return\">''The Return of Tarzan'', chapter 2, being the earliest instance.</ref> His preferred dress is a knife and a [[loincloth]] of animal hide, his preferred abode is any convenient tree branch when he desires to sleep, and his favored food is raw meat, killed by himself; even better if he is able to bury it a week so that [[putrefaction]] has had a chance to tenderize it a bit.\n\nTarzan's [[Anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosophy was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was [[Jane Goodall]], who describes the Tarzan series as having a major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.<ref name=\"goodall\">See The Jane Goodall Institute's Biography of Jane Goodall [http://www.janegoodall.org/janes-story].</ref>\n\n[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Mowgli]] has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation of Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other [[List of fictional feral children|\"wild boy\"]] characters.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n[[File:The Adventures of Tarzan (1921) - 2.jpg|alt=Tarzan holding a tiger corpse above his head|thumb|Tarzan's agility, speed, and strength allow him to kill a Leopard in 1921's ''[[The Adventures of Tarzan]]''.]]\nTarzan's jungle upbringing gives him abilities far beyond those of ordinary humans. These include climbing, clinging, and leaping as well as any great ape. He uses branches and swings from vines to travel at great speed, a skill acquired among the anthropoid apes.\n\nHis strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and swimming skills are extraordinary in comparison to normal men. He has wrestled full grown bull [[ape]]s and [[gorilla]]s, [[lion]]s, [[Rhinoceros|rhino]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[Python (genus)|python]]s, [[shark]]s, [[tiger]]s, giant [[seahorse]]s and even [[dinosaur]]s (when he visited [[Pellucidar]]). Tarzan is a skilled tracker and uses his exceptional hearing and keen sense of smell to follow prey or avoid predators. \n\nExtremely intelligent, Tarzan was literate in English before he first encountered other English-speaking people. His literacy is self-taught after several years in his early teens by visiting the log cabin of his infancy and looking at children's primer/picture books. He eventually reads every book in his father's portable book collection and is fully aware of geography, basic world history, and his family tree.He is \"found\" by a traveling Frenchman who teaches him the basics of human speech and returns him to England.\n\nTarzan can learn a new language in days, ultimately speaking many languages, including that of the great apes, [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], many [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] dialects, Arabic, ancient [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ancient [[Latin]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], and the languages of the [[Tarzan and the Ant Men|Ant Men]] and of [[Pellucidar]].\n\nUnlike depictions in black and white movies of the 1930s after learning to speak a language in the novels, Tarzan/John Clayton is very articulate, reserved and does not speak in broken English as the classic movies depict him. He can communicate with many species of jungle animals, and has been shown to be a skilled impressionist, able to mimic the sound of a gunshot perfectly.\n\n==Literature==\n{{main|Tarzan (book series)}}\n[[File:Tarzan of the Apes in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Dust-jacket illustration of ''Tarzan of the Apes'' first edition.]]\n[[File:Tarzan of the Apes.djvu|alt=The title page|thumb|page=7|A 1914 publication of ''Tarzan of the Apes'' (originally from 1912).]]\nTarzan has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world.<ref>John Clute and Peter Nicholls, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', St. Martin's Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}, p. 178, \"Tarzan is a remarkable creation, and possibly the best-known fictional character of the century.\"</ref> In addition to more than two dozen books by Burroughs and a handful more by authors with the blessing of Burroughs' estate, the character has appeared in [[film]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic strip]]s, and [[comic books]]. Numerous parodies and pirated works have also appeared.\n\nBurroughs considered other names for the character, including \"Zantar\" and \"Tublat Zan,\" before he settled on \"Tarzan\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarzan.org/history_of_tarzan_part2.html |title=Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc |publisher=Tarzan.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\nEven though the copyright on ''Tarzan of the Apes'' has [[public domain|expired]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] and other countries, the name Tarzan is claimed as a [[trademark]] of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]]\n\nIt is also worth noting that Burroughs' use of dates and of time passing is constantly inconsistent in his novels; in fact, there are downright contradictions in the series. In the first book ''Tarzan Of The Apes'' it is implied that Tarzan was born early in 1888 and the arrival of Jane is said to have occurred in 1909, which would make him 20 years old. In ''Tarzan Of The Apes'', chapter 9, Burroughs states:\n:Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his native language. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no great river to bring down the savage natives of the interior.\nTwo paragraphs later Mbonga's warriors enter. Yet in ''The Return Of Tarzan'', chapter 5, when the ape man has almost killed the Count de Coude, Tarzan states:\n:Until I was fifteen I had never seen a human being. I was twenty before I saw a white man.\nHowever, the book makes multiple references to the fact that Tarzan\u2019s parents, John and Alice Clayton, were missing for only twenty years, which means that Tarzan would only be 18\u201319 years of age. Numerous authorised movies and novels have all agreed with the notion of Tarzan being 18 years old during the events of the first novel. A later novel, ''Tarzan the Untamed'', faces a similar problem with the novel being set in the year 1914, despite the fact that Tarzan and Jane's son, Jack 'Korak' Clayton is supposed to be 18 years old. It is believed among fans that Burroughs did this deliberately to give an illusion that Tarzan had once been an actual person and that Burroughs was trying to conceal his real identity. In the first novel it is mentioned: \n:I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale. When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative. I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true. The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies. If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.\n\nBurroughs mentions immediately after this that 'John Clayton' is itself a fictitious name, invented by 'Tarzan' to mask his real identity.\n\n===Critical reception===\nWhile ''Tarzan of the Apes'' met with some critical success, subsequent books in the series received a cooler reception and have been criticized for being derivative and formulaic. The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on [[coincidence]]) strain credulity. According to [[Rudyard Kipling]] (who himself wrote stories of a [[feral child]], ''[[The Jungle Book]]'''s [[Mowgli]]), Burroughs wrote ''Tarzan of the Apes'' just so that he could \"find out how bad a book he could write and get away with it\".<ref>Gail Bederman,''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917,'' University of Chicago Press, 1995, pages 219.</ref>\n\nWhile Burroughs is not a polished novelist, he is a vivid storyteller, and many of his novels are still in print.<ref>John Clute and Peter Nicholls, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', St. Martin's Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}, p. 178, \"It has often been said that ERB's works have small literary or intellectual merit. Nevertheless,...because ERB had a genius for the literalization of the dream, they have endured.\"</ref> In 1963, author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Burroughs for creating a compelling \"daydream figure\".<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/features/gore-vidal-archive/tarzan-revisited-1263 \"Tarzan Revisited\" by Gore Vidal].</ref> Critical reception grew more positive with the 1981 study by Erling B.

Burroughs' [[melodrama]]tic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes, appeal to a worldwide fan base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erblist.com/erbmania/tangor/ape-english.html |title=Bozarth, David Bruce. \"Ape-English Dictionary\" |publisher=Erblist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Tarzan 06014 nevit.jpg|thumb|left|Tarzan walking, in this display from an Ankara amusement park.]]\n\nThe Tarzan books and movies employ extensive [[stereotype|stereotyping]] to a degree common in the times in which they were written. This has led to criticism in later years, with changing social views and customs, including charges of [[racism]] since the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_5_59/ai_55722257 | work=Humanist | title=Tarzan&nbsp;\u2013 Review | first=Bertram | last=Rothschild | year=1999}}</ref> The early books give a pervasively negative and stereotypical portrayal of native [[Africans]], including [[Arab]]s. In ''The Return of Tarzan'', Arabs are \"surly looking\" and call Christians \"dogs\", while blacks are \"lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering\". One could make an equal argument that when it came to blacks that Burroughs was simply depicting unwholesome characters as unwholesome and the good ones in a better light{{mdash}}as in Chapter 6 of ''[[Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar]]'' where Burroughs writes of Mugambi: \"nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil\".<ref>''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'', A.C. McClurg, 1918</ref> Other groups are stereotyped as well. A Swede has \"a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails\", and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (except the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete.<ref>Edgar Rice Burroughs, ''The Return of Tarzan'', Grosset & Dunlap, 1915 ASIN B000WRZ2NG.</ref> In later books, Africans are portrayed somewhat more realistically as people. For example, in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', [[Stereotypes of Africans|while the depiction of Africans remains relatively primitive]], they are portrayed more individualistically, with a greater variety of character traits (positive and negative), while the main villains are white people, although Burroughs never loses his distaste for European royalty.<ref>Edgar Rice Burroughs, ''Tarzan's Quest'', Grosset & Dunlop, 1936, ASIN B000O3K9EU.</ref>\n\nBurroughs' opinions, manifested through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect common attitudes in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and [[sexist]]. However Thomas F. Bertonneau writes about Burroughs' \"conception of the feminine that elevates the woman to the same level as the man and that{{mdash}}in such characters as Dian of the Pellucidar novels or Dejah Thoris of the Barsoom novels{{mdash}}figures forth a female type who corresponds neither to desperate housewife, full-lipped prom-date, middle-level careerist office-manager, nor frowning ideological feminist-professor, but who exceeds all these by bounds in her realized humanity and in so doing suggests their insipidity.\"<ref>[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4066] Edgar Rice Burroughs and Masculine Narrative by Thomas F. Bertonneau</ref> The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in [[violence against women]] or in [[Ethnic hatred|racially motivated violence]]. In ''Tarzan of the Apes'', details of a background of suffering experienced at the hands of whites by Mbonga's \"once great\" people are repeatedly told with evident sympathy, and in explanation or even justification of their current animosity toward whites.\n\nAlthough the character of Tarzan does not directly engage in violence against women, feminist scholars have critiqued the presence of other sympathetic male characters who do so with Tarzan's approval.<ref name=Torgovnick>{{cite book|last=Torgovnick|first=Mariana|title=Gone Primitive|url=https://archive.org/details/goneprimitive0090|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago press|isbn=978-0226808321|pages=[https://archive.org/details/goneprimitive0090/page/42 42\u201372]}}</ref> In ''[[Tarzan and the Ant Men]]'', the men of a fictional tribe of creatures called the Alali gain social dominance of their society by beating Alali women into submission with weapons that Tarzan willingly provides them.<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/> Following the battle, Burroughs states: \"To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had taken\u2014the son of The First Woman seized a female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own glowing with love and admiration. (178)\"<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/> While Burroughs depicts some female characters with humanistic equalizing elements, Torgovnick argues that violent scenes against women in the context of male political and social domination are condoned in his writing, reinforcing a notion of gendered hierarchy where [[patriarchy]] is portrayed as the natural pinnacle of society.<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/>\n\nIn regards to race, a superior\u2013inferior relationship with valuation is also accordingly implied, as it is unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations can be seen in most other interactions between differing people, although one could argue that such interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is no story. According to [[James Loewen]]'s ''Sundown Towns'', this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a former [[Sundown town]] (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it).\n\nGail Bederman takes a different view in her ''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917''. There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that \"civilization\" is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on 1912's ''Tarzan of the Apes'' because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male by the standards of 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, \"an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon\", does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his \"masculine impulse to rape\". However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, \"lyncher Tarzan\" actually enjoys killing black people, for example the cannibalistic Mbongans. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as \"Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men\". The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane (who in the original novel is not British, but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland) from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees \"civilized\" Africans farming, his first instinct is to kill them just for being black. \"Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims{{mdash}}cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood{{mdash}}lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man.\"\n\nDespite embodying all the tropes of white supremacy espoused or rejected by the people she had reviewed ([[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Ida B. Wells]]), Bederman states that, in all probability, Burroughs was not trying to make any kind of statement or echo any of them. \"He probably never heard of any of them.\" Instead, Bederman writes that Burroughs proves her point because, in telling racist and sexist stories whose protagonist boasted of killing blacks, he was not being unusual at all, but was instead just being a typical 1912 white American.\n\nTarzan is a white European male who grows up with apes. According to \"Taking Tarzan Seriously\" by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is confused with the social hierarchy that he is a part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan is the only one who is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of his world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion is that he does not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle is a microcosm for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite his odd circumstances. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common in white men.<ref>Gail Bederman,''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917,'' University of Chicago Press, 1995, pages 224\u2013232.</ref><ref>Turgovnick, Mariana \u201cTaking Tarzan Seriously\u201d from Gone Primitive, University of Chicago Press 1990 [Ch 2 pp.42\u201372]</ref>\n\n===Unauthorized works===\n{{main|Tarzan (book series)#Unauthorized works}}\n\nAfter Burroughs' death a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such works. The most notable example in the [[United States]] was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous \"Barton Werper\" that appeared 1964\u201365 by Gold Star Books (part of [[Charlton Comics]]). As a result of legal action by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]], they were taken off the market.<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/werper_barton Werper, Barton ]</ref> Similar series appeared in other countries, notably [[Argentina]], [[Israel]], and some Arab countries.\n\n===Modern fiction===\nIn 1972, [[science fiction]] author [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]] wrote ''[[Tarzan Alive]]'', a biography of Tarzan utilizing the [[Frame tale|frame device]] that he was a real person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with [[Doc Savage]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]], are the cornerstones of the [[Wold Newton family]]. Farmer wrote two novels, ''[[Hadon of Ancient Opar]]'' and ''[[Flight to Opar]]'', set in the distant past and giving the antecedents of the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], which plays an important role in the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's ''[[A Feast Unknown]]'', and its two sequels ''[[Lord of the Trees]]'' and ''[[The Mad Goblin]]'', are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon. ''A Feast Unknown'' is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Tarzan in other media==\n{{main|Tarzan in film and other non-print media}}\n[[File:Poster - Tarzan the Fearless 01.jpg|thumb|Tarzan, as depicted by [[Buster Crabbe]] in the film serial ''[[Tarzan the Fearless]]'']]\n{{in popular culture|date=September 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Film===\nThe first Tarzan films were silent pictures adapted from the original Tarzan novels, which appeared within a few years of the character's creation. The first actor to portray the adult Tarzan was [[Elmo Lincoln]] in 1918's film ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]''. With the advent of talking pictures, a popular Tarzan movie franchise was developed, which lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s. Starting with ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' in 1932 through twelve films until 1948, the franchise was anchored by former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]] in the title role. Weissmuller and his immediate successors were enjoined to portray the ape-man as a [[noble savage]] speaking broken English, in marked contrast to the cultured aristocrat of Burroughs's novels.\n\nWith the exception of Burroughs' co-produced ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', this \"me Tarzan, you Jane\" characterization of Tarzan persisted until the late 1950s, when producer [[Sy Weintraub]], having bought the film rights from producer [[Sol Lesser]], produced ''[[Tarzan's Greatest Adventure]]'' followed by eight other films and a television series. The Weintraub productions portray a Tarzan that is closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original concept in the novels: a jungle lord who speaks grammatical English and is well educated and familiar with civilization. Most Tarzan films made before the mid-fifties were black-and-white films shot on studio sets, with stock jungle footage edited in. The Weintraub productions from 1959 on were shot in foreign locations and were in color.\n\nThere were also several serials and features that competed with the main franchise, including ''[[Tarzan the Fearless]]'' (1933) starring [[Buster Crabbe]] and ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'' (1935) starring [[Bruce Bennett|Herman Brix]]. The latter serial was unique for its period in that it was partially filmed on location (Guatemala) and portrayed Tarzan as educated. It was the only Tarzan film project for which [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was personally involved in the production.\n\nTarzan films from the 1930s on often featured Tarzan's chimpanzee companion [[Cheeta]], his consort Jane (not usually given a last name), and an adopted son, usually known only as \"Boy.\" The Weintraub productions from 1959 on dropped the character of Jane and portrayed Tarzan as a lone adventurer. Later Tarzan films have been occasional and somewhat idiosyncratic.\n\nMore recently, [[Tony Goldwyn]] portrayed Tarzan in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney\u2019s]] [[Tarzan (1999 film)|animated film of the same name]] (1999). This version marked a new beginning for the ape man, taking its inspiration equally from Burroughs and the 1984 live-action film ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]''.\n\nSince ''Greystoke'', two additional live-action Tarzan movies have been released, 1998's ''[[Tarzan and the Lost City (film)|Tarzan and the Lost City]]'' and 2016's ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'', both [[period piece]]s that drew inspiration from Edgar Rice Burroughs' writings.\n\n===Radio===\n{{main|Tarzan (radio program)}}\n\nTarzan was the hero of two popular radio programs in the [[United States]]. The first aired from 1932\u20131936 with [[James Pierce]] in the role of Tarzan. The second ran from 1951\u20131953 with [[Lamont Johnson]] in the title role.<ref>Robert R. Barrett, ''Tarzan on Radio'', Radio Spirits, 1999.</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{main|List of TV series based on Tarzan}}\nTelevision later emerged as a primary vehicle bringing the character to the public. From the mid-1950s, all the extant sound Tarzan films became staples of Saturday morning television aimed at young and teenaged viewers. In 1958, movie Tarzan [[Gordon Scott]] filmed three episodes for a prospective television series. The program did not sell, but a different live action ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' series produced by [[Sy Weintraub]] and starring [[Ron Ely]] ran on [[NBC]] from 1966 to 1968. This depiction of Tarzan is a well-educated bachelor who grew tired of urban civilization and is in his native African jungle once again.\n\nAn animated series from [[Filmation]], ''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]'', aired from 1976 to 1977, followed by the anthology programs ''[[Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour]]'' (1977\u20131978), ''[[Tarzan and the Super 7]]'' (1978\u20131980), ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour]]'' (1980\u20131981), and ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour]]'' (1981\u20131982). In those cartoons, Tarzan was voiced by [[Robert Ridgely]].\n\n[[Joe Lara]] starred in the title role in ''[[Tarzan in Manhattan]]'' (1989), an offbeat TV movie, and later returned in a completely different interpretation in ''[[Tarzan: The Epic Adventures]]'' (1996), a new live-action series.\n\nIn between the two productions with Lara, ''[[Tarz\u00e1n]]'', a half-hour syndicated series ran from 1991 through 1994. In this version of the show, Tarzan was portrayed as a blond environmentalist, with Jane turned into a French ecologist.\n\nDisney\u2019s animated series ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2001\u20132003) was a spin-off from its animated film.\n[[File:Travis Fimmel by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=Fimmel at a microphone|thumb|Australian [[Travis Fimmel]] (pictured 2015) briefly portrayed Tarzan on television]]\nThe latest television series was the short-lived live-action ''[[Tarzan (2003 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' (2003), which starred male model [[Travis Fimmel]] and updated the setting to contemporary [[New York City]], with Jane as a police detective, played by [[Sarah Wayne Callies]]. The series was cancelled after only eight episodes.\n\n''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured recurring sketches with the speech-impaired trio of \"[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1987\u20131988#Tonto, Tarzan, and, Frankenstein's Monster|Tonto, Tarzan, and Frankenstein's Monster]]\". In those sketches, Tarzan is portrayed by [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\n===Stage===\nA 1921 Broadway production of ''Tarzan of The Apes'' starred Ronald Adair as Tarzan and Ethel Dwyer as Jane Porter. In 1976, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote a musical entitled ''T. Zee'', loosely based on Tarzan but restyled in a rock idiom. ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', a musical stage adaptation of the 1999 animated feature, opened at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] on Broadway on May 10, 2006. The show, a [[Disney Theatrical]] production, was directed and designed by Bob Crowley. The same version of Tarzan that was played at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] is being played throughout Europe and has been a huge success in the Netherlands. The Broadway show closed on July 8, 2007. Tarzan also appeared in the ''Tarzan Rocks!'' show at the Theatre in the Wild at [[Walt Disney World Resort]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. The show closed in 2006.\n\n===Video games===\nA game under the title ''[[Tarzan Goes Ape]]'', with little connection to the franchise, was released in the 1980s for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. A ''[[Tarzan (computer game)|Tarzan]]'' computer game by Michael Archer was produced by [[Martech]]. Disney's Tarzan had seen video games released for the [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Game Boy Color]]. Followed by ''[[Disney's Tarzan Untamed]]'' for the PS2 and Gamecube and ''[[Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Tarzan also appeared in the PS2 game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]],'' although this Tarzan was shown in the Disney context, not the original conceptional idea of Tarzan by Burroughs. In the first ''[[Rayman]]'', a Tarzanesque version of Rayman named Tarayzan appears in the Dream Forest.\n\n===Action figures===\nThroughout the 1970s [[Mego Corporation]] licensed the Tarzan character and produced 8\" action figures which they included in their \"World's Greatest Super Heroes\" line of characters. In 1975 they also produced a 3\" \"Bendy\" figure made of poseable, malleable plastic.\n\n===Ephemera===\nSeveral Tarzan-themed products have been manufactured, including [[View-Master]] reels and packets, numerous Tarzan coloring books, children's books, follow-the-dots, and activity books.\n\n===Tarzan in comics===\n{{main|Tarzan (comics)}}\n''Tarzan of the Apes'' was adapted in newspaper strip form, in early 1929, with illustrations by [[Hal Foster]]. A [[full page]] [[Sunday strip]] began March 15, 1931 by [[Rex Maxon]]. Over the years, many artists have drawn the ''Tarzan'' comic strip, notably [[Burne Hogarth]], [[Russ Manning]], and [[Mike Grell]]. The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on July 29, 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints circa 2000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine. [[NBM Publishing]] did a high quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.\n\nTarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as ''Sparkler'', ''Tip Top Comics'' and ''Single Series''. [[Western Publishing]] published ''Tarzan'' in [[Dell Comics]]'s ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, ''Tarzan'', published through [[Dell Comics]] and later [[Gold Key Comics]] from January\u2013February 1948 to February 1972; many of these issues adapted Burroughs' novels. [[DC Comics|DC]] took over the series in 1972, publishing ''Tarzan'' #207\u2013258 from April 1972 to February 1977, including work by [[Joe Kubert]]. In 1977 the series moved to [[Marvel Comics]], which restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. Marvel issued ''Tarzan'' #1\u201329 (as well as three ''Annual''s), from June 1977 to October 1979, mainly by [[John Buscema]]. Following the conclusion of the Marvel series the character had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this period [[Blackthorne Comics]] published ''Tarzan'' in 1986, and [[Malibu Comics]] published ''Tarzan'' comics in 1992. [[Dark Horse Comics]] has published various ''Tarzan'' series from 1996 to the present, including reprints of works from previous publishers like Gold Key and DC, and joint projects with other publishers featuring crossovers with other characters.\n\nThere have also been a number of different comic book projects from other publishers over the years, in addition to various minor appearances of Tarzan in other comic books. The Japanese [[manga]] series ''Jungle no Ouja Ta-chan'' ([[Jungle King Tar-chan]]) by [[Tokuhiro Masaya]] was based loosely on Tarzan. Also, manga \"god\" [[Osamu Tezuka]] created a Tarzan manga in 1948 entitled ''Tarzan no Himitsu Kichi'' (''Tarzan's Secret Base'').\n\n==Works inspired by Tarzan==\n[[Jerry Siegel]] named Tarzan and another Burroughs character, [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], as early inspiration for his creation of [[Superman]].<ref>http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/9079/Tarzan-was-an-early-inspiration-for-the-character-of-Superman</ref>\n\nTarzan's popularity inspired numerous imitators in [[pulp magazine]]s. A number of these, like [[Kwa of the Jungle|Kwa]] and [[Ka-Zar of the pulps|Ka-Zar]] were direct or loosely veiled copies; others, like [[Polaris of the Snows]], were similar characters in different settings, or with different gimmicks. Of these characters the most popular was [[Ki-Gor]], the subject of fifty-nine novels that appeared between winter 1939 to spring 1954 in the magazine ''[[Jungle Stories]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Great Pulp Heroes |last= Hutchison |first= Don |year= 2007 |publisher= Book Republic Press |isbn= 978-1-58042-184-3|page= 195}}</ref>\n\n==Species named after Tarzan==\n[[File:Calumma tarzan 01.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The chameleon on a branch|''Clumma tarzan'' in Madagascar]]\nTarzan is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of chameleon, ''[[Calumma tarzan]]'', which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]].<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

(\"Tarzan\", pp. 260\u2013261).</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nTarzan is often used as a [[nickname]] to indicate a similarity between a person's characteristics and that of the fictional character. Individuals with an exceptional 'ape-like' ability to climb, cling and leap beyond that of ordinary humans may often receive the nickname 'Tarzan'.<ref>[http://www.herald.ie/news/courts/taxiqueue-jumper-punched-reveller-in-tarzanstyle-attack-2837390.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> An example is retired [[United States|American]] [[baseball]] player [[Joe Wallis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/cooperstown-confidential-tarzan-joe-wallis1/ |last=Markusen|first= Bruce|title=Cooperstown Confidential: Tarzan Joe Wallis|publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\nComedian [[Carol Burnett]] was often prompted by her audiences to perform her trademark [[Tarzan yell]].

Created by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], Tarzan first appeared in the [[novel]] ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' (magazine publication [[1912 in literature|1912]], book publication [[1914 in literature|1914]]), and subsequently in 25 sequels, several authorized books by other authors, and innumerable works in other media, both authorized and unauthorized. The film version of Tarzan as the noble savage (''\"Me Tarzan, You Jane\"''), as acted by [[Johnny Weissmuller]], does not reflect the original character in the novels, who is gracious and highly sophisticated.\n\n==Character biography==\nTarzan is the son of a British lord and lady who were [[Marooning|marooned]] on the Atlantic coast of [[Africa]] by [[mutiny|mutineers]]. When Tarzan was an infant, his mother died, and his father was killed by [[Kerchak]], leader of the ape tribe by whom Tarzan was adopted. Soon after his parents' death, Tarzan became a feral child, and his tribe of apes are known as the [[Mangani]], [[Great Ape]]s of a species unknown to science. [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] is his ape mother. Burroughs added stories occurring during Tarzan's adolescence in his sixth Tarzan book, ''[[Jungle Tales of Tarzan]]''. Tarzan is his ape name; his English name is John Clayton, [[Viscount]] Greystoke (according to Burroughs in ''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (novel)|Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]''; [[Earl]] of Greystoke in later, less canonical sources, notably the 1984 film ''[[Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes|Greystoke]]''). In fact, Burroughs's narrator in ''Tarzan of the Apes'' describes both Clayton and Greystoke as fictitious names, implying that, within the fictional world that Tarzan inhabits, he may have a different real name.\n\nAs an eighteen-year-old young adult, Tarzan meets a young American woman, [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]]. She, her father, and others of their party are marooned on the same coastal jungle area where Tarzan's human parents were twenty years earlier. When Jane returns to the United States, Tarzan leaves the jungle in search of her, his one true love. In ''[[The Return of Tarzan]]'', Tarzan and Jane marry. In later books he lives with her for a time in England. They have one son, Jack, who takes the ape name [[Korak (character)|Korak]] (\"the Killer\"). Tarzan is contemptuous of what he sees as the hypocrisy of civilization, and he and Jane return to Africa, making their home on an extensive estate that becomes a base for Tarzan's later adventures.\n\nAs revealed in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', Tarzan, Jane, Tarzan's monkey friend Nkima, and their allies gained some of the Kavuru's pills that grant immortality to their consumer.\n\n==Characterization==\n[[File:John Charles Dollman - Mowgli made leader of the Bandar Log.jpg|alt=Mowgli reclining, surrounded by monkeys|thumb|Rudyard Kipling's Mowgli was a likely influence on Tarzan, including his ease with non-human [[primate]]s]]\nBurroughs created an elegant version of the [[wild man]] figure largely unalloyed with character flaws or faults. Tarzan is described as being tall, athletic, handsome, and tanned, with grey eyes and long black hair. He wears almost [[nudity|no clothes]], except for a  [[loincloth]]. Emotionally, he is courageous, intelligent, loyal, and steadfast. He is presented as behaving ethically in most situations, except when seeking vengeance under the motivation of grief, as when his ape mother Kala is killed in ''Tarzan of the Apes'', or when he believes Jane has been murdered in ''Tarzan the Untamed''. He is deeply in love with his wife and totally devoted to her; in numerous situations where other women express their attraction to him, Tarzan politely but firmly declines their attentions. When presented with a situation where a weaker individual or party is being preyed upon by a stronger foe, Tarzan invariably takes the side of the weaker party. In dealing with other men, Tarzan is firm and forceful. With male friends, he is reserved but deeply loyal and generous. As a host, he is, likewise, generous and gracious. As a leader, he commands devoted loyalty.\n\nIn keeping with these noble characteristics, Tarzan's philosophy embraces an extreme form of \"return to nature\". Although he is able to pass within society as a civilized individual, he prefers to \"strip off the thin veneer of civilization\", as Burroughs often puts it.<ref name=\"return\">''The Return of Tarzan'', chapter 2, being the earliest instance.</ref> His preferred dress is a knife and a [[loincloth]] of animal hide, his preferred abode is any convenient tree branch when he desires to sleep, and his favored food is raw meat, killed by himself; even better if he is able to bury it a week so that [[putrefaction]] has had a chance to tenderize it a bit.\n\nTarzan's [[Anarcho-primitivism|primitivist]] philosophy was absorbed by countless fans, amongst whom was [[Jane Goodall]], who describes the Tarzan series as having a major influence on her childhood. She states that she felt she would be a much better spouse for Tarzan than his fictional wife, Jane, and that when she first began to live among and study the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s she was fulfilling her childhood dream of living among the great apes just as Tarzan did.<ref name=\"goodall\">See The Jane Goodall Institute's Biography of Jane Goodall [http://www.janegoodall.org/janes-story].</ref>\n\n[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s [[Mowgli]] has been cited as a major influence on Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation of Tarzan. Mowgli was also an influence for a number of other [[List of fictional feral children|\"wild boy\"]] characters.\n\n==Skills and abilities==\n[[File:The Adventures of Tarzan (1921) - 2.jpg|alt=Tarzan holding a tiger corpse above his head|thumb|Tarzan's agility, speed, and strength allow him to kill a Leopard in 1921's ''[[The Adventures of Tarzan]]''.]]\nTarzan's jungle upbringing gives him abilities far beyond those of ordinary humans. These include climbing, clinging, and leaping as well as any great ape. He uses branches and swings from vines to travel at great speed, a skill acquired among the anthropoid apes.\n\nHis strength, speed, stamina, agility, reflexes, and swimming skills are extraordinary in comparison to normal men. He has wrestled full grown bull [[ape]]s and [[gorilla]]s, [[lion]]s, [[Rhinoceros|rhino]]s, [[crocodile]]s, [[Python (genus)|python]]s, [[shark]]s, [[tiger]]s, giant [[seahorse]]s and even [[dinosaur]]s (when he visited [[Pellucidar]]). Tarzan is a skilled tracker and uses his exceptional hearing and keen sense of smell to follow prey or avoid predators. \n\nExtremely intelligent, Tarzan was literate in English before he first encountered other English-speaking people. His literacy is self-taught after several years in his early teens by visiting the log cabin of his infancy and looking at children's primer/picture books. He eventually reads every book in his father's portable book collection and is fully aware of geography, basic world history, and his family tree.He is \"found\" by a traveling Frenchman who teaches him the basics of human speech and returns him to England.\n\nTarzan can learn a new language in days, ultimately speaking many languages, including that of the great apes, [[French language|French]], [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[English language|English]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], many [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] dialects, Arabic, ancient [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], ancient [[Latin]], [[Mayan languages|Mayan]], and the languages of the [[Tarzan and the Ant Men|Ant Men]] and of [[Pellucidar]].\n\nUnlike depictions in black and white movies of the 1930s after learning to speak a language in the novels, Tarzan/John Clayton is very articulate, reserved and does not speak in broken English as the classic movies depict him. He can communicate with many species of jungle animals, and has been shown to be a skilled impressionist, able to mimic the sound of a gunshot perfectly.\n\n==Literature==\n{{main|Tarzan (book series)}}\n[[File:Tarzan of the Apes in color.jpg|thumb|upright|Dust-jacket illustration of ''Tarzan of the Apes'' first edition.]]\n[[File:Tarzan of the Apes.djvu|alt=The title page|thumb|page=7|A 1914 publication of ''Tarzan of the Apes'' (originally from 1912).]]\nTarzan has been called one of the best-known literary characters in the world.<ref>John Clute and Peter Nicholls, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', St. Martin's Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}, p. 178, \"Tarzan is a remarkable creation, and possibly the best-known fictional character of the century.\"</ref> In addition to more than two dozen books by Burroughs and a handful more by authors with the blessing of Burroughs' estate, the character has appeared in [[film]]s, [[radio]], [[television]], [[comic strip]]s, and [[comic books]]. Numerous parodies and pirated works have also appeared.\n\nBurroughs considered other names for the character, including \"Zantar\" and \"Tublat Zan,\" before he settled on \"Tarzan\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tarzan.org/history_of_tarzan_part2.html |title=Edgar Rice Burroughs Inc |publisher=Tarzan.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\nEven though the copyright on ''Tarzan of the Apes'' has [[public domain|expired]] in the [[United States|United States of America]] and other countries, the name Tarzan is claimed as a [[trademark]] of [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]]\n\nIt is also worth noting that Burroughs' use of dates and of time passing is constantly inconsistent in his novels; in fact, there are downright contradictions in the series. In the first book ''Tarzan Of The Apes'' it is implied that Tarzan was born early in 1888 and the arrival of Jane is said to have occurred in 1909, which would make him 20 years old. In ''Tarzan Of The Apes'', chapter 9, Burroughs states:\n:Thus, at eighteen, we find him, an English lordling, who could speak no English, and yet who could read and write his native language. Never had he seen a human being other than himself, for the little area traversed by his tribe was watered by no great river to bring down the savage natives of the interior.\nTwo paragraphs later Mbonga's warriors enter. Yet in ''The Return Of Tarzan'', chapter 5, when the ape man has almost killed the Count de Coude, Tarzan states:\n:Until I was fifteen I had never seen a human being. I was twenty before I saw a white man.\nHowever, the book makes multiple references to the fact that Tarzan\u2019s parents, John and Alice Clayton, were missing for only twenty years, which means that Tarzan would only be 18\u201319 years of age. Numerous authorised movies and novels have all agreed with the notion of Tarzan being 18 years old during the events of the first novel. A later novel, ''Tarzan the Untamed'', faces a similar problem with the novel being set in the year 1914, despite the fact that Tarzan and Jane's son, Jack 'Korak' Clayton is supposed to be 18 years old. It is believed among fans that Burroughs did this deliberately to give an illusion that Tarzan had once been an actual person and that Burroughs was trying to conceal his real identity. In the first novel it is mentioned: \n:I had this story from one who had no business to tell it to me, or to any other. I may credit the seductive influence of an old vintage upon the narrator for the beginning of it, and my own skeptical incredulity during the days that followed for the balance of the strange tale. When my convivial host discovered that he had told me so much, and that I was prone to doubtfulness, his foolish pride assumed the task the old vintage had commenced, and so he unearthed written evidence in the form of musty manuscript, and dry official records of the British Colonial Office to support many of the salient features of his remarkable narrative. I do not say the story is true, for I did not witness the happenings which it portrays, but the fact that in the telling of it to you I have taken fictitious names for the principal characters quite sufficiently evidences the sincerity of my own belief that it MAY be true. The yellow, mildewed pages of the diary of a man long dead, and the records of the Colonial Office dovetail perfectly with the narrative of my convivial host, and so I give you the story as I painstakingly pieced it out from these several various agencies. If you do not find it credible you will at least be as one with me in acknowledging that it is unique, remarkable, and interesting.\n\nBurroughs mentions immediately after this that 'John Clayton' is itself a fictitious name, invented by 'Tarzan' to mask his real identity.\n\n===Critical reception===\nWhile ''Tarzan of the Apes'' met with some critical success, subsequent books in the series received a cooler reception and have been criticized for being derivative and formulaic. The characters are often said to be two-dimensional, the dialogue wooden, and the storytelling devices (such as excessive reliance on [[coincidence]]) strain credulity. According to [[Rudyard Kipling]] (who himself wrote stories of a [[feral child]], ''[[The Jungle Book]]'''s [[Mowgli]]), Burroughs wrote ''Tarzan of the Apes'' just so that he could \"find out how bad a book he could write and get away with it\".<ref>Gail Bederman,''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917,'' University of Chicago Press, 1995, pages 219.</ref>\n\nWhile Burroughs is not a polished novelist, he is a vivid storyteller, and many of his novels are still in print.<ref>John Clute and Peter Nicholls, ''The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction'', St. Martin's Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-312-09618-6}}, p. 178, \"It has often been said that ERB's works have small literary or intellectual merit. Nevertheless,...because ERB had a genius for the literalization of the dream, they have endured.\"</ref> In 1963, author [[Gore Vidal]] wrote a piece on the Tarzan series that, while pointing out several of the deficiencies that the Tarzan books have as works of literature, praises Burroughs for creating a compelling \"daydream figure\".<ref>[http://www.esquire.com/features/gore-vidal-archive/tarzan-revisited-1263 \"Tarzan Revisited\" by Gore Vidal].</ref> Critical reception grew more positive with the 1981 study by Erling B.

Burroughs' [[melodrama]]tic situations and the elaborate details he works into his fictional world, such as his construction of a partial language for his great apes, appeal to a worldwide fan base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.erblist.com/erbmania/tangor/ape-english.html |title=Bozarth, David Bruce. \"Ape-English Dictionary\" |publisher=Erblist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Harikalar Diyari Tarzan 06014 nevit.jpg|thumb|left|Tarzan walking, in this display from an Ankara amusement park.]]\n\nThe Tarzan books and movies employ extensive [[stereotype|stereotyping]] to a degree common in the times in which they were written. This has led to criticism in later years, with changing social views and customs, including charges of [[racism]] since the early 1970s.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1374/is_5_59/ai_55722257 | work=Humanist | title=Tarzan&nbsp;\u2013 Review | first=Bertram | last=Rothschild | year=1999}}</ref> The early books give a pervasively negative and stereotypical portrayal of native [[Africans]], including [[Arab]]s. In ''The Return of Tarzan'', Arabs are \"surly looking\" and call Christians \"dogs\", while blacks are \"lithe, ebon warriors, gesticulating and jabbering\". One could make an equal argument that when it came to blacks that Burroughs was simply depicting unwholesome characters as unwholesome and the good ones in a better light{{mdash}}as in Chapter 6 of ''[[Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar]]'' where Burroughs writes of Mugambi: \"nor could a braver or more loyal guardian have been found in any clime or upon any soil\".<ref>''Tarzan and the Jewels of Opar'', A.C. McClurg, 1918</ref> Other groups are stereotyped as well. A Swede has \"a long yellow moustache, an unwholesome complexion, and filthy nails\", and Russians cheat at cards. The aristocracy (except the House of Greystoke) and royalty are invariably effete.<ref>Edgar Rice Burroughs, ''The Return of Tarzan'', Grosset & Dunlap, 1915 ASIN B000WRZ2NG.</ref> In later books, Africans are portrayed somewhat more realistically as people. For example, in ''[[Tarzan's Quest]]'', [[Stereotypes of Africans|while the depiction of Africans remains relatively primitive]], they are portrayed more individualistically, with a greater variety of character traits (positive and negative), while the main villains are white people, although Burroughs never loses his distaste for European royalty.<ref>Edgar Rice Burroughs, ''Tarzan's Quest'', Grosset & Dunlop, 1936, ASIN B000O3K9EU.</ref>\n\nBurroughs' opinions, manifested through the narrative voice in the stories, reflect common attitudes in his time, which in a 21st-century context would be considered racist and [[sexist]]. However Thomas F. Bertonneau writes about Burroughs' \"conception of the feminine that elevates the woman to the same level as the man and that{{mdash}}in such characters as Dian of the Pellucidar novels or Dejah Thoris of the Barsoom novels{{mdash}}figures forth a female type who corresponds neither to desperate housewife, full-lipped prom-date, middle-level careerist office-manager, nor frowning ideological feminist-professor, but who exceeds all these by bounds in her realized humanity and in so doing suggests their insipidity.\"<ref>[http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/4066] Edgar Rice Burroughs and Masculine Narrative by Thomas F. Bertonneau</ref> The author is not especially mean-spirited in his attitudes. His heroes do not engage in [[violence against women]] or in [[Ethnic hatred|racially motivated violence]]. In ''Tarzan of the Apes'', details of a background of suffering experienced at the hands of whites by Mbonga's \"once great\" people are repeatedly told with evident sympathy, and in explanation or even justification of their current animosity toward whites.\n\nAlthough the character of Tarzan does not directly engage in violence against women, feminist scholars have critiqued the presence of other sympathetic male characters who do so with Tarzan's approval.<ref name=Torgovnick>{{cite book|last=Torgovnick|first=Mariana|title=Gone Primitive|url=https://archive.org/details/goneprimitive0090|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of Chicago press|isbn=978-0226808321|pages=[https://archive.org/details/goneprimitive0090/page/42 42\u201372]}}</ref> In ''[[Tarzan and the Ant Men]]'', the men of a fictional tribe of creatures called the Alali gain social dominance of their society by beating Alali women into submission with weapons that Tarzan willingly provides them.<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/> Following the battle, Burroughs states: \"To entertain Tarzan and to show him what great strides civilization had taken\u2014the son of The First Woman seized a female by the hair and dragging her to him struck her heavily about the head and face with his clenched fist, and the woman fell upon her knees and fondled his legs, looking wistfully into his face, her own glowing with love and admiration. (178)\"<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/> While Burroughs depicts some female characters with humanistic equalizing elements, Torgovnick argues that violent scenes against women in the context of male political and social domination are condoned in his writing, reinforcing a notion of gendered hierarchy where [[patriarchy]] is portrayed as the natural pinnacle of society.<ref name=\"Torgovnick\"/>\n\nIn regards to race, a superior\u2013inferior relationship with valuation is also accordingly implied, as it is unmistakable in virtually all interactions between whites and blacks in the Tarzan stories, and similar relationships and valuations can be seen in most other interactions between differing people, although one could argue that such interactions are the bedrock of the dramatic narrative and without such valuations there is no story. According to [[James Loewen]]'s ''Sundown Towns'', this may be a vestige of Burroughs' having been from [[Oak Park, Illinois]], a former [[Sundown town]] (a town that forbids non-whites from living within it).\n\nGail Bederman takes a different view in her ''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917''. There she describes how various people of the time either challenged or upheld the idea that \"civilization\" is predicated on white masculinity. She closes with a chapter on 1912's ''Tarzan of the Apes'' because the story's protagonist is, according to her, the ultimate male by the standards of 1912 white America. Bederman does note that Tarzan, \"an instinctivily chivalrous Anglo-Saxon\", does not engage in sexual violence, renouncing his \"masculine impulse to rape\". However, she also notes that not only does Tarzan kill black man Kulonga in revenge for killing his ape mother (a stand-in for his biological white mother) by hanging him, \"lyncher Tarzan\" actually enjoys killing black people, for example the cannibalistic Mbongans. Bederman, in fact, reminds readers that when Tarzan first introduces himself to Jane, he does so as \"Tarzan, the killer of beasts and many black men\". The novel climaxes with Tarzan saving Jane (who in the original novel is not British, but a white woman from Baltimore, Maryland) from a black ape rapist. When he leaves the jungle and sees \"civilized\" Africans farming, his first instinct is to kill them just for being black. \"Like the lynch victims reported in the Northern press, Tarzan's victims{{mdash}}cowards, cannibals, and despoilers of white womanhood{{mdash}}lack all manhood. Tarzan's lynchings thus prove him the superior man.\"\n\nDespite embodying all the tropes of white supremacy espoused or rejected by the people she had reviewed ([[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[G. Stanley Hall]], [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]], [[Ida B. Wells]]), Bederman states that, in all probability, Burroughs was not trying to make any kind of statement or echo any of them. \"He probably never heard of any of them.\" Instead, Bederman writes that Burroughs proves her point because, in telling racist and sexist stories whose protagonist boasted of killing blacks, he was not being unusual at all, but was instead just being a typical 1912 white American.\n\nTarzan is a white European male who grows up with apes. According to \"Taking Tarzan Seriously\" by Marianna Torgovnick, Tarzan is confused with the social hierarchy that he is a part of. Unlike everyone else in his society, Tarzan is the only one who is not clearly part of any social group. All the other members of his world are not able to climb or decline socially because they are already part of a social hierarchy which is stagnant. Turgovnick writes that since Tarzan was raised as an ape, he thinks and acts like an ape. However, instinctively he is human and he resorts to being human when he is pushed to. The reason of his confusion is that he does not understand what the typical white male is supposed to act like. His instincts eventually kick in when he is in the midst of this confusion, and he ends up dominating the jungle. In Tarzan, the jungle is a microcosm for the world in general in 1912 to the early 1930s. His climbing of the social hierarchy proves that the European white male is the most dominant of all races/sexes, no matter what the circumstance. Furthermore, Turgovnick writes that when Tarzan first meets Jane, she is slightly repulsed but also fascinated by his animal-like actions. As the story progresses, Tarzan surrenders his knife to Jane in an oddly chivalrous gesture, which makes Jane fall for Tarzan despite his odd circumstances. Turgovnick believes that this displays an instinctual, civilized chivalry that Burrough believes is common in white men.<ref>Gail Bederman,''Manliness and Civilization: A Cultural History of Gender and Race in the United States, 1880\u20131917,'' University of Chicago Press, 1995, pages 224\u2013232.</ref><ref>Turgovnick, Mariana \u201cTaking Tarzan Seriously\u201d from Gone Primitive, University of Chicago Press 1990 [Ch 2 pp.42\u201372]</ref>\n\n===Unauthorized works===\n{{main|Tarzan (book series)#Unauthorized works}}\n\nAfter Burroughs' death a number of writers produced new Tarzan stories. In some instances, the estate managed to prevent publication of such works. The most notable example in the [[United States]] was a series of five novels by the pseudonymous \"Barton Werper\" that appeared 1964\u201365 by Gold Star Books (part of [[Charlton Comics]]). As a result of legal action by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs, Inc.]], they were taken off the market.<ref>[http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/werper_barton Werper, Barton ]</ref> Similar series appeared in other countries, notably [[Argentina]], [[Israel]], and some Arab countries.\n\n===Modern fiction===\nIn 1972, [[science fiction]] author [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]] wrote ''[[Tarzan Alive]]'', a biography of Tarzan utilizing the [[Frame tale|frame device]] that he was a real person. In Farmer's fictional universe, Tarzan, along with [[Doc Savage]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]], are the cornerstones of the [[Wold Newton family]]. Farmer wrote two novels, ''[[Hadon of Ancient Opar]]'' and ''[[Flight to Opar]]'', set in the distant past and giving the antecedents of the lost city of [[Opar (fictional city)|Opar]], which plays an important role in the Tarzan books. In addition, Farmer's ''[[A Feast Unknown]]'', and its two sequels ''[[Lord of the Trees]]'' and ''[[The Mad Goblin]]'', are pastiches of the Tarzan and Doc Savage stories, with the premise that they tell the story of the real characters the fictional characters are based upon. ''A Feast Unknown'' is somewhat infamous among Tarzan and Doc Savage fans for its graphic violence and sexual content.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}\n\n==Tarzan in other media==\n{{main|Tarzan in film and other non-print media}}\n[[File:Poster - Tarzan the Fearless 01.jpg|thumb|Tarzan, as depicted by [[Buster Crabbe]] in the film serial ''[[Tarzan the Fearless]]'']]\n{{in popular culture|date=September 2017}}{{more citations needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n===Film===\nThe first Tarzan films were silent pictures adapted from the original Tarzan novels, which appeared within a few years of the character's creation. The first actor to portray the adult Tarzan was [[Elmo Lincoln]] in 1918's film ''[[Tarzan of the Apes (1918 film)|Tarzan of the Apes]]''. With the advent of talking pictures, a popular Tarzan movie franchise was developed, which lasted from the 1930s through the 1960s. Starting with ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan the Ape Man]]'' in 1932 through twelve films until 1948, the franchise was anchored by former [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] swimmer [[Johnny Weissmuller]] in the title role. Weissmuller and his immediate successors were enjoined to portray the ape-man as a [[noble savage]] speaking broken English, in marked contrast to the cultured aristocrat of Burroughs's novels.\n\nWith the exception of the Burroughs co-produced ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'', this \"me Tarzan, you Jane\" characterization of Tarzan persisted until the late 1950s, when producer [[Sy Weintraub]], having bought the film rights from producer [[Sol Lesser]], produced ''[[Tarzan's Greatest Adventure]]'' followed by eight other films and a television series. The Weintraub productions portray a Tarzan that is closer to Edgar Rice Burroughs' original concept in the novels: a jungle lord who speaks grammatical English and is well educated and familiar with civilization. Most Tarzan films made before the mid-fifties were black-and-white films shot on studio sets, with stock jungle footage edited in. The Weintraub productions from 1959 on were shot in foreign locations and were in color.\n\nThere were also several serials and features that competed with the main franchise, including ''[[Tarzan the Fearless]]'' (1933) starring [[Buster Crabbe]] and ''[[The New Adventures of Tarzan]]'' (1935) starring [[Bruce Bennett|Herman Brix]]. The latter serial was unique for its period in that it was partially filmed on location (Guatemala) and portrayed Tarzan as educated. It was the only Tarzan film project for which [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] was personally involved in the production.\n\nTarzan films from the 1930s on often featured Tarzan's chimpanzee companion [[Cheeta]], his consort Jane (not usually given a last name), and an adopted son, usually known only as \"Boy.\" The Weintraub productions from 1959 on dropped the character of Jane and portrayed Tarzan as a lone adventurer. Later Tarzan films have been occasional and somewhat idiosyncratic.\n\nMore recently, [[Tony Goldwyn]] portrayed Tarzan in [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney\u2019s]] [[Tarzan (1999 film)|animated film of the same name]] (1999). This version marked a new beginning for the ape man, taking its inspiration equally from Burroughs and the 1984 live-action film ''[[Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes]]''.\n\nSince ''Greystoke'', two additional live-action Tarzan movies have been released, 1998's ''[[Tarzan and the Lost City (film)|Tarzan and the Lost City]]'' and 2016's ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (film)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'', both [[period piece]]s that drew inspiration from Edgar Rice Burroughs' writings.\n\n===Radio===\n{{main|Tarzan (radio program)}}\n\nTarzan was the hero of two popular radio programs in the [[United States]]. The first aired from 1932\u20131936 with [[James Pierce]] in the role of Tarzan. The second ran from 1951\u20131953 with [[Lamont Johnson]] in the title role.<ref>Robert R. Barrett, ''Tarzan on Radio'', Radio Spirits, 1999.</ref>\n\n===Television===\n{{main|List of TV series based on Tarzan}}\nTelevision later emerged as a primary vehicle bringing the character to the public. From the mid-1950s, all the extant sound Tarzan films became staples of Saturday morning television aimed at young and teenaged viewers. In 1958, movie Tarzan [[Gordon Scott]] filmed three episodes for a prospective television series. The program did not sell, but a different live action ''[[Tarzan (1966 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' series produced by [[Sy Weintraub]] and starring [[Ron Ely]] ran on [[NBC]] from 1966 to 1968. This depiction of Tarzan is a well-educated bachelor who grew tired of urban civilization and is in his native African jungle once again.\n\nAn animated series from [[Filmation]], ''[[Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle]]'', aired from 1976 to 1977, followed by the anthology programs ''[[Batman/Tarzan Adventure Hour]]'' (1977\u20131978), ''[[Tarzan and the Super 7]]'' (1978\u20131980), ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger Adventure Hour]]'' (1980\u20131981), and ''[[The Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour]]'' (1981\u20131982). In those cartoons, Tarzan was voiced by [[Robert Ridgely]].\n\n[[Joe Lara]] starred in the title role in ''[[Tarzan in Manhattan]]'' (1989), an offbeat TV movie, and later returned in a completely different interpretation in ''[[Tarzan: The Epic Adventures]]'' (1996), a new live-action series.\n\nIn between the two productions with Lara, ''[[Tarz\u00e1n]]'', a half-hour syndicated series ran from 1991 through 1994. In this version of the show, Tarzan was portrayed as a blond environmentalist, with Jane turned into a French ecologist.\n\nDisney\u2019s animated series ''[[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|The Legend of Tarzan]]'' (2001\u20132003) was a spin-off from its animated film.\n[[File:Travis Fimmel by Gage Skidmore.jpg|alt=Fimmel at a microphone|thumb|Australian [[Travis Fimmel]] (pictured 2015) briefly portrayed Tarzan on television]]\nThe latest television series was the short-lived live-action ''[[Tarzan (2003 TV series)|Tarzan]]'' (2003), which starred male model [[Travis Fimmel]] and updated the setting to contemporary [[New York City]], with Jane as a police detective, played by [[Sarah Wayne Callies]]. The series was cancelled after only eight episodes.\n\n''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' featured recurring sketches with the speech-impaired trio of \"[[Recurring Saturday Night Live characters and sketches introduced 1987\u20131988#Tonto, Tarzan, and, Frankenstein's Monster|Tonto, Tarzan, and Frankenstein's Monster]]\". In those sketches, Tarzan is portrayed by [[Kevin Nealon]].\n\n===Stage===\nA 1921 Broadway production of ''Tarzan of The Apes'' starred Ronald Adair as Tarzan and Ethel Dwyer as Jane Porter. In 1976, [[Richard O'Brien]] wrote a musical entitled ''T. Zee'', loosely based on Tarzan but restyled in a rock idiom. ''[[Tarzan (musical)|Tarzan]]'', a musical stage adaptation of the 1999 animated feature, opened at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] on Broadway on May 10, 2006. The show, a [[Disney Theatrical]] production, was directed and designed by Bob Crowley. The same version of Tarzan that was played at the [[Richard Rodgers Theatre]] is being played throughout Europe and has been a huge success in the Netherlands. The Broadway show closed on July 8, 2007. Tarzan also appeared in the ''Tarzan Rocks!'' show at the Theatre in the Wild at [[Walt Disney World Resort]]'s [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]]. The show closed in 2006.\n\n===Video games===\nA game under the title ''[[Tarzan Goes Ape]]'', with little connection to the franchise, was released in the 1980s for the [[Commodore 64]] and [[ZX Spectrum]]. A ''[[Tarzan (computer game)|Tarzan]]'' computer game by Michael Archer was produced by [[Martech]]. Disney's Tarzan had seen video games released for the [[PlayStation]], [[Nintendo 64]] and [[Game Boy Color]]. Followed by ''[[Disney's Tarzan Untamed]]'' for the PS2 and Gamecube and ''[[Disney's Tarzan: Return to the Jungle]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. Tarzan also appeared in the PS2 game ''[[Kingdom Hearts]],'' although this Tarzan was shown in the Disney context, not the original conceptional idea of Tarzan by Burroughs. In the first ''[[Rayman]]'', a Tarzanesque version of Rayman named Tarayzan appears in the Dream Forest.\n\n===Action figures===\nThroughout the 1970s [[Mego Corporation]] licensed the Tarzan character and produced 8\" action figures which they included in their \"World's Greatest Super Heroes\" line of characters. In 1975 they also produced a 3\" \"Bendy\" figure made of poseable, malleable plastic.\n\n===Ephemera===\nSeveral Tarzan-themed products have been manufactured, including [[View-Master]] reels and packets, numerous Tarzan coloring books, children's books, follow-the-dots, and activity books.\n\n===Tarzan in comics===\n{{main|Tarzan (comics)}}\n''Tarzan of the Apes'' was adapted in newspaper strip form, in early 1929, with illustrations by [[Hal Foster]]. A [[full page]] [[Sunday strip]] began March 15, 1931 by [[Rex Maxon]]. Over the years, many artists have drawn the ''Tarzan'' comic strip, notably [[Burne Hogarth]], [[Russ Manning]], and [[Mike Grell]]. The daily strip began to reprint old dailies after the last Russ Manning daily (#10,308, which ran on July 29, 1972). The Sunday strip also turned to reprints circa 2000. Both strips continue as reprints today in a few newspapers and in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine. [[NBM Publishing]] did a high quality reprint series of the Foster and Hogarth work on Tarzan in a series of hardback and paperback reprints in the 1990s.\n\nTarzan has appeared in many comic books from numerous publishers over the years. The character's earliest comic book appearances were in comic strip reprints published in several titles, such as ''Sparkler'', ''Tip Top Comics'' and ''Single Series''. [[Western Publishing]] published ''Tarzan'' in [[Dell Comics]]'s ''[[Four Color|Four Color Comics]]'' #134 & 161 in 1947, before giving him his own series, ''Tarzan'', published through [[Dell Comics]] and later [[Gold Key Comics]] from January\u2013February 1948 to February 1972; many of these issues adapted Burroughs' novels. [[DC Comics|DC]] took over the series in 1972, publishing ''Tarzan'' #207\u2013258 from April 1972 to February 1977, including work by [[Joe Kubert]]. In 1977 the series moved to [[Marvel Comics]], which restarted the numbering rather than assuming that used by the previous publishers. Marvel issued ''Tarzan'' #1\u201329 (as well as three ''Annual''s), from June 1977 to October 1979, mainly by [[John Buscema]]. Following the conclusion of the Marvel series the character had no regular comic book publisher for a number of years. During this period [[Blackthorne Comics]] published ''Tarzan'' in 1986, and [[Malibu Comics]] published ''Tarzan'' comics in 1992. [[Dark Horse Comics]] has published various ''Tarzan'' series from 1996 to the present, including reprints of works from previous publishers like Gold Key and DC, and joint projects with other publishers featuring crossovers with other characters.\n\nThere have also been a number of different comic book projects from other publishers over the years, in addition to various minor appearances of Tarzan in other comic books. The Japanese [[manga]] series ''Jungle no Ouja Ta-chan'' ([[Jungle King Tar-chan]]) by [[Tokuhiro Masaya]] was based loosely on Tarzan. Also, manga \"god\" [[Osamu Tezuka]] created a Tarzan manga in 1948 entitled ''Tarzan no Himitsu Kichi'' (''Tarzan's Secret Base'').\n\n==Works inspired by Tarzan==\n[[Jerry Siegel]] named Tarzan and another Burroughs character, [[John Carter of Mars|John Carter]], as early inspiration for his creation of [[Superman]].<ref>http://www.omgfacts.com/lists/9079/Tarzan-was-an-early-inspiration-for-the-character-of-Superman</ref>\n\nTarzan's popularity inspired numerous imitators in [[pulp magazine]]s. A number of these, like [[Kwa of the Jungle|Kwa]] and [[Ka-Zar of the pulps|Ka-Zar]] were direct or loosely veiled copies; others, like [[Polaris of the Snows]], were similar characters in different settings, or with different gimmicks. Of these characters the most popular was [[Ki-Gor]], the subject of fifty-nine novels that appeared between winter 1939 to spring 1954 in the magazine ''[[Jungle Stories]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= The Great Pulp Heroes |last= Hutchison |first= Don |year= 2007 |publisher= Book Republic Press |isbn= 978-1-58042-184-3|page= 195}}</ref>\n\n==Species named after Tarzan==\n[[File:Calumma tarzan 01.jpg|right|thumb|alt=The chameleon on a branch|''Clumma tarzan'' in Madagascar]]\nTarzan is commemorated in the scientific name of a species of chameleon, ''[[Calumma tarzan]]'', which is [[Endemism|endemic]] to [[Madagascar]].<ref>Beolens, Bo; Watkins, Michael; Grayson, Michael (2011).

Individuals with an exceptional 'ape-like' ability to climb, cling and leap beyond that of ordinary humans may often receive the nickname 'Tarzan'.<ref>[http://www.herald.ie/news/courts/taxiqueue-jumper-punched-reveller-in-tarzanstyle-attack-2837390.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2013}}</ref> An example is retired [[United States|American]] [[baseball]] player [[Joe Wallis]].<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/article/cooperstown-confidential-tarzan-joe-wallis1/ |last=Markusen|first= Bruce|title=Cooperstown Confidential: Tarzan Joe Wallis|publisher=Hardballtimes.com |date=2009-08-14 |accessdate=2013-05-30}}</ref>\n\nComedian [[Carol Burnett]] was often prompted by her audiences to perform her trademark [[Tarzan yell]].

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez serving as [[showrunner]]s, and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Jon Bernthal]] and [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] are introduced as Castle and Natchios, respectively. [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] also return from the [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]], with [[Stephen Rider]] joining them. The season was ordered in April 2015 after the successful release of the first, with Petrie and Ramirez replacing the season one showrunner [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Production on the season began in July 2015 and continued through December, with the season focusing on the nature of heroism through comparison of Murdock to Castle and Natchios, and showing how the latter two affect Murdock's life. \n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris on March 7, 2016, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on March 18. Critics praised the introduction of Castle and Natchios, as well as Bernthal's performance in particular, the season's action, and storylines. However, many missed the presence of [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]'s [[Ben Urich]] from season one, and D'Onofrio's [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] during the first half of season two.

How that all fits together, and whether or not there will be a second season of this show\u2014or if it will fold into the others\u2014are questions nobody really has answers to yet.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> In November 2014, DeKnight said that there \"probably will be more\" seasons of ''Daredevil'' following the first.<ref name=\"DeKnightThanksgivingTwitter\" /> In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos stated the series was \"eligible to go into multiple seasons for sure\" and Netflix would look at \"how well [they] are addressing both the Marvel fanbase but also the broader fanbase\" to determine if additional seasons would be appropriate.<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\" />\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Marvel and Netflix announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez replacing DeKnight as showrunners as well as acting as executive producers; both served as writers in the first season and worked closely with DeKnight and series creator [[Drew Goddard]].<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> The season introduces the [[Punisher]], whom DeKnight and the writers had wanted to introduce in a [[post-credits scene]] during the first-season finale but were unable due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one. DeKnight felt that this \"was the right decision. I think there\u2019s a better, more organic way to introduce him to the world.\"<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" /> Ramirez referred to the second season internally as \"Daredevil vs. the Punisher\".<ref name=\"DDvsPunisher\" /> In September 2015, Goddard explained that he was still involved with the season as an executive producer, consulting with Petrie and Ramirez when asked to.<ref name=\"GoddardSep2015\" /> The season consists of 13 hour-long episodes.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=What's fantastic about the story is, is that it's created this enormous division in his life, because the woman that he once loved has returned, and she certainly has some issues with morality, and how you get the job done, and going on the other end of the spectrum is Frank Castle, who believes that justice needs to be served in a particular way. For Matt, who believes in the law, the question of whether or not he is a vigilante, and whether or not that makes him the same as these people, is something that will drive the story, and will drive Matt.|source=Jeph Loeb on how the season explores \"what it {{em|is}} to be a hero\".<ref name=\"LoebCBJan2016\" />}}\nRamirez talked about how the second season would be different from the first, saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering \"if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes\" and because of the positive fan reaction to that (\"we got a loud answer of 'yes'\"), approached the second season with the mindset, \"you wanted grounded and wanted dark, here\u2019s Elektra and Punisher. You asked for it.\" Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to \"peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world. That\u2019s something we get to pick and choose.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" />\n\nOn including the Punisher specifically in the season, where he is introduced to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are \"able to do things on the small screen that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than \"pushing the boundary\" or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more \"adult...darker, dirtier\" way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher.<ref name=\"GoddardDec2015\" /> Petrie stated that the writers hoped to \"stir the pot\" and \"get people to think\" with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as \"Punisher\" in the writer's room, similarly to [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] not being called \"Kingpin\" for season one, as it allowed the writers to think \"about [Castle] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell\u2019s Kitchen or other things.\"<ref name=\"WritersPunisher\" /> In the series, the moniker of \"The Punisher\" is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\nFor the timing of introducing the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that \"one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall\", but it was important to take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them.<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" /> Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with \"amazing stuff\" for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to \"completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism.\" Ramirez added,<blockquote>It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That\u2019s what we did this season.<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherElektra\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] explained that with Wilson Fisk imprisoned following the first season, season two picks up with \"the crime rate [having] plummeted. Things have returned to normal, if not better than normal\", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] \"question everything. Matt has to reevaluate {{Sic|who is}} and what he does\".<ref name=\"TVLineTCAJan2016\" /> [[Jeph Loeb]], head of [[Marvel Television]], said that \"if season one was really about Matt\u2019s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what is it to be a hero.\" By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to \"push and pull\" on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies\u2014the Punisher seeing \"justice in a very black-and-white kind of way\", and Elektra living \"more in the gray\". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said that she has a very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and \"quest for justice. Who are you doing this for?

But, that said, we want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible.<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" />\n\nLorraine Calvert joined the series as costume designer for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, which in the comics usually consists of impractically \"strappy\" red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, \"Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian, [because] she was a free spirit who traveled all over the world with as much money as she possibly could.\" This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra \"really needs a very simple, elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming.\" The costume consisted of \"black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra\u2019s face.\" The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.<ref name=\"EWCostumes\" />\n\nDaredevil's costume was also upgraded in the season, with Calvert calling it \"a much more fluid suit and much more tactical in a way.\" The costume department \"streamlined\" the suit to make it simpler, using less material on the gauntlets and boots.<ref name=\"EWCostumes\" /> Cox described it as a \"delicate area\" that required some \"tweaks\" after the brief use of it at the end of the first season. He noted that the changes are weaved into the storyline of the season, including the need for a new, redesigned mask, and a lower-half of the suit that is closer to the original cargo pants that the character wore earlier in the previous season. These baggier pants gave Cox and his stunt double much more maneuverability.<ref name=\"CoxCostume\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction on the season began in July 2015 in [[East Harlem]], with the working title ''Ringside'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> and a nine-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" /> Filming locations included the Metro Theater; [[Roosevelt Island]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]; [[Long Island City]]; [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] for exterior shots of Murdock's apartment; [[Newtown Creek]]; the [[Forest Park Carousel]]; [[Bayside, Queens]] for Castle's old home; [[Green-Wood Cemetery|Green-Wood Cemetery and Catacombs]]; [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; the [[Bronx County Courthouse]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Fort Totten]] and tunnels inside [[Bayley Seton Hospital]] for when Murdock confronts the Hand; and [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming ended in December 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\nMartin Ahlgren joined the series as director of photography for the season,<ref name=\"AhlgrenJoins\" /> deciding to \"go in a slightly different direction\" than the first season, but retaining \"the yellowish street light color that gave season one a very distinct style\". Ahlgren filmed season two in [[4K resolution]] on [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|RED Dragon]] cameras, and tried to use in-shot lighting such as lamps and car headlights, as well as \"4\u00d74 Light Blankets\u2014flexible sheets of LED that was small enough to fit into tight locations and light enough that it could be taped to a wall, yet outputs a very nice soft light that can be adjusted from daylight to tungsten color\".<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" /> Ahlgren highlighted the car chase at the beginning of \"Guilty as Sin\" as a challenge, noting the many ninjas chasing the car, and the one that \"jumps up on the car and travels on the roof for a block\", with all the stunts filmed on location. An Ultimate Arm, \"a motorized crane mounted on a Porsche Cayenne\", was used for the sequence, a break from the series' usual handheld and steadicam operations. The chase was shot over two nights in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with the interior of the car then filmed on a green screen stage, a rarity for the series, \"to give the actors a better environment to act in\".<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" />\n\nOn the season's fight sequences and choreography, Bernthal said, \"The fights are all character-driven and the fights tell a story.\" Cox added that \"there is absolutely an attempt to make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue; there is motive behind it, there is reason behind it, it means something.\"<ref name=\"CoxBernthalFights\" /> Cox's stunt double, Chris Brewster, explained how the series' fight choreography has evolved, with the first season having shown Murdock just starting out as a vigilante\u2014\"he fought with all heart and soul, but wasn't a polished fighter....he was more raw and gritty\"\u2014while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes\u2014\"his style is more defined and thought out now, but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair\". As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra, Brewster said that because of the Punisher's military background he uses a lot of weapons, and his \"hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature\", while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand, so she has similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick. \"However,\" Brewster continued, \"The Hand are trained assassins who are all about stealth takeouts and quick kills. Her style shows elements of\" that as well.<ref name=\"BrewsterChoreography\" /> The season uses multiple different martial art styles, including [[Arnis|kali]], Chinese [[kung fu]], [[wing chun]], [[kenjutsu]], and [[boxing]].<ref name=\"NetflixStunts\" />\n\nThe one-take fight in \"New York's Finest\" in which Daredevil fights gang members down a staircase was described by Cox as \"kind of like an homage\" to the first season's well received one-take hallway fight scene, and \"almost like that scene on crack\". Silvera noted that it is a metaphorical \"descent into Hell\" rather than a \"test of will\" like the first season's scene.<ref name=\"CoxBernthalFights\" /><ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> The stunt team had three days to prepare the fight, and the final sequence was filmed in a day and a half.<ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> Unlike the first season's scene, which was shot on a set and used a camera mounted on a ceiling track, the stairwell sequence was filmed on location, and required the camera to be passed around multiple people to get the final shot.<ref name=\"EWOner\" /> The season includes another homage to the hallway scene in \"Seven Minutes in Heaven\", where the Punisher has his own hallway fight. Silvera noted that this \"full-blown\", murdering Punisher was \"a strong contrast to Daredevil\". For all the season's fights, the stunt team filmed a [[previsualization]] version using stunt doubles,<ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> with the actors, such as Cox, then shown this in sections on the day of filming, and allowed to make adjustments where necessary. Though the actors completed the majority of the fights, doubles were used for flips and major stunts.<ref name=\"NetflixStunts\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX returns from the first season to work on the visual effects for the series.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nBy September 2015, [[John Paesano]] had begun composing music for the season.<ref name=\"PaesanoReturns\" /> He felt that the season's new showrunners \"were true to what we were trying to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge\" such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that \"it\u2019s not like we all of the sudden went into [[John Williams]] territory, you know? It\u2019s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels.\" When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he \"took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt\" and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where \"we were going to hit what\" and \"maintain that definable aspect of New York\" and its sound.<ref name=\"PaesanoCollider\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 15, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 50:49\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = Braden Kimball and John Paesano\n| length1         = 1:03\n\n| title2          = Devil of Hell's Kitchen\n| length2         = 2:47\n\n| title3          = The Punisher\n| length3         = 4:19\n\n| title4          = Stairway to Hell\n| length4         = 3:25\n\n| title5          = Raindrops\n| length5         = 3:03\n\n| title6          = Sparring\n| length6         = 2:51\n\n| title7          = Playing House\n| length7         = 1:41\n\n| title8          = Dripping Chilis\n| length8         = 3:47\n\n| title9          = Ninjas!\n| length9         = 3:47\n\n| title10         = Cell Block D\n| length10        = 4:19\n\n| title11         = Black Sky\n| length11        = 3:42\n\n| title12         = The Diner\n| length12        = 5:41\n\n| title13         = Stick and Ellie\n| length13        = 2:26\n\n| title14         = They Have Nothing Now\n| length14        = 6:12\n\n| title15         = To Be a Hero\n| length15        = 1:46\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn references to the larger MCU, Ramirez said \"those little [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] that come along the way are fun\", but there were times when the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to \"keep it in Hell's Kitchen\" and focus on issues such as \"the air conditioner doesn\u2019t work at Nelson and Murdock. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re interested in.\" He explained that the real life New York City \"has a larger than life presence\" with celebrities that live there\u2014\"If you see [[Derek Jeter]] walking down the street, that\u2019s great, but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel. We want our guys to be real New Yorkers.\"<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherElektra\" />\n\nThe season features the [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] Dogs of Hell, who were first introduced through their Nevada chapter in the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode \"[[Yes Men (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Yes Men]]\",<ref name=\"DigitalSpyEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DogsofHell\" /> and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"AVClubReview\" /> It also mentions the vigilantes [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]], the death of Oscar Clemons, and the law firm Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz, which are all references to the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"BustleEasterEggs\" /> When Claire Temple first appears in the season, she has \"a cut in her eyebrow\", which Cox was told would be explained in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', saying, \"the timeline had been thought through and worked out so that whatever\u2019s going on in ''Luke Cage'' ... somehow at some point during that show, the next day she\u2019s in the hospital talking to me.\"<ref name=\"TempleLC\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Daredevil'' was released on March 18, 2016 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site. The images were randomly distributed among select subscribers, with Netflix tracking to see which one was the best-performing to eventually use for all subscribers. Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how long it was until the season would debut.<ref name=\"VarietyReleaseBTS\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nFootage from the season was shown at [[New York Comic Con]] in October 2015,<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> and at [[Comic Con Experience]] that December.<ref name=\"ComicConExp\" /> On February 15, 2016, the first part of the season trailer was released focusing on the Punisher, while the second part focusing on Elektra was released 10 days later, on February 25.<ref name=\"Trailer2Parts\" /><ref name=\"DogsofHell\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' felt the first part is \"clearly going for a vibe similar to that first full-length ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|Dark Knight]]'' teaser back in December of 2007, with Castle being framed as a natural byproduct of/reaction to Daredevil\u2019s own vigilantism\". He also appreciated that it appeared Castle would be presented as a villain, as the previous [[Punisher in film|film adaptions of the character]] always had Castle \"still a hero at the end.\" Mendelson's one drawback to the trailer was when Castle starts \"monologue-ing\" in the last third, feeling Bernthal \"casts such an imposing and grim shadow as a near-silent angel of death that the [haunting and mythological] mood is almost broken\".<ref name=\"MendelsonTrailerPt1\" /> Joanna Robinson at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' felt that the premise of the trailer, with Daredevil facing the Punisher, is \"right in line with the big superhero trend this spring\", comparing it to ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' and ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', which feature [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] fighting [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] and [[Batman]] fighting [[Superman]], respectively. Robinson wondered if, like those films, the season also has a separate, \"bigger bad waiting in the wings to unite our vigilantes\" that the trailer is hiding.<ref name=\"RobinsonTrailerPt1\" />\n\nOn March 7, 2016, the first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris,<ref name=\"ParisPremiere\" /> with a premiere in New York City on March 10.<ref name=\"NYCPremiere\" /> Also in early March, billboards were erected in Toronto featuring character posters for Daredevil, Punisher and Elektra.<ref name=\"TorontoBillboards\" /> The series' [[Twitter]] account encouraged users to vote for which character was their favorite, with the other two receiving blood and bruises added to their billboards.<ref name=\"TorontoBillboards2\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on May 15, 2017,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on June 14, 2017,<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017.<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, the second season of ''Daredevil'' had 5.94% of viewers age 18-49 watching in an average minute in the first 32 days following its release.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers\" /> Symphony also estimated that 3.201 million viewers age 18-49 were watching an episode of ''Daredevil''{{'}} second season over the average minute in its first weekend of release.<ref name=\"SymphonyViewers2\" /> The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered. Jumpshot, which \"analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers\", looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company's U.S. members, factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season.<ref name=\"JumpshotViewers\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:Jon Bernthal 2014.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Jon Bernthal's performance as Frank Castle / Punisher was one of the highlights of the series for critics.<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /><ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /><ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /><ref name=\"VultureReview\" />]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported an 81% approval rating with an average rating of 6.94/10 based on 57 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bolstered by some impressive action, ''Daredevil'' keeps its footing in season two, even if its new adversaries can't quite fill the void left by Wilson Fisk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s02/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2 (2016)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-2/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, the season begins \"on an uneven note\", comparing some of the early moments to the works of [[Sam Peckinpah]], \"complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Kevin Fitzpatrick of [[Screen Crush]] felt the first seven episodes of the season seemed \"to have learned the best of both\" from season one and ''Jessica Jones'', \"placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city.\" He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed \"the improved spotlight\" for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, \"So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and ''Daredevil''{{\u2019}}s particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original.\" However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] brought as [[Ben Urich]] in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression \"feels much cleaner\" than the first's, \"moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' said, \"''Daredevil'' season two is very much the same excellent show ''Daredevil'' season one was...but in the places it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s also very much improved\". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of \"thick blacks\" in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Chris Cabin also praised the first seven episodes of the season, giving it four stars, and saying that the series \"finds overwhelmingly sincere and effective traces of humanity in a genre that has been hard-pressed to feel overtly pre-conceived in its political, societal, and philosophical ideas.\" He said ''Daredevil'', like ''Jessica Jones'', \"feels like a show that is constantly evolving, and consistently searching for challenges.\" Cabin also felt that \"the show\u2019s use of sound and image to infer or suggest as much as any line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin.\" He added that the season \"goes to great lengths to make the stakes of\" the moral and ethical issues, as seen by pitting Daredevil's methods against the Punisher, \"intensely involving and thrilling,\" while also praising the action sequences of the season and the \"streamlined focus on character in the writing\", claiming that \"none of the [MCU] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show.\"<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Dennis Perkins writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the season a \"B+\", missing D\u2019Onofrio's \"towering menace as Wilson Fisk\", but feeling that Bernthal and Yung \"make Castle and Elektra an effective season-long two-pronged assault on Matt Murdock\u2019s heroic identity, which gives ''Daredevil''{{'}}s supporting characters a clearer purpose as well.\"<ref name=\"AVClubReview\" /> [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it \"excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung.\"<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\nJack Shepherd of ''[[The Independent]]'' was slightly more critical of the early episodes of the season, saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle \"is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with ''Daredevil''\" pointing out that \"there is no real bad guy here\" and there \"is only so many times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up before you start thinking there is a glitch in [[the Matrix]].\" He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, with the introduction of Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called \"by far the season\u2019s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead\", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances.<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least \"the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [Punisher and Elektra] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt \"that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them\". Despite being \"right on the edge of desensitization\" regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used \"vary[ing] the dynamic enough\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" />\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen award the season a \"C\", calling it \"a straight-up disappointment.\" Calling the early episodes with Daredevil's face-off with the Punisher \"skimpy and sluggish from the get-go\", Jensen also added that they were \"a flatline of inert drama, with long scenes of windy exposition or dull skulking interrupted by the occasional well-staged if ridiculously gory fight sequence.\" Jensen added that \"hope for improvement\" came with the introduction of Elektra, and that the sixth episode should be a template for the rest of the season, which ultimately, he felt was \"stiff and silly.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" /> Daniel D'Addario for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' was also disappointed with the season, saying, \"it\u2019s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long, and not particularly enjoyable, ride... ''Daredevil'' just wants to dole out fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan. Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark.\"<ref name=\"TimeReview\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s Abraham Riesman joined the criticism, calling the seven episodes reviewed \"a dour parade of one clich\u00e9 after another, recycling themes, images, and rhetoric that audiences have seen countless times before.\" Though he wouldn't call it \"{{em|bad}}\", he felt that with all the other superhero content released in the same year, \"it feels woefully unnecessary.\" However, he did praise Bernthal's performance, saying it was \"another excitingly sympathetic antagonist\" after D'Onofrio's \"standout performance\" as Fisk in the first season, but was \"nowhere near as fun\". In contrast to the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season of ''Jessica Jones'']], which Riseman called Marvel's \"first attempt to depict sex in any kind of realistic way\", he called the second season of ''Daredevil'' \"astoundingly un-sexy.\"<ref name=\"VultureReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nGot Your 6, which \"champions positive portrayals of military [[veteran]]s in Hollywood\", deemed \"Semper Fidelis\" to be \"6 Certified\" for \"responsibly and accurately portray[ing] veterans via the character of Frank Castle, The Punisher, who insists that his legal representation not perpetuate veteran stereotypes of PTSD in order to defend his actions\".<ref name=\"6Certified\" /> ''Daredevil'' was included on [[FanSided|Hidden Remote]]'s Best TV Series of 2016 list, ranking 4th.<ref name=\"HiddenRemoteTop2016\" /> [[Comic Book Resources]] named \"Seven Minutes in Heaven\" and \"Penny and Dime\" as the 12th and 2nd best episodes in 2016 among comic book-related television series, respectively.<ref name=\"CBRTopEpisodes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season is produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez serving as [[showrunner]]s, and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Jon Bernthal]] and [[\u00c9lodie Yung]] are introduced as Castle and Natchios, respectively. [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Rosario Dawson]], and [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] also return from the [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]], with [[Stephen Rider]] joining them. The season was ordered in April 2015 after the successful release of the first, with Petrie and Ramirez replacing the season one showrunner [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Production on the season began in July 2015 and continued through December, with the season focusing on the nature of heroism through comparison of Murdock to Castle and Natchios, and showing how the latter two affect Murdock's life. \n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris on March 7, 2016, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on March 18. Critics praised the introduction of Castle and Natchios, as well as Bernthal's performance in particular, the season's action, and storylines. However, many missed the presence of [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]]'s [[Ben Urich]] from season one, and D'Onofrio's [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] during the first half of season two. The series was renewed for a [[Daredevil (season 3)|third season]] in July 2016.<ref name=\"DaredevilS3\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#395971 |overall=7 |season=7 |title=25 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-daredevil/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's daredevil on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 14\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Bang\n |DirectedBy = [[Phil Abraham]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Douglas Petrie]] & Marco Ramirez\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|18}}\n |ShortSummary = Following [[Daredevil (season 1)#Episodes|the downfall]] of [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] and the [[Russian mafia]], and the disappearance of the [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese]] and [[Yakuza]], various gangs attempt to take control of [[Hell's Kitchen]], including the [[Irish Mob]] and [[Drug cartel#Mexico|Cartels]]. When a group of Irish are gunned down by an apparent \"army\", the sole survivor, [[Grotto (comics)|Elliot \"Grotto\" Grote]], seeks out the firm of Nelson and Murdock for protection. [[Karen Page]], Nelson and Murdock's assistant\u2014who is struggling to manage their financial troubles given that the firm's clientele often cannot afford legal fees\u2014takes the wounded Grotto to the hospital, while [[Foggy Nelson]] learns from the Dogs of Hell biker gang that a group of their own was murdered by the same \"army\" as the Irish. [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]], as his secret vigilante persona Daredevil, investigates the cartels, who he learns had all of their high-power weapons stolen by a single man.

Though his body armor saved his life, Murdock's head and heightened senses are damaged and impaired, and Nelson insists that he rest and recover. Nelson attempts to get Grotto into witness protection, but since all of his mob contacts were murdered, District Attorney Samantha Reyes only agrees if Grotto wears [[Covert listening device#A wire|a wire]] to a meeting with a high-level drug lord. After his senses improve, Murdock asks his armorer, [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], for a new, improved mask, before investigating the hideout where the Irish were murdered. Realizing that they had a now missing dog, Murdock tracks it to a nearby apartment, where the other vigilante\u2014nicknamed \"[[Punisher|The Punisher]]\" by the DA's office\u2014had been listening to the DA's operation with Grotto on a police radio. When the Punisher attacks the operation, Nelson and Page realize that Reyes had always meant it as a trap. Police snipers fire at the Punisher as Daredevil arrives and attacks him.

The Punisher insists that what he does is necessary, that by murdering criminals he stops them from doing wrong ever again, while Daredevil merely delays the inevitable by injuring them. Their debate culminates in Punisher bringing out Grotto, whom he caught stealing a car in an attempt to flee the city, and strapping a gun with a single bullet to Daredevil's hand, offering him the choice of killing Grotto, killing the Punisher before he kills Grotto, or doing nothing and living with the fact that his actions caused someone's death anyway. Daredevil shoots the chains holding him and breaks free, but in doing so gives the Punisher time to fatally shoot Grotto. As the dying Grotto asks why Daredevil allowed him to die, the Punisher attacks a nearby Dogs of Hell group.

Page begins investigating the Punisher herself, using files slipped to her by assistant DA [[Blake Tower]]. She learns that he is Frank Castle, once a husband and father who was hospitalized with a bullet in his head. Barely surviving, Castle escaped an apparent cover up of some kind, potentially of Reyes's doing. The Irish confront Castle at a family carousel and take him hostage. Cooley violently tortures him, until Castle escapes and brutally murders Cooley and several of the other Irish. Daredevil finds them and stops Castle from murdering anyone else, helping him escape. Castle tells Daredevil about his family, who were murdered, before allowing himself to be arrested, with Daredevil giving credit for his capture to Sergeant Brett Mahoney in hopes of restoring the public's faith in the police rather than in vigilante justice.\n |LineColor = 395971\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber = 18\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = Kinbaku\n |DirectedBy = [[Floria Sigismondi]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Lauren Schmidt Hissrich]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|3|18}}\n |ShortSummary = Ten years ago, Murdock met [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]], the bored daughter of a wealthy Greek ambassador.

When Natchios manipulated Murdock into confronting Sweeney, hoping to have Murdock kill him, Murdock refused to do so, and Natchios left. In the present day, Natchios returns to New York asking for Murdock's help with the Japanese arm of the [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]], with whom her late father had dealings. Murdock refuses, but spies on her business meeting with the company, where she plants a bug in their system. Murdock later confronts Natchios about Sweeney, and she claims that she knows Murdock's true nature, which she believes is the same as hers.

Natchios believes that the Yakuza are up to something big in New York, and Murdock reluctantly agrees to continue helping her when she promises to leave the city once they are done. Murdock, Nelson, and Page are visited by the public defender on the Punisher case, who reveals that Reyes intends to link Castle to other Dogs of Hell murders outside of New York, making the death penalty an option. Murdock and Page convince Nelson that they should be helping Castle themselves, to protect him from Reyes and learn what really happened to him and his family. While Murdock and Natchios attend a Roxxon gala and steal a valuable Yakuza ledger, Page reveals to Castle what she has learned of his past, eventually earning his cooperation. However, in front of Reyes and the judge, Castle refuses a plea deal that would give him life in prison and instead pleads not guilty.

Unable to use a PTSD defense from Castle's time at war\u2014Castle believes it would be disrespectful to real PTSD-suffering war veterans\u2014Nelson instead focuses on Castle's family being failed by the justice system. Murdock works with Page in preparing to cross-examine the chief medical examiner, who likely doctored the Castle family death certificates for Reyes, but before he can do so in court the man confesses; he had been tortured the night before into revealing the truth. Murdock realizes that Natchios had overheard him and Page and attempted to 'help', and reveals his involvement with her to Nelson. With the examiner's testimony now invalid, Nelson's relationship with Murdock fractures. Murdock confronts Natchios, who agrees to stay away from the trial, before joining her in searching an abandoned building site from which the Yakuza ledger revealed shipments of dirt.

They escape back to Murdock's apartment, where Stick reveals to Murdock that Natchios works for him (and has done since before she first met Murdock, which was on a mission to recruit him for Stick) as he fights a war for the [[Chaste (Marvel Comics)|Chaste]] against the ancient group the [[Hand (comics)|Hand]], for which the Japanese Roxxon arm and the Yakuza are fronts. Murdock offers to take Natchios back and help her defeat the Hand if she renounces Stick and his murderous ways; she agrees. In court, Nelson begins to sway the jury in Castle's favor, but Castle takes the stand and purposefully wrecks his own defense. Page and Nelson blame Murdock for losing the trial. Natchios and Murdock share a close moment before they are attacked by a lone ninja. Murdock subdues him and discovers that he is only a teenager, before Natchios impulsively slits his throat, to Murdock's horror.

Fisk admits that this will allow Fisk to take control of the prison himself. Castle mortally wounds Dutton, who reveals that he organised the deal for a drug dealer called 'the Blacksmith'. Fisk then betrays Castle by releasing Dutton's supporters on him, but Castle slaughters them all. Realizing that Castle could be an asset against Fisk's competitors while the latter is imprisoned, Fisk arranges for Castle to escape the prison. However, Castle warns Fisk that the next time he sees him, he will kill him. Nelson and Murdock agree to part ways, while Page continues her personal investigation of Castle. She confirms with the now former-chief medical examiner that in addition to the Castle family there was another victim of the massacre, an undercover cop; the deal and subsequent massacre were part of a sting operation.

Learning of Castle's escape, Reyes has Nelson, Murdock, and Page meet at her office. She confirms that her office had organised the sting on the Blacksmith's deal with the Irish, Cartel, and Dogs of Hell, and explains that she chose not to clear the area so as not to tip off the criminals, leading to the deaths of the undercover cop and Castle's family when the deal went south. Now, she believes that Castle is targeting her daughter, and pleads for help in bringing him in. However, Reyes is gunned down in front of them by an unidentified shooter. Murdock visits Fisk in prison and confirms his suspicions, that Fisk is running it and orchestrated Castle's release.

Some of the Hand died during the fight, and an attempted autopsy on one of them shows the scars of a prior autopsy. The hospital board chooses to cover this up, compelling Temple to quit. Page and Castle are confronted by the Blacksmith's men, and Castle violently beats his location out of them before murdering them. He then leaves the horrified Page. Daredevil confronts Tower, who reveals the one lead the DA's office has on the Blacksmith: a competitor working out of Chinatown. Daredevil goes there to find Madame Gao, an old ally of Fisk's, who sends him to the pier. Castle attacks a boat there, used to smuggle drugs, and attempts to kill a man claiming to be the Blacksmith; Daredevil stops him, but the Blacksmith's men arrive and attack the boat, and Castle escapes in the chaos.

Daredevil stops the two from killing each other, but the Hand arrive and kidnap Stick. The police believe that Castle is dead, and Page reluctantly agrees; rather than dropping her investigation into Castle, which she was going to write an expos\u00e9 on for the ''New York Bulletin'', Page decides to write a profile to show the public that there was more to Castle than just the Punisher. She interviews Castle's Marine commander [[Ray Schoonover (comics)|Ray Schoonover]], but realizes that he is the Blacksmith. Castle arrives, and murders Schoonover despite Page's pleas. Daredevil and Natchios find Stick, with Natchios still bent on killing him. However, they are confronted by Yoshioka, who reveals that Natchios' killer instincts are because she is the Black Sky, a mythical weapon worshiped by the Hand.

With Stick safe at Murdock's apartment, the Hand raids a police station for information on people Daredevil has helped. They take hostages, including Page and criminal [[Turk Barrett]]. Because Barrett is on house arrest, police officers tracking him report the situation before they are killed by the Hand. Murdock and Natchios use this call to find the hostages, and free them. They are then confronted by a horde of Hand ninjas, led by Yoshioka. Natchios sacrifices herself to save Murdock, and he defeats the rest of the Hand with help of Castle, who looks to move on from his past and accept the Punisher mantle. Stick returns to finish off Yoshioka, beheading him. Murdock and Stick mourn Natchios, with Murdock stating that his love for her was worth it, and accepting that Stick's philosophy of cutting off emotional ties is flawed.

DeKnight]] said that ''Daredevil'' \"is one part of the bigger plan\u2014''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'', and then ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''. How that all fits together, and whether or not there will be a second season of this show\u2014or if it will fold into the others\u2014are questions nobody really has answers to yet.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> In November 2014, DeKnight said that there \"probably will be more\" seasons of ''Daredevil'' following the first.<ref name=\"DeKnightThanksgivingTwitter\" /> In January 2015, Netflix COO Ted Sarandos stated the series was \"eligible to go into multiple seasons for sure\" and Netflix would look at \"how well [they] are addressing both the Marvel fanbase but also the broader fanbase\" to determine if additional seasons would be appropriate.<ref name=\"SarandosMultipleSeasons\" />\n\nOn April 21, 2015, Marvel and Netflix announced that the series had been renewed for a second season, with [[Doug Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez replacing DeKnight as showrunners as well as acting as executive producers; both served as writers in the first season and worked closely with DeKnight and series creator [[Drew Goddard]].<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> The season introduces the [[Punisher]], whom DeKnight and the writers had wanted to introduce in a [[post-credits scene]] during the first-season finale but were unable due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one. DeKnight felt that this \"was the right decision. I think there\u2019s a better, more organic way to introduce him to the world.\"<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" /> Ramirez referred to the second season internally as \"Daredevil vs. the Punisher\".<ref name=\"DDvsPunisher\" /> In September 2015, Goddard explained that he was still involved with the season as an executive producer, consulting with Petrie and Ramirez when asked to.<ref name=\"GoddardSep2015\" /> The season consists of 13 hour-long episodes.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" />\n\n===Writing===\n{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=What's fantastic about the story is, is that it's created this enormous division in his life, because the woman that he once loved has returned, and she certainly has some issues with morality, and how you get the job done, and going on the other end of the spectrum is Frank Castle, who believes that justice needs to be served in a particular way. For Matt, who believes in the law, the question of whether or not he is a vigilante, and whether or not that makes him the same as these people, is something that will drive the story, and will drive Matt.|source=Jeph Loeb on how the season explores \"what it {{em|is}} to be a hero\".<ref name=\"LoebCBJan2016\" />}}\nRamirez talked about how the second season would be different from the first, saying that the writers had spent the first season wondering \"if there was a place for dark and gritty content in superheroes\" and because of the positive fan reaction to that (\"we got a loud answer of 'yes'\"), approached the second season with the mindset, \"you wanted grounded and wanted dark, here\u2019s Elektra and Punisher. You asked for it.\" Petrie, talking about the potential use of flashbacks in the season, said that sometimes it is best to \"peel back the layer of the onion through flashback, or two people in a room talking can have all the power in the world. That\u2019s something we get to pick and choose.\"<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" />\n\nOn including the Punisher specifically in the season, where he is introduced to the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], Goddard felt television was the best fit for the character, as the writers are \"able to do things on the small screen that fit that character better than if we had to water him down for the movies.\"<ref name=\"GoddardSept2015\" /> Goddard stated that the season's approach to the characters and their actions would be to do what makes sense for the characters rather than \"pushing the boundary\" or looking to shock the audience, though he noted that this could still go in a more \"adult...darker, dirtier\" way due to the freedom of Netflix and the presence of characters such as the Punisher.<ref name=\"GoddardDec2015\" /> Petrie stated that the writers hoped to \"stir the pot\" and \"get people to think\" with the inclusion of the Punisher and his lethal methods, adding, \"Taking lethal justice into your own hands in America in 2015 is tricky shit. We have not shied away from the rich complicated reality of Now. If you've got a gun and you're not the police you're going to incite strong feelings.\"<ref name=\"EWDec2015\" /> Ramirez added that Castle was not referred to as \"Punisher\" in the writer's room, similarly to [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] not being called \"Kingpin\" for season one, as it allowed the writers to think \"about [Castle] as a man with a vendetta, who made an oath to his dead family. The more specific it got, the less it became about issues outside of Hell\u2019s Kitchen or other things.\"<ref name=\"WritersPunisher\" /> In the series, the moniker of \"The Punisher\" is given to Castle by the media due to his aggressive actions.<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" />\n\nFor the timing of introducing the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that \"one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall\", but it was important to take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them.<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" /> Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with \"amazing stuff\" for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to \"completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism.\" Ramirez added,<blockquote>It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about here? Do we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That\u2019s what we did this season.<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherElektra\" /></blockquote>\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] explained that with Wilson Fisk imprisoned following the first season, season two picks up with \"the crime rate [having] plummeted. Things have returned to normal, if not better than normal\", which is when Punisher is introduced, who makes [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] \"question everything. Matt has to reevaluate {{Sic|who is}} and what he does\".<ref name=\"TVLineTCAJan2016\" /> [[Jeph Loeb]], head of [[Marvel Television]], said that \"if season one was really about Matt\u2019s decision to become a hero, then season two really became about what is it to be a hero.\" By introducing the Punisher and Elektra, the writers were able to \"push and pull\" on Murdock, contrasting their three ideologies\u2014the Punisher seeing \"justice in a very black-and-white kind of way\", and Elektra living \"more in the gray\". On Elektra in particular, Loeb said that she has a very clear, self-motivated agenda, and she challenges Murdock's own agenda and \"quest for justice. Who are you doing this for? Why are you doing this?

What would protect you?...will people be wearing kick ass costumes in this show? At some point, everybody does. We promise. But, that said, we want to make them feel as organic and grounded as possible.<ref name=\"IGNPunisherElektra\" />\n\nLorraine Calvert joined the series as costume designer for the season. On adapting Elektra's costume for the season, which in the comics usually consists of impractically \"strappy\" red cloth, Calvert decided to make it utilitarian and appealing, while still being faithful to the comics. Originally starting out opposite of the eventual sleek design for both her fighting and daytime attire, Calvert said, \"Ideas were tossed around about how she was possibly bohemian, [because] she was a free spirit who traveled all over the world with as much money as she possibly could.\" This eventually led to the final, sleeker design, because Elektra \"really needs a very simple, elegant line because too much cloth is overwhelming.\" The costume consisted of \"black moto pants, a one-piece zippered body suit, a sleeveless vest, and red cloth to provide the highlights and the hood covering Elektra\u2019s face.\" The shade of the red used for Elektra throughout the season was chosen so it would not clash with the red in Daredevil's costume, as well as to match the darker tone of the series.<ref name=\"EWCostumes\" />\n\nDaredevil's costume was also upgraded in the season, with Calvert calling it \"a much more fluid suit and much more tactical in a way.\" The costume department \"streamlined\" the suit to make it simpler, using less material on the gauntlets and boots.<ref name=\"EWCostumes\" /> Cox described it as a \"delicate area\" that required some \"tweaks\" after the brief use of it at the end of the first season. He noted that the changes are weaved into the storyline of the season, including the need for a new, redesigned mask, and a lower-half of the suit that is closer to the original cargo pants that the character wore earlier in the previous season. These baggier pants gave Cox and his stunt double much more maneuverability.<ref name=\"CoxCostume\" />\n\n===Filming===\nProduction on the season began in July 2015 in [[East Harlem]], with the working title ''Ringside'',<ref name=\"FilmingBegins\" /> and a nine-day-per-episode schedule.<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" /> Filming locations included the Metro Theater; [[Roosevelt Island]]; [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn]]; [[Long Island City]]; [[SoHo, Manhattan|SoHo]] for exterior shots of Murdock's apartment; [[Newtown Creek]]; the [[Forest Park Carousel]]; [[Bayside, Queens]] for Castle's old home; [[Green-Wood Cemetery|Green-Wood Cemetery and Catacombs]]; [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; the [[Bronx County Courthouse]]; [[Tribeca]]; [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]]; the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]]; [[Fort Totten (Queens)|Fort Totten]] and tunnels inside [[Bayley Seton Hospital]] for when Murdock confronts the Hand; and [[Calvary Cemetery (Queens, New York)|Calvary Cemetery]].<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Filming ended in December 2015.<ref name=\"FilmingEnds\" />\n\nMartin Ahlgren joined the series as director of photography for the season,<ref name=\"AhlgrenJoins\" /> deciding to \"go in a slightly different direction\" than the first season, but retaining \"the yellowish street light color that gave season one a very distinct style\". Ahlgren filmed season two in [[4K resolution]] on [[Red Digital Cinema Camera Company#Red Dragon|RED Dragon]] cameras, and tried to use in-shot lighting such as lamps and car headlights, as well as \"4\u00d74 Light Blankets\u2014flexible sheets of LED that was small enough to fit into tight locations and light enough that it could be taped to a wall, yet outputs a very nice soft light that can be adjusted from daylight to tungsten color\".<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" /> Ahlgren highlighted the car chase at the beginning of \"Guilty as Sin\" as a challenge, noting the many ninjas chasing the car, and the one that \"jumps up on the car and travels on the roof for a block\", with all the stunts filmed on location. An Ultimate Arm, \"a motorized crane mounted on a Porsche Cayenne\", was used for the sequence, a break from the series' usual handheld and steadicam operations. The chase was shot over two nights in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, with the interior of the car then filmed on a green screen stage, a rarity for the series, \"to give the actors a better environment to act in\".<ref name=\"AhlgrenInterview\" />\n\nOn the season's fight sequences and choreography, Bernthal said, \"The fights are all character-driven and the fights tell a story.\" Cox added that \"there is absolutely an attempt to make sure every punch or kick that is thrown is like a line of dialogue; there is motive behind it, there is reason behind it, it means something.\"<ref name=\"CoxBernthalFights\" /> Cox's stunt double, Chris Brewster, explained how the series' fight choreography has evolved, with the first season having shown Murdock just starting out as a vigilante\u2014\"he fought with all heart and soul, but wasn't a polished fighter....he was more raw and gritty\"\u2014while the second season sees the character having learned from previous mistakes\u2014\"his style is more defined and thought out now, but he will always fight with the Daredevil flair\". As for the fighting styles of Punisher and Elektra, Brewster said that because of the Punisher's military background he uses a lot of weapons, and his \"hand to hand style is more of a close quarter combat nature\", while Elektra was trained by Stick and the Hand, so she has similar movement to Daredevil who was also trained by Stick. \"However,\" Brewster continued, \"The Hand are trained assassins who are all about stealth takeouts and quick kills. Her style shows elements of\" that as well.<ref name=\"BrewsterChoreography\" /> The season uses multiple different martial art styles, including [[Arnis|kali]], Chinese [[kung fu]], [[wing chun]], [[kenjutsu]], and [[boxing]].<ref name=\"NetflixStunts\" />\n\nThe one-take fight in \"New York's Finest\" in which Daredevil fights gang members down a staircase was described by Cox as \"kind of like an homage\" to the first season's well received one-take hallway fight scene, and \"almost like that scene on crack\". Silvera noted that it is a metaphorical \"descent into Hell\" rather than a \"test of will\" like the first season's scene.<ref name=\"CoxBernthalFights\" /><ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> The stunt team had three days to prepare the fight, and the final sequence was filmed in a day and a half.<ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> Unlike the first season's scene, which was shot on a set and used a camera mounted on a ceiling track, the stairwell sequence was filmed on location, and required the camera to be passed around multiple people to get the final shot.<ref name=\"EWOner\" /> The season includes another homage to the hallway scene in \"Seven Minutes in Heaven\", where the Punisher has his own hallway fight. Silvera noted that this \"full-blown\", murdering Punisher was \"a strong contrast to Daredevil\". For all the season's fights, the stunt team filmed a [[previsualization]] version using stunt doubles,<ref name=\"SilveraArtisans\" /> with the actors, such as Cox, then shown this in sections on the day of filming, and allowed to make adjustments where necessary. Though the actors completed the majority of the fights, doubles were used for flips and major stunts.<ref name=\"NetflixStunts\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nShade VFX returns from the first season to work on the visual effects for the series.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" />\n\n===Music===\nBy September 2015, [[John Paesano]] had begun composing music for the season.<ref name=\"PaesanoReturns\" /> He felt that the season's new showrunners \"were true to what we were trying to do in season one. There were just elements in season two that we had to acknowledge\" such as the Punisher and Elektra. He jokingly said that \"it\u2019s not like we all of the sudden went into [[John Williams]] territory, you know? It\u2019s definitely still dark, still gritty ... but it definitely jumps up a couple levels.\" When approaching the characters of Punisher and Elektra, with whom Paesano was familiar from the comics and previous adaptations, he \"took all those preconceived notions I had with a grain of salt\" and waited to see what the season's interpretation of the characters would be. Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where \"we were going to hit what\" and \"maintain that definable aspect of New York\" and its sound.<ref name=\"PaesanoCollider\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on July 15, 2016.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 50:49\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = Braden Kimball and John Paesano\n| length1         = 1:03\n\n| title2          = Devil of Hell's Kitchen\n| length2         = 2:47\n\n| title3          = The Punisher\n| length3         = 4:19\n\n| title4          = Stairway to Hell\n| length4         = 3:25\n\n| title5          = Raindrops\n| length5         = 3:03\n\n| title6          = Sparring\n| length6         = 2:51\n\n| title7          = Playing House\n| length7         = 1:41\n\n| title8          = Dripping Chilis\n| length8         = 3:47\n\n| title9          = Ninjas!\n| length9         = 3:47\n\n| title10         = Cell Block D\n| length10        = 4:19\n\n| title11         = Black Sky\n| length11        = 3:42\n\n| title12         = The Diner\n| length12        = 5:41\n\n| title13         = Stick and Ellie\n| length13        = 2:26\n\n| title14         = They Have Nothing Now\n| length14        = 6:12\n\n| title15         = To Be a Hero\n| length15        = 1:46\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nOn references to the larger MCU, Ramirez said \"those little [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] that come along the way are fun\", but there were times when the writers did not take opportunities to reference the rest of the universe because they felt like distractions from the series' narrative and characters. Petrie stated that the writers wanted to \"keep it in Hell's Kitchen\" and focus on issues such as \"the air conditioner doesn\u2019t work at Nelson and Murdock. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re interested in.\" He explained that the real life New York City \"has a larger than life presence\" with celebrities that live there\u2014\"If you see [[Derek Jeter]] walking down the street, that\u2019s great, but then you turn the corner and you get into an argument with the guy who overcharged you for a pretzel. We want our guys to be real New Yorkers.\"<ref name=\"ColliderPunisherElektra\" />\n\nThe season features the [[Outlaw motorcycle club|motorcycle gang]] Dogs of Hell, who were first introduced through their Nevada chapter in the ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' episode \"[[Yes Men (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Yes Men]]\",<ref name=\"DigitalSpyEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DogsofHell\" /> and [[Roxxon Energy Corporation]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"AVClubReview\" /> It also mentions the vigilantes [[Jessica Jones]] and [[Luke Cage]], the death of Oscar Clemons, and the law firm Hogarth, Chao, and Benowitz, which are all references to the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season]] of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.<ref name=\"CBREasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyEasterEggs\" /><ref name=\"BustleEasterEggs\" /> When Claire Temple first appears in the season, she has \"a cut in her eyebrow\", which Cox was told would be explained in ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', saying, \"the timeline had been thought through and worked out so that whatever\u2019s going on in ''Luke Cage'' ... somehow at some point during that show, the next day she\u2019s in the hospital talking to me.\"<ref name=\"TempleLC\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe second season of ''Daredevil'' was released on March 18, 2016 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] [[Netflix]] worldwide,<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" /> in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"UltraHD\" /> Preparing for the release, Netflix created eight different images to use as cover art for the season on its site. The images were randomly distributed among select subscribers, with Netflix tracking to see which one was the best-performing to eventually use for all subscribers. Netflix also debuted a countdown timer to a percentage of its users worldwide, allowing them to see how long it was until the season would debut.<ref name=\"VarietyReleaseBTS\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nFootage from the season was shown at [[New York Comic Con]] in October 2015,<ref name=\"NYCC2015\" /> and at [[Comic Con Experience]] that December.<ref name=\"ComicConExp\" /> On February 15, 2016, the first part of the season trailer was released focusing on the Punisher, while the second part focusing on Elektra was released 10 days later, on February 25.<ref name=\"Trailer2Parts\" /><ref name=\"DogsofHell\" /> Scott Mendelson of ''[[Forbes]]'' felt the first part is \"clearly going for a vibe similar to that first full-length ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|Dark Knight]]'' teaser back in December of 2007, with Castle being framed as a natural byproduct of/reaction to Daredevil\u2019s own vigilantism\". He also appreciated that it appeared Castle would be presented as a villain, as the previous [[Punisher in film|film adaptions of the character]] always had Castle \"still a hero at the end.\" Mendelson's one drawback to the trailer was when Castle starts \"monologue-ing\" in the last third, feeling Bernthal \"casts such an imposing and grim shadow as a near-silent angel of death that the [haunting and mythological] mood is almost broken\".<ref name=\"MendelsonTrailerPt1\" /> Joanna Robinson at ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' felt that the premise of the trailer, with Daredevil facing the Punisher, is \"right in line with the big superhero trend this spring\", comparing it to ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]'' and ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'', which feature [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] fighting [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] and [[Batman]] fighting [[Superman]], respectively. Robinson wondered if, like those films, the season also has a separate, \"bigger bad waiting in the wings to unite our vigilantes\" that the trailer is hiding.<ref name=\"RobinsonTrailerPt1\" />\n\nOn March 7, 2016, the first two episodes of the season premiered in Paris,<ref name=\"ParisPremiere\" /> with a premiere in New York City on March 10.<ref name=\"NYCPremiere\" /> Also in early March, billboards were erected in Toronto featuring character posters for Daredevil, Punisher and Elektra.<ref name=\"TorontoBillboards\" /> The series' [[Twitter]] account encouraged users to vote for which character was their favorite, with the other two receiving blood and bruises added to their billboards.<ref name=\"TorontoBillboards2\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on May 15, 2017,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on June 14, 2017,<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on August 22, 2017.<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, [[Symphony Technology Group]] compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound.

The website's critical consensus reads, \"Bolstered by some impressive action, ''Daredevil'' keeps its footing in season two, even if its new adversaries can't quite fill the void left by Wilson Fisk.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s02/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2 (2016)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 68 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil/season-2/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 2|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\nReviewing the first seven episodes, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, the season begins \"on an uneven note\", comparing some of the early moments to the works of [[Sam Peckinpah]], \"complete with slow-motion bullets and blood sprays. Stick with it, though, and the show blossoms, featuring a few terrific action sequences while introducing into this grim world seminal characters the Punisher and Elektra.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Kevin Fitzpatrick of [[Screen Crush]] felt the first seven episodes of the season seemed \"to have learned the best of both\" from season one and ''Jessica Jones'', \"placing its most compelling imagery front and center straightaway, but still taking time to pick apart the characters beneath them, rather than shout platitudes about saving the city.\" He also praised the castings of Bernthal and Yung as Punisher and Elektra, respectively, and enjoyed \"the improved spotlight\" for Foggy and Karen, given the reduction of Dawson saying, \"So many superhero series struggle to draw its supporting characters as compellingly as the action, and ''Daredevil''{{\u2019}}s particular blend of set piece and legal thriller feels inescapably original.\" However, Fitzpatrick did note the series lacked the presence [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] brought as [[Ben Urich]] in the first season. He concluded that the season's progression \"feels much cleaner\" than the first's, \"moving almost in acts more than back and forth victories...Even the aim feels that much more cohesive, to start in a place of Matt, Foggy and Karen all confident in their new roles, but wrestling with the consequence of their choice to always help the helpless.\"<ref name=\"ScreenCrushReview\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' said, \"''Daredevil'' season two is very much the same excellent show ''Daredevil'' season one was...but in the places it isn\u2019t, it\u2019s also very much improved\". Barr praised Bernthal as the Punisher, and noted the reduction in the amount of \"thick blacks\" in the cinematography that the first season was criticized for.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n[[Collider (website)|Collider]]'s Chris Cabin also praised the first seven episodes of the season, giving it four stars, and saying that the series \"finds overwhelmingly sincere and effective traces of humanity in a genre that has been hard-pressed to feel overtly pre-conceived in its political, societal, and philosophical ideas.\" He said ''Daredevil'', like ''Jessica Jones'', \"feels like a show that is constantly evolving, and consistently searching for challenges.\" Cabin also felt that \"the show\u2019s use of sound and image to infer or suggest as much as any line of dialogue...continues to set this series apart from its half-measured kin.\" He added that the season \"goes to great lengths to make the stakes of\" the moral and ethical issues, as seen by pitting Daredevil's methods against the Punisher, \"intensely involving and thrilling,\" while also praising the action sequences of the season and the \"streamlined focus on character in the writing\", claiming that \"none of the [MCU] films have even an iota of the seductive intimacy and heart of this show.\"<ref name=\"ColliderReview\" /> Dennis Perkins writing for ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' awarded the season a \"B+\", missing D\u2019Onofrio's \"towering menace as Wilson Fisk\", but feeling that Bernthal and Yung \"make Castle and Elektra an effective season-long two-pronged assault on Matt Murdock\u2019s heroic identity, which gives ''Daredevil''{{'}}s supporting characters a clearer purpose as well.\"<ref name=\"AVClubReview\" /> [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler, after reviewing all the episodes of season two individually, gave the season a 9.3 out of 10, saying that it \"excelled at both action and story while giving us a more complex and layered season than the first....Gone was a notable 'main villain', but instead we were given fantastic performances by not only the main cast but by newcomers Jon Bernthal and Elodie Yung.\"<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" />\n\nJack Shepherd of ''[[The Independent]]'' was slightly more critical of the early episodes of the season, saying the ideological battle between Murdock and Castle \"is the crux of these first few episodes and also highlights the main problem with ''Daredevil''\" pointing out that \"there is no real bad guy here\" and there \"is only so many times you can watch an episode end with Daredevil and Punisher beating each other up before you start thinking there is a glitch in [[the Matrix]].\" He also agreed with Fitzpatick regarding Curtis-Hall's presence as Ben Urich not being filled in the season. Despite this, Shepherd added that the season began to pick up by the fourth episode, with the introduction of Elektra, capping with episodes six and seven, which he called \"by far the season\u2019s best, laying the foundation for an exciting story ahead\", while also praising Cox, Henson, Woll, Bernthal and Yung for their performances.<ref name=\"IndependentReview\" /> Daniel Fienberg, reviewing the first seven episodes for ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', expressed similar sentiments as Shepherd, feeling the episodes missed what Vincent D'Onofrio brought as Wilson Fisk in the first season, or at least \"the through-line threat that he presented...Fortunately, the [Punisher and Elektra] are vividly realized and the action is still visceral and brutal and maybe the big picture will emerge in the season's second half. Because of the portrayals of those two characters, he felt \"that there's a challenge to remain wholly invested in plotlines that don't involve them\". Despite being \"right on the edge of desensitization\" regarding the fight scenes, Fienberg still praised them, highlighting the different styles Elektra and the Punisher used \"vary[ing] the dynamic enough\".<ref name=\"THRReview\" />\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''{{'}}s Jeff Jensen award the season a \"C\", calling it \"a straight-up disappointment.\" Calling the early episodes with Daredevil's face-off with the Punisher \"skimpy and sluggish from the get-go\", Jensen also added that they were \"a flatline of inert drama, with long scenes of windy exposition or dull skulking interrupted by the occasional well-staged if ridiculously gory fight sequence.\" Jensen added that \"hope for improvement\" came with the introduction of Elektra, and that the sixth episode should be a template for the rest of the season, which ultimately, he felt was \"stiff and silly.\"<ref name=\"EWReview\" /> Daniel D'Addario for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' was also disappointed with the season, saying, \"it\u2019s hard not to feel that one is being taken for a long, and not particularly enjoyable, ride... ''Daredevil'' just wants to dole out fun doses of extreme gore on the path to an endpoint on a business plan. Any viewer committed to story is left searching in the dark.\"<ref name=\"TimeReview\" /> [[Vulture (blog)|Vulture]]'s Abraham Riesman joined the criticism, calling the seven episodes reviewed \"a dour parade of one clich\u00e9 after another, recycling themes, images, and rhetoric that audiences have seen countless times before.\" Though he wouldn't call it \"{{em|bad}}\", he felt that with all the other superhero content released in the same year, \"it feels woefully unnecessary.\" However, he did praise Bernthal's performance, saying it was \"another excitingly sympathetic antagonist\" after D'Onofrio's \"standout performance\" as Fisk in the first season, but was \"nowhere near as fun\". In contrast to the [[Jessica Jones (season 1)|first season of ''Jessica Jones'']], which Riseman called Marvel's \"first attempt to depict sex in any kind of realistic way\", he called the second season of ''Daredevil'' \"astoundingly un-sexy.\"<ref name=\"VultureReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nGot Your 6, which \"champions positive portrayals of military [[veteran]]s in Hollywood\", deemed \"Semper Fidelis\" to be \"6 Certified\" for \"responsibly and accurately portray[ing] veterans via the character of Frank Castle, The Punisher, who insists that his legal representation not perpetuate veteran stereotypes of PTSD in order to defend his actions\".<ref name=\"6Certified\" /> ''Daredevil'' was included on [[FanSided|Hidden Remote]]'s Best TV Series of 2016 list, ranking 4th.<ref name=\"HiddenRemoteTop2016\" /> [[Comic Book Resources]] named \"Seven Minutes in Heaven\" and \"Penny and Dime\" as the 12th and 2nd best episodes in 2016 among comic book-related television series, respectively.<ref name=\"CBRTopEpisodes\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serving as [[showrunner]], and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] plays Fisk. They are joined by principal cast members [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], and [[Rosario Dawson]]. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, with Goddard hired in December. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014, the season focuses on the darker, more mature elements of the source material. Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season, with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at [[Marvel Studios]]. The season features links and references to other MCU projects, including future Netflix series.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Los Angeles on April 2, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on April 10 to an estimated high viewership. Critics praised the performances, particularly D'Onofrio's, and the darker tone and action sequences of the series compared to other properties set in the MCU. However, some of the pacing during the season and the final red Daredevil suit received criticism. The first season received two nominations for [[67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Emmy Awards]], for the visual effects from Shade VFX, and the sound editing. The series was renewed for a [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] on April 21, 2015.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#0A2252 |overall=7 |season=7 |title=25 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-daredevil/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's daredevil on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Into the Ring\n |DirectedBy = [[Phil Abraham]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Drew Goddard]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Criminals, including the [[Russian mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese mob]], have taken advantage of [[Hell's Kitchen]]'s circumstances since \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\". Blinded as a boy in an accident that gave him heightened senses, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] begins fighting this rising criminal element by night as a costumed [[vigilante]] while opening a law firm with his friend, [[Foggy Nelson]]. Their first client is [[Karen Page]], a secretary for construction company Union Allied, who has been framed for the murder of her co-worker, Daniel Fisher, after accidentally uncovering a pension embezzlement scheme. Murdock prevents Karen from being prosecuted and protects her from an assassin, before exposing the scandal through [[Ben Urich]] at ''The New York Bulletin''. Grateful for their help, Page offers to work for Murdock and Nelson. [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] covers up the involvement of his employer in the scandal, and orders Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov, the Russians' leaders, to deal with Murdock (\"the man in black\"): they kidnap a young boy to lure him into a trap.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Cut Man\n |DirectedBy = Phil Abraham\n |WrittenBy = Drew Goddard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = When Murdock was a boy, his father was murdered by the Hell's Kitchen [[Irish Mob]] for winning a match he was told to [[Match fixing|throw]]. Now, after failing to rescue the kidnapped boy, a severely injured Murdock is found in a dumpster by nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]. Nelson meanwhile attempts to comfort Page following her recent traumatic experiences. Temple takes Murdock to her apartment, tends to his wounds, and removes his mask, discovering his blindness. He refuses to reveal his name, but does reveal his heightened senses when they alert him to a Russian who is searching the apartment building, giving Temple time to hide Murdock and convince the man that she knows nothing. Murdock realizes that the man did not believe her, and overpowers him, taking him to the roof. Murdock and Temple torture him into revealing the boy's location, before Murdock pushes him off the roof and into the same dumpster; Murdock says he will survive. Murdock enters the building where they are keeping the boy, defeats the guards, and rescues the boy.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Rabbit in a Snowstorm\n |DirectedBy = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy = Marco Ramirez\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Wesley, having become aware of Nelson and Murdock because of their involvement with Page during the Union Allied scandal, hires them to defend John Healy, an assassin. Though Nelson wishes not to get involved with an obvious criminal element, Murdock wishes to use the case to discover who Wesley's employer is, and so accepts Wesley's offer, which includes a substantial sum to ensure their silence. Page receives a similar offer from Union Allied, who do not want her to talk to anyone else about the scandal, and threaten to sue her for leaking company secrets to the press if she does not agree. Despite this, Page goes to Urich, whose editor Ellison is forcing him to write superfluous stories rather than the major crime breaks of his youth, and offers to tell him more about the Union Allied scandal. After successfully defending Healy, Murdock confronts him in costume and forces him to reveal Wesley's employer, [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]. Healy  commits suicide rather than face the consequences of giving up Fisk's identity.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = In the Blood\n |DirectedBy = [[Ken Girotti]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Joe Pokaski]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock is unable to find any record of Fisk, and so continues to interrogate criminals, searching for answers. Wesley informs the Ranskahovs of an offer Fisk has made to help with their operations, given their recent failures. Angered at this apparent slight, they attempt to stop the man in black once and for all by visiting in hospital the Russian whom Murdock threw from the roof. After the Russian tells them of Temple, they send men to kidnap her, but she manages to call Murdock in time to alert him of her kidnapping. The Russians attempt to torture Murdock's name out of Temple, but Murdock arrives and defeats the gangsters. Seeing the aftermath of this, the Ranskahovs decide to agree to Fisk's offer, with Anatoly going to tell Fisk personally, by barging into the restaurant where Fisk is having dinner with an art gallery curator named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]]. Fisk takes a confused Marianna home, and angered at this intrusion and embarrassment, Fisk beheads Anatoly and orders Wesley to send the body to Vladimir.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = World on Fire\n |DirectedBy = [[Farren Blackburn]]\n |WrittenBy = Luke Kalteux\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Fisk explains the situation to his allies, including Chinese leader Madame Gao, of whom he asks a special favor. Elena Cardenas, a renter of powerful businessman Armand Tulley, comes to Nelson and Murdock after Tulley, who wants to convert her apartment building, sends men to wreck her home. Nelson goes to Tulley's lawyers at Landman and Zack (where he and Murdock once interned), represented by Marci Stahl, Nelson's ex-girlfriend. She explains that Cardenas and her neighbors can either take a large settlement or be evicted. While looking for complaints against Tulley at the police station, Murdock realizes Detectives Carl Hoffman and Christian Blake are corrupt when he hears them kill a Russian. Murdock later incapacitates Blake and uses his cell phone to find Vladimir. Fisk pays [[Turk Barrett]] to reveal to Vladimir that Fisk killed Anatoly, and as they prepare for a war against Fisk, their forces are destroyed in a [[suicide attack]] by Gao's workers.

With Temple's help, Murdock cauterizes Vladimir's wounds, alerting a non-corrupt police officer to their presence. The officer calls in Murdock and Vladimir's location, and the warehouse is soon surrounded. Blake and Hoffman take control of the situation, and await Fisk's orders. Fisk talks to Murdock via police radio, telling him of his admiration for what Murdock is trying to do, even though it clashes with Fisk's own plans to save the city. Fisk then frames the vigilante by having a police sniper fire on other officers from the roof of the warehouse, including Blake, as Urich and the media look on. Vladimir, in return for Murdock avenging Anatoly's death, gives him information on [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]] \u2013 the accountant for all of Fisk's operations \u2013 before giving his life so that Murdock can escape.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Stick\n |DirectedBy = [[Brad Turner (director)|Brad Turner]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Douglas Petrie]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock tracks down Owlsley, but is distracted by the arrival of an elderly man: Murdock's mentor, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], who taught him to master his abilities as a child, but abandoned him when Murdock developed an attachment to him. Now, he enlists Murdock's help in destroying Black Sky, a weapon that the Japanese, led by Nobu, are bringing to New York. Stick agrees to refrain from killing, but breaks his promise when he kills Black Sky, who is actually a young boy. After fighting in Murdock's apartment, Murdock defeats Stick, who agrees to leave the city. Urich, having agreed to help Page expose the further scandal and corruption surrounding Hell's Kitchen and Union Allied, explains that they need proof before they can publish anything. While searching for a connection between Tulley's men and Union Allied, Page is confronted by them. Nelson helps her escape them, so she and Urich explain their investigation to him.

Owlsley and Nobu, angry at being confronted by the vigilante and losing Black Sky, respectively, express their displeasure with Fisk, while he is also dealing with Blake, who wakes up in hospital. Fisk convinces Hoffman to kill Blake before he can speak out against Fisk, but Hoffman is incapacitated by Murdock, who gets information on Fisk from Blake before he dies. Gao visits Fisk, warning him that he will have to get everything under control if he does not want her, Nobu, and Owlsley to side-step him. An angry Fisk is later consoled by Marianna, and he tells her of how, as a child, he murdered his father when he was beating Fisk's mother. She convinces him to stand up and go public with his intentions to save the city.

Nobu demands a promised city block from Fisk, who agrees on the condition Nobu provide him with a \"specialist\" in return to deal with the vigilante. The block, which Fisk has bought from Tulley, is where Cardenas lives, and she is one of the few tenants who stands in the way of Fisk gifting it to Nobu. When Cardenas is killed by a junkie, Murdock realizes that Fisk is behind it, and tracks him to an abandoned warehouse, where he is confronted by the specialist: Nobu.

He was succeeded by [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes, remained with the show as a consultant and executive producer. It was also revealed that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Daredevil''.<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> The first season consists of 13 hour-long episodes,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight, Goddard, [[Jeph Loeb]], Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season does not directly adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling that it was more important to focus on \"nailing the spirit of the comics\".<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" /> He stated that Netflix's support of \"the creatives\" coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material as far as he could while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at \"how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we\u2019re doing.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a \"13-hour film\" than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and \"be much more specific\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioMar2015\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in \"seemingly insurmountable circumstances\", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nThough the season was much more violent than previous MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be \"too far\", saying that \"''Daredevil'' wasn\u2019t asking for a lot of sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn\u2019t fit the story for that season. I think that\u2019ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once ''Daredevil'' was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\nSpeaking about the way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight explained that several options had been brought up, such as \"one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil\", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having [[Ben Urich]] give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would \"get a little bit silly....[if] we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!',\" and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Charlie Cox]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]],<ref name=\"Cox\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"Woll\" /> [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> \n\nIn July 2014, [[Peter Shinkoda]] was reported to have a recurring role in the season, portraying Hashiro.<ref name=\"Shinkoda\" /> In March 2015, this character was revealed to actually be Nobu Yoshioka, while recurring opponents for Daredevil \u2013 Madame Gao, Vladimir Ranskahov, and [[Turk Barrett]] \u2013 were also announced, portrayed by Wai Ching Ho, [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]], and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]].<ref name=\"EWMar2015Castings\" /><ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Additionally, the following also recur throughout the season: Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison;<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"Cantor\" /> Judith Delgado as Elena Cardenas;<ref name=\"Delgado\" /> Daryl Edwards as Carl Hoffman;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> [[Adriane Lenox]] as Doris Urich;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Father Paul Lantom]];<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" /> Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl;<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> Chris Tardio as Christian Blake;<ref name=\"Tardio\" /> Susan Varon as Josie;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> and Tom Walker as Francis.<ref name=\"Walker\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Marvel's Daredevil.gif|thumb|right|The two costumes worn by Cox in the season: first, his black \"vigilante outfit\";<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> second, his red \"classic suit\".<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" />]]\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky read the first two episodes' scripts and some outlines of future scripts, and developed a \"solid understanding\" of the character arcs and overall story to begin the advanced planning needed for costume design. She also asked questions to prepare for character's stunt requirements and the building or retro-fitting of more complex costumes.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" />\n\nMurdock begins the season wearing a black costume (called the \"vigilante outfit\" by production), inspired by the one worn by the character in [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[List of Daredevil titles#One-shots and limited series|The Man Without Fear]]'', rather than the more traditional red, horned suit. This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> On the design process, DeKnight revealed that \"we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented with a lot of different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right.\"<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the \"real-world\" of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store.\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that \"really conform to his head\" but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor\u2019s face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side as it is in the \"classic profile\" of the comics.<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" /> DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the \"DD\" emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was \"one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom\", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was \"very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty\".<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\nMany of the male characters in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to \"what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn\u2019t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Daredevil'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, stating that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell\u2019s Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Loeb said that ''Daredevil'' would begin filming in July 2014,<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month.<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> It filmed under the [[working title]] ''Bluff'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program.<ref name=\"Budget\" /> Production concluded on December 21, 2014.<ref name=\"ProductionWrap\" /> Other filming locations in New York City included the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] and [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhoods in Brooklyn;<ref name=\"Brooklyn\" /><ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Abe Lebewohl Park in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in [[Flushing, Queens]]; the [[New York County Courthouse|New York State Supreme Court Building]], with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]; the [[Rockefeller Center]] rooftop gardens; [[Brooklyn College]] for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\n\"Cut Man\" ends with a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. DeKnight called it the \"most complicated action scene\" in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director [[Phil Abraham]], stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> He also named ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films as inspiration for the sequence.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" /> There were only a few days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow \"at least a couple of weeks\", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them \"slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening.\" The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.<ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\nTalking about the scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in \"In the Blood\", DeKnight noted that series like ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would have shown the head being crushed, which he felt was \"the right choice\" for them, but for ''Daredevil'' \"we did very much a ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but you never saw the car door crushing his head....Sound effects, absolutely. It\u2019s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX; ''Daredevil'' featured over 1000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" /><ref name=\"ShadeVFX2\" /> Executive visual effects supervisor Bryan Goswin explained that the company's work included the creation of digital doubles when stunts were not safe for actors or stunt doubles, as well as blood-hits and wounds, with \"a lot of support to the idea of the violence and gore that happens in Daredevil\" given to differentiate the series from other Marvel projects, and to try to set the series in a \"more realistic and dark place, the real streets of New York.\"<ref name=\"ShadeVFX3\" />\n\nOne shot created by Shade VFX is when the audience sees Matt Murdock's \"vision\" \u2013 the way that he \"sees\" using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in \"Stick\", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in \"The Ones We Leave Behind\" when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect was going to be in \"Daredevil\" when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] was brought on \"a couple of weeks in to post-production\", and scored an episode every four to five days. Paesano estimated that each episode has around 25\u201330 minutes of music in it. In approaching the series' score, Paesano looked to DeKnight, who \"had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... music you could feel and not necessarily hear.\" The result was a more [[minimalism|minimalist]] score than typical \"superhero\" music, although the music starts to \"change color\" and move closer to that of the MCU when the classic red costume is introduced. Most of the score was produced electronically, though live elements, such as a cello, were used where possible. Rather than \"keep the drive and the energy up\" with drums, Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series' minimalist approach, and tied into the fact that Daredevil can hear people's heartbeats in the show.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on April 27, 2015.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 41:45\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano & Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:04\n\n| title2          = Fogwell's Gym\n| length2         = 3:53\n\n| title3          = Battlin' Jack Murdock\n| length3         = 3:05\n\n| title4          = Hallway Fight\n| length4         = 4:26\n\n| title5          = Union Allied\n| length5         = 1:51\n\n| title6          = Passenger Side\n| length6         = 2:57\n\n| title7          = A World on Fire\n| length7         = 1:26\n\n| title8          = Ben Urich\n| length8         = 3:09\n\n| title9          = Stick\n| length9         = 2:11\n\n| title10         = Wilson Fisk\n| length10        = 4:38\n\n| title11         = Worthy Opponents\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = Avocados at Law\n| length12        = 1:42\n\n| title13         = Man of Ill Intent\n| length13        = 3:45\n\n| title14         = The Suit\n| length14        = 5:43\n\n| title15         = Daredevil\n| length15        = 1:41\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn February 2015, Emma Fleisher of Marvel Television stated that ''Daredevil'' takes place in the aftermath of ''The Avengers'', but would not \"explicitly [be] in that ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' world.

So the [[Chitauri|aliens]] came down and ruined the city, and this is the story of Hell's Kitchen's rebuild.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlend\" /> Connections to other MCU properties include the character of [[Absorbing Man|Carl \"Crusher\" Creel]], who appears in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and is mentioned as having fought Jack Murdock in the latter's final boxing match;<ref name=\"IGN8Apr2015\" /> St. Agnes Orphanage, where both Matt Murdock and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] are raised; the insignia on Madame Gao's heroin, which is a connection to the Iron Fist antagonist [[Steel Serpent]]; and mentions of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" />\n\nThe final scene of \"Stick\", featuring a conversation between [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and Stone, was meant to hint at further ties between the series and other areas of the MCU in the same way as Marvel's film [[post-credits scene]]s, though it could not actually go after the episode's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> There were discussions about having another such \"coda\" at the end of the season finale, one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York, only to be killed by the [[Punisher]] in a surprise introduction. The scene would not have shown the actor's face, but would have included the character's iconic skull insignia. The idea was dropped, again because of Netflix's playing system, and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode, with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series' [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]].<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Daredevil'' was released on April 10, 2015 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> On April 14, 2015, ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track, \"a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes.\"<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" /> By April 16, episodes for the series had been [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] by 2.1 million individual users worldwide, according to Excipio, a piracy tracking firm, surpassed in that timeframe only by ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The biggest countries for piracy were Brazil (190,274 torrent downloaders), India (149,316), the U.S. (144,351), the UK (119,891), France (105,473) and Australia (101,025). Except for India, Netflix was available in each of those countries at the time.<ref name=\"Piracy\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nAt the October 2014 [[New York Comic Con]], footage from the series was shown.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> In January 2015, a motion [[film poster]] was released to coincide with the revealing of the streaming date for the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The following month, on February 4, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and different from Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC series]], but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after [[Super Bowl XLIX]], especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' or ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and could have benefited from introducing \"its latest and riskiest show\" to general audiences through it.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> In March 2015, an additional motion poster was released, which featured all major characters and [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] in the background of the poster, as well as the possible reveal of Murdock's red suit in his reflection.<ref name=\"MotionPoster\" /> In the lead up to the first-season premiere, a [[street marketing]] campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals.<ref name=\"Murals\" /> On April 2, 2015, the series had its premiere at the [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Premiere House]] at [[L.A. Live]]<ref name=\"LAPremiere\" /> where the first two episodes were previewed.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on October 3, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on November 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Luth Research compiled data for the season, based on a sample of 2,500 Netflix subscribers watching via computers, tablets or smartphones. (Luth Research does not track Netflix viewing on televisions, whether Internet-connected sets or those linked to streaming-media players or gaming consoles.) According to Luth, an estimated 10.7% of subscribers (approximately 4.4 million) watched at least one episode of ''Daredevil'' in its first 11 days on Netflix, with 2.3% (940,000) watching on the first day.<ref name=\"LuthViewers\" /> In a separate study, Netflix determined that the fifth episode of the season was the one to \"hook\" viewers, \"to the point where they [continued on to watch] the entire first season.\"<ref name=\"NetflixHook\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:The Judge 32 (15236588671).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Wilson Fisk was one of the highlights of the series for critics.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /><ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"IWReview\" />]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 70 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With tight adherence to its source material's history, high production quality, and a no-nonsense dramatic flair, ''Daredevil'' excels as an effective superhero origin story, a gritty procedural, and an exciting action adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil|title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn reviews for the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that \"Compared to Marvel's experience with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating\" in terms of what can be done and shown.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Matt Patches of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' added, \"The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench ''Daredevil'' in shadows and blood.\" He compared ''Daredevil'' to \"a TV spinoff\" of [[Christopher Nolan]]{{'}}s [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|Batman films]], and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of ''Daredevil'', in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /> Victoria McNally of [[MTV]] felt the early episodes' fight sequences were \"filmed beautifully\" and enjoyed that they featured little [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], while also calling Henson \"perfectly cast and endlessly amusing\" as Nelson.<ref name=\"MTVReview\" />\n\nEric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend also had positive thoughts on the initial episodes, saying, \"It\u2019s smart, entertaining, and has moments so shocking that you\u2019ll have to repress screams. Suffice it to say, Marvel and Netflix have another big winner on their respective plates,\" while also praising the acting.<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> Speaking of the first two episodes, Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' added additional praise, saying, \"Quite simply, in ''Daredevil'' Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]''.\" Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they \"would\u2019ve been hailed as one of Marvel\u2019s best films to date.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> Mike Hale at the ''[[New York Times]]'' was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace \"leisurely\", but \"a pleasant change from the norm\", and called Cox's performance \"divided\", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, ''Daredevil'' is \"eminently watchable\", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\" />\n\nAfter reviewing each of the individual episodes, [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler gave the entire first season a score of 9 out of 10, indicating an \"Amazing\" season, saying that though it may have \"spun a few wheels\" while building up to its endgame, the series was \"a thrilling, ultra-satisfying take on Daredevil's material and lore. One that, like Favreau's first Iron Man film, helped breathe new life and fandom into a somewhat B-tier Marvel character.\" He particularly praised D'Onofrio's performance, the \"edgy\" fight sequences, the fact that the hero himself got \"beat on \u2013 a lot\", and the unique dark take on the MCU.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Liz Shannon Miller, reviewing the season for [[Indiewire]], graded it a 'B+', and though feeling that it didn't quite live up to DeKnight's admitted influence, ''The Wire'', praised the series, noting its characters and development, and the performances of the entire cast, especially those of D'Onofrio, Curtis-Hall, and Cox. She was positive about the level of violence the series depicted, and all of its \"brutal\" and \"beautiful\" fight sequences, as well as the way that the series explores the consequences for average people of events from the films, while committing to building its own universe within the already established MCU.<ref name=\"IWReview\" /> [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] also praised the cast and characters, particularly D'Onofrio, and felt that series benefited from having a much narrower focus than the Marvel films or other series. He did wish that Murdock's \"world on fire\"-sight was used more often, and felt that the classic Daredevil costume, which \"may not translate well to live-action\", could use \"some tweaks\".<ref name=\"HitFixReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nCox was honored at the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]'s 19th Annual Helen Keller Achievement Awards, for those \"that have demonstrated outstanding achievement in improving quality of life for people with vision loss.\"<ref name=\"19thHelenKellerAA\" /> The series' main title sequence, created initially for this season, won the [[Online Film & Television Association Award|Online Film & Television Association's award]] for the Best New Titles Sequence,<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\"/> and was nominated for the Creative Arts Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Outstanding Main Title Design]], which went to ''[[Manhattan (TV series)|Manhattan]]''.<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\" />\n\nThe season was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> ''[[Business Insider]]''{{'}}s (3rd),<ref name=\"BITop102015\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[Digital Spy]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"TVGuideTop102015\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> and ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (23rd).<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> It also was included on ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}} Best New TV Shows of 2015 list.<ref name=\"VanityFairTop102015\" /> ''Daredevil''{{'}}s first season was the seventh trending television show search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!

(TV series)#Episodes\n}}\nThe first season of the American [[web television]] series ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', which is based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|of the same name]], follows the early days of Matt Murdock / Daredevil, a lawyer-by-day who fights crime at night, juxtaposed with the rise of crime lord [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]. It is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU), sharing continuity with [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|the films]] and other [[Marvel's Netflix television series|television series of the franchise]]. The season was produced by [[Marvel Television]] in association with [[ABC Studios]], DeKnight Prods. and Goddard Textiles, with [[Steven S. DeKnight]] serving as [[showrunner]], and series creator [[Drew Goddard]] acting as consultant.\n\n[[Charlie Cox]] stars as Murdock, while [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] plays Fisk. They are joined by principal cast members [[Deborah Ann Woll]], [[Elden Henson]], [[Toby Leonard Moore]], [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]], [[Bob Gunton]], [[Ayelet Zurer]], and [[Rosario Dawson]]. ''Daredevil'' entered development in late 2013, with Goddard hired in December. DeKnight replaced him as showrunner and Cox was hired to star in May 2014. Filmed in New York City from July to December 2014, the season focuses on the darker, more mature elements of the source material. Stephanie Maslansky designed the costumes for the season, with the final red suit for Daredevil designed by Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists at [[Marvel Studios]]. The season features links and references to other MCU projects, including future Netflix series.\n\nThe first two episodes of the season premiered in Los Angeles on April 2, 2015, with the full season of 13 episodes released on [[Netflix]] on April 10 to an estimated high viewership. Critics praised the performances, particularly D'Onofrio's, and the darker tone and action sequences of the series compared to other properties set in the MCU. However, some of the pacing during the season and the final red Daredevil suit received criticism. The first season received two nominations for [[67th Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Emmy Awards]], for the visual effects from Shade VFX, and the sound editing. The series was renewed for a [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]] on April 21, 2015.<ref name=\"Season2Ordered\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#0A2252 |overall=7 |season=7 |title=25 |director=16 |writer=30 |airdate=15 |airdateR=<ref name=\"Futon\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch/marvels-daredevil/listings/ |title=Shows A-Z - marvel's daredevil on netflix |website=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=August 6, 2019}}</ref> |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = Into the Ring\n |DirectedBy = [[Phil Abraham]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Drew Goddard]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Criminals, including the [[Russian mafia]], [[Yakuza]], and [[Triad (organized crime)|Chinese mob]], have taken advantage of [[Hell's Kitchen]]'s circumstances since \"[[The Avengers (2012 film)#Plot|the incident]]\". Blinded as a boy in an accident that gave him heightened senses, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock]] begins fighting this rising criminal element by night as a costumed [[vigilante]] while opening a law firm with his friend, [[Foggy Nelson]]. Their first client is [[Karen Page]], a secretary for construction company Union Allied, who has been framed for the murder of her co-worker, Daniel Fisher, after accidentally uncovering a pension embezzlement scheme. Murdock prevents Karen from being prosecuted and protects her from an assassin, before exposing the scandal through [[Ben Urich]] at ''The New York Bulletin''. Grateful for their help, Page offers to work for Murdock and Nelson. [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]] covers up the involvement of his employer in the scandal, and orders Anatoly and Vladimir Ranskahov, the Russians' leaders, to deal with Murdock (\"the man in black\"): they kidnap a young boy to lure him into a trap.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Cut Man\n |DirectedBy = Phil Abraham\n |WrittenBy = Drew Goddard\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = When Murdock was a boy, his father was murdered by the Hell's Kitchen [[Irish Mob]] for winning a match he was told to [[Match fixing|throw]]. Now, after failing to rescue the kidnapped boy, a severely injured Murdock is found in a dumpster by nurse [[Claire Temple (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Claire Temple]]. Nelson meanwhile attempts to comfort Page following her recent traumatic experiences. Temple takes Murdock to her apartment, tends to his wounds, and removes his mask, discovering his blindness. He refuses to reveal his name, but does reveal his heightened senses when they alert him to a Russian who is searching the apartment building, giving Temple time to hide Murdock and convince the man that she knows nothing. Murdock realizes that the man did not believe her, and overpowers him, taking him to the roof. Murdock and Temple torture him into revealing the boy's location, before Murdock pushes him off the roof and into the same dumpster; Murdock says he will survive. Murdock enters the building where they are keeping the boy, defeats the guards, and rescues the boy.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Rabbit in a Snowstorm\n |DirectedBy = [[Adam Kane]]\n |WrittenBy = Marco Ramirez\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Wesley, having become aware of Nelson and Murdock because of their involvement with Page during the Union Allied scandal, hires them to defend John Healy, an assassin. Though Nelson wishes not to get involved with an obvious criminal element, Murdock wishes to use the case to discover who Wesley's employer is, and so accepts Wesley's offer, which includes a substantial sum to ensure their silence. Page receives a similar offer from Union Allied, who do not want her to talk to anyone else about the scandal, and threaten to sue her for leaking company secrets to the press if she does not agree. Despite this, Page goes to Urich, whose editor Ellison is forcing him to write superfluous stories rather than the major crime breaks of his youth, and offers to tell him more about the Union Allied scandal. After successfully defending Healy, Murdock confronts him in costume and forces him to reveal Wesley's employer, [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]]. Healy  commits suicide rather than face the consequences of giving up Fisk's identity.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 4\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 4\n |Title = In the Blood\n |DirectedBy = [[Ken Girotti]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Joe Pokaski]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock is unable to find any record of Fisk, and so continues to interrogate criminals, searching for answers. Wesley informs the Ranskahovs of an offer Fisk has made to help with their operations, given their recent failures. Angered at this apparent slight, they attempt to stop the man in black once and for all by visiting in hospital the Russian whom Murdock threw from the roof. After the Russian tells them of Temple, they send men to kidnap her, but she manages to call Murdock in time to alert him of her kidnapping. The Russians attempt to torture Murdock's name out of Temple, but Murdock arrives and defeats the gangsters. Seeing the aftermath of this, the Ranskahovs decide to agree to Fisk's offer, with Anatoly going to tell Fisk personally, by barging into the restaurant where Fisk is having dinner with an art gallery curator named [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]]. Fisk takes a confused Marianna home, and angered at this intrusion and embarrassment, Fisk beheads Anatoly and orders Wesley to send the body to Vladimir.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 5\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 5\n |Title = World on Fire\n |DirectedBy = [[Farren Blackburn]]\n |WrittenBy = Luke Kalteux\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Fisk explains the situation to his allies, including Chinese leader Madame Gao, of whom he asks a special favor. Elena Cardenas, a renter of powerful businessman Armand Tulley, comes to Nelson and Murdock after Tulley, who wants to convert her apartment building, sends men to wreck her home. Nelson goes to Tulley's lawyers at Landman and Zack (where he and Murdock once interned), represented by Marci Stahl, Nelson's ex-girlfriend. She explains that Cardenas and her neighbors can either take a large settlement or be evicted. While looking for complaints against Tulley at the police station, Murdock realizes Detectives Carl Hoffman and Christian Blake are corrupt when he hears them kill a Russian. Murdock later incapacitates Blake and uses his cell phone to find Vladimir. Fisk pays [[Turk Barrett]] to reveal to Vladimir that Fisk killed Anatoly, and as they prepare for a war against Fisk, their forces are destroyed in a [[suicide attack]] by Gao's workers.

With Temple's help, Murdock cauterizes Vladimir's wounds, alerting a non-corrupt police officer to their presence. The officer calls in Murdock and Vladimir's location, and the warehouse is soon surrounded. Blake and Hoffman take control of the situation, and await Fisk's orders. Fisk talks to Murdock via police radio, telling him of his admiration for what Murdock is trying to do, even though it clashes with Fisk's own plans to save the city. Fisk then frames the vigilante by having a police sniper fire on other officers from the roof of the warehouse, including Blake, as Urich and the media look on. Vladimir, in return for Murdock avenging Anatoly's death, gives him information on [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]] \u2013 the accountant for all of Fisk's operations \u2013 before giving his life so that Murdock can escape.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Stick\n |DirectedBy = [[Brad Turner (director)|Brad Turner]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Douglas Petrie]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = Murdock tracks down Owlsley, but is distracted by the arrival of an elderly man: Murdock's mentor, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], who taught him to master his abilities as a child, but abandoned him when Murdock developed an attachment to him. Now, he enlists Murdock's help in destroying Black Sky, a weapon that the Japanese, led by Nobu, are bringing to New York. Stick agrees to refrain from killing, but breaks his promise when he kills Black Sky, who is actually a young boy. After fighting in Murdock's apartment, Murdock defeats Stick, who agrees to leave the city. Urich, having agreed to help Page expose the further scandal and corruption surrounding Hell's Kitchen and Union Allied, explains that they need proof before they can publish anything. While searching for a connection between Tulley's men and Union Allied, Page is confronted by them. Nelson helps her escape them, so she and Urich explain their investigation to him.

Owlsley and Nobu, angry at being confronted by the vigilante and losing Black Sky, respectively, express their displeasure with Fisk, while he is also dealing with Blake, who wakes up in hospital. Fisk convinces Hoffman to kill Blake before he can speak out against Fisk, but Hoffman is incapacitated by Murdock, who gets information on Fisk from Blake before he dies. Gao visits Fisk, warning him that he will have to get everything under control if he does not want her, Nobu, and Owlsley to side-step him. An angry Fisk is later consoled by Marianna, and he tells her of how, as a child, he murdered his father when he was beating Fisk's mother. She convinces him to stand up and go public with his intentions to save the city. This negates all of Murdock's information from Blake, which Urich was going to publish.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 9\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 9\n |Title = Speak of the Devil\n |DirectedBy = [[Nelson McCormick (director)|Nelson McCormick]]\n |WrittenBy = [[Christos Gage]] & Ruth Fletcher Gage\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|4|10}}\n |ShortSummary = In the wake of Fisk's public revelation, Murdock, Page, Nelson, and Urich begin searching for something from Fisk's past that they can use against him. Murdock visits Marianna at her art gallery, hoping to gain insight into Fisk by speaking with her, and encounters Fisk himself. Nobu demands a promised city block from Fisk, who agrees on the condition Nobu provide him with a \"specialist\" in return to deal with the vigilante. The block, which Fisk has bought from Tulley, is where Cardenas lives, and she is one of the few tenants who stands in the way of Fisk gifting it to Nobu. When Cardenas is killed by a junkie, Murdock realizes that Fisk is behind it, and tracks him to an abandoned warehouse, where he is confronted by the specialist: Nobu. Murdock eventually defeats Nobu, accidentally causing him to burn alive, but sustains serious injuries. Fisk then confronts Murdock, beating him nearly to death. Murdock barely escapes, only to collapse at his home in front of Nelson.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 10\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 10\n |Title = Nelson v.

Murdock explains that after experiencing the twisted morals of Landman and Zack, Murdock took it upon himself to confront an abusive father with no legal evidence against him, but who Murdock had discovered through his heightened senses. Since then, he had been doing everything he could to make the city a better place whenever the law could not. Nelson, unable to look past Murdock's lies, leaves their firm. Urich, after the extension on his sick wife's hospital stay is denied and he is offered a better paying job as an editor rather than a reporter, decides to give up the investigation. Page, in an attempt to change his mind, takes him to a rest home she just discovered, where they meet Marlene Vistain, Fisk's mother, who tells them that Fisk killed his father. Fisk, meanwhile, is throwing a charity gala to publicly raise money for victims of the bombings.

Before she goes, Temple suggests that he get better protection if he is going to continue his crusade. With the help of Barrett, Murdock finds [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Melvin Potter]], a mentally unbalanced engineer who has been coerced into creating armored clothing for Fisk, and asks him to make a suit of body armor in exchange for stopping Fisk from hurting anyone else. Page wishes to reveal the story of how Vistain is alive, and says that Fisk killed his father, but Urich explains that it is unreliable, given her state of mind. While Fisk will not leave Marianna's side as she recovers in hospital, Wesley receives a phone call from Vistain and learns that Page and Urich visited her. He confronts Page and attempts to blackmail her into not exposing Fisk, threatening to hurt her friends.

Fisk's men find Wesley, and the grieving Fisk realizes that the last person he talked to was Vistain. Wanting to keep those he loves safe by sending them out of the country, Fisk is unable to convince Marianna to leave him, but does get Vistain away, with the sick Vistain unable to tell him what her call to Wesley was about. Nelson continues his work without Murdock, and takes what they know to Stahl. Page, struggling to get over killing Wesley, convinces Urich to write the story, but it is rejected by Ellison. When Urich accuses Ellison of being paid off by Fisk, he gets fired. Urich decides to start his own blog to get Fisk's story out there, but Fisk's actual informant in the ''Bulletin'' tells him that Urich visited Vistain, angering him to the point that he breaks into Urich's apartment and kills him.\n |LineColor = 0A2252\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Daredevil (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 13\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 13\n |Title = Daredevil\n |DirectedBy = Steven S.

When Owlsley tries to blackmail him, an infuriated Fisk kills Owlsley by throwing him into an open elevator shaft. Murdock and Nelson reconcile their differences, and begin building their case against Fisk. As the vigilante, Murdock finds Hoffman with information from Stahl and convinces him to testify against Fisk. Acting on this testimony, federal agents arrest Fisk and his co-conspirators, but Fisk manages to escape custody. Before he can flee the city, Murdock intercepts him, wearing the new armor made for him by Potter. After a brutal fight, Murdock defeats Fisk and leaves him to the police. With Fisk arrested, Marianna leaves the city. Murdock, Page, and Nelson celebrate their success and resume their work.

He was succeeded by [[Steven S. DeKnight]]. Goddard, who wrote the first two episodes, remained with the show as a consultant and executive producer. It was also revealed that the series would be titled ''Marvel's Daredevil''.<ref name=\"GoddardDaredevilExit\" /> The first season consists of 13 hour-long episodes,<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight, Goddard, [[Jeph Loeb]], Jim Chory, [[Dan Buckley]], [[Joe Quesada]], [[Stan Lee]], [[Alan Fine (executive)|Alan Fine]], Cindy Holland, Kris Henigman, Allie Goss, and Peter Friedlander serve as executive producers.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" />\n\n===Writing===\nThe season does not directly adapt any one storyline from the comics, with DeKnight feeling that it was more important to focus on \"nailing the spirit of the comics\".<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" /> He stated that Netflix's support of \"the creatives\" coupled with Marvel's restrictions on their properties led to him pushing the source material as far as he could while remaining respectful of the characters and their history, and being surprised at \"how willing everyone is to take a really fresh look and really push what we\u2019re doing.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightPaste\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] compared telling a story on Netflix to more of a \"13-hour film\" than a television series and noted that time can be taken to tell the story and \"be much more specific\".<ref name=\"D'OnofrioMar2015\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] explained that what she saw as one of the most important themes in the series was normal people having an impact in \"seemingly insurmountable circumstances\", with the focus not being on Daredevil's abilities or the characters' qualifications, but on their willingness to help people.<ref name=\"IGNApr2015\" />\n\nThough the season was much more violent than previous MCU works, DeKnight felt that sexual violence would be \"too far\", saying that \"''Daredevil'' wasn\u2019t asking for a lot of sexual situations, especially since Matt Murdock is not really in the position to get into a relationship, and it just didn\u2019t fit the story for that season. I think that\u2019ll change moving forward, but I never pushed any kind of sexual agenda on the show. I think once ''Daredevil'' was a hit and people were really responding positively, you can see the progression into more of an adult world in ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\nSpeaking about the way the season reveals the name Daredevil, DeKnight explained that several options had been brought up, such as \"one of the versions in the comics where when he was a kid people used to taunt him with the name Daredevil\", which did not fit in the world of the series, or having [[Ben Urich]] give the character the name, but the timing for that did not work due to Urich's death before the final Daredevil suit was introduced. It was decided that instead of having the name Daredevil said onscreen, it would be easier to introduce it through the media as a newspaper headline. On why this was not done for Wilson Fisk as Kingpin, DeKnight stated that he felt it would \"get a little bit silly....[if] we went, 'Oh they called him Daredevil! Oh they called him Kingpin!',\" and was unable to come up with another natural way for the name Kingpin to come up, so it was decided to leave that for a later time.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Casting===\nThe main cast for the season includes [[Charlie Cox]] as [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Matt Murdock / Daredevil]],<ref name=\"Cox\" /> [[Deborah Ann Woll]] as [[Karen Page]],<ref name=\"Woll\" /> [[Elden Henson]] as [[Foggy Nelson|Franklin \"Foggy\" Nelson]],<ref name=\"Henson\" /> [[Toby Leonard Moore]] as [[Wesley (comics)|James Wesley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Vondie Curtis-Hall]] as [[Ben Urich]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Bob Gunton]] as [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Leland Owlsley]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Ayelet Zurer]] as [[Vanessa Fisk|Vanessa Marianna]],<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /> [[Rosario Dawson]] as [[Claire Temple]],<ref name=\"DawsonCast\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /> [[Vincent D'Onofrio]] as [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]].<ref name=\"D'Onofrio\" /> \n\nIn July 2014, [[Peter Shinkoda]] was reported to have a recurring role in the season, portraying Hashiro.<ref name=\"Shinkoda\" /> In March 2015, this character was revealed to actually be Nobu Yoshioka, while recurring opponents for Daredevil \u2013 Madame Gao, Vladimir Ranskahov, and [[Turk Barrett]] \u2013 were also announced, portrayed by Wai Ching Ho, [[Nikolai Nikolaeff]], and [[Rob Morgan (actor)|Rob Morgan]].<ref name=\"EWMar2015Castings\" /><ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> Additionally, the following also recur throughout the season: Geoffrey Cantor as Mitchell Ellison;<ref name=\"MarvelNYCC\" /><ref name=\"Cantor\" /> Judith Delgado as Elena Cardenas;<ref name=\"Delgado\" /> Daryl Edwards as Carl Hoffman;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> Royce Johnson as Brett Mahoney;<ref name=\"EdwardsJohnson\" /> [[Adriane Lenox]] as Doris Urich;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> [[Peter McRobbie]] as [[Father Lantom|Father Paul Lantom]];<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" /> Amy Rutberg as Marci Stahl;<ref name=\"Rutberg\" /> Chris Tardio as Christian Blake;<ref name=\"Tardio\" /> Susan Varon as Josie;<ref name=\"NerdistCast\" /> and Tom Walker as Francis.<ref name=\"Walker\" />\n\n===Design===\n[[File:Charlie Cox as Daredevil in Marvel's Daredevil.gif|thumb|right|The two costumes worn by Cox in the season: first, his black \"vigilante outfit\";<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> second, his red \"classic suit\".<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" />]]\nCostume designer Stephanie Maslansky read the first two episodes' scripts and some outlines of future scripts, and developed a \"solid understanding\" of the character arcs and overall story to begin the advanced planning needed for costume design.

This was done to highlight the formation of Matt Murdock as Daredevil, with the costume evolving over time as the character develops.<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> Marvel Comics' [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] Quesada conceptualized the look based on DeKnight's specifications.<ref name=\"TyrannyStyle\" /> On the design process, DeKnight revealed that \"we tried practically everything, design-wise. We experimented with a lot of different head pieces. One version was a ski mask with the eyes sewn shut. We tried everything until we found something that just felt right.\"<ref name=\"IGNTrailer\" /> DeKnight and Quesada explained that the idea was for Murdock to start out with a homemade outfit that fits more in the \"real-world\" of the series, and to then evolve it into the classic Daredevil suit.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> Maslansky noted that they wanted the outfit to \"look like something that Matt Murdock could put together himself, that he could either order off the Internet or shop around town....we wound up with pretty practical choices for him. His shirts are compression shirts and his pants wound up being from an army/navy store.\" Concerning the black mask, Maslansky noted that a balance between aesthetic and safety was required, and that it was made of layers of cotton mesh that \"really conform to his head\" but also allowed Cox to see through the mask.<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\nOn the red suit, Maslansky said, \"We wanted something that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy\" adding that it was \"tricky\" making it practical.<ref name=\"IGNCostume\" /> To begin the process of creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on ''Daredevil'' comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and \"architectural\" shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with \"deeper portions\" in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, \"because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actor\u2019s face is going to be doing something else\". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by [[Andy Park (comics)|Andy Park]], discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side as it is in the \"classic profile\" of the comics.<ref name=\"MarvelSuit\" /> DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the \"DD\" emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was \"one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom\", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was \"very difficult to translate to screen, especially in this world that is grounded and gritty\".<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\nMany of the male characters in the series are often seen wearing suits, which Maslansky was comfortable with after working as the costume designer on ''[[White Collar (TV series)|White Collar]]''. Murdock's suits are differentiated more by texture than color, with a limited palette, given that the character cannot see what color his clothing is. Cox's size changed throughout the series as he continued to work out. For Murdock's sunglasses, Maslansky worked with series prop master Michael Jortner to make something that fit into the modern world, but paid homage to \"what was familiar to fans\". Close to 100 different versions of the prop were created for Cox to try. For the women of the series, Maslansky looked to their backstories in the show, with Page having dreams and fantasies of a life in New York along the lines of [[Katharine Hepburn]] and [[Lauren Bacall]], and dressing according to those thoughts (\"retro, slim skirts, tighter fitting tops and slim dresses\"), while Marianna coming into the series as a mysterious yet glamorous [[femme fatale]], dressing in high-end, couture clothing; \"she needed to appeal to [Fisk]. He wouldn\u2019t go for just any chick in a pair of old jeans and a t-shirt.\"<ref name=\"Fashionista\" />\n\n===Filming===\nIn February 2014, Marvel announced that ''Daredevil'' would be filmed in New York City.<ref name=\"NYCFilmingAnnounced\" /> In April 2014, Quesada reiterated this, stating that the show would be filming in areas of [[Brooklyn]] and [[Long Island City]] that still look like the old [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell\u2019s Kitchen]], in addition to sound stage work.<ref name=\"QuesadaNetflix\" /> Loeb said that ''Daredevil'' would begin filming in July 2014,<ref name=\"JulyFilmingAnnounced\" /> and DeKnight confirmed that filming had started that month.<ref name=\"DeKnightJuly2014\" /> It filmed under the [[working title]] ''Bluff'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> on a $56 million budget. The production received $14.3 million under the New York Film & TV Tax Credit Program.<ref name=\"Budget\" /> Production concluded on December 21, 2014.<ref name=\"ProductionWrap\" /> Other filming locations in New York City included the [[Williamsburg, Brooklyn|Williamsburg]], [[Greenpoint, Brooklyn|Greenpoint]] and [[Bushwick, Brooklyn|Bushwick]] neighborhoods in Brooklyn;<ref name=\"Brooklyn\" /><ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" /> Abe Lebewohl Park in the [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]]; Whitestone Lanes bowling alley in [[Flushing, Queens]]; the [[New York County Courthouse|New York State Supreme Court Building]], with the interior for court scenes filmed on a set; [[Brooklyn Borough Hall]]; the [[Rockefeller Center]] rooftop gardens; [[Brooklyn College]] for Murdock and Nelson's flashback to their time in college; the [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]] neighborhood in Manhattan; and the Honeywell Bridge in Long Island City.<ref name=\"UntappedFilming\" />\n\n\"Cut Man\" ends with a long action sequence filmed in a [[Long take|single take]]. DeKnight called it the \"most complicated action scene\" in the series, due to the technical difficulty in filming it, and credited Goddard, episodic director [[Phil Abraham]], stunt coordinator Philip J Silvera, and series cinematographer Matt Lloyd with realizing it.<ref name=\"ColliderApr2015\" /> He also named ''[[The Raid: Redemption|The Raid]]'' films as inspiration for the sequence.<ref name=\"RSApr2015\" /> There were only a few days to plan and set up the fight, as opposed to a film which would allow \"at least a couple of weeks\", and it took 7 or 8 takes to get the shot right. Silvera explained that the scene was always scripted to be a one-shot, and that he had intended to work around it with wipes, but Abraham challenged the team to do it all for real, which allowed the fight to feel more grounded by having them \"slow down the fight, and just have this raw, animalistic feeling happening.\" The final shot does include some 'Texas Switches' between actors and stunt doubles, but was ultimately filmed with no cuts.<ref name=\"Stunts\" />\n\nTalking about the scene where Fisk beheads Anatoly Ranskahov with a car door in \"In the Blood\", DeKnight noted that series like ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' and ''[[The Walking Dead (TV series)|The Walking Dead]]'' would have shown the head being crushed, which he felt was \"the right choice\" for them, but for ''Daredevil'' \"we did very much a ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' thing, we saw the aftereffects of it, but you never saw the car door crushing his head....Sound effects, absolutely. It\u2019s a very disturbing scene without crossing that line into a horror movie kind of deal.\"<ref name=\"DeKnightGrislyScenes\" />\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects for the series were completed by the New York studio Shade VFX; ''Daredevil'' featured over 1000 visual effect shots.<ref name=\"ShadeVFX\" /><ref name=\"ShadeVFX2\" /> Executive visual effects supervisor Bryan Goswin explained that the company's work included the creation of digital doubles when stunts were not safe for actors or stunt doubles, as well as blood-hits and wounds, with \"a lot of support to the idea of the violence and gore that happens in Daredevil\" given to differentiate the series from other Marvel projects, and to try to set the series in a \"more realistic and dark place, the real streets of New York.\"<ref name=\"ShadeVFX3\" />\n\nOne shot created by Shade VFX is when the audience sees Matt Murdock's \"vision\" \u2013 the way that he \"sees\" using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in \"Stick\", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in \"The Ones We Leave Behind\" when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect was going to be in \"Daredevil\" when the camera pushes in on Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" />\n\n===Music===\nComposer [[John Paesano]] was brought on \"a couple of weeks in to post-production\", and scored an episode every four to five days. Paesano estimated that each episode has around 25\u201330 minutes of music in it. In approaching the series' score, Paesano looked to DeKnight, who \"had a very clear vision of what he wanted ... music you could feel and not necessarily hear.\" The result was a more [[minimalism|minimalist]] score than typical \"superhero\" music, although the music starts to \"change color\" and move closer to that of the MCU when the classic red costume is introduced. Most of the score was produced electronically, though live elements, such as a cello, were used where possible. Rather than \"keep the drive and the energy up\" with drums, Paesano elected to use a low pulsing heartbeat that was inline with the series' minimalist approach, and tied into the fact that Daredevil can hear people's heartbeats in the show.<ref name=\"PaesanoApr2015\" /> A soundtrack album for the season was released digitally by [[Hollywood Records]] on April 27, 2015.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n\nAll music composed by John Paesano, unless otherwise noted.<ref name=\"Soundtrack\" />\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = \n| total_length    = 41:45\n\n\n| title1          = Main Title\n| music1          = John Paesano & Braden Kimball\n| length1         = 1:04\n\n| title2          = Fogwell's Gym\n| length2         = 3:53\n\n| title3          = Battlin' Jack Murdock\n| length3         = 3:05\n\n| title4          = Hallway Fight\n| length4         = 4:26\n\n| title5          = Union Allied\n| length5         = 1:51\n\n| title6          = Passenger Side\n| length6         = 2:57\n\n| title7          = A World on Fire\n| length7         = 1:26\n\n| title8          = Ben Urich\n| length8         = 3:09\n\n| title9          = Stick\n| length9         = 2:11\n\n| title10         = Wilson Fisk\n| length10        = 4:38\n\n| title11         = Worthy Opponents\n| length11        = 2:28\n\n| title12         = Avocados at Law\n| length12        = 1:42\n\n| title13         = Man of Ill Intent\n| length13        = 3:45\n\n| title14         = The Suit\n| length14        = 5:43\n\n| title15         = Daredevil\n| length15        = 1:41\n}}\n\n===Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins===\nIn February 2015, Emma Fleisher of Marvel Television stated that ''Daredevil'' takes place in the aftermath of ''The Avengers'', but would not \"explicitly [be] in that ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' world. We're in our own corner [of the MCU]. So the [[Chitauri|aliens]] came down and ruined the city, and this is the story of Hell's Kitchen's rebuild.\"<ref name=\"CinemaBlend\" /> Connections to other MCU properties include the character of [[Absorbing Man|Carl \"Crusher\" Creel]], who appears in ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' portrayed by [[Brian Patrick Wade]], and is mentioned as having fought Jack Murdock in the latter's final boxing match;<ref name=\"IGN8Apr2015\" /> St. Agnes Orphanage, where both Matt Murdock and ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''{{'}}s [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] are raised; the insignia on Madame Gao's heroin, which is a connection to the Iron Fist antagonist [[Steel Serpent]]; and mentions of [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon Oil]], a company featured throughout the MCU.<ref name=\"SRTrivia\" />\n\nThe final scene of \"Stick\", featuring a conversation between [[Stick (comics)|Stick]] and Stone, was meant to hint at further ties between the series and other areas of the MCU in the same way as Marvel's film [[post-credits scene]]s, though it could not actually go after the episode's credits due to the way that Netflix begins the next episode during the credits of the current one.<ref name=\"DeKnightPostmortem\" /> There were discussions about having another such \"coda\" at the end of the season finale, one which would have featured Leland Owlsley attempting to escape New York, only to be killed by the [[Punisher]] in a surprise introduction. The scene would not have shown the actor's face, but would have included the character's iconic skull insignia. The idea was dropped, again because of Netflix's playing system, and Owlsley was ultimately killed by Fisk in the episode, with the introduction of the Punisher saved for the series' [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]].<ref name=\"PunisherCoda\" />\n\n==Release==\nThe first season of ''Daredevil'' was released on April 10, 2015 on the [[streaming media|streaming service]] Netflix, in all territories where it is available, in [[Ultra-high-definition television|Ultra HD]] [[4K resolution|4K]].<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /><ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> On April 14, 2015, ''Daredevil'' was the first Netflix series to receive its [[Descriptive Video Service]] [[audio description]] track, \"a narration track that describes what is happening on-screen, including physical actions, facial expressions, costumes, settings and scene changes.\"<ref name=\"NetflixAudioDescription\" /> By April 16, episodes for the series had been [[Copyright infringement|pirated]] by 2.1 million individual users worldwide, according to Excipio, a piracy tracking firm, surpassed in that timeframe only by ''[[Game of Thrones]]''. The biggest countries for piracy were Brazil (190,274 torrent downloaders), India (149,316), the U.S. (144,351), the UK (119,891), France (105,473) and Australia (101,025). Except for India, Netflix was available in each of those countries at the time.<ref name=\"Piracy\" /> The season was enhanced to be available in [[High-dynamic-range video|high dynamic range]] after its initial release by post-production vendor [[Deluxe Entertainment Services Group|Deluxe]].<ref name=\"HDR\" />\n\n===Marketing===\nAt the October 2014 [[New York Comic Con]], footage from the series was shown.<ref name=\"NYCC20141\" /><ref name=\"NYCC20142\" /> In January 2015, a motion [[film poster]] was released to coincide with the revealing of the streaming date for the first season.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> The following month, on February 4, a teaser trailer was released.<ref name=\"VarietyTrailerUltraHD\" /> Merrill Barr of ''[[Forbes]]'' noted the dark tone of the trailer in a similar vein to [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]'' and different from Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series#ABC series|ABC series]], but questioned the timing of the trailer debut after [[Super Bowl XLIX]], especially as the company did not air trailers during the event for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' or ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' and could have benefited from introducing \"its latest and riskiest show\" to general audiences through it.<ref name=\"ForbesTrailer\" /> In March 2015, an additional motion poster was released, which featured all major characters and [[Stark Tower|Avengers Tower]] in the background of the poster, as well as the possible reveal of Murdock's red suit in his reflection.<ref name=\"MotionPoster\" /> In the lead up to the first-season premiere, a [[street marketing]] campaign appeared across the world in 12 cities with various artists creating murals.<ref name=\"Murals\" /> On April 2, 2015, the series had its premiere at the [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Premiere House]] at [[L.A. Live]]<ref name=\"LAPremiere\" /> where the first two episodes were previewed.<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" />\n\n===Home media===\nThe season was released on [[DVD]] in [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] and [[Blu-ray]] in [[Blu-ray#B|Region B]] on October 3, 2016,<ref name=\"Region2HomeMedia\" /> in [[DVD region code#1|Region 1]] and [[Blu-ray#A|Region A]] on November 8, 2016,<ref name=\"Region1HomeMedia\" /> and in [[DVD region code#4|Region 4]] on December 7, 2016.<ref name=\"Region4HomeMedia\" />\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Audience viewership===\nAs Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series, Luth Research compiled data for the season, based on a sample of 2,500 Netflix subscribers watching via computers, tablets or smartphones. (Luth Research does not track Netflix viewing on televisions, whether Internet-connected sets or those linked to streaming-media players or gaming consoles.) According to Luth, an estimated 10.7% of subscribers (approximately 4.4 million) watched at least one episode of ''Daredevil'' in its first 11 days on Netflix, with 2.3% (940,000) watching on the first day.<ref name=\"LuthViewers\" /> In a separate study, Netflix determined that the fifth episode of the season was the one to \"hook\" viewers, \"to the point where they [continued on to watch] the entire first season.\"<ref name=\"NetflixHook\" />\n\n===Critical response===\n[[File:The Judge 32 (15236588671).jpg|thumb|right|150px|Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as Wilson Fisk was one of the highlights of the series for critics.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /><ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /><ref name=\"IWReview\" />]]\nThe [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reported a 99% approval rating with an average rating of 8.1/10 based on 70 reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"With tight adherence to its source material's history, high production quality, and a no-nonsense dramatic flair, ''Daredevil'' excels as an effective superhero origin story, a gritty procedural, and an exciting action adventure.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/daredevil/s01/|title=Marvel's Daredevil: Season 1 (2015)|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=January 6, 2019}}</ref> [[Metacritic]], which uses a weighted average, assigned a score of 75 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metacritic.com/tv/marvels-daredevil|title=Marvel's Daredevil : Season 1|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=April 10, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn reviews for the first five episodes of the series, Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' felt that \"Compared to Marvel's experience with ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' for ABC, operating in Netflix's pay-to-view world is clearly liberating\" in terms of what can be done and shown.<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> Matt Patches of ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' added, \"The show's exterior recasts the high fructose, splash page aesthethic of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America with neo-noir attitude. Goddard and DeKnight drench ''Daredevil'' in shadows and blood.\" He compared ''Daredevil'' to \"a TV spinoff\" of [[Christopher Nolan]]{{'}}s [[The Dark Knight Trilogy|Batman films]], and praised Cox and D'Onofrio's portrayals, while criticizing a subplot involving Nelson and Page and noting that the slow pacing of ''Daredevil'', in which story may be stretched out more than needs be, could be a problem for binge-watchers.<ref name=\"EsquireReview\" /> Victoria McNally of [[MTV]] felt the early episodes' fight sequences were \"filmed beautifully\" and enjoyed that they featured little [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], while also calling Henson \"perfectly cast and endlessly amusing\" as Nelson.<ref name=\"MTVReview\" />\n\nEric Eisenberg of Cinema Blend also had positive thoughts on the initial episodes, saying, \"It\u2019s smart, entertaining, and has moments so shocking that you\u2019ll have to repress screams. Suffice it to say, Marvel and Netflix have another big winner on their respective plates,\" while also praising the acting.<ref name=\"CinemaBlendReview\" /> Speaking of the first two episodes, Mark Hughes of ''[[Forbes]]'' added additional praise, saying, \"Quite simply, in ''Daredevil'' Marvel delivers one of the greatest live-action superhero origin stories ever made. It is in the same top-tier category of true superhero origin films along with ''[[Batman Begins]]'', ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'', and ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman: The Movie]]''.\" Hughes stated that if the first two episodes were released in theaters with only minor tweaks, they \"would\u2019ve been hailed as one of Marvel\u2019s best films to date.\"<ref name=\"ForbesReview\" /> Mike Hale at the ''[[New York Times]]'' was less positive about the series, calling it ordinary, but admitting having high expectations due to his love for the comics, and admiring the care and seriousness with which the series was made. He called the series pace \"leisurely\", but \"a pleasant change from the norm\", and called Cox's performance \"divided\", praising him as Murdock and criticizing him as Daredevil. Hale was positive about the cast overall, and ultimately surmised that after seeing the first five episodes, ''Daredevil'' is \"eminently watchable\", but not the Daredevil he remembered from the comics.<ref name=\"NYTimesReview\" />\n\nAfter reviewing each of the individual episodes, [[IGN]] reviewer Matt Fowler gave the entire first season a score of 9 out of 10, indicating an \"Amazing\" season, saying that though it may have \"spun a few wheels\" while building up to its endgame, the series was \"a thrilling, ultra-satisfying take on Daredevil's material and lore. One that, like Favreau's first Iron Man film, helped breathe new life and fandom into a somewhat B-tier Marvel character.\" He particularly praised D'Onofrio's performance, the \"edgy\" fight sequences, the fact that the hero himself got \"beat on \u2013 a lot\", and the unique dark take on the MCU.<ref name=\"IGNSeasonReview\" /> Liz Shannon Miller, reviewing the season for [[Indiewire]], graded it a 'B+', and though feeling that it didn't quite live up to DeKnight's admitted influence, ''The Wire'', praised the series, noting its characters and development, and the performances of the entire cast, especially those of D'Onofrio, Curtis-Hall, and Cox. She was positive about the level of violence the series depicted, and all of its \"brutal\" and \"beautiful\" fight sequences, as well as the way that the series explores the consequences for average people of events from the films, while committing to building its own universe within the already established MCU.<ref name=\"IWReview\" /> [[Alan Sepinwall]] of [[HitFix]] also praised the cast and characters, particularly D'Onofrio, and felt that series benefited from having a much narrower focus than the Marvel films or other series. He did wish that Murdock's \"world on fire\"-sight was used more often, and felt that the classic Daredevil costume, which \"may not translate well to live-action\", could use \"some tweaks\".<ref name=\"HitFixReview\" />\n\n===Accolades===\nCox was honored at the [[American Foundation for the Blind]]'s 19th Annual Helen Keller Achievement Awards, for those \"that have demonstrated outstanding achievement in improving quality of life for people with vision loss.\"<ref name=\"19thHelenKellerAA\" /> The series' main title sequence, created initially for this season, won the [[Online Film & Television Association Award|Online Film & Television Association's award]] for the Best New Titles Sequence,<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\"/> and was nominated for the Creative Arts Emmy Award for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Main Title Design|Outstanding Main Title Design]], which went to ''[[Manhattan (TV series)|Manhattan]]''.<ref name=\"EmmyAwards\" />\n\nThe season was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists, ranking on ''[[People (magazine)|People]]''{{'}}s (1st, along with ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''),<ref name=\"PeopleTop102015\" /> ''[[Business Insider]]''{{'}}s (3rd),<ref name=\"BITop102015\" /> ''[[TV Guide]]'' and [[Digital Spy]]'s (7th),<ref name=\"TVGuideTop102015\" /><ref name=\"DigitalSpyTop102015\" /> and ''[[Slate Magazine]]''{{'}}s (23rd).<ref name=\"SlateTop252015\" /> It also was included on ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]''{{'}} Best New TV Shows of 2015 list.<ref name=\"VanityFairTop102015\" /> ''Daredevil''{{'}}s first season was the seventh trending television show search on [[Google]] for 2015.<ref name=\"GoogleTrend\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 99%;\"\n|-\n!
