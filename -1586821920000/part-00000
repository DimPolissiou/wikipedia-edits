Each video is produced in the form of a sporting event with commentary provided by Greg Woods.  The channel features annual series such as the ''Marble League'', the ''Marble Rally'', ''Marbula One'', and the ''Hubelino Tournament'' with the same set teams competing across events. Additionally, Jelle produces seasonal Halloween and Christmas content, as well as one-off events such as the ''A-Maze-ing Maze Race''. Interspersed between the competition videos, Jelle releases a wide variety of marble runs without commentary exhibiting his marble course constructions (some of which are on display in museums).\n\n==History==\nJelle Bakker was born in 1983 in [[Wervershoof]], [[Netherlands]]. He stated on his old YouTube channel that he has a form of [[autism]], and said that because he has no occupation, making marble machines was one of his biggest [[Hobby|hobbies]].<ref name=\"eyVSJ\" /> He currently lives in [[Nijmegen]]. Shortly after Bakker created his YouTube channel, Greg Woods commented on one of his videos and eventually became the English commentator for the entire series.<ref name=\"B4dkz\" /> Originally, Bakker planned to end the MarbleLympics series after the 2017 MarbleLympics. \u201cThe MarbleLympics will end in early August with an ending ceremony,\u201d he said in an interview by ''[[The Irish News]]'',\u201d but I will still continue in making great marbles-related videos.\" However, he continued the series due to popularity.\n\nHe received the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for the world's longest marble run on May 21, 2009. The record was broken by someone else in 2011.<ref name=\"qclJh\" />\n\nIn 2006, he created the ''Jelle's Marble Runs'' YouTube channel, on which he started the MarbleLympics in 2016 as a mock version of the Olympic games. The channel soon started gaining attention and a fanbase in 2015.<ref name=\"ED07p\" />\n\nIn late 2018, Bakker accidentally deleted his original channel while trying to delete his [[Google+]] account and was forced to relaunch.<ref name=\"Z8X4b\" />\n\n==Popular Series==\n\n===Marble League===\nThe Marble League (formerly the MarbleLympics) is an annual series featuring marbles competing in Olympic-inspired events. At its inception in 2016, 16 teams were invited to compete in 12 events which included the 10 meter sprint, hurdles, and the long jump among others. Each team consisted of four marbles of matching colors and patterns. The champion of the Marble League is crowned based on the aggregate points in all events. Starting in 2017, the qualifiers were held in advance of each Marble League season with the top four teams from the previous year automatically qualifying for the subsequent season. Beginning in 2018, the Marble League featured a host team that took one of the four automatic qualification spots alongside the top three teams from the last year. The 2018 Marble League was the first and only winter edition featuring events such as speed skating, ice hockey, and snowboard cross. Other changes included the addition of a fifth team member. In 2019, the MarbleLympics changed its name to Marble League due to trademark issues, increased the number of events to 16, and added a coach marble for each team.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Host\n!style=\"background-color: gold;\"|Champion\n!style=\"background-color: silver;\"|Runner-Up \n!style=\"background-color: #cd7f32\"|Third place\n|-\n|2016\n|n/a\n|Savage Speeders\n|Mellow Yellow\n|Thunderbolts\n|-\n|2017\n|n/a\n|O'rangers\n|Savage Speeders\n|Mellow Yellow\n|-\n|2018\n|Snowballs\n|Midnight Wisps\n|Savage Speeders\n|Oceanics\n|-\n|2019\n|Oceanics\n|Raspberry Racers\n|Green Ducks\n|Hazers\n|-\n|2020\n|Team Galactic\n|TBD\n|TBD\n|TBD\n|}\n\n====Marble League Showdown====\nThe Marble League Showdown was introduced in 2019 as the lower division series of games for teams who did not qualify for the year's Marble League championship games.

Since in a normal atom or crystal lattice the negative charge of the electrons is balanced by the positive charge of the [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]], the absence of an electron leaves a net positive charge at the hole's location.

This meaning is used in [[Auger electron spectroscopy]] (and other [[x-ray]] techniques), in [[computational chemistry]], and to explain the low electron-electron scattering-rate in crystals ([[metal]]s, semiconductors).\n\nIn [[crystal]]s, [[electronic band structure]] calculations lead to an [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]] for the electrons, which is typically negative at the top of a band. The [[negative mass]] is an unintuitive concept,<ref>For these negative mass electrons, [[crystal momentum|momentum]] is opposite to [[group velocity|velocity]], so forces acting on these electrons cause their velocity to change in the 'wrong' direction.

A hole is essentially a way to conceptualize the interactions of the electrons within a nearly ''full'' valence band of a crystal lattice, which is ''missing'' a small fraction of its electrons. In some ways, the behavior of a hole within a semiconductor [[Crystal structure|crystal lattice]] is comparable to that of the bubble in a full bottle of water.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Weller|first=Paul F.|date=1967|title=An analogy for elementary band theory concepts in solids|journal=J.

The tiles are analogous to electrons, while the missing tile ''(lower right corner)'' is analogous to a hole.  Just as the position of the missing tile can be moved to different locations by moving the tiles, a hole in a crystal lattice can move to different positions in the lattice by the motion of the surrounding electrons.]]\n\nHole conduction in a [[valence band]] can be explained by the following analogy. Imagine a row of people seated in an auditorium, where there are no spare chairs. Someone in the middle of the row wants to leave, so he jumps over the back of the seat into another row, and walks out. The empty row is analogous to the [[conduction band]], and the person walking out is analogous to a conduction electron.\n\nNow imagine someone else comes along and wants to sit down. The empty row has a poor view; so he does not want to sit there. Instead, a person in the crowded row moves into the empty seat the first person left behind. The empty seat moves one spot closer to the edge and the person waiting to sit down. The next person follows, and the next, et cetera. One could say that the empty seat moves towards the edge of the row. Once the empty seat reaches the edge, the new person can sit down.\n\nIn the process everyone in the row has moved along. If those people were negatively charged (like electrons), this movement would constitute [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conduction]]. If the seats themselves were positively charged, then only the vacant seat would be positive. This is a very simple model of how hole conduction works.\n\nInstead of analyzing the movement of an empty state in the valence band as the movement of many separate electrons, a single equivalent imaginary particle called a \"hole\" is considered. In an applied [[electric field]], the electrons move in one direction, corresponding to the hole moving in the other. If a hole associates itself with a neutral atom, that atom loses an electron and becomes positive. Therefore, the hole is taken to have positive [[electric charge|charge]] of +e, precisely the opposite of the electron charge.\n\nIn reality, due to the [[uncertainty principle]] of [[quantum mechanics]], combined with the [[Bloch wave|energy levels available in the crystal]], the hole is not localizable to a single position as described in the previous example. Rather, the positive charge which represents the hole spans an area in the crystal lattice covering many hundreds of [[crystal structure|unit cells]]. This is equivalent to being unable to tell which broken bond corresponds to the \"missing\" electron.  Conduction band electrons are similarly delocalized.\n\n=== Detailed picture: A hole is the absence of a negative-mass electron ===\n[[File:BandDiagram-Semiconductors-E.PNG|thumb|right|A semiconductor [[electronic band structure]] (right) includes the dispersion relation of each band, i.e. the energy of an electron ''E'' as a function of the electron's [[Wave vector|wavevector]] ''k''. The \"unfilled band\" is the semiconductor's [[conduction band]]; it curves upward indicating positive [[effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]. The \"filled band\" is the semiconductor's [[valence band]]; it curves downward indicating negative effective mass.]]\nThe analogy above is quite simplified, and cannot explain why holes create an opposite effect to electrons in the [[Hall effect]] and [[Thermoelectric effect#Seebeck effect|Seebeck effect]]. A more precise and detailed explanation follows.<ref name=Kittel>Kittel, ''Introduction to Solid State Physics'', 8th edition, pp. 194\u2013196.</ref>\n\n* ''The [[dispersion relation]] determines how electrons respond to forces (via the concept of [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]).''<ref name=Kittel />\n\nA dispersion relation is the relationship between [[Wave vector|wavevector]] (k-vector) and energy in a band, part of the [[electronic band structure]]. In quantum mechanics, the electrons are waves, and energy is the wave frequency. A localized electron is a [[Wave packet|wavepacket]], and the motion of an electron is given by the formula for the [[group velocity|group velocity of a wave]]. An electric field affects an electron by gradually shifting all the wavevectors in the wavepacket, and the electron accelerates when its wave group velocity changes. Therefore, again, the way an electron responds to forces is entirely determined by its dispersion relation. An electron floating in space has the dispersion relation ''E''=\u210f<sup>2</sup>''k''<sup>2</sup>/(2''m''), where ''m'' is the (real) [[Electron rest mass|electron mass]] and \u210f is [[Planck constant|reduced Planck constant]]. Near the bottom of the [[conduction band]] of a semiconductor, the dispersion relation is instead ''E''=\u210f<sup>2</sup>''k''<sup>2</sup>/(2''m''<sup>*</sup>) (''m''<sup>*</sup> is the ''[[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|effective mass]]''), so a conduction-band electron responds to forces ''as if'' it had the mass ''m''<sup>*</sup>.\n\n* ''Electrons near the top of the [[valence band]] behave as if they have [[negative mass]].''<ref name=Kittel />\n\nThe dispersion relation near the top of the valence band is ''E''=\u210f<sup>2</sup>k<sup>2</sup>/(2''m''<sup>*</sup>) with ''negative'' effective mass. So electrons near the top of the valence band behave like they have [[negative mass]]. When a force pulls the electrons to the right, these electrons actually move left. This is solely due to the shape of the valence band and is unrelated to whether the band is full or empty. If you could somehow empty out the valence band and just put one electron near the valence band maximum (an unstable situation), this electron would move the \"wrong way\" in response to forces.\n\n* ''Positively-charged holes as a shortcut for calculating the total current of an almost-full band.''<ref name=Kittel />\n\nA perfectly full band always has zero current. One way to think about this fact is that the electron states near the top of the band have negative effective mass, and those near the bottom of the band have positive effective mass, so the net motion is exactly zero. If an otherwise-almost-full valence band has a state ''without'' an electron in it, we say that this state is occupied by a hole. There is a mathematical shortcut for calculating the current due to every electron in the whole valence band: Start with zero current (the total if the band were full), and ''subtract'' the current due to the electrons that ''would'' be in each hole state if it wasn't a hole. Since ''subtracting'' the current caused by a ''negative'' charge in motion is the same as ''adding'' the current caused by a ''positive'' charge moving on the same path, the mathematical shortcut is to pretend that each hole state is carrying a positive charge, while ignoring every other electron state in the valence band.\n\n* ''A hole near the top of the valence band moves the same way as an electron near the top of the valence band '''would''' move''<ref name=Kittel /> (which is in the opposite direction compared to conduction-band electrons experiencing the same force.)\n\nThis fact follows from the discussion and definition above. This is an example where the auditorium analogy above is misleading. When a person moves left in a full auditorium, an empty seat moves right. But in this section we are imagining how electrons move through k-space, not real space, and the effect of a force is to move all the electrons through k-space in the same direction at the same time. In this context, a better analogy is a bubble underwater in a river: The bubble moves the same direction as the water, not the opposite.\n\nSince force = mass \u00d7 acceleration, a negative-effective-mass electron near the top of the valence band would move the opposite direction as a positive-effective-mass electron near the bottom of the conduction band, in response to a given electric or magnetic force. Therefore, a hole moves this way as well.\n\n* ''Conclusion: Hole is a positive-charge, positive-mass [[quasiparticle]]''.\n\nFrom the above, a hole (1) carries a positive charge, and (2) responds to electric and magnetic fields as if it had a positive charge and positive mass. (The latter is because a particle with positive charge and positive mass respond to electric and magnetic fields in the same way as a particle with a negative charge and negative mass.) That explains why holes can be treated in all situations as ordinary positively charged [[quasiparticles]].\n\n=== Role in semiconductor technology ===\n\nIn some semiconductors, such as silicon, the hole's effective mass is dependent on a direction ([[Anisotropy|anisotropic]]), however a value averaged over all directions can be used for some macroscopic calculations.\n\nIn most semiconductors, the effective mass of a hole is much larger than that of an [[electron]]. This results in lower [[Electron mobility|mobility]] for holes under the influence of an [[electric field]] and this may slow down the speed of the electronic device made of that semiconductor. This is one major reason for adopting electrons as the primary charge carriers, whenever possible in semiconductor devices, rather than holes. Also, why [[NMOS logic]] is faster than [[PMOS logic]].\n\nHowever, in many semiconductor devices, both electrons ''and'' holes play an essential role. Examples include [[p\u2013n diode]]s, [[Bipolar junction transistor|bipolar transistors]], and [[CMOS logic]].\n\n== Holes in quantum chemistry ==\nAn alternate meaning for the term '''electron hole''' is used in [[computational chemistry]]. In [[coupled cluster]] methods, the ground (or lowest energy) state of a molecule is interpreted as the \"vacuum state\"\u2014conceptually, in this state, there are no electrons. In this scheme, the absence of an electron from a normally filled state is called a \"hole\" and is treated as a particle, and the presence of an electron in a normally empty state is simply called an \"electron\". This terminology is almost identical to that used in solid-state physics.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Band gap]]\n* [[Carrier generation and recombination]]\n* [[Effective mass (solid-state physics)|Effective mass]]\n* [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity]]\n* [[Hole formalism]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Particles}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Quasiparticles]]\n[[Category:Quantum chemistry]]\n[[Category:Charge carriers]]\n[[Category:Holes]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Holon (physics)}}\n\n[[Image:Electron-hole.svg|thumb|When an electron leaves a [[helium]] atom, it leaves an electron-hole in its place.

Fahad Sultan, the son of a feudal lord studies with Samra and the two fall in love. They get married and live a happy life although Samra has problems adjusting  in the feudal system while she was raised in a modern household. Fahad was going to contest elections due to the influence of his politician father, but some enemies shoot him to death. This turns Samra's life upside down. She is deeply saddened by her husband's death and in addition to that, her husband's family imposes ruthless rules on her. Samra's father dies in a car crash and Samra was not even allowed to go to her own father's funeral. Every sort of hardship is imposed on Samra, who is pregnant with Fahad's child.\n\nFahad's father, Sultan Asfantyar is deeply sadden by the death of his son and he believes he has lost his son because of a sin that he committed ---he had abandoned his first son. 28 years ago, Asfantyar had married Amna (Saba Faisal) but his mother Lalimaa jad refused to accept Amna because of which Asfantyar left the pregnant Amna. Now Asfantyar decides to bring Amna and her son to his house to rectify his mistakes. He meets his son Saarang. Saarang did not know that his father was alive and when he gets to know the truth, he is furious but Asfantyar manages to beg Saarang to come to his mansion. Amna and Saarang enter the mansion and face rejection from Laalimaa(Naveed Shahzad) and Aafandyar's second wife Taashfeen (Jia Ali). Taashfeen does not want to give Saarang the position of Fahad but Asfandyar gives Saarang all the authorities that Fahad had. Saarang falls in love with Samra. Samra gives birth to Fahad's son Qasim. Samra is miserable at the haveli so Saarang tries to help her by getting her a secret mobile phone which she can use to contact her mother. Samra finally runs away from the haveli with the help of Saarang. Saarang decides that the only way he can get Samra to safety is if she marries him as Saarang now has power and authority. Samra initially refuses out of loyalty to Fahad but unknowingly she starts to fall for him. Thinking of her son, she agrees to marry Saarang and they do so and face rejection from the family except Amna. Saarang decides to take his mother and Samra with them to live somewhere else but is stopped by Laali Maa who refuses to let Samra leave and taunts her for betraying Fahad. Samra retaliates by calling her out of her behaviour saying she\u2019s the reason for everything even Fahad\u2019s death and she continues criticising her until  Laali Maa suffers a heart attack. \n\nSamra moves away to live with her mum and Laali Maa finally wakes up and regrets everything she has done. She finally accepts Saarang as her grandson and also Samra but the latter is still unable to forgive her.

Fahad Sultan, the son of a feudal lord studies with Samra and the two fall in love. They get married and live a happy life although Samra has problems adjusting  in the feudal system while she was raised in a modern household. Fahad was going to contest elections due to the influence of his politician father, but some enemies shoot him to death. This turns Samra's life upside down. She is deeply saddened by her husband's death and in addition to that, her husband's family imposes ruthless rules on her. Samra's father dies in a car crash and Samra was not even allowed to go to her own father's funeral. Every sort of hardship is imposed on Samra, who is pregnant with Fahad's child.\n\nFahad's father, Sultan Asfantyar is deeply sadden by the death of his son and he believes he has lost his son because of a sin that he committed ---he had abandoned his first son. 28 years ago, Asfantyar had married Amna (Saba Faisal) but his mother Lalimaa jad refused to accept Amna because of which Asfantyar left the pregnant Amna. Now Asfantyar decides to bring Amna and her son to his house to rectify his mistakes. He meets his son Saarang. Saarang did not know that his father was alive and when he gets to know the truth, he is furious but Asfantyar manages to beg Saarang to come to his mansion. Amna and Saarang enter the mansion and face rejection from Laalimaa(Naveed Shahzad) and Aafandyar's second wife Taashfeen (Jia Ali). Taashfeen does not want to give Saarang the position of Fahad but Asfandyar gives Saarang all the authorities that Fahad had. Saarang falls in love with Samra. Samra gives birth to Fahad's son Qasim. Samra is miserable at the haveli so Saarang tries to help her by getting her a secret mobile phone which she can use to contact her mother. Samra finally runs away from the haveli with the help of Saarang. Saarang decides that the only way he can get Samra to safety is if she marries him as Saarang now has power and authority. Samra initially refuses out of loyalty to Fahad but unknowingly she starts to fall for him. Thinking of her son, she agrees to get married to Saarang and they do so and face rejection from the family except Amna. Saarang decides to take his mother and Samra with them to live somewhere else but is stopped by Laali Maa who refuses to let Samra leave and taunts her for betraying Fahad. Samra retaliates by calling her out of her behaviour saying she\u2019s the reason for everything even Fahad\u2019s death and she continues criticising her until  Laali Maa suffers a heart attack. \n\nSamra moves away to live with her mum and Laali Maa finally wakes up and regrets everything she has done. She finally accepts Saarang as her grandson and also Samra but the latter is still unable to forgive her. Asfantyar visits Samra and his grandson and asks forgiveness and she forgives him and finally lets him see his grandson. In her imagination, Samra sees Fahad who tells her to accept her feelings for Saarang and gives his blessings. In the end, Samra finally forgives Laali Maa and her and Saarang finally confess their love for each other.\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Yumna Zaidi]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://veryfilmi.com/zahid-ahmed-yumna-zaidi-star-together-pukaar/|title=Zahid Ahmed and Yumna Zaidi to Star Together in Pukaar! - VeryFilmi|date=2018-02-06|work=VeryFilmi|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}</ref> as Samra Sultan; Fahad\u2019s former wife, Sarang\u2019s wife\n*[[Zahid Ahmed (actor)|Zahid Ahmed]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hipinpakistan.com/news/1153767|title=Zahid Ahmed- the man on a roll- signs another serial titled \"Pukaar\"|last=Khan|first=Saira|date=2017-10-23|work=HIP|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}</ref> as Sarang Sultan; Sultan and Amna\u2019s son, Samra\u2019s second husband \n*[[Saad Qureshi]] as Fahad Sultan; Sultan and Taashfeen\u2019s son, Samra\u2019s first husband \n*Naveed Shahzad as Laali Maa; Sultan Asfand\u2019s mother \n*[[Rehan Sheikh]] as Sultan Asfand; Fahad and Sarang\u2019s father, Laali Maa\u2019s son, Amna and Taashfeen\u2019s husband\n*Jia Ali as Taashfeen; Fahad's mother, Sultan\u2019s second wife\n*[[Laila Zuberi]] as Samra's mother\n*[[Shehryar Zaidi]] as Najam; Samra's father\n*[[Saba Faisal (actress)|Saba Faisal]] as Amna; Sarang's mother, Sultan\u2019s first wife\n*Kausar Siddiqui as Zamani; Laali Maa\u2019s maid\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|http://www.arydigital.tv/waada-exclusive-ary-digital-drama/}}\n\n[[Category:Pakistani drama television series]]\n[[Category:Urdu-language television programs]]\n[[Category:ARY Digital television series]]\n[[Category:2018 Pakistani television series debuts]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pukaar_(Pakistani_TV_series)"}

This battle took place around 1600 as the Ng\u0101ti Raukawa moved into the southern Waikato. The name ''Tokoroa'' first appeared on the early maps of the 1860s, although this was for an area 50&nbsp;km north east of today's Tokoroa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/tokoroa|title=Tokoroa|publisher=New Zealand History|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations, growth and decline===\n\nTokoroa is one of the most recent towns in New Zealand history.  The township was established (circa) 1917 by the Matarawa Land Company as a potential farming area; although a few families had already settled in the area after 1910, and a school with 9 pupils was founded in 1915 (later to become Tokoroa East School).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokoroa.school.nz/tokoroa_information.htm|title=History of Tokoroa|publisher=Tokoroa Intermediate|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> The land was found to be too poor for raising cattle or sheep due to its predominant pumice soils.  However, agricultural science showed the land could actually be made to successfully support dairy cattle.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&d=OG19210214.2.19|title=Pumice Lands Proved|newspaper=Ohinemuri Gazette|volume=XXXII|issue=4228|date=14 February 1921|page=2}}</ref> The soil had serious deficiencies causing livestock to suffer from what became known as \"[[bush sickness]]\" (later found to be cobalt deficiency). In the 1930s, the deficiency was addressed, and subsequently, cattle farming then became profitable.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-places/page-17|title=Waikato Places - Tokoroa|encyclopedia=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=13 July 2012|first=Nancy|last=Swarbrick}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1925 and 1935 ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' was first introduced as a commercial tree crop, to the district - as the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies.  As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for [[Kinleith Mill]] workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited's integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8&nbsp;km south of the township.  In 1948, Tokoroa had a population of 1,100. By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa reached, for a time, a population of over 20,000 - the number necessary to be officially deemed a city.  In the 1980s years NZFP (and later, mill-owner [[Carter Holt Harvey]] Ltd) began to downscale and restructure operations at Kinleith. Tokoroa's population fell to approximately 18,000. Since the late 1980s ongoing downscaling at Kinleith - and closing of other local industries - has resulted in a marked drop in population. Census figures put the 2006 population at approximately 13,600.\n\n===Marae===\n\nTokoroa has two [[marae]] connected to local [[iwi]] and [[hap\u016b]]. Ng\u0101tira Marae and Te Tikanga a T\u0101whiao meeting house are associated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Ahuru]] and the [[Waikato Tainui]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Korok\u012b (Waikato Tainui)|Ng\u0101ti Korok\u012b]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa ki Paneh\u0101kua]]. \u014cng\u0101roto Marae and Whaita meeting house are affiliated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Whaita]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\n\nSurrounding the township are many [[Dairy Farming|dairy farms]] and [[forests|plantation forest]]s. There are many scenic reserves around the town \u2013 the artificial lake 'Moana-Nui' (formed by damming the Matarawa Stream) lies within a recreational park.\n\nTokoroa lies in the centre of a triangle made up of the tourism destinations of [[Rotorua]], [[Waitomo]] and [[Taupo]].  There are also about 45 recreational lakes within less than an hour's drive of Tokoroa.\n\n===Township===\n\nAs well as the central business district, the township is made up of many subdivisions, each built in different stages of the Kinleith complex's development. These subdivisions are:\n\n*Parkdale\n*Paraonui\n*Papanui\n*Matarawa\n*Aotea\n*Strathmore\n*Amisfield\n\nMany of the street names of the town were named by the first managing director of N.Z. Forest Products Ltd.(builders of the [[Kinleith Mill|Kinleith mill]]), '''Sir David Henry''' (1888\u20131963), after places near his hometown of [[Edinburgh]], in [[Scotland]]. David Henry Primary School is a key example of him and his namesaking.\n\n===Demographics===\nTokoroa is a town of over 13,600 people.\n\nTokoroa is a multicultural town, with about 35% of the population being M\u0101ori and another 20% from the Pacific Islands (mainly the [[Cook Islands]]). The remaining 45% of the population is made up mainly by NZ Europeans.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Tokoroa, Waikato\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 22.7\n|Feb high C = 22.9\n|Mar high C = 21\n|Apr high C = 18\n|May high C = 14.7\n|Jun high C = 12.3\n|Jul high C = 11.7\n|Aug high C = 12.6\n|Sep high C = 14.4\n|Oct high C = 16.4\n|Nov high C = 18.6\n|Dec high C = 20.7\n|Jan low C = 12\n|Feb low C = 12.3\n|Mar low C = 11\n|Apr low C = 8.4\n|May low C = 5.7\n|Jun low C = 3.9\n|Jul low C = 2.8\n|Aug low C = 3.9\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = 7.3\n|Nov low C = 8.9\n|Dec low C = 10.6\n|Jan precipitation mm = 114\n|Feb precipitation mm = 101\n|Mar precipitation mm = 117\n|Apr precipitation mm = 111\n|May precipitation mm = 134\n|Jun precipitation mm = 156\n|Jul precipitation mm = 161\n|Aug precipitation mm = 157\n|Sep precipitation mm = 149\n|Oct precipitation mm = 135\n|Nov precipitation mm = 132\n|Dec precipitation mm = 145\n|source = [https://en.climate-data.org/oceania/new-zealand/waikato/tokoroa-29884/ Tokoroa climate]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe economic lifeblood of Tokoroa is forestry, centred at the nearby [[Kinleith Mill]]; and dairy farming. In 1995, [[Fonterra]] built the southern hemisphere's largest cheese factory in Lichfield,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swktodc.govt.nz/district/district_info/cheese_factory.asp |title=Fonterra Cheese Factory |publisher=South Waikato District Council |accessdate=2010-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118144958/http://www.swktodc.govt.nz/district/district_info/cheese_factory.asp |archivedate=18 November 2009 }}</ref> some 5&nbsp;km north of the town. Recently, due to an increase in dairy prices, large amounts of previously forested land either have been or are in the process of being converted into farmland.\n\nThe main agricultural activities of the district are sheep and dairy farming. Forestry is still, however, the primary and most important industry to the district.  Timber is milled and processed at Kinleith.  Over recent years, the sharp decline in timber processing has seen the majority of raw logs shipped offshore.  Most of the Kinleith workers live in Tokoroa, with a small number commuting from other South Waikato towns.  Tokoroa is a marketing and servicing centre for agriculture, inline with other associated industries.  These other industries include (but are not limited to): the manufacture of cheese (and related dairy products [via [[Fonterra]]]), specialised wooden boxing, timber joinery, saw milling, general engineering, and the quarrying of building (masonry) stone.\n\nAlthough Tokoroa's economy primarily tends to revolve around timber and farming, many large retail companies have continued investing in the town \u2013 Foodstuffs recently constructed and opened a [[New World (supermarket)]] on Tokoroa's main street (Bridge Street). Also, [[Progressive Enterprises]] (a major competitor to Foodstuffs Group) also recently built New Zealand's first [[Countdown (supermarket)]] featuring bilingual (i.e. including Te Reo-M\u0101ori) signage.\n\n==Education==\n{{Further|List of schools in Waikato, New Zealand#South Waikato District}}\nTertiary education is important to Tokoroa, through [[Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa]] and a

2011.<ref>http://tokoroaeastschool-jay.weebly.com/home.html</ref>\n\n==Town facilities and attractions==\n\nTokoroa has a number of Tourist and visiting attractions, as well as many facilities for local use.\n[[Image:Tokoroa Talking Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Tokoroa Greenman 'OZ']]\n\n===Talking Poles===\nSince 1997, Tokoroa has been \"sprouting\" Talking Poles, consisting mainly of carvings representing ethnic culture, sports recreation, industry in the town and stories about the town. This one, photographed shortly after its unveiling in 2004, is a chainsaw carving of a [[deodar cedar]] which died from natural causes. It is representative of the Greenman in Welsh mythology and is located on State Highway 1, immediately adjacent to the town's information centre.\n\nBy October 2008, 42 Talking Poles were displayed around the town. Tokoroa Talking Poles symposium is convened every two years at the Tokoroa campus of [[Te Wananga o Aotearoa]]. The Greenman was carved in 2004 by Mr Andy Hankcock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chainsaw man|url=http://www.newzealand.com/travel/destinations/regions/waikato/waikato-towns.cfm/nodeid/253.html}}</ref>\n\n===Lake Moana-Nui===\nTokoroa's man-made Lake Moana-Nui was created in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early [[extreme sport]] unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.\n\nIn the period following the initial construction of the dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas. The lake weed eventually became a drowning hazard that claimed the lives of swimmers over the preceding decade. In this sense, the project was a failure, and Lake Moana-Nui was considered unsafe. In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic handrailing was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control the weed and to flush out the stale, stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project so that it can be used in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lake Moana Nui|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC16FHT}}</ref> To date (as at 25 April 2015), Lake Moana-Nui has been fully drained, refilled, and restored - and has been cleared by the local council for public recreation (as it was in its heyday during the 1970s and 80's).\n\nThere are picnic tables built around the lakes arc and there are four playgrounds. At the southern end of Lake Moana-Nui are gardens which were planted by a collective of Tokoroa school children.\n\n===Town Library===\nThe current location of Tokoroa's library holds many historic memories for the locals - as it was previously the town's cinema. It currently holds a library with a full computer suite, over 2,000 books, a reference book section, and children's leisure area. It is located in the Tokoroa town centre.\n\n===Tokoroa Hospital===\nTokoroa Hospital provides limited medical services for a population of approximately 22,800 people in the South Waikato District. Currently, the hospital provides 21 beds made up of a 17-bed inpatient ward and a 4-bed maternity ward. There is also a dedicated emergency department with capacity for five patients, and a fully functional theatre suite presently used for minor day surgery. Other facilities include x-ray and laboratory services, a cafe, a helipad for patient transfer, and various [[allied health]] services. District and public health nursing, diabetes nursing specialists, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and health social work services are also based the hospital site, which also hosts clinics with various visiting specialists. The hospital site accommodates the Tokoroa Council of Social Services (an umbrella organisation of community services),<ref>{{cite web| title=Waikato District Health Board |url=http://www.waikatodhb.govt.nz/file/fileid/34370}}</ref> and since 2014 has also hosted the town's GP practices, a pharmacy and several other health services in a modern health campus based at the hospital's former Ward 3.<ref>{{cite web| title=South Waikato Health Centre |url=http://www.waikatodhb.health.nz/about-us/rural-health/south-waikato-health-centre/}}</ref>\n\n==Culture & Sports==\nTokoroa hosts a number of sporting, cultural and music events every year including the Polynesian festival.\n\n===Polynesian Festival===\nTokoroa Polynesian Festival occurs every year during September. Tokoroa's local schools and preschools give Samoan, M\u0101ori and Cook Islands performances, where you hear the Cook Island drumming and dancing and the M\u0101ori performing arts being displayed on the huge stage at the new South Waikato Events Centre, located at The Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground. The 2009 event hosted NZ artists J.Williams and Erika.\n\n===Sports===\nTokoroa being within the Waikato Province falls under the Waikato ITM Cup provincial catchment and the Chiefs Super Rugby franchise. The South Waikato district's netball associations also fall under the catchment for inclusion in the ANZ Championship, Waikato/BOP Magic franchise.\n\nOver many decades, Tokoroa has been a natural base for strong, competitive woodchopping and sawing events. The axe long saw and chainsaw competitions, at the local A&P Shows, over many decades, have always been central to the local, timber and timber works culture of the town. As of 2018 the annual Tokoroa A&P show has been axed due to financial reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/94816199/ap-show-axed-from-rural-town-of-tokoroa|title=The A&P Show will be no longer in Tokoroa|first=Luke|last=Kirkeby|publisher=NZ Farmer|date=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground===\n\nThe sports ground is used every weekend and is in use throughout the weekdays. The Memorial Sports Ground includes:\n\n* Eight full netball courts\n* Eight full tennis courts\n* Three full rugby fields\n* Eight touch or rugby league fields\n* One Soccer field\n* One Rugby Union Club - Southern United Rugby Football Club (SURF)\n\n===Y.M.C.A Sports Centre===\nTokoroa's Y.M.C.A hosts a number of indoor and outdoor events, such as:\n* Indoor skating\n* Outdoor Archery\n* Indoor & Outdoor soccer (football)\n* Basketball\n* Netball\n* Volleyball\n* Indoor Hockey\n* Dance classes\n\n==Transportation==\n===Cycling===\nTokoroa has a number of cycleways which link the town centre with the outlying suburbs. These cycleways consist of a mixture of dedicated cycle lanes and mixed-use cycle/walk ways. There is an extensive cycleway from Browning Street, Tokoroa that leads to Kinleith which has extensive views of the town and the Kinleith mill.\n\n===Public Roads & General Access===\nNew Zealand's main arterial route, State Highway 1, runs through Tokoroa's eastern edge. Tokoroa is also accessible from the south-west via [[New Zealand State Highway 32|State Highway 32]] (via Maraetai Road).  Tokoroa is also a non-traffic light controlled zone.\n\nTokoroa is served by national bus (coachline) services such as [[Intercity (New Zealand)]] and [[Naked Bus]], operating on various routes along State Highway 1.\n\n===Railway===\n\nThe Kinleith Branch line runs through Tokoroa on its route between Waharoa on the East Coast Main Trunk line, and its terminus at the Kinleith Mill to the south of the town. Most freight trains on the line travel between the Kinleith and the Port of Tauranga. There have never been any passenger services on the line.  Also, there is no longer a station, or rail-freight yard in Tokoroa, where once they existed.\n\nPrevious to the construction of the Kinleith Mill, and the current Kinleith Branch line, a private bush tramway operated by the Taupo Totara Timber (TTT) Company, used to operate along the route of the present line along its path between Putaruru and the company's mill at Mokai, near Taupo.\n\nThe main cargo, from Kinleith, used to include: raw and processed pulp; paper products; plywood, timber, and raw logs.  With restructuring having taken its toll on processing at Kinleith, however, the predominant cargo is now raw and ring-barked logs; logs are destined for export to timber, pulp, and paper processing plants worldwide.\n\n==Radio Stations==\nThere are several local radio stations in Tokoroa:\n* [[Raukawa FM]] 90.9/95.7&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Cruise FM]], locally owned community radio station broadcasting to Tokoroa 94.1FM, Mangakino-Whakamaru 104.4FM and Putaruru 107.7FM. Ph 07 88 66 939] 94.1&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Vision FM]] 88.5&nbsp;MHz\n* [[FRESH FM]] 88.3&nbsp;MHz\nAs well as local repeaters of national radio stations - including the former site of [[Radio Forestland]], 1ZO (1413&nbsp;kHz, AM/MB):\n* Radio New Zealand National 729&nbsp;kHz/101.3&nbsp;MHz\n* Newstalk ZB 1413&nbsp;kHz\n* Radio Rhema 99.7&nbsp;MHz\n* The Hits 97.3&nbsp;MHz\n\n==Notable people==\n*[[Isaac Boss]] \u2014 honours: Hautapu RFC, Waikato RFC (NPC), [[Ireland national rugby union team|Ireland]] [[rugby union]] International\n*[[Pero Cameron]] \u2014 NZ Basketball rep' (Honours: Auckland and Waikato NBL Teams; Coach of Wellington Saints NBL Championship Team, 2010; NZ [[Tall Blacks]])\n*[[Adrian Cashmore]] \u2013 honours: Auckland RFC (NPC), Auckland Blues, NZ [[All Blacks]] [2 Tests]\n*[[Quade Cooper]] \u2013 Australian rugby union player (honours: Queensland Reds, Wallabies)\n*[[John Davies (middle-distance runner)|John Davies]] \u2013 teacher, [[public relations]] representative, Bronze medal-winning [[Sportsperson|athlete]] ([[1964 Summer Olympics]]), and athletics coach\n*[[Stella Duffy]] \u2013 Novelist\n*[[Nick Franklin]] \u2013 FMX Rider\n*[[Ben Hana]] \u2013 [[Wellington]] identity: better known as \"Blanket Man\" (deceased)\n*[[Tommy Hayes (rugby union, born 1973)|Tommy Hayes]] \u2013 [[Cook Islands]] rugby union representative\n*[[Isaac John]] \u2013 honours: [[New Zealand Warriors]], [[Wakefield_Trinity|Wakefield Trinity (UK)]], [[Penrith Panthers]], [[Cook_Islands_national_rugby_league_team|Cook Islands Rugby League]], [[New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team|New Zealand Kiwis]]\n*[[Richard Kahui]] \u2013 honours: Waikato RFC (NPC), Highlanders, Waikato/BOP Chiefs, NZ [[All Blacks]] [17 Tests]\n*[[Bob Kerr (author and artist)|Bob Kerr]] - author, artist and illustrator\n*[[Paul Koteka]] (Tohoa Tauroa Paul (\"Bam Bam\") Koteka) - Honours: Tokoroa HSOB RFC, Pirates RFC, NZ Juniors, Waikato RFC (NPC), NZ M\u0101ori, NZ [[All Blacks]] [2 Tests], Western Australia RFC (93 caps; later Captain of WA State Team) \n*[[Nicky Little]] \u2013 International honours: Fiji Rugby Union representative (nephew of [[Walter Little (rugby player)|Walter Little]])\n*[[Walter Little (rugby player)|Walter Little]] - honours: North Harbour RFC, Waikato/BOP Chiefs, Auckland Blues, NZ [[All Blacks]] [50 Tests]\n*[[Kendrick Lynn]] \u2013 rugby union player\n*[[Sean Maitland]] \u2013 honours: NZ U-20 Rugby Union Team (World Cup Champions), Canterbury Crusaders, [[Glasgow Warriors]], Scotland\n*[[Joseph Manu]] - honours: [[Junior_Kiwis|Junior Kiwis (2015)]] and [[National_Rugby_League|NRL]] [[Sydney Roosters]] (2016-), [[2018_NRL_Grand_Final|NRL Grand Final Winner 2018]]\n*[[Keven Mealamu]] \u2014 honours: Auckland RFC, Auckland Blues, Waikato/BOP Chiefs, NZ [[All Blacks]] [123 Tests]\n*[[Jenny Morris (musician)|Jenny Morris]] \u2013  New Zealand/Australian singer/songwriter, [[The Crocodiles]]; [[Models (band)|Models]] and [[INXS]]\n*[[Henry Paul]] \u2013 [[New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team|New Zealand (Kiwis) rugby league representative]]\n*[[Robbie Paul]] \u2013 [[New_Zealand_national_rugby_league_team|New Zealand (Kiwis) rugby league representative]]\n*[[The Politicians]] \u2013 rock/[[New wave music|new wave]]/reggae band formed in 1981 by Tim Armstrong.\n*Sir [[Paul Reeves]] \u2013 [[Anglican]] priest, Archbishop / diplomat / former [[Governor-General of New Zealand]]\n*[[Bruce Simpson (blogger)|Bruce Simpson]] \u2013 blogger and jet-engine experimenter\n*[[Brian Tamaki]] \u2013 founder of [[Destiny Church, New Zealand|Destiny Church]]\n*[[Zane Tetevano]] \u2013 honours: [[Newcastle_Knights|Newcastle Knights RL (2011)]], [[Cook_Islands_national_rugby_league_team|Cook Islands Rugby league Representative]], [[Sydney Roosters]], [[2018_NRL_Grand_Final|NRL Grand Final Winner 2018]]\n*[[Maria Tutaia]] \u2013 New Zealand [[netball]] representative (honours: Waikato/BOP Magic, Northern Mystics, Silver Ferns)\n*[[Monique Williams (athlete)|Monique Williams]] \u2013 New Zealand sprinter (honours: selection at NZ representative levels)\n*[[Royce Willis]] \u2013 honours: BOP RFC, Waikato RFC, Auckland Blues, Waikato/BOP Chiefs, NZ [[All Blacks]] [12 Tests]\n\n==Notes and references==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book | first=A.

This battle took place around 1600 as the Ng\u0101ti Raukawa moved into the southern Waikato. The name ''Tokoroa'' first appeared on the early maps of the 1860s, although this was for an area 50&nbsp;km north east of today's Tokoroa.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://nzhistory.govt.nz/keyword/tokoroa|title=Tokoroa|publisher=New Zealand History|accessdate=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Foundations, growth and decline===\n\nTokoroa is one of the most recent towns in New Zealand history.  The township was established (circa) 1917 by the Matarawa Land Company as a potential farming area; although a few families had already settled in the area after 1910, and a school with 9 pupils was founded in 1915 (later to become Tokoroa East School).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tokoroa.school.nz/tokoroa_information.htm|title=History of Tokoroa|publisher=Tokoroa Intermediate|accessdate=25 February 2014}}</ref> The land was found to be too poor for raising cattle or sheep due to its predominant pumice soils.

In the 1930s, the deficiency was addressed, and subsequently, cattle farming then became profitable.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/waikato-places/page-17|title=Waikato Places - Tokoroa|encyclopedia=Te Ara - The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|date=13 July 2012|first=Nancy|last=Swarbrick}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1925 and 1935 ''[[Pinus radiata]]'' was first introduced as a commercial tree crop, to the district - as the trees were found not to be adversely affected by the local soil deficiencies.  As the initial crops matured, Tokoroa was then developed as a residential satellite for [[Kinleith Mill]] workers (New Zealand Forest Products Limited's integrated timber, pulp and paper mill), approximately 8&nbsp;km south of the township.  In 1948, Tokoroa had a population of 1,100. By the early 1970s, however, Tokoroa reached, for a time, a population of over 20,000 - the number necessary to be officially deemed a city.  In the 1980s years NZFP (and later, mill-owner [[Carter Holt Harvey]] Ltd) began to downscale and restructure operations at Kinleith. Tokoroa's population fell to approximately 18,000. Since the late 1980s ongoing downscaling at Kinleith - and closing of other local industries - has resulted in a marked drop in population. Census figures put the 2006 population at approximately 13,600.\n\n===Marae===\n\nTokoroa has two [[marae]] connected to local [[iwi]] and [[hap\u016b]]. Ng\u0101tira Marae and Te Tikanga a T\u0101whiao meeting house are associated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Ahuru]] and the [[Waikato Tainui]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Korok\u012b (Waikato Tainui)|Ng\u0101ti Korok\u012b]] and [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa ki Paneh\u0101kua]]. \u014cng\u0101roto Marae and Whaita meeting house are affiliated with the [[Ng\u0101ti Raukawa]] hap\u016b of [[Ng\u0101ti Whaita]].<ref name=\"tkmentry\">{{cite web|title=Te K\u0101hui M\u0101ngai directory|url= http://www.tkm.govt.nz/ |website=tkm.govt.nz|publisher=[[Te Puni K\u014dkiri]]}}</ref><ref name=\"maorimaps\">{{cite web |title=M\u0101ori Maps |url=https://maorimaps.com/map |website=maorimaps.com |publisher=Te Potiki National Trust}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Location===\n\nSurrounding the township are many [[Dairy Farming|dairy farms]] and [[forests|plantation forest]]s. There are many scenic reserves around the town \u2013 the artificial lake 'Moana-Nui' (formed by damming the Matarawa Stream) lies within a recreational park.\n\nTokoroa lies in the centre of a triangle made up of the tourism destinations of [[Rotorua]], [[Waitomo]] and [[Taupo]].  There are also about 45 recreational lakes within less than an hour's drive of Tokoroa.\n\n===Township===\n\nAs well as the central business district, the township is made up of many subdivisions, each built in different stages of the Kinleith complex's development. These subdivisions are:\n\n*Parkdale\n*Paraonui\n*Papanui\n*Matarawa\n*Aotea\n*Strathmore\n*Amisfield\n\nMany of the street names of the town were named by the first managing director of N.Z. Forest Products Ltd.(builders of the [[Kinleith Mill|Kinleith mill]]), '''Sir David Henry''' (1888\u20131963), after places near his hometown of [[Edinburgh]], in [[Scotland]]. David Henry Primary School is a key example of him and his namesaking.\n\n===Demographics===\nTokoroa is a town of over 13,600 people.\n\nTokoroa is a multicultural town, with about 35% of the population being M\u0101ori and another 20% from the Pacific Islands (mainly the [[Cook Islands]]). The remaining 45% of the population is made up mainly by NZ Europeans.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Weather box|width=auto\n|location = Tokoroa, Waikato\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan high C = 22.7\n|Feb high C = 22.9\n|Mar high C = 21\n|Apr high C = 18\n|May high C = 14.7\n|Jun high C = 12.3\n|Jul high C = 11.7\n|Aug high C = 12.6\n|Sep high C = 14.4\n|Oct high C = 16.4\n|Nov high C = 18.6\n|Dec high C = 20.7\n|Jan low C = 12\n|Feb low C = 12.3\n|Mar low C = 11\n|Apr low C = 8.4\n|May low C = 5.7\n|Jun low C = 3.9\n|Jul low C = 2.8\n|Aug low C = 3.9\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = 7.3\n|Nov low C = 8.9\n|Dec low C = 10.6\n|Jan precipitation mm = 114\n|Feb precipitation mm = 101\n|Mar precipitation mm = 117\n|Apr precipitation mm = 111\n|May precipitation mm = 134\n|Jun precipitation mm = 156\n|Jul precipitation mm = 161\n|Aug precipitation mm = 157\n|Sep precipitation mm = 149\n|Oct precipitation mm = 135\n|Nov precipitation mm = 132\n|Dec precipitation mm = 145\n|source = [https://en.climate-data.org/oceania/new-zealand/waikato/tokoroa-29884/ Tokoroa climate]\n}}\n\n==Economy==\n\nThe economic lifeblood of Tokoroa is forestry, centred at the nearby [[Kinleith Mill]]; and dairy farming. In 1995, [[Fonterra]] built the southern hemisphere's largest cheese factory in Lichfield,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.swktodc.govt.nz/district/district_info/cheese_factory.asp |title=Fonterra Cheese Factory |publisher=South Waikato District Council |accessdate=2010-01-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091118144958/http://www.swktodc.govt.nz/district/district_info/cheese_factory.asp |archivedate=18 November 2009 }}</ref> some 5&nbsp;km north of the town. Recently, due to an increase in dairy prices, large amounts of previously forested land either have been or are in the process of being converted into farmland.\n\nThe main agricultural activities of the district are sheep and dairy farming. Forestry is still, however, the primary and most important industry to the district.  Timber is milled and processed at Kinleith.  Over recent years, the sharp decline in timber processing has seen the majority of raw logs shipped offshore.  Most of the Kinleith workers live in Tokoroa, with a small number commuting from other South Waikato towns.  Tokoroa is a marketing and servicing centre for agriculture, inline with other associated industries.  These other industries include (but are not limited to): the manufacture of cheese (and related dairy products [via [[Fonterra]]]), specialised wooden boxing, timber joinery, saw milling, general engineering, and the quarrying of building (masonry) stone.\n\nAlthough Tokoroa's economy primarily tends to revolve around timber and farming, many large retail companies have continued investing in the town \u2013 Foodstuffs recently constructed and opened a [[New World (supermarket)]] on Tokoroa's main street (Bridge Street). Also, [[Progressive Enterprises]] (a major competitor to Foodstuffs Group) also recently built New Zealand's first [[Countdown (supermarket)]] featuring bilingual (i.e. including Te Reo-M\u0101ori) signage.\n\n==Education==\n{{Further|List of schools in Waikato, New Zealand#South Waikato District}}\nTertiary education is important to Tokoroa, through [[Te W\u0101nanga o Aotearoa]] and a

Tokoroa East School closed in 2011.<ref>http://tokoroaeastschool-jay.weebly.com/home.html</ref>\n\n==Town facilities and attractions==\n\nTokoroa has a number of Tourist and visiting attractions, as well as many facilities for local use.\n[[Image:Tokoroa Talking Pole.jpg|thumb|left|Tokoroa Greenman 'OZ']]\n\n===Talking Poles===\nSince 1997, Tokoroa has been \"sprouting\" Talking Poles, consisting mainly of carvings representing ethnic culture, sports recreation, industry in the town and stories about the town. This one, photographed shortly after its unveiling in 2004, is a chainsaw carving of a [[deodar cedar]] which died from natural causes. It is representative of the Greenman in Welsh mythology and is located on State Highway 1, immediately adjacent to the town's information centre.\n\nBy October 2008, 42 Talking Poles were displayed around the town. Tokoroa Talking Poles symposium is convened every two years at the Tokoroa campus of [[Te Wananga o Aotearoa]]. The Greenman was carved in 2004 by Mr Andy Hankcock.<ref>{{cite web|title=Chainsaw man|url=http://www.newzealand.com/travel/destinations/regions/waikato/waikato-towns.cfm/nodeid/253.html}}</ref>\n\n===Lake Moana-Nui===\nTokoroa's man-made Lake Moana-Nui was created in the late 1970s for the community, involving excavation by large earthmoving equipment and a concrete dam wall with a drain valve control. A wooden bridge located on the south-west end of the dam wall that supported and controlled the drain valve was a favourite 'bomb' spot, and barefoot skiing down the spillway was early [[extreme sport]] unique to Tokoroa. During the 1970s, 'The Lake' was used extensively by youths and was referred to in local parlance as 'Tokoroa Beach'. On many summer afternoons, it was a common sight to see youth lying on the footpath across the road from the lake drying out after a swim.\n\nIn the period following the initial construction of the dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas. The lake weed eventually became a drowning hazard that claimed the lives of swimmers over the preceding decade. In this sense, the project was a failure, and Lake Moana-Nui was considered unsafe. In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic handrailing was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control the weed and to flush out the stale, stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project so that it can be used in the future.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lake Moana Nui|url=http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=GC16FHT}}</ref> To date (as at 25 April 2015), Lake Moana-Nui has been fully drained, refilled, and restored - and has been cleared by the local council for public recreation (as it was in its heyday during the 1970s and 80's).\n\nThere are picnic tables built around the lakes arc and there are four playgrounds. At the southern end of Lake Moana-Nui are gardens which were planted by a collective of Tokoroa school children.\n\n===Town Library===\nThe current location of Tokoroa's library holds many historic memories for the locals - as it was previously the town's cinema. It currently holds a library with a full computer suite, over 2,000 books, a reference book section, and children's leisure area. It is located in the Tokoroa town centre.\n\n===Tokoroa Hospital===\nTokoroa Hospital provides limited medical services for a population of approximately 22,800 people in the South Waikato District. Currently, the hospital provides 21 beds made up of a 17-bed inpatient ward and a 4-bed maternity ward. There is also a dedicated emergency department with capacity for five patients, and a fully functional theatre suite presently used for minor day surgery. Other facilities include x-ray and laboratory services, a cafe, a helipad for patient transfer, and various [[allied health]] services. District and public health nursing, diabetes nursing specialists, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and health social work services are also based the hospital site, which also hosts clinics with various visiting specialists. The hospital site accommodates the Tokoroa Council of Social Services (an umbrella organisation of community services),<ref>{{cite web| title=Waikato District Health Board |url=http://www.waikatodhb.govt.nz/file/fileid/34370}}</ref> and since 2014 has also hosted the town's GP practices, a pharmacy and several other health services in a modern health campus based at the hospital's former Ward 3.<ref>{{cite web| title=South Waikato Health Centre |url=http://www.waikatodhb.health.nz/about-us/rural-health/south-waikato-health-centre/}}</ref>\n\n==Culture & Sports==\nTokoroa hosts a number of sporting, cultural and music events every year including the Polynesian festival.\n\n===Polynesian Festival===\nTokoroa Polynesian Festival occurs every year during September. Tokoroa's local schools and preschools give Samoan, M\u0101ori and Cook Islands performances, where you hear the Cook Island drumming and dancing and the M\u0101ori performing arts being displayed on the huge stage at the new South Waikato Events Centre, located at The Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground. The 2009 event hosted NZ artists J.Williams and Erika.\n\n===Sports===\nTokoroa being within the Waikato Province falls under the Waikato ITM Cup provincial catchment and the Chiefs Super Rugby franchise. The South Waikato district's netball associations also fall under the catchment for inclusion in the ANZ Championship, Waikato/BOP Magic franchise.\n\nOver many decades, Tokoroa has been a natural base for strong, competitive woodchopping and sawing events. The axe long saw and chainsaw competitions, at the local A&P Shows, over many decades, have always been central to the local, timber and timber works culture of the town. As of 2018 the annual Tokoroa A&P show has been axed due to financial reasons.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/94816199/ap-show-axed-from-rural-town-of-tokoroa|title=The A&P Show will be no longer in Tokoroa|first=Luke|last=Kirkeby|publisher=NZ Farmer|date=19 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tokoroa Memorial Sports Ground===\n\nThe sports ground is used every weekend and is in use throughout the weekdays. The Memorial Sports Ground includes:\n\n* Eight full netball courts\n* Eight full tennis courts\n* Three full rugby fields\n* Eight touch or rugby league fields\n* One Soccer field\n* One Rugby Union Club - Southern United Rugby Football Club (SURF)\n\n===Y.M.C.A Sports Centre===\nTokoroa's Y.M.C.A hosts a number of indoor and outdoor events, such as:\n* Indoor skating\n* Outdoor Archery\n* Indoor & Outdoor soccer (football)\n* Basketball\n* Netball\n* Volleyball\n* Indoor Hockey\n* Dance classes\n\n==Transportation==\n===Cycling===\nTokoroa has a number of cycleways which link the town centre with the outlying suburbs. These cycleways consist of a mixture of dedicated cycle lanes and mixed-use cycle/walk ways. There is an extensive cycleway from Browning Street, Tokoroa that leads to Kinleith which has extensive views of the town and the Kinleith mill.\n\n===Public Roads & General Access===\nNew Zealand's main arterial route, State Highway 1, runs through Tokoroa's eastern edge. Tokoroa is also accessible from the south-west via [[New Zealand State Highway 32|State Highway 32]] (via Maraetai Road).  Tokoroa is also a non-traffic light controlled zone.\n\nTokoroa is served by national bus (coachline) services such as [[Intercity (New Zealand)]] and [[Naked Bus]], operating on various routes along State Highway 1.\n\n===Railway===\n\nThe Kinleith Branch line runs through Tokoroa on its route between Waharoa on the East Coast Main Trunk line, and its terminus at the Kinleith Mill to the south of the town. Most freight trains on the line travel between the Kinleith and the Port of Tauranga. There have never been any passenger services on the line.  Also, there is no longer a station, or rail-freight yard in Tokoroa, where once they existed.\n\nPrevious to the construction of the Kinleith Mill, and the current Kinleith Branch line, a private bush tramway operated by the Taupo Totara Timber (TTT) Company, used to operate along the route of the present line along its path between Putaruru and the company's mill at Mokai, near Taupo.\n\nThe main cargo, from Kinleith, used to include: raw and processed pulp; paper products; plywood, timber, and raw logs.  With restructuring having taken its toll on processing at Kinleith, however, the predominant cargo is now raw and ring-barked logs; logs are destined for export to timber, pulp, and paper processing plants worldwide.\n\n==Radio Stations==\nThere are several local radio stations in Tokoroa:\n* [[Raukawa FM]] 90.9/95.7&nbsp;MHz\n* [[Cruise FM]], locally owned community radio station broadcasting to Tokoroa 94.1FM, Mangakino-Whakamaru 104.4FM and Putaruru 107.7FM.
