It is used for [[medical imaging]] and industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence [[interferometry]], typically employing [[near-infrared]] light. The use of relatively long [[wavelength]] light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium.

In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses ([[femtosecond laser]]s). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.\n\nLight in an OCT system is broken into two arms\u2014a sample arm (containing the item of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of reflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm gives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have traveled the \"same\" optical distance (\"same\" meaning a difference of less than a coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a reflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT). Areas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater interference than areas that don't. Any light that is outside the short coherence length will not interfere.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Optical Coherence Tomography: An Emerging Technology for Biomedical Imaging and Optical Biopsy |year=2000|last1= Fujimoto |first1= JG| last2= Pitris |first2= C.| last3= Boppart |first3= SA| last4= Brezinski |first4= ME|journal= Neoplasia |volume=2|issue=1\u20132|pages=9\u201325|pmc= 1531864 | doi=10.1038/sj.neo.7900071 | pmid=10933065}}</ref> This reflectivity profile, called an [[A-scan]], contains information about the spatial dimensions and location of structures within the item of interest.

An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.\n\nWithin the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to [[ultrasound imaging]]. Other medical imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mastereyeassociates.com/optical-coherence-tomography-scan |title=Optical Coherence Tomography provides better resolution than an MRI and Helps Diagnose Retina & Corneal Disease and Glaucoma, Part II |last=Unknown |first=Unknown |publisher=mastereyeassociates |date=June 13, 2017 |website=mastereyeassociates.com |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2&nbsp;mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained \u2018non-contact\u2019 or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also important to note that the laser output from the instruments is low \u2013 eye-safe near-infrared light is used \u2013 and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.\n\n==Theory==\nThe principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The optical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically [[Michelson interferometer|Michelson]] type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is split into and recombined from reference and sample arm, respectively.\n\n{|\n[[File:OCT B-Scan Setup.GIF|thumb|375px|Fig. 2 Typical optical setup of single point OCT.

A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.\n\nThe interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in terms of the source intensity, <math>I_S</math>, as\n\n:<math> I = k_1 I_S + k_2 I_S + 2 \\sqrt { \\left ( k_1 I_S \\right ) \\cdot \\left ( k_2 I_S \\right )} \\cdot Re \\left [\\gamma \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right] \\qquad (1) </math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1 + k_2 < 1</math> represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and <math> \\gamma ( \\tau ) </math> is called the complex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier dependent on reference arm scan or time delay <math> \\tau </math>, and whose recovery is of interest in OCT. Due to the coherence gating effect of OCT the complex degree of coherence is represented as a Gaussian function expressed as<ref name=\"Fercher\"/>\n\n:<math> \\gamma \\left ( \\tau \\right ) = \\exp \\left [- \\left ( \\frac{\\pi\\Delta\\nu\\tau}{2 \\sqrt{\\ln 2} } \\right )^2 \\right] \\cdot \\exp \\left ( -j2\\pi\\nu_0\\tau \\right ) \\qquad \\quad (2) </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\Delta\\nu </math> represents the spectral width of the source in the optical frequency domain, and <math> \\nu_0 </math> is the centre optical frequency of the source. In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the [[Doppler effect]] resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation. In OCT, the Doppler-shifted optical carrier has a frequency expressed as\n\n:<math> f_{Dopp} = \\frac { 2 \\cdot \\nu_0 \\cdot v_s } { c } \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\qquad \\quad (3) </math>\n\nwhere <math> \\nu_0 </math> is the central optical frequency of the source, <math> v_s </math> is the scanning velocity of the pathlength variation, and <math> c </math> is the speed of light.\n\n[[File:Principle-TD-FD OCT.svg|thumb|450px|interference signals in TD vs. FD-OCT]]\nThe axial and lateral resolutions of OCT are decoupled from one another; the former being an equivalent to the coherence length of the light source and the latter being a function of the optics.

Two common approaches are swept-source and spectral-domain OCT. A swept source OCT encodes the optical frequency in time with a spectrally scanning source. A spectral domain OCT uses a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array, to separate the different wavelengths. Due to the [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] relation ([[Wiener-Khintchine theorem]] between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/2944.796348|title=Optical coherence tomography (OCT): a review|year=1999|last1=Schmitt|first1=J.M.|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=5|pages=1205\u20131215|issue=4|bibcode=1999IJSTQ...5.1205S|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f49830744c352507c8728d63384acc22dd3db0b1}}</ref><ref name=\"Fercher2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-4018(95)00119-S|title=Measurement of intraocular distances by backscattering spectral interferometry|year=1995|last1=Fercher|first1=A|last2=Hitzenberger|first2=C.K.|last3=Kamp|first3=G.|last4=El-Zaiat|first4=S.Y.|journal=Optics Communications|volume=117|issue=1\u20132|pages=43\u201348|bibcode= 1995OptCo.117...43F }}</ref> This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the signal to noise ratio proportional to the number of detection elements.

Thereby the information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR ([[signal to noise ratio]]) advantage of ~10 [[decibel|dB]] at much higher speeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300&nbsp;nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.\n\n[[Optical heterodyne detection|Synthetic array heterodyne detection]] offers another approach to this problem without the need for high dispersion.\n\n====Time encoded====\nTime encoded frequency domain OCT (TEFD-OCT, or swept source OCT) tries to combine some of the advantages of standard TD and SEFD-OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.\nHere the advantage lies in the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve very small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies (20\u2013200&nbsp;kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially at high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high frequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or the sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).\n\n===Full-field OCT===\n[[File:Full-field OCT.png|thumb|350px|Schematic view of a full-field OCT]]\n\nAn imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara's team in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal|language=en |title= Full-field optical coherence microscopy  |year=1998|last1=Beaurepaire|first1= E. |last2= Boccara |first2= A.C. |journal= Optics Letters |volume=23|issue = 4 |pages=244\u2013246 |doi=10.1364/ol.23.000244|pmid= 18084473 |bibcode=1998OptL...23..244B}}</ref> with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning.

En face images can also be obtained by scanning the illumination line laterally.

By using a supercontinuum laser as a light source, a quasi-isotropic spatial resolution of ~ 1&nbsp;\u00b5m is achieved at a central wavelength of ~ 800&nbsp;nm. On the other hand, line illumination and detection, combined with the use of a high NA microscope objective, produce a confocal gate that prevents most scattered light that does not contribute to the signal from being detected by the camera. This confocal gate, which is absent in the full-field OCT technique, gives LC-OCT an advantage in terms of detection sensitivity and penetration in highly scattering media such as skin tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |title=High-resolution line-scanning optical coherence microscopy|year=2007|journal=Opt.

It is used for [[medical imaging]] and industrial [[nondestructive testing]] (NDT). Optical coherence tomography is based on low-coherence [[interferometry]], typically employing [[near-infrared]] light. The use of relatively long [[wavelength]] light allows it to penetrate into the scattering medium. [[Confocal microscopy]], another optical technique, typically penetrates less deeply into the sample but with higher resolution.\n\nDepending on the properties of the light source ([[superluminescent diode]]s, [[ultrashort pulse laser|ultrashort pulsed lasers]], and [[supercontinuum]] lasers have been employed), optical coherence tomography has achieved sub-[[Micrometre|micrometer]] resolution (with very wide-spectrum sources emitting over a ~100&nbsp;nm wavelength range).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}{{verification needed|reason=confocal microscopy typically has a resolution of about 1 um and it is stated earlier that confocal microscopy has better resolution than OCT, so need to substantiate this claim|date=June 2015}}\n\nOptical coherence tomography is one of a class of [[optical tomography|optical tomographic]] techniques.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Commercially available optical coherence tomography systems are employed in diverse applications, including art conservation and diagnostic medicine, notably in [[ophthalmology]] and [[optometry]] where it can be used to obtain detailed images from within the retina.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} Recently, it has also begun to be used in interventional [[cardiology]] to help diagnose coronary artery disease,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Bezerra|first=Hiram G.|author2=Costa, Marco A. |author3=Guagliumi, Giulio |author4=Rollins, Andrew M. |author5= Simon, Daniel I. |title=Intracoronary Optical Coherence Tomography: A Comprehensive Review|journal=JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions|date=November 2009|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1035\u20131046|doi=10.1016/j.jcin.2009.06.019|pmid=19926041|pmc=4113036}}</ref> and in [[dermatology]] to improve diagnosis.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Chua|first1=Shunjie|title=High-Definition Optical Coherence Tomography for the Study of Evolution of a Disease|journal=Dermatology Bulletin|date=2015|volume=26|issue=1|pages=2\u20133|url=https://www.nsc.com.sg/Professional-Education/Documents/NSC-Bulletin-PDF/NSC%20Derm%20Bulletin%20Vol%2026%20Num_1%20Jan%202015.pdf|accessdate=28 May 2015}}</ref> A relatively recent implementation of optical coherence tomography, [[frequency-domain]] optical coherence tomography, provides advantages in the [[signal-to-noise ratio]] provided, thus permitting faster signal acquisition.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Introduction==\n[[File:HautFingerspitzeOCT.gif|thumb|300px|Optical coherence tomogram of a fingertip.

In OCT, this interference is shortened to a distance of micrometers, owing to the use of broad-bandwidth light sources (i.e., sources that emit light over a broad range of frequencies). Light with broad bandwidths can be generated by using superluminescent diodes or lasers with extremely short pulses ([[femtosecond laser]]s). White light is an example of a broadband source with lower power.\n\nLight in an OCT system is broken into two arms\u2014a sample arm (containing the item of interest) and a reference arm (usually a mirror). The combination of reflected light from the sample arm and reference light from the reference arm gives rise to an interference pattern, but only if light from both arms have traveled the \"same\" optical distance (\"same\" meaning a difference of less than a coherence length). By scanning the mirror in the reference arm, a reflectivity profile of the sample can be obtained (this is time domain OCT). Areas of the sample that reflect back a lot of light will create greater interference than areas that don't. Any light that is outside the short coherence length will not interfere.<ref>{{cite journal |title= Optical Coherence Tomography: An Emerging Technology for Biomedical Imaging and Optical Biopsy |year=2000|last1= Fujimoto |first1= JG| last2= Pitris |first2= C.| last3= Boppart |first3= SA| last4= Brezinski |first4= ME|journal= Neoplasia |volume=2|issue=1\u20132|pages=9\u201325|pmc= 1531864 | doi=10.1038/sj.neo.7900071 | pmid=10933065}}</ref> This reflectivity profile, called an [[A-scan]], contains information about the spatial dimensions and location of structures within the item of interest.

An optical beam is directed at the tissue, and a small portion of this light that reflects from sub-surface features is collected. Note that most light is not reflected but, rather, scatters off at large angles. In conventional imaging, this diffusely scattered light contributes background that obscures an image. However, in OCT, a technique called interferometry is used to record the optical path length of received photons allowing rejection of most photons that scatter multiple times before detection. Thus OCT can build up clear 3D images of thick samples by rejecting background signal while collecting light directly reflected from surfaces of interest.\n\nWithin the range of noninvasive three-dimensional imaging techniques that have been introduced to the medical research community, OCT as an echo technique is similar to [[ultrasound imaging]]. Other medical imaging techniques such as computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or positron emission tomography do not use the echo-location principle.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mastereyeassociates.com/optical-coherence-tomography-scan |title=Optical Coherence Tomography provides better resolution than an MRI and Helps Diagnose Retina & Corneal Disease and Glaucoma, Part II |last=Unknown |first=Unknown |publisher=mastereyeassociates |date=June 13, 2017 |website=mastereyeassociates.com |access-date=June 13, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe technique is limited to imaging 1 to 2&nbsp;mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering is too small to be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and images can be obtained \u2018non-contact\u2019 or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also important to note that the laser output from the instruments is low \u2013 eye-safe near-infrared light is used \u2013 and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.\n\n==Theory==\nThe principle of OCT is white light, or low coherence, interferometry. The optical setup typically consists of an interferometer (Fig. 1, typically [[Michelson interferometer|Michelson]] type) with a low coherence, broad bandwidth light source. Light is split into and recombined from reference and sample arm, respectively.\n\n{|\n[[File:OCT B-Scan Setup.GIF|thumb|375px|Fig. 2 Typical optical setup of single point OCT.

A property of low coherence interferometry is that interference, i.e. the series of dark and bright fringes, is only achieved when the path difference lies within the coherence length of the light source. This interference is called auto correlation in a symmetric interferometer (both arms have the same reflectivity), or cross-correlation in the common case. The envelope of this modulation changes as pathlength difference is varied, where the peak of the envelope corresponds to pathlength matching.\n\nThe interference of two partially coherent light beams can be expressed in terms of the source intensity, <math>I_S</math>, as\n\n:<math> I = k_1 I_S + k_2 I_S + 2 \\sqrt { \\left ( k_1 I_S \\right ) \\cdot \\left ( k_2 I_S \\right )} \\cdot Re \\left [\\gamma \\left ( \\tau \\right ) \\right] \\qquad (1) </math>\n\nwhere <math>k_1 + k_2 < 1</math> represents the interferometer beam splitting ratio, and <math> \\gamma ( \\tau ) </math> is called the complex degree of coherence, i.e. the interference envelope and carrier dependent on reference arm scan or time delay <math> \\tau </math>, and whose recovery is of interest in OCT.

In equation (2), the Gaussian envelope is amplitude modulated by an optical carrier. The peak of this envelope represents the location of the microstructure of the sample under test, with an amplitude dependent on the reflectivity of the surface. The optical carrier is due to the [[Doppler effect]] resulting from scanning one arm of the interferometer, and the frequency of this modulation is controlled by the speed of scanning. Therefore, translating one arm of the interferometer has two functions; depth scanning and a Doppler-shifted optical carrier are accomplished by pathlength variation.

Two common approaches are swept-source and spectral-domain OCT. A swept source OCT encodes the optical frequency in time with a spectrally scanning source. A spectral domain OCT uses a dispersive detector, like a grating and a linear detector array, to separate the different wavelengths. Due to the [[Fourier analysis|Fourier]] relation ([[Wiener-Khintchine theorem]] between the auto correlation and the spectral power density) the depth scan can be immediately calculated by a Fourier-transform from the acquired spectra, without movement of the reference arm.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1109/2944.796348|title=Optical coherence tomography (OCT): a review|year=1999|last1=Schmitt|first1=J.M.|journal=IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics|volume=5|pages=1205\u20131215|issue=4|bibcode=1999IJSTQ...5.1205S|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/f49830744c352507c8728d63384acc22dd3db0b1}}</ref><ref name=\"Fercher2\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0030-4018(95)00119-S|title=Measurement of intraocular distances by backscattering spectral interferometry|year=1995|last1=Fercher|first1=A|last2=Hitzenberger|first2=C.K.|last3=Kamp|first3=G.|last4=El-Zaiat|first4=S.Y.|journal=Optics Communications|volume=117|issue=1\u20132|pages=43\u201348|bibcode= 1995OptCo.117...43F }}</ref> This feature improves imaging speed dramatically, while the reduced losses during a single scan improve the signal to noise ratio proportional to the number of detection elements.

Thereby the information of the full depth scan can be acquired within a single exposure. However, the large signal to noise advantage of FD-OCT is reduced due to the lower dynamic range of stripe detectors with respect to single photosensitive diodes, resulting in an SNR ([[signal to noise ratio]]) advantage of ~10 [[decibel|dB]] at much higher speeds. This is not much of a problem when working at 1300&nbsp;nm, however, since dynamic range is not a serious problem at this wavelength range.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe drawbacks of this technology are found in a strong fall-off of the SNR, which is proportional to the distance from the zero delay and a sinc-type reduction of the depth dependent sensitivity because of limited detection linewidth. (One pixel detects a quasi-rectangular portion of an optical frequency range instead of a single frequency, the Fourier-transform leads to the sinc(z) behavior). Additionally the dispersive elements in the spectroscopic detector usually do not distribute the light equally spaced in frequency on the detector, but mostly have an inverse dependence. Therefore, the signal has to be resampled before processing, which can not take care of the difference in local (pixelwise) bandwidth, which results in further reduction of the signal quality. However, the fall-off is not a serious problem with the development of new generation CCD or photodiode array with a larger number of pixels.\n\n[[Optical heterodyne detection|Synthetic array heterodyne detection]] offers another approach to this problem without the need for high dispersion.\n\n====Time encoded====\nTime encoded frequency domain OCT (TEFD-OCT, or swept source OCT) tries to combine some of the advantages of standard TD and SEFD-OCT. Here the spectral components are not encoded by spatial separation, but they are encoded in time. The spectrum is either filtered or generated in single successive frequency steps and reconstructed before Fourier-transformation. By accommodation of a frequency scanning light source (i.e. frequency scanning laser) the optical setup (see Fig. 3) becomes simpler than SEFD, but the problem of scanning is essentially translated from the TD-OCT reference-arm into the TEFD-OCT light source.\nHere the advantage lies in the proven high SNR detection technology, while swept laser sources achieve very small instantaneous bandwidths (linewidths) at very high frequencies (20\u2013200&nbsp;kHz). Drawbacks are the nonlinearities in the wavelength (especially at high scanning frequencies), the broadening of the linewidth at high frequencies and a high sensitivity to movements of the scanning geometry or the sample (below the range of nanometers within successive frequency steps).\n\n===Full-field OCT===\n[[File:Full-field OCT.png|thumb|350px|Schematic view of a full-field OCT]]\n\nAn imaging approach to temporal OCT was developed by Claude Boccara's team in 1998,<ref>{{cite journal|language=en |title= Full-field optical coherence microscopy  |year=1998|last1=Beaurepaire|first1= E. |last2= Boccara |first2= A.C. |journal= Optics Letters |volume=23|issue = 4 |pages=244\u2013246 |doi=10.1364/ol.23.000244|pmid= 18084473 |bibcode=1998OptL...23..244B}}</ref> with an acquisition of the images without beam scanning.

This confocal gate, which is absent in the full-field OCT technique, gives LC-OCT an advantage in terms of detection sensitivity and penetration in highly scattering media such as skin tissues.<ref>{{cite journal |title=High-resolution line-scanning optical coherence microscopy|year=2007|journal=Opt.

Scanning of the sample can be accomplished by either scanning the light on the sample, or by moving the sample under test. A linear scan will yield a two-dimensional data set corresponding to a cross-sectional image (X-Z axes scan), whereas an area scan achieves a three-dimensional data set corresponding to a volumetric image (X-Y-Z axes scan).\n\n===Single point===\nSystems based on single point, confocal, or flying-spot time domain OCT, must scan the sample in two lateral dimensions and reconstruct a three-dimensional image using depth information obtained by coherence-gating through an axially scanning reference arm (Fig. 2).

Wall painting in the tomb of [[Horemheb]] ([[KV57]]).]]\nOsiris is the mythological father of the god [[Horus]], whose conception is described in the [[Osiris myth]] (a central myth in [[Ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian belief]]). The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus. As such, since Horus was born after Osiris' resurrection, Horus became thought of as a representation of new beginnings and the vanquisher of the usurper Set.\n\n''Ptah-Seker'' (who resulted from the identification of Creator god [[Ptah]] with [[Seker]]) thus gradually became identified with Osiris, the two becoming '''Ptah-Seker-Osiris'''. As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Murugan god of fertility & Forming===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC).

The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:\n* ''The First Day, The Procession of [[Wepwawet]]'': A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]].

Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

The myth describes Osiris as having been killed by his brother, Set, who wanted Osiris' throne. His wife, Isis finds the body of Osiris and hides it in the reeds where it is found and dismembered by Set. Isis retrieves and joins the fragmented pieces of Osiris, then briefly revives Osiris by use of magic. This spell gives her time to become pregnant by Osiris. Isis later gives birth to Horus.

As the sun was thought to spend the night in the underworld, and was subsequently \"reborn\" every morning, Ptah-Seker-Osiris was identified as king of the [[underworld]], god of the [[afterlife]], life, death, and regeneration.\n\n===Ram god===\n{{Hiero|Banebdjed <br> (''b3-nb-\u1e0fd'')|<hiero>E10-nb-Dd-niwt-Dd</hiero>|align=left|era=egypt}}\nOsiris' soul, or rather his ''[[Egyptian soul|Ba]]'', was occasionally worshipped in its own right, almost as if it were a distinct god, especially in the [[Nile Delta|Delta]] city of [[Mendes]]. This aspect of Osiris was referred to as ''[[Banebdjedet]]'', which is grammatically [[Grammatical gender|feminine]] (also spelt \"''Banebded''\" or \"''Banebdjed''\"), literally \"the ''ba'' of the lord of the ''[[djed]]'', which roughly means ''The soul of the lord of the pillar of continuity''. The ''djed'', a type of pillar, was usually understood as the [[Vertebral column|backbone]] of Osiris.\n\nThe Nile supplying water, and Osiris (strongly connected to the vegetable regeneration) who died only to be resurrected, represented continuity and stability. As ''Banebdjed'', Osiris was given [[epithet]]s such as ''Lord of the Sky'' and ''Life of the ([[solar deity|sun god]]) [[Ra]]''. ''Ba'' does not mean \"soul\" in the western sense, and has to do with power, reputation, force of character, especially in the case of a god.\n\nSince the ''ba'' was associated with power, and also happened to be a word for [[Ram (sheep)|ram]] in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]], Banebdjed was depicted as a ram, or as Ram-headed. A living, sacred ram was kept at Mendes and worshipped as the incarnation of the god, and upon death, the rams were mummified and buried in a ram-specific [[necropolis]]. Banebdjed was consequently said to be Horus' father, as Banebdjed was an aspect of Osiris.\n\nRegarding the association of Osiris with the ram, the god's traditional [[crook and flail]] are the instruments of the shepherd, which has suggested to some scholars also an origin for Osiris in herding tribes of the upper Nile. The crook and flail were originally symbols of the minor agricultural deity [[Andjety]], and passed to Osiris later. From Osiris, they eventually passed to Egyptian kings in general as symbols of divine authority.\n\n==Mythology==\n[[File:Jewel Osiris family-E 6204-IMG 0641-gradient.jpg|thumb|200px|The family of Osiris.

Osiris' wife, [[Isis]], searched for his remains until she finally found him embedded in a tamarisk tree trunk, which was holding up the roof of a palace in [[Byblos]] on the Phoenician coast. She managed to remove the coffin and retrieve her husband's body.\n\nIn one version of the myth, Isis used a spell to briefly revive Osiris so he could impregnate her. After embalming and burying Osiris, Isis conceived and gave birth to their son, Horus. Thereafter Osiris lived on as the god of the underworld. Because of his death and resurrection, Osiris was associated with the flooding and retreating of the Nile and thus with the yearly growth and death of crops along the Nile valley.\n\n[[Diodorus Siculus]] gives another version of the myth in which Osiris was described as an ancient king who taught the Egyptians the arts of civilization, including agriculture, then travelled the world with his sister Isis, the satyrs, and [[Muse|the nine muses]], before finally returning to Egypt. Osiris was then murdered by his evil brother [[Typhon]], who was identified with Set. Typhon divided the body into twenty-six pieces, which he distributed amongst his fellow conspirators in order to implicate them in the murder. Isis and Hercules (Horus) avenged the death of Osiris and slew Typhon. Isis recovered all the parts of Osiris' body, except the phallus, and secretly buried them. She made replicas of them and distributed them to several locations, which then became centres of Osiris worship.<ref>\"Osiris\", [[Man, Myth & Magic (encyclopedia)|Man, Myth & Magic]], S.G.F Brandon, Vol5 P2088, BPC Publishing.</ref><ref>\"The Historical Library of Diodorus Siculus\", translated by George Booth 1814. retrieved 3 June 2007.

The annual festival involved the construction of \"Osiris Beds\" formed in shape of Osiris, filled with soil and sown with seed.<ref>Teeter, Emily (2011). ''Religion and Ritual in Ancient Egypt''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 58\u201366</ref>\n\nThe germinating seed symbolized Osiris rising from the dead.

When they pretend that the mutilated remains of the god have been found and rejoined...they turn from mourning to rejoicing.\" (''De Errore Profanorum'').\n\nThe passion of Osiris was reflected in his name 'Wenennefer\" (\"the one who continues to be perfect\"), which also alludes to his post mortem power.<ref name=\"Mark Collier p42\"/>\n\n===Ikhernofret Stela===\nMuch of the extant information about the rites of Osiris can be found on the [[Ikhernofret Stela]] at [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]] erected in the 12th Dynasty by Ikhernofret, possibly a priest of Osiris or other official (the titles of Ikhernofret are described in his stela from Abydos) during the reign of [[Senwosret III]] (Pharaoh Sesostris, about 1875 BC). The ritual reenactment of Osiris's funeral rites were held in the last month of the inundation (the annual Nile flood), coinciding with Spring, and held at Abydos which was the traditional place where the body of Osiris drifted ashore after having been drowned in the Nile.<ref name=\"passion play\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/743017 |publisher=ancientworlds.net |title=The passion plays of osiris |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626111529/http://www.ancientworlds.net/aw/Article/743017 |archivedate=2007-06-26 }}</ref>\n\nThe part of the myth recounting the chopping up of the body into 14 pieces by Set is not recounted in this particular stela. Although it is attested to be a part of the rituals by a version of the Papyrus Jumilhac, in which it took Isis 12 days to reassemble the pieces, coinciding with the festival of ploughing.<ref>J. Vandier, \"Le Papyrus Jumilhac\", pp.&nbsp;136\u2013137, Paris, 1961</ref> Some elements of the ceremony were held in the [[Egyptian temple|temple]], while others involved public participation in a form of theatre. The Stela of Ikhernofret recounts the programme of events of the public elements over the five days of the Festival:\n* ''The First Day, The Procession of [[Wepwawet]]'': A mock battle was enacted during which the enemies of Osiris are defeated. A procession was led by the god Wepwawet (\"opener of the way\").\n* ''The Second Day, The Great Procession of Osiris'': The body of Osiris was taken from his temple to his tomb. The boat he was transported in, the \"[[Neshmet]]\" bark, had to be defended against his enemies.\n* ''The Third Day:'' Osiris is Mourned and the Enemies of the Land are Destroyed''.\n* ''The Fourth Day, Night Vigil'': Prayers and recitations are made and funeral rites performed.\n* ''The Fifth Day, Osiris is Reborn'': Osiris is reborn at dawn and crowned with the crown of [[Ma'at]]. A statue of Osiris is brought to the temple.<ref name=\"passion play\"/>\n\n===Wheat and clay rituals===\n[[File:Terre cuite pleureuse Louvre E27247.jpg|thumb|left|A rare sample of Egyptian terra cotta sculpture which may depict [[Isis]] mourning Osiris.

[[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]], Paris.]]\n\nContrasting with the public \"theatrical\" ceremonies sourced from the I-Kher-Nefert stele (from the Middle Kingdom), more esoteric ceremonies were performed inside the temples by priests witnessed only by chosen initiates. Plutarch mentions that (for much later period) two days after the beginning of the festival \"the priests bring forth a sacred chest containing a small golden coffer, into which they pour some potable water...and a great shout arises from the company for joy that Osiris is found (or resurrected). Then they knead some fertile soil with the water...and fashion therefrom a crescent-shaped figure, which they cloth and adorn, this indicating that they regard these gods as the substance of Earth and Water.\" (''Isis and Osiris,'' 39). Yet his accounts were still obscure, for he also wrote, \"I pass over the cutting of the wood\" \u2013 opting not to describe it, since he considered it as a most sacred ritual (''Ibid.'' 21).\n\nIn the Osirian temple at [[Denderah]], an inscription (translated by Budge, Chapter XV, Osiris and the Egyptian Resurrection) describes in detail the making of wheat paste models of each dismembered piece of Osiris to be sent out to the town where each piece is discovered by Isis. At the temple of Mendes, figures of Osiris were made from wheat and paste placed in a trough on the day of the murder, then water was added for several days, until finally the mixture was kneaded into a mold of Osiris and taken to the temple to be buried (the sacred grain for these cakes were grown only in the temple fields). Molds were made from the wood of a red tree in the forms of the sixteen dismembered parts of Osiris, the cakes of \"divine\" bread were made from each mold, placed in a silver chest and set near the head of the god with ''the inward parts of Osiris'' as described in the Book of the Dead (XVII).\n\n== <!-- [[Osiris and his council]] links here -->Judgement ==\n\nThe idea of divine justice being exercised after death for wrongdoing during life is first encountered during the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]] in a 6th dynasty tomb containing fragments of what would be described later as the [[Maat#42 Confessions (Papyrus of Ani)|Negative Confessions]] performed in front of the 42 [[Assessors of Maat|Assessors of Ma'at]].<ref>\"Studies in Comparative Religion\", General editor, E.

Serapis was often treated as the consort of Isis and became the patron deity of the Ptolemies' capital, Alexandria.{{sfnp|Wilkinson|2003|pp=127\u2013128}} Serapis's origins are not known. Some ancient authors claim the cult of Serapis was established at Alexandria by [[Alexander the Great]] himself, but most who discuss the subject of Serapis's origins give a story similar to that by Plutarch. Writing about 400 years after the fact, Plutarch claimed that [[Ptolemy I]] established the cult after dreaming of a colossal statue at [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinope]] in Anatolia. His councillors identified as a statue of the Greek god [[Pluto (god)|Pluto]] and said that the Egyptian name for Pluto was Serapis. This name may have been a Hellenization of \"Osiris-Apis\".<ref>[[Fran\u00e7oise Dunand]] and Christiane Zivie-Coche (2004), ''Gods and Men in Egypt: 3000 BCE to 395 CE'', pp. 214\u2013215</ref> Osiris-Apis was a patron deity of the [[Memphite Necropolis]] and the father of the [[Apis (god)|Apis bull]] who was worshipped there, and texts from Ptolemaic times treat \"Serapis\" as the Greek translation of \"Osiris-Apis\". But little of the early evidence for Serapis's cult comes from Memphis, and much of it comes from the Mediterranean world with no reference to an Egyptian origin for Serapis, so Mark Smith expresses doubt that Serapis originated as a Greek form of Osiris-Apis's name and leaves open the possibility that Serapis originated outside Egypt.{{sfnp|Smith|2017|pp=390\u2013394}}\n\n===Destruction of cult===\n[[Image:Philae, seen from the water, Aswan, Egypt, Oct 2004.jpg|thumb|left|[[Philae Island]].]]\nThe cult of Isis and Osiris continued at [[Philae]] until at least the 450s CE, long after the imperial decrees of the late 4th century that ordered the closing of temples to \"[[pagan]]\" gods.

Sculptures by [[Alberto Giacometti]] in Paris and [[Laoco\u00f6n and His Sons]] have had a lasting impact in his mind.<ref name=MasterStroke/> The experiences in Europe inspired Khan to study and focus his efforts on sculpture.<ref name=StarMag/><ref name=Jamini>{{Cite news |date=2013-10-13 |title=An Interview with Hamiduzzaman Khan |url=https://issuu.com/bengal-foundation/docs/jamini/8 |work=Jamini|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDuring his stay in [[Baroda]] as a student, Khan made sculpture based on the [[Bangladesh War of Liberation]] and presented it to viewers in his first exhibit. The sculpture was a massacred human figure in lying position. Khan was praised by artist [[M. F. Husain]] and he was awarded first prize for the work in the exhibition celebrating twenty-five years of Faculty of Fine Arts, University of Baroda.\n\n==Career==\nKhan participated in his first national sculpture exhibition in 1976, and was awarded the first prize for his sculpture \"Dorja\"(door). He was appointed to make a bronze sculpture in Bangabhaban in 1981, entitled \"Bird Family\".\n\nIn the 1980s Khan was commissioned to decorate the [[Bangabhaban]] fountain with sculptural work.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2012-06-10 |title=Hamiduzzaman Khan's Solo Exhibition at Galleri Kaya: Watercolours and Sculptures Exposition |url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2682859231.html |url-status=dead |work=Dhaka Courier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414135727/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P3-2682859231.html |archive-date=2016-04-14}}</ref> He created a bronze sculpture in Bangabhaban in 1981, entitled \"Bird Family\".

The episode aired on March 30, 2020 on [[AMC (TV channel)|AMC]] in the United States. Outside of the United States, the episode premiered on streaming service [[Netflix]] in several countries.\n\n== Plot ==\nJimmy and Kim marry; with spousal privilege, Jimmy can tell Kim about his cases without lying.\n\nLalo is charged with murder. Jimmy represents him at his arraignment and Lalo is remanded. He directs Jimmy to obtain his release on bail so he will not go to trial, promising that if successful, Jimmy will become wealthy as a \"friend of the cartel\". Jimmy tests his new relationship with Kim by telling her about Lalo, including his intent not to fight for Lalo's release.\n\nRich and Kim meet with Kevin and apologize for the outcome of Acker's case, and Kevin indicates he will let them know whether he decides to retain them. Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office and tells him he consistently ignored their advice. She tells Kevin that whether he retains them or obtains new lawyers, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by telling Kim and Rich he will see them at their regular Thursday meeting.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is past the problem that caused his recent anger. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn down one of Gus's restaurants. In Houston, Gus and other Madrigal subsidiary owners provide reports to CEO Peter Schuler. Gus later meets with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab and warns them that Lalo remains a threat even while incarcerated. Peter panics, and Gus calms him by reminding him of their shared experience in Santiago. On his return, Gus and Nacho protect Nacho's role as the mole inside the Salamanca organization by vandalizing Gus's flagship restaurant, then setting an explosion that burns it down.\n\nGus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Jimmy details about the investigative work he did under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the information at the bail hearing to accuse police of witness tampering. The judge grants bail of {{USD|7 million}} cash, which Lalo tells a shocked Jimmy he can pay, but that Jimmy will have to pick it up.\n\nHoward approaches Jimmy at the courthouse about working at HHM and Jimmy says he is still considering it. Howard realizes Jimmy has been toying with him, including damaging his car and disrupting his recent lunch, and rescinds the offer. Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and loudly proclaims that he has grown too big for the constraints of an HHM job.\n\n==Production==\n\"JMM\" is the directorial debut of Melissa Bernstein, an executive producer on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]''.<ref name=\"rs review\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-7-jmm-974534/ |title='Better Call Saul' Recap: Just Make Money |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=March 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] referencing ''Breaking Bad'' were included in this episode.

Jimmy tests his new relationship with Kim by telling her about Lalo, including his intent not to fight for Lalo's release.\n\nRich and Kim meet with Kevin and apologize for the outcome of Acker's case, and Kevin indicates he will let them know whether he decides to retain them. Kim leads Rich back to Kevin's office and tells him he consistently ignored their advice. She tells Kevin that whether he retains them or obtains new lawyers, she hopes he will be more willing to listen. Kevin indicates his approval by telling Kim and Rich he will see them at their regular Thursday meeting.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is past the problem that caused his recent anger. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn down one of Gus's restaurants. In Houston, Gus and other Madrigal subsidiary owners provide reports to CEO Peter Schuler. Gus later meets with Peter and Lydia to update them on the status of the meth lab and warns them that Lalo remains a threat even while incarcerated. Peter panics, and Gus calms him by reminding him of their shared experience in Santiago. On his return, Gus and Nacho protect Nacho's role as the mole inside the Salamanca organization by vandalizing Gus's flagship restaurant, then setting an explosion that burns it down.\n\nGus wants Lalo released, so Mike provides Jimmy details about the investigative work he did under an assumed name. Jimmy uses the information at the bail hearing to accuse police of witness tampering. The judge grants bail of {{USD|7 million}} cash, which Lalo tells a shocked Jimmy he can pay, but that Jimmy will have to pick it up.\n\nHoward approaches Jimmy at the courthouse about working at HHM and Jimmy says he is still considering it. Howard realizes Jimmy has been toying with him, including damaging his car and disrupting his recent lunch, and rescinds the offer. Jimmy angrily blames Howard for Chuck's death and loudly proclaims that he has grown too big for the constraints of an HHM job.\n\n==Production==\n\"JMM\" is the directorial debut of Melissa Bernstein, an executive producer on ''[[Breaking Bad]]'', ''[[Better Call Saul]]'', and ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie|El Camino]]''.<ref name=\"rs review\">{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-recaps/better-call-saul-recap-season-5-episode-7-jmm-974534/ |title='Better Call Saul' Recap: Just Make Money |last=Sepinwall |first=Alan |authorlink=Alan Sepinwall |date=March 20, 2020 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=March 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nSeveral [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]] referencing ''Breaking Bad'' were included in this episode.
