While Peru felt that the matter was already decided in the [[Ecuadorian-Peruvian War]] of 1941, Ecuador did not agree with the [[Rio de Janeiro Protocol]]. Later in 1998 the Guarantors of the Rio Protocol ruled that the border of the undelimited zone was indeed the line of the Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor, as Peru had been claiming since the 1940s. \n\nIn the aftermath of the incident, both sides increased their military presence along the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor]] area and Cenepa Valley, starting an escalating spiral of tension and provocation that finally resulted in another military confrontation in 1995, the [[Cenepa War]].\n\nWhile the name ''Paquisha War'' is widely used by the international community and Ecuador, in Spanish this incident is also known as the '''Falso Paquisha War''' (''Conflicto del Falso Paquisha'') in Peru and, occasionally, as the '''Paquisha Incident''' or the '''Upper Comaina Conflict''' (''conflicto del Alto Comaina'').\n\n==Historical background==\n''For details on the history of the border dispute between Ecuador and Peru, please see [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]].''\n\n===The Paquisha or \"Fake Paquisha\" Incident===\nThe dispute revolved around the existence of three Ecuadorian military outposts, called Paquisha, Mayaico, and Machinaza, located in the valley of the Comaina River, beyond the eastern slopes of the [[Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor|Condor range]] (in Spanish, ''Cordillera del C\u00f3ndor''). While these posts were located in the as yet non-demarcated zone of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian border, the establishment of these posts was considered by the Peruvian Government as a violation of a ''[[status quo]]'' line arranged between the military leaders of both countries in the course of several meetings at the end of the 1970s. During these agreements both sides would have agreed not to establish any new military posts in the disputed areas,<ref>Mena, 1981</ref> which would have meant for Ecuador not to establish any military presence to the east of the ridgeline of the Condor Range.\n\nThe Ecuadorian possession of these posts was denounced by Peruvian representatives at the foreign ministers' meeting of the [[Organization of American States|OAS]], on February 2, 1981. During this meeting, the Peruvian Foreign Minister, [[Javier Arias Stella]], called the three Ecuadorian military outposts ''falsos'' (\"fakes\"), despite Ecuadorian sovereignty.\n\nEcuadorians indicated that these detachments corresponded to the \"Paquisha\" base established in Ecuadorian territory. But, after measuring the coordinates, it was found that they did not correspond to the aforementioned Paquisha accepted in the [[Rio Protocol|Protocol of Rio de Janeiro]] but, as the Peruvian president [[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry|Fernando Bela\u00fande]] described it, to a \"False Paquisha\", a name he gave to distinguish it easily from the first Paquisha that was legal according to the Rio protocol of 1942<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306200426/https://www.mindef.gob.pe/vercontenido.php?archivo=menu%2Fhistoricos%2Fefem-nacional%2Fefeme-enero3.htm&retorno=si|title=Operations of the False Paquisha|last=|first=|website=Ministry of Defense of Peru|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nThe Ecuadorian Foreign Minister, [[Alfonso Barrera Valderde]], responded to this allegation stating that when Ecuador responded to the attacks on January 22, it always specified that the attacks were being made against the ''destacamentos'' (military outposts) of Paquisha, Mayaicu, and Machinaza, not against the similarly named Ecuadorian towns.<ref>Mena Villamar, Claudio.

Levoyer proposed a new plan which placed all personnel, weapons, supplies, etc., in twenty-four hours in the front and ready to fulfill the mission of defense.\n\nThe Peruvian armed forces were surprised by the rapid deployment of Ecuadorian forces, so, thinking that Levoyer and his men might invade the north of Peru, they organized anti-tank defense lines, trenches, and other defenses.\n\nFortunately, events did not lead to general war. The widespread confrontation was avoided probably because of the direct talks between top military Commanders of the two countries, and the military Delegates of Chile, Argentina, Brazil and USA. The talks took place in the border line near the Pacific Ocean, in the towns of Huaquillas (Ecuador, Province of El Oro) and Aguas Verdes (Peru, Department of Tumbes). The result was the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act.\n\nThe cycle of direct face to face talks included Levoyer who was called by the Peruvians the leader of the \"hard line\". While they ran, Levoyer staged exercises both to encourage his men and to undermine the morale of their Peruvian opponents who had to get used to the daily six o'clock in the morning start of the exercises, which included artillery and other displays of force.\n\n===Aftermath===\nBorder violence remained constant until the resolution of the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute#Resolution and arbitration|Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]] in 1998 through the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]. Violence occurred most of the time around January, which coincides with the month that the [[Rio Protocol]] was signed. Despite several proposals to complete demarcation of the border, no agreement was possible at that time.\n\nSeveral military bases were built up and down the Cordillera by both countries, and the region was militarized. The Peruvian bases were serviced by helicopter, while on the Ecuadorian side, gravel roads were constructed to several military border posts.\n\nSome sources claim that the Ecuadorian resistance to the full implementation of the border demarcation during the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely due to domestic political struggles.\n\nAccording to the USIP, after this war, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry conducted a national opinion survey that reportedly confirmed the popularity of nullification of the Rio Protocol and Ecuador's right to sovereign access to the [[Amazon river]]. Thus, in 1983, the Ecuadorian congress reaffirmed its position on the nullity of the [[Rio Protocol]].\n\nIn the \"''Paquisha book, the whole truth''\" of the Ecuadorian writer Claudio Mena said the author argues that Ecuadorian President [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] had planned to inaugurate on February 12 those surveillance posts that [[Ecuador]] had installed in the territory of [[Peru]] to show the world that this territory was \" Ecuadorian soil<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/IFXjg|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|work=Diary Hoy, Ecuador|access-date=}}</ref> \"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1349/rio-cenepa/cenepa.html Interview with Peruvian President Fernando Belaunder Terry, Falso Paquisha Incident]'' Caretas\n*''[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml Detailed information about the military actions in the Paquisha Incident]''\n*''[http://ecuador.nativeweb.org/border/border1.html The 1995 Peruvian-Ecuadorian border conflict]\n\n{{Ecuador topics}}\n\n[[Category:Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 in Ecuador]]\n[[Category:History of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:1981 in Peru]]\n[[Category:History of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Ecuador\u2013Peru border]]\n[[Category:January 1981 events in South America]]\n[[Category:February 1981 events in South America]]\n", "text_old": "{{More footnotes|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict    = Paquisha War\n| partof      = the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute|Ecuadorian-Peruvian conflicts]]\n| image       = Ecuador-Peru-Frontera.svg\n| image_size  = 280\n| caption     = Ecuador\u2013Peru border\n| date        = {{start and end dates|1981|01|22|1981|02|05|df=y}}\n| place       = Condor mountain range\n| result      = Peruvian Victory <ref>{{cite web|title=Conflicto del Alto Comaina, Ecured Cuba|url=https://www.ecured.cu/Conflicto_del_Alto_Comaina|accessdate=18 February 2013|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=\u2018False Paquisha\u2019: 37 years after a military feat, Expreso Diary|url=https://www.expreso.com.pe/actualidad/falso-paquisha-a-37-anos-de-una-proeza-militar/|accessdate=29 January 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The other victory: How we achieve peace with Ecuador|url=https://revistaideele.com/ideele/content/la-otra-victoria-c%C3%B3mo-logramos-la-paz-con-el-ecuador|accessdate=7 March 2017|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n| combatant1  = {{flag|Peru}}\n| combatant2  = {{flag|Ecuador}}\n| commander1  = {{ubl|[[Fernando Bela\u00fande Terry]]|[[Rafael Hoyos Rubio]]}}\n| commander2  = [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]]\n| strength1   = unknown\n| strength2   = 53 men<ref>{{cite web|title=Paquisha, 35 a\u00f1os de este importante nombre en la historia del Ecuador|url=https://www.eluniverso.com/noticias/2016/01/21/nota/5359180/paquisha-nombre-historia-ecuador|accessdate=8 January 2018|language=Spanish}}</ref>\n| casualties1 = 17 killed\n| casualties2 = {{ubl|16 killed|30 wounded}}\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Ecuadorian-Peruvian}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Paquisha War''' ({{Lang-es|guerra de Paquisha}}) was a military clash that took place between January and February 1981 between [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]] over the control of three watchposts.

Levoyer proposed a new plan which placed all personnel, weapons, supplies, etc., in twenty-four hours in the front and ready to fulfill the mission of defense.\n\nThe Peruvian armed forces were surprised by the rapid deployment of Ecuadorian forces, so, thinking that Levoyer and his men might invade the north of Peru, they organized anti-tank defense lines, trenches, and other defenses.\n\nFortunately, events did not lead to general war. The widespread confrontation was avoided probably because of the direct talks between top military Commanders of the two countries, and the military Delegates of Chile, Argentina, Brazil and USA. The talks took place in the border line near the Pacific Ocean, in the towns of Huaquillas (Ecuador, Province of El Oro) and Aguas Verdes (Peru, Department of Tumbes). The result was the Sorrosa-Du Bois Act.\n\nThe cycle of direct face to face talks included Levoyer who was called by the Peruvians the leader of the \"hard line\". While they ran, Levoyer staged exercises both to encourage his men and to undermine the morale of their Peruvian opponents who had to get used to the daily six o'clock in the morning start of the exercises, which included artillery and other displays of force.\n\n===Aftermath===\nBorder violence remained constant until the resolution of the [[History of the Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute#Resolution and arbitration|Ecuadorian-Peruvian territorial dispute]] in 1998 through the [[Brasilia Presidential Act]]. Violence occurred most of the time around January, which coincides with the month that the [[Rio Protocol]] was signed. Despite several proposals to complete demarcation of the border, no agreement was possible at that time.\n\nSeveral military bases were built up and down the Cordillera by both countries, and the region was militarized. The Peruvian bases were serviced by helicopter, while on the Ecuadorian side, gravel roads were constructed to several military border posts.\n\nSome sources claim that the Ecuadorian resistance to the full implementation of the border demarcation during the 1970s and 1980s was almost entirely due to domestic political struggles.\n\nAccording to the USIP, after this war, Ecuador's Foreign Ministry conducted a national opinion survey that reportedly confirmed the popularity of nullification of the Rio Protocol and Ecuador's right to sovereign access to the [[Amazon river]]. Thus, in 1983, the Ecuadorian congress reaffirmed its position on the nullity of the [[Rio Protocol]].\n\nIn the \"''Paquisha book, the whole truth''\" of the Ecuadorian writer Claudio Mena said the author argues that Ecuadorian President [[Jaime Rold\u00f3s Aguilera]] had planned to inaugurate on February 12 those surveillance posts that [[Ecuador]] had installed in the territory of [[Peru]] to show the world that this territory was \" Ecuadorian soil<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://archive.is/IFXjg|title=Paquisha or the False Story|last=Mena Villamar|first=Claudio|work=Diary Hoy, Ecuador|access-date=}}</ref> \"\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*''[http://www.caretas.com.pe/1349/rio-cenepa/cenepa.html Interview with Peruvian President Fernando Belaunder Terry, Falso Paquisha Incident]'' Caretas\n*''[http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_164.shtml Detailed information about the military actions in the Paquisha Incident]''\n*''[http://ecuador.nativeweb.org/border/border1.html The 1995 Peruvian-Ecuadorian border conflict]\n\n{{Ecuador topics}}\n\n[[Category:Ecuadorian\u2013Peruvian wars]]\n[[Category:Conflicts in 1981]]\n[[Category:1981 in Ecuador]]\n[[Category:History of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:1981 in Peru]]\n[[Category:History of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Peru]]\n[[Category:Territorial disputes of Ecuador]]\n[[Category:Ecuador\u2013Peru border]]\n[[Category:January 1981 events in South America]]\n[[Category:February 1981 events in South America]]\n", "name_user": "Valdemar7070", "label": "safe", "comment": "Serious bibliographic source added to page", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paquisha_War"}

This followed the launches of the broadcasters' own video-on-demand services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 February 2009, Project Kangaroo was blocked by the then [[Competition Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission|title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2009-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe commission stated that the case surrounding Kangaroo was about the control of valuable UK-originated TV content. \"BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material, which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of video-on-demand services to UK viewers,\" said Peter Freeman, the chairman of the Competition Commission, in its final report on Project Kangaroo. \"We thought viewers would benefit from better video-on-demand [VoD] services if the parties \u2013 possibly in conjunction with other new and/or already established providers of VoD \u2013 competed with each other.\"\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said at the time, \"This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting.\"\n\nAfter the planned Project Kangaroo was blocked, the system's assets were sold to transmitter firm [[Arqiva]] and this led to the development of the service [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], which operated from February 2010 to October 2011, with content from the BBC, Channel 4, and Channel 5, some of which (such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'') now appears on BritBox.\n\n=== Rise of streaming ===\nSince the rise of [[Netflix]] and subsequent other Subscription Video on Demand services (SVODs), [[Europe|European]] PSBs and media companies in particular, have started to find ways to compete with the increasing dominance of American SVODs, and many old rivalries have also been put aside in Europe and to collaborate by creating joint SVODs, such the like of BritBox but also [[France]]'s Salto (backed by networks [[TF1 Group|TF1]], [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]] and [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]), and [[Germany|German]]-based [[:de:Joyn_(Streaminganbieter)|Joyn]] (a joint venture between [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|ProSiebenSat.1]] and [[Discovery, Inc.|Discovery]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-broadcasters-unite-take-netflix-global-streamers-1217336|title=A European Union of TV?

Such collaboration would greatly increase BritBox's catalogue and financial resources when competing with other streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ and [[Amazon Prime|Prime Video]].

which contains outdated stereotypes and opinions. In response to this, BritBox has announced that it would not include classic homegrown series that are deemed to be inappropriate for modern audiences.\n\nBritBox bosses have said a range of older shows, such as the BBC's ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' and ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', as well as ITV's ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'', will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable.<ref name=\"TuckerHudson\">{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Grant|last2=Hudson|first2=Jack|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britbox-opens-up-racist-doctor-who-can-of-worms-kv9pt68x5|title=BritBox opens up 'racist Doctor Who' can of worms|work=The Sunday Times|date=8 March 2020|access-date=8 March 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Reemah Sakaan, the senior ITV executive responsible for launching the subscription video-on-demand service, said \u201cWe also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards].

Some individual episodes of some shows that appear on BritBox such as BBC's ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial from the original run (''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'', 1977) are also deemed problematic. In the ''Doctor Who'' serial, people of Chinese extraction are termed \"inscrutable Chinks\" and an English actor performs in \"yellowface\". However, it is understood that no ''Fawlty Towers'' episodes will be cut from the service but will run with warnings of offensive language instead.

This followed the launches of the broadcasters' own video-on-demand services.\n\nOn Wednesday, 4 February 2009, Project Kangaroo was blocked by the then [[Competition Commission]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2009/feb/04/project-kangaroo-blocked-by-competition-commission|title=Project Kangaroo blocked by Competition Commission|last=Sweney|first=Mark|date=2009-02-04|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-01-03|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> \n\nThe commission stated that the case surrounding Kangaroo was about the control of valuable UK-originated TV content. \"BBC Worldwide, ITV and Channel 4 together control the vast majority of this material, which puts them in a very strong position as wholesalers of TV content to restrict competition from other current and future providers of video-on-demand services to UK viewers,\" said Peter Freeman, the chairman of the Competition Commission, in its final report on Project Kangaroo. \"We thought viewers would benefit from better video-on-demand [VoD] services if the parties \u2013 possibly in conjunction with other new and/or already established providers of VoD \u2013 competed with each other.\"\n\nA Channel 4 spokesperson said at the time, \"This is a disproportionate remedy and a missed opportunity in the further development of British broadcasting.\"\n\nAfter the planned Project Kangaroo was blocked, the system's assets were sold to transmitter firm [[Arqiva]] and this led to the development of the service [[SeeSaw (Internet television)|SeeSaw]], which operated from February 2010 to October 2011, with content from the BBC, Channel 4, and Channel 5, some of which (such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'') now appears on BritBox.\n\n=== Rise of streaming ===\nSince the rise of [[Netflix]] and subsequent other Subscription Video on Demand services (SVODs), [[Europe|European]] PSBs and media companies in particular, have started to find ways to compete with the increasing dominance of American SVODs, and many old rivalries have also been put aside in Europe and to collaborate by creating joint SVODs, such the like of BritBox but also [[France]]'s Salto (backed by networks [[TF1 Group|TF1]], [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]] and [[M6 (TV channel)|M6]]), and [[Germany|German]]-based [[:de:Joyn_(Streaminganbieter)|Joyn]] (a joint venture between [[ProSiebenSat.1 Media|ProSiebenSat.1]] and [[Discovery, Inc.|Discovery]])<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/european-broadcasters-unite-take-netflix-global-streamers-1217336|title=A European Union of TV?

Such collaboration would greatly increase BritBox's catalogue and financial resources when competing with other streaming platforms like Netflix, Disney+ and [[Amazon Prime|Prime Video]].

which contains outdated stereotypes and opinions. In response to this, BritBox has announced that it would not include classic homegrown series that are deemed to be inappropriate for modern audiences.\n\nBritBox bosses have said a range of older shows, such as the BBC's ''[[Till Death Us Do Part]]'' and ''[[It Ain't Half Hot Mum]]'', as well as ITV's ''[[Love Thy Neighbour (1972 TV series)|Love Thy Neighbour]]'', will not appear on the service because of content deemed racist or otherwise unacceptable.<ref name=\"TuckerHudson\">{{cite news|last1=Tucker|first1=Grant|last2=Hudson|first2=Jack|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/britbox-opens-up-racist-doctor-who-can-of-worms-kv9pt68x5|title=BritBox opens up 'racist Doctor Who' can of worms|work=The Sunday Times|date=8 March 2020|access-date=8 March 2020}} {{subscription required}}</ref> Reemah Sakaan, the senior ITV executive responsible for launching the subscription video-on-demand service, said \u201cWe also recomply everything that goes on to BritBox [with modern TV viewing standards].

Some individual episodes of some shows that appear on BritBox such as BBC's ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' and ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial from the original run (''[[The Talons of Weng-Chiang]]'', 1977) are also deemed problematic. In the ''Doctor Who'' serial, people of Chinese extraction are termed \"inscrutable Chinks\" and an English actor performs in \"yellowface\". However, it is understood that no ''Fawlty Towers'' episodes will be cut from the service but will run with warnings of offensive language instead.

The team was owned by the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]] winner [[Gil de Ferran]]. On August 7, 2009 de Ferran announced that he would retire from racing at the end of the 2009 season. He also planned to move the team to the [[IndyCar Series]], but instead merged with Luczo Dragon Racing to form [[de Ferran Luczo Dragon Racing]].\n\n==Racing History==\n[[File:DeFerran ALMS Monterey 2008.jpg|thumb|Right|300px|The de Ferran Motorsports Acura ARX-01b at [[Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca|Laguna Seca]]]]\nThe 2008 season started late for the team.
