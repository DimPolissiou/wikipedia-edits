He was also an international [[rugby union]] forward who won five caps for [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]]. He played club rugby for [[Swansea RFC|Swansea]], captaining the club through two seasons, and was the first Swansea player to represent Wales.\n\n==Biography==\nGeorge Lockwood Morris was born on 29 January 1859. He was the great-grandson in a junior branch of the family of [[Sir John Morris, 1st Baronet]], the industrialist and founder of the suburb of [[Morriston]] in Swansea.\n\nBetween 1878 and 1884 he was a noted rugby player.\n\nIn 1889 he married Wilhelmina Cory of the [[Cory baronets|Cory family]] at Swansea. They lived at Sketty, and had three children - Muriel, who died in her teens, [[Cedric Morris|Cedric Lockwood]] (1889-1982), who became a noted painter and plantsman, and Nancy (born 1893).\n\nIn 1947, at the age of 88, Morris inherited the [[Morris Baronets|Morris]] baronetcy from a distant cousin, three months before his death.<ref>Richard Morphet ''Cedric Morris'' The Tate Gallery 1984 {{ISBN|0-946590-06-0}} p17</ref>\n\n==Rugby career==\n\nMorris joined the Swansea team in 1878, at the age of 19, and in the 1881/82 season he was awarded the captaincy of the Senior XV team, an honour he would hold for the next season.\n\nOn 28 January 1882 Morris was selected for the Wales team in their [[1881-82 Home Nations rugby union matches|first rugby match against Ireland]].

The film is set in post\u2013World War II [[Vienna]]. It centres on Holly Martins, an American who is given a job in Vienna by his friend Harry Lime but, when he arrives in Vienna, gets the news that Lime is dead. Martins then meets with Lime's acquaintances in an attempt to investigate what he considers a suspicious death.\n\nThe atmospheric use of black-and-white [[expressionist]] [[cinematography]] by [[Robert Krasker]], with harsh [[stage lighting|lighting]] and distorted \"[[Dutch angle]]\" camera technique, is a major feature of ''The Third Man''.

Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two British [[Royal Military Police]]: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins's books, and his superior, Major Calloway. Afterwards Martins is asked to give a lecture to a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident and, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\n\nMartins goes to see Anna and becomes suspicious that Lime's death was not an accident. The porter at Lime's apartment building says that Lime was killed immediately and that three men carried the body, not two. Martins and Anna discover that the police are searching her flat; the police confiscate a [[Identity document forgery|forged]] [[passport]] and detain her. The next evening Martins visits Lime's \"medical adviser\", Dr. Winkel, who says that he arrived at the accident after Lime was dead, and only two men were there.\n\nThe porter offers to give Martins more information, but someone kills him before Martins can see him. When Martins arrives, the crowd believes that he is involved and becomes hostile. Escaping from them, Martins returns to the hotel, and a cab immediately takes him to the book club, where he makes a poor speech. When Popescu enters, he asks about Martins's next book. Martins says that it will be called ''The Third Man'', \"a murder story\" inspired by facts. Popescu tells Martins that he should stick to fiction. Martins sees two thugs advancing towards him and flees.\n\nCalloway again advises Martins to leave Vienna, but Martins refuses and demands that Lime's death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime's [[Racket (crime)|racket]] was stealing [[penicillin]] from [[military hospital]]s, diluting it, and selling it on the [[black market]], leading to many deaths. Martins, convinced, agrees to leave.\n\nMartins learns that Anna too has been told about Lime's crimes and is about to be sent to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sector. Leaving her apartment, Martins notices someone watching from a dark doorway. A shaft of light reveals the person to be Lime, who flees, ignoring Martins's calls, and vanishes.  Martins summons Calloway, who deduces that Lime has escaped through the [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]. The British police [[exhume]] Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of the [[orderly]] who stole the penicillin for Lime.\n\nThe next day, Martins meets with Lime, and they ride Vienna's [[Ferris wheel]], the [[Wiener Riesenrad]]. Lime obliquely threatens Martins, reveals the full extent of his ruthlessness, and then reiterates his job offer before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help capture Lime, and Martins agrees, asking for Anna's safe conduct out of Vienna in exchange. However, when Anna learns this, she refuses to leave. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of [[meningitis]] that had been treated using Lime's diluted penicillin.\n\nLime arrives to rendezvous with Martins, but Anna warns him. He tries once again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are there in force. Lime shoots and kills Paine, but Calloway shoots and wounds Lime. Badly injured, Lime drags himself up a ladder to a street grating, but he cannot lift it. Martins then kills him using Paine's revolver. Later, Martins attends Lime's second funeral. At the risk of missing his flight out of Vienna, he waits to speak to Anna, but she ignores him and walks past.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as Holly Martins\n* [[Alida Valli]] (credited as Valli) as Anna Schmidt\n* [[Orson Welles]] as Harry Lime\n* [[Trevor Howard]] as Major Calloway\n* [[Paul H\u00f6rbiger]] as Karl, Lime's porter (credited as Paul Hoerbiger)\n* [[Ernst Deutsch]] as \"Baron\" Kurtz\n* [[Erich Ponto]] as Dr. Winkel\n* [[Siegfried Breuer]] as Popescu\n* [[Hedwig Bleibtreu]] as Anna's old landlady\n* [[Bernard Lee]] as Sergeant Paine\n* [[Wilfrid Hyde-White]] as Crabbin\n}}\n'''Uncredited'''\n{{castlist|\n* [[Annie Rosar]] as the porter's wife \n* Alexis Chesnakov as Brodsky, Russian official \n* Herbert Halbik as Little Hansel - Boy with Ball \n* [[Robert Brown (British actor)|Robert Brown]] as British Military Policeman in the sewer chase scene \n* [[Paul Hardtmuth]] as the hall porter at [[Hotel Sacher]] \n* [[Geoffrey Keen]] as British Military Policeman \n* [[Eric Pohlmann]] as waiter at Smolka's \n* [[Reed De Rouen]] as  American Military Policeman at Railroad Station \n* [[Brother Theodore]] as Man on Street \n* [[Nelly Arno]] as Kurtz's mother<ref name=BFI>{{cite web|title=Nelly Arno|url=http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bafc07929|website=BFI|accessdate=22 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140816093402/http://explore.bfi.org.uk/4ce2bafc07929|archive-date=16 August 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n* [[Karel \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1nek]] as actor at [[Josefstadt Theatre]] \n* Joseph Cotten as the narrator (pre-1999 US version)\n* [[Carol Reed]] as the narrator (pre-1999 UK, and all post-'99 versions)\n* [[Charles Winchester]] as the Thug (Post-1999 UK, and all post-'99 versions)\n}}\n\n==Production==\n\n===Development===\nBefore writing the screenplay, Graham Greene worked out the atmosphere, characterisation and mood of the story by writing a novella.<ref>[[Graham Greene|Greene, Graham]] and Henry J. Donaghy (1992). ''Conversations With Graham Greene''. Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi. {{ISBN|0-87805-549-5}}. p 76.</ref> He wrote it as a source text for the screenplay and never intended it to be read by the general public, although it was later published under the same name as the film. In 1948 he met [[Elizabeth Varley|Elizabeth Montagu]] in Vienna. She gave him tours of the city, its sewers and some of its less reputable night-clubs. She also introduced Greene to [[Peter Smollett|Peter Smolka]], the central European correspondent for ''The Times''. Smolka gave Greene the stories about the black market in Vienna.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Guardian |date=10 July 1999 |title=Harry in the shadow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview10 |accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator in the novella is Major Calloway, which gives the book a slightly different emphasis from that of the screenplay. A small portion of his narration appears in a modified form at the film's beginning in Reed's voice-over: \"I never knew the old Vienna\". Other differences include both Martins' and Lime's nationalities; they are English in the book. Martins' given name is Rollo rather than Holly. Popescu's character is an American called Cooler. Crabbin was a single character in the novella. The screenplay's original draft replaced him with two characters, played by [[Basil Radford]] and [[Naunton Wayne]], but ultimately in the film, as in the novella, Crabbin remains a single character.\n\nThere is also a difference of ending.  The novella's implies that Anna and Martins are about to begin a new life together, in stark contrast to the unmistakable snub by Anna that closes the film.  In the book, Anna does walk away from Lime's grave, but the text continues:\n\n<blockquote>I watched him striding off on his overgrown legs after the girl. He caught her up and they walked side by side. I don't think he said a word to her: it was like the end of a story except that before they turned out of my sight her hand was through his arm\u2014which is how a story usually begins. He was a very bad shot and a very bad judge of character, but he had a way with Westerns (a trick of tension) and with girls (I wouldn't know what).</blockquote>\n\nDuring the shooting of the film, the final scene was the subject of a dispute between Greene, who wanted the happy ending of the novella, and Reed and [[David O. Selznick]], who stubbornly refused to end the film on what they felt was an artificially happy note. Greene later wrote: \"One of the very few major disputes between Carol Reed and myself concerned the ending, and he has been proved triumphantly right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-astory.html |title='The Third Man' as a Story and a Film |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=19 March 1950 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nDavid O. Selznick's contribution, according to himself, was mainly to have provided his actors Cotten and Welles and to have produced the US-version, less to the co-writing of the script with Reed and Greene.<ref>{{cite book |last=Haver |first=Ronald |title=David O.

In film scholar [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]'s 2007 book ''Discovering Orson Welles'', Rosenbaum calls it a \"popular misconception\",<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan, ''Discovering Orson Welles'', University of California Press; 1st edition (2 May 2007), p.25 {{ISBN|0-520-25123-7}}</ref> although Rosenbaum did note that the film \"began to echo the Wellesian theme of betrayed male friendship and certain related ideas from ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.\"<ref name=rosenweb>Rosenbaum, Jonathan.

Yet old myths die hard, and some viewers persist in believing otherwise.\"<ref name=rosenweb/> Welles himself fuelled this theory in a 1958 interview, in which he said that he had had an important role in making ''The Third Man'', but that it was a \"delicate matter, because [he] wasn't the producer\".<ref>Welles, Orson, Mark W. Estrin. ''Orson Welles: Interviews''. Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2002.

Bogdanovich also stated in the introduction to the DVD: <blockquote>However, I think it's important to note that the look of ''The Third Man''\u2014and, in fact, the whole film\u2014would be unthinkable without ''Citizen Kane'', ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', all of which Orson made in the [[1940s in film|'40s]], and all of which preceded ''The Third Man''.

Looking down on the people below from his vantage point, Lime compares them to dots, and says that it would be insignificant if one of them or a few of them \"stopped moving, forever\". Back on the ground, he notes:\n\n<blockquote>You know what the fellow said \u2013 in Italy, for 30 years under the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]], they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the [[Renaissance]]. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, in five hundred years of democracy and peace \u2013 and what did that produce? The [[cuckoo clock]].</blockquote>\n\nWelles added this remark \u2013 in the published script, it is in a footnote. Greene wrote in a letter,<ref>13 October 1977</ref> \"What happened was that during the shooting of ''The Third Man'' it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\" Welles apparently said the lines came from \"an old Hungarian play\"\u2014in any event the idea is not original to Welles, acknowledged by the phrase \"what the fellow said\".\n\nThe likeliest source is the painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. In a lecture on art from 1885 (published in ''Mr Whistler's \"Ten O'Clock{{\"-}}'' [1888]), he said, \"The Swiss in their mountains&nbsp;... What more worthy people!&nbsp;... yet, the perverse and scornful [goddess, Art] will have none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box! For this was [[William Tell|Tell]] a hero! For this did [[Albrecht Gessler|Gessler]] die!\" In a 1916 reminiscence,<ref>''San Francisco Town Talk'', February 26, 1916, reported in [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres10hail#page/n255/mode/2up ''California Art Research'': Charles J.

'But environment does not lead to a production of art,' Whistler retorted. 'Consider Switzerland. There the people have everything in the form of natural advantages \u2013 mountains, valleys and blue sky. And what have they produced? The cuckoo clock!\"\n\nOr it may be that Welles was influenced by [[Geoffrey Household]], who wrote, in 1939, in his novel [[Rogue Male (novel)|Rogue Male]]:  \"...Swiss.  A people, my dear fellow, of quite extraordinary stupidity and immorality.  A combination which only a long experience of democratic government could have produced.\"\n\n''This Is Orson Welles'' (1993) quotes Welles: \"When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks,\"<ref>Nigel Rees, ''Brewer's Famous Quotations'', Sterling, 2006, pp. 485\u201386.</ref> as the clocks are native to the German [[Black Forest]].

''The Third Man'' was also adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'': on 9 April 1951 with Joseph Cotten reprising his role and on 8 February 1954 with [[Ray Milland]] as Martins.\n\nA British [[radio drama]] series, ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]'' (broadcast in the US as ''The Lives of Harry Lime''), created as a \"prequel\" to the film, centres on Lime's adventures prior to his \"death in Vienna\", and Welles reprises his role as a Lime somewhat less nefarious adventurer anti-hero than the sociopathic opportunist depicted in the film's incarnation.  Fifty-two episodes aired in 1951 and 1952, several of which Welles wrote, including \"Ticket to Tangiers\", which is included on the Criterion Collection and Studio Canal releases of ''The Third Man''. Recordings of the 1952 episodes \"Man of Mystery\", \"Murder on the Riviera\", and \"Blackmail Is a Nasty Word\" are also included on the Criterion Collection DVD ''The Complete [[Mr. Arkadin]]''.\n\nA [[The Third Man (TV series)|television spin-off]] starring [[Michael Rennie]] as Harry Lime ran for five seasons from 1959 to 1965. Seventy-seven episodes were filmed; directors included [[Paul Henreid]] (10 episodes) and [[Arthur Hiller]] (six episodes). [[Jonathan Harris]] played [[sidekick]] Bradford Webster for 72 episodes, and [[Roger Moore]] guest-starred in the instalment \"The Angry Young Man\", which Hiller directed.\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nIn the ''[[Law & Order]]'' episode \"Fluency\", Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Jack McCoy]] ([[Sam Watterson]]) uses the ferris wheel scene as part of his line of questioning against defendant Elliot Peters (played by [[Robert Sedgwick (actor)|Robert Sedgwick]]).  Peters, like Lime, is accused of selling saline as a flu vaccine in the black market, resulting in at least 16 deaths in [[New York City]]. Peters is found guilty on multiple counts of homicide.\n\nThe final scene is described in the short story \"All The Trees Are Naked\" by Sam Shepard, published in the book ''Great Dream of Heaven''. The narrator mistakenly refers to the actress as Ingrid Bergman.\n\nIn [[Len Deighton]]'s spy novel ''[[Spy Line]]'', protagonist Bernard Samson jokingly reports to a superior after being asked if he knows Vienna, \"I was there with Harry Lime.\"\n\nIn the ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' parody \"The Third Mouse\" the Brain (voiced by [[Maurice Lamarche]] doing an impersonation of Welles) inverts the cuckoo clock speech and praises the Swiss, in justification for his (temporary) abandonment of pursuing world domination.\n\n[[Jack White]] named his record label [[Third Man Records]] as an homage to the film. White also has a still from the sewer chase scene on his bass drum for his band [[The Dead Weather]]\n\nIn ''[[Home Alone]]'' one of the bandits is named Harry Lyme.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[BFI Top 100 British films]]\n* [[Sch\u00f6nlaterngasse]], alleyway in Vienna\n* ''[[Ten Seconds to Hell]]'', a.k.a.

The film is set in post\u2013World War II [[Vienna]]. It centres on Holly Martins, an American who is given a job in Vienna by his friend Harry Lime but, when he arrives in Vienna, gets the news that Lime is dead. Martins then meets with Lime's acquaintances in an attempt to investigate what he considers a suspicious death.\n\nThe atmospheric use of black-and-white [[expressionist]] [[cinematography]] by [[Robert Krasker]], with harsh [[stage lighting|lighting]] and distorted \"[[Dutch angle]]\" camera technique, is a major feature of ''The Third Man''. Combined with the iconic theme music, seedy locations and acclaimed performances from the cast, the style evokes the atmosphere of an exhausted, cynical post-war Vienna at the start of the [[Cold War]].\n\nGreene wrote the novella of the same name as preparation for the screenplay. [[Anton Karas]] wrote and performed the score, which featured only the [[zither]]. The title music \"[[The Third Man Theme]]\" topped the international music charts in 1950, bringing the previously unknown performer international fame; the theme would also inspire [[Nino Rota]]'s principal melody in ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' (1960).{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} ''The Third Man'' is considered one of [[List of films considered the best|the greatest films of all time]], celebrated for its acting, musical score and atmospheric cinematography.<ref>[[Leslie Halliwell|Halliwell, Leslie]] and John Walker, ed.

Martins is told that Lime was killed by a car while crossing the street. At Lime's funeral, Martins meets two British [[Royal Military Police]]: Sergeant Paine, a fan of Martins's books, and his superior, Major Calloway. Afterwards Martins is asked to give a lecture to a book club a few days later. He then meets a friend of Lime's, \"Baron\" Kurtz, who tells Martins that he and another friend, Popescu, carried Lime to the side of the street after the accident and, before he died, Lime asked them to take care of Martins and Lime's girlfriend, actress Anna Schmidt.\n\nMartins goes to see Anna and becomes suspicious that Lime's death was not an accident. The porter at Lime's apartment building says that Lime was killed immediately and that three men carried the body, not two. Martins and Anna discover that the police are searching her flat; the police confiscate a [[Identity document forgery|forged]] [[passport]] and detain her. The next evening Martins visits Lime's \"medical adviser\", Dr. Winkel, who says that he arrived at the accident after Lime was dead, and only two men were there.\n\nThe porter offers to give Martins more information, but someone kills him before Martins can see him. When Martins arrives, the crowd believes that he is involved and becomes hostile. Escaping from them, Martins returns to the hotel, and a cab immediately takes him to the book club, where he makes a poor speech. When Popescu enters, he asks about Martins's next book. Martins says that it will be called ''The Third Man'', \"a murder story\" inspired by facts. Popescu tells Martins that he should stick to fiction. Martins sees two thugs advancing towards him and flees.\n\nCalloway again advises Martins to leave Vienna, but Martins refuses and demands that Lime's death be investigated. Calloway reveals that Lime's [[Racket (crime)|racket]] was stealing [[penicillin]] from [[military hospital]]s, diluting it, and selling it on the [[black market]], leading to many deaths. Martins, convinced, agrees to leave.\n\nMartins learns that Anna too has been told about Lime's crimes and is about to be sent to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] sector. Leaving her apartment, Martins notices someone watching from a dark doorway. A shaft of light reveals the person to be Lime, who flees, ignoring Martins's calls, and vanishes.  Martins summons Calloway, who deduces that Lime has escaped through the [[Sanitary sewer|sewers]]. The British police [[exhume]] Lime's coffin and discover that the body is that of the [[orderly]] who stole the penicillin for Lime.\n\nThe next day, Martins meets with Lime, and they ride Vienna's [[Ferris wheel]], the [[Wiener Riesenrad]]. Lime obliquely threatens Martins, reveals the full extent of his ruthlessness, and then reiterates his job offer before leaving quickly. Calloway then asks Martins to help capture Lime, and Martins agrees, asking for Anna's safe conduct out of Vienna in exchange. However, when Anna learns this, she refuses to leave. Exasperated, Martins decides to leave, but on the way to the airport, Calloway stops at a hospital to show Martins children dying of [[meningitis]] that had been treated using Lime's diluted penicillin.\n\nLime arrives to rendezvous with Martins, but Anna warns him. He tries once again to escape using the sewer tunnels, but the police are there in force. Lime shoots and kills Paine, but Calloway shoots and wounds Lime. Badly injured, Lime drags himself up a ladder to a street grating, but he cannot lift it. Martins then kills him using Paine's revolver. Later, Martins attends Lime's second funeral.

Jackson, Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi. {{ISBN|0-87805-549-5}}. p 76.</ref> He wrote it as a source text for the screenplay and never intended it to be read by the general public, although it was later published under the same name as the film. In 1948 he met [[Elizabeth Varley|Elizabeth Montagu]] in Vienna. She gave him tours of the city, its sewers and some of its less reputable night-clubs. She also introduced Greene to [[Peter Smollett|Peter Smolka]], the central European correspondent for ''The Times''. Smolka gave Greene the stories about the black market in Vienna.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=The Guardian |date=10 July 1999 |title=Harry in the shadow |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1999/jul/10/books.guardianreview10 |accessdate=23 December 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe narrator in the novella is Major Calloway, which gives the book a slightly different emphasis from that of the screenplay. A small portion of his narration appears in a modified form at the film's beginning in Reed's voice-over: \"I never knew the old Vienna\". Other differences include both Martins' and Lime's nationalities; they are English in the book. Martins' given name is Rollo rather than Holly. Popescu's character is an American called Cooler. Crabbin was a single character in the novella. The screenplay's original draft replaced him with two characters, played by [[Basil Radford]] and [[Naunton Wayne]], but ultimately in the film, as in the novella, Crabbin remains a single character.\n\nThere is also a difference of ending.  The novella's implies that Anna and Martins are about to begin a new life together, in stark contrast to the unmistakable snub by Anna that closes the film.  In the book, Anna does walk away from Lime's grave, but the text continues:\n\n<blockquote>I watched him striding off on his overgrown legs after the girl. He caught her up and they walked side by side. I don't think he said a word to her: it was like the end of a story except that before they turned out of my sight her hand was through his arm\u2014which is how a story usually begins. He was a very bad shot and a very bad judge of character, but he had a way with Westerns (a trick of tension) and with girls (I wouldn't know what).</blockquote>\n\nDuring the shooting of the film, the final scene was the subject of a dispute between Greene, who wanted the happy ending of the novella, and Reed and [[David O. Selznick]], who stubbornly refused to end the film on what they felt was an artificially happy note. Greene later wrote: \"One of the very few major disputes between Carol Reed and myself concerned the ending, and he has been proved triumphantly right.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/00/02/20/specials/greene-astory.html |title='The Third Man' as a Story and a Film |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=19 March 1950 |accessdate=2 September 2013}}</ref>\n\nDavid O.

In film scholar [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]'s 2007 book ''Discovering Orson Welles'', Rosenbaum calls it a \"popular misconception\",<ref>Rosenbaum, Jonathan, ''Discovering Orson Welles'', University of California Press; 1st edition (2 May 2007), p.25 {{ISBN|0-520-25123-7}}</ref> although Rosenbaum did note that the film \"began to echo the Wellesian theme of betrayed male friendship and certain related ideas from ''[[Citizen Kane]]''.\"<ref name=rosenweb>Rosenbaum, Jonathan.

Yet old myths die hard, and some viewers persist in believing otherwise.\"<ref name=rosenweb/> Welles himself fuelled this theory in a 1958 interview, in which he said that he had had an important role in making ''The Third Man'', but that it was a \"delicate matter, because [he] wasn't the producer\".<ref>Welles, Orson, Mark W. Estrin. ''Orson Welles: Interviews''. Mississippi: University Press of Mississippi, 2002.

Bogdanovich also stated in the introduction to the DVD: <blockquote>However, I think it's important to note that the look of ''The Third Man''\u2014and, in fact, the whole film\u2014would be unthinkable without ''Citizen Kane'', ''[[The Stranger (1946 film)|The Stranger]]'' and ''[[The Lady from Shanghai]]'', all of which Orson made in the [[1940s in film|'40s]], and all of which preceded ''The Third Man''.

Looking down on the people below from his vantage point, Lime compares them to dots, and says that it would be insignificant if one of them or a few of them \"stopped moving, forever\". Back on the ground, he notes:\n\n<blockquote>You know what the fellow said \u2013 in Italy, for 30 years under the [[House of Borgia|Borgias]], they had warfare, terror, murder and bloodshed, but they produced [[Michelangelo]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and the [[Renaissance]]. In Switzerland, they had brotherly love, in five hundred years of democracy and peace \u2013 and what did that produce? The [[cuckoo clock]].</blockquote>\n\nWelles added this remark \u2013 in the published script, it is in a footnote. Greene wrote in a letter,<ref>13 October 1977</ref> \"What happened was that during the shooting of ''The Third Man'' it was found necessary for the timing to insert another sentence.\" Welles apparently said the lines came from \"an old Hungarian play\"\u2014in any event the idea is not original to Welles, acknowledged by the phrase \"what the fellow said\".\n\nThe likeliest source is the painter [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]]. In a lecture on art from 1885 (published in ''Mr Whistler's \"Ten O'Clock{{\"-}}'' [1888]), he said, \"The Swiss in their mountains&nbsp;... What more worthy people!&nbsp;... yet, the perverse and scornful [goddess, Art] will have none of it, and the sons of patriots are left with the clock that turns the mill, and the sudden cuckoo, with difficulty restrained in its box! For this was [[William Tell|Tell]] a hero! For this did [[Albrecht Gessler|Gessler]] die!\" In a 1916 reminiscence,<ref>''San Francisco Town Talk'', February 26, 1916, reported in [https://archive.org/stream/californiaartres10hail#page/n255/mode/2up ''California Art Research'': Charles J.

'But environment does not lead to a production of art,' Whistler retorted. 'Consider Switzerland. There the people have everything in the form of natural advantages \u2013 mountains, valleys and blue sky. And what have they produced? The cuckoo clock!\"\n\nOr it may be that Welles was influenced by [[Geoffrey Household]], who wrote, in 1939, in his novel [[Rogue Male (novel)|Rogue Male]]:  \"...Swiss.  A people, my dear fellow, of quite extraordinary stupidity and immorality.  A combination which only a long experience of democratic government could have produced.\"\n\n''This Is Orson Welles'' (1993) quotes Welles: \"When the picture came out, the Swiss very nicely pointed out to me that they've never made any cuckoo clocks,\"<ref>Nigel Rees, ''Brewer's Famous Quotations'', Sterling, 2006, pp. 485\u201386.</ref> as the clocks are native to the German [[Black Forest]].

In June 2008, the American Film Institute (AFI) revealed its ''[[AFI's 10 Top 10|10 Top 10]]''\u2014the best 10 films in 10 \"classic\" American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community.

''The Third Man'' was also adapted as a one-hour radio play on two broadcasts of ''[[Lux Radio Theatre]]'': on 9 April 1951 with Joseph Cotten reprising his role and on 8 February 1954 with [[Ray Milland]] as Martins.\n\nA British [[radio drama]] series, ''[[The Adventures of Harry Lime]]'' (broadcast in the US as ''The Lives of Harry Lime''), created as a \"prequel\" to the film, centres on Lime's adventures prior to his \"death in Vienna\", and Welles reprises his role as a Lime somewhat less nefarious adventurer anti-hero than the sociopathic opportunist depicted in the film's incarnation.  Fifty-two episodes aired in 1951 and 1952, several of which Welles wrote, including \"Ticket to Tangiers\", which is included on the Criterion Collection and Studio Canal releases of ''The Third Man''. Recordings of the 1952 episodes \"Man of Mystery\", \"Murder on the Riviera\", and \"Blackmail Is a Nasty Word\" are also included on the Criterion Collection DVD ''The Complete [[Mr. Arkadin]]''.\n\nA [[The Third Man (TV series)|television spin-off]] starring [[Michael Rennie]] as Harry Lime ran for five seasons from 1959 to 1965. Seventy-seven episodes were filmed; directors included [[Paul Henreid]] (10 episodes) and [[Arthur Hiller]] (six episodes). [[Jonathan Harris]] played [[sidekick]] Bradford Webster for 72 episodes, and [[Roger Moore]] guest-starred in the instalment \"The Angry Young Man\", which Hiller directed.\n\n==Cultural references==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}\nIn the ''[[Law & Order]]'' episode \"Fluency\", Executive Assistant District Attorney [[Jack McCoy]] ([[Sam Watterson]]) uses the ferris wheel scene as part of his line of questioning against defendant Elliot Peters (played by [[Robert Sedgwick (actor)|Robert Sedgwick]]).  Peters, like Lime, is accused of selling saline as a flu vaccine in the black market, resulting in at least 16 deaths in [[New York City]]. Peters is found guilty on multiple counts of homicide.\n\nThe final scene is described in the short story \"All The Trees Are Naked\" by Sam Shepard, published in the book ''Great Dream of Heaven''. The narrator mistakenly refers to the actress as Ingrid Bergman.\n\nIn [[Len Deighton]]'s spy novel ''[[Spy Line]]'', protagonist Bernard Samson jokingly reports to a superior after being asked if he knows Vienna, \"I was there with Harry Lime.\"\n\nIn the ''[[Pinky and the Brain]]'' parody \"The Third Mouse\" the Brain (voiced by [[Maurice Lamarche]] doing an impersonation of Welles) inverts the cuckoo clock speech and praises the Swiss, in justification for his (temporary) abandonment of pursuing world domination.\n\n[[Jack White]] named his record label [[Third Man Records]] as an homage to the film. White also has a still from the sewer chase scene on his bass drum for his band [[The Dead Weather]]\n\nIn [[Home Alone]] one of the bandits is named Harry Lyme.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Film}}\n* [[BFI Top 100 British films]]\n* [[Sch\u00f6nlaterngasse]], alleyway in Vienna\n* ''[[Ten Seconds to Hell]]'', a.k.a.

He began the first volume of the series, ''[[Mortal Engines]]'', in the 1980s, and it was published in 2001. Reeve then published three further novels, ''[[Predator's Gold]]'' in 2003, ''[[Infernal Devices (Reeve)|Infernal Devices]]'' in 2005, and ''[[A Darkling Plain]]'' in 2006.<ref name=\"TheStarMiniReviews\"/> The series is set thousands of years in the future in a time known as the Traction Era, and tell the story of two young adventurers on a desolate planet Earth where moving cities roam for resources, eating each other. The novels have won a number of awards, including the [[Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize]] in 2002 for ''Mortal Engines'' and the 2006 [[Guardian Children's Fiction Prize]]<ref name=ezard/><ref name=prize2006/> and the 2007 [[List of Los Angeles Times Book Prize winners|Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Young Adult Fiction]] for ''A Darkling Plain''.<ref name=latimes/>\n\nA companion piece entitled ''The Traction Codex'' was released in 2011, and was expanded into ''The Illustrated World of Mortal Engines'' by Reeve and Jeremy Levett, which was published in 2018. Additionally, a collection of short stories set before the series called ''Night Flights'' was published the same year. Also, a prequel series, ''[[Fever Crumb (series)|Fever Crumb]]'', set 600 years before the events of the Quartet, was published between 2009 and 2011.

Nations no longer exist except in the lands of the Anti-Traction League; whereas Traction Cities\u2014[[Walking City|mobile cities]] mounted on caterpillar tracks\u2014are fiercely independent [[city-states]] that use giant mechanical jaws to dismantle one another for resources. Trade is mostly accomplished by [[airship]], or between mobile cities of roughly equal size (unable to devour each other). Old-Tech (technology from before the Traction Era, some from the 21st century) is the most sought-after commodity.\n\n* '''The Great Hunting Ground''' \u2013 Consists of Europe and Northern Asia, and is the domain of the Traction Cities. It is a muddy wasteland, in which the constant movement of the cities has destroyed all vegetation. The land is identified by city-dwellers as the \"Out-Country\".\n* '''The Ice Wastes''' \u2013 New name for the [[Arctic]], wherein Traction Cities use iron runners to skate across the ice. In some places, the ice is thin, and they risk falling in the ocean.\n* '''Africa''' \u2013 Africa is split between the [[Sahara Desert]], governed by Traction Cities, and the southern regions, run by Anti-Tractionists. Areas of the southern continent include the static cities of Zagwa and Tibetsi, and the highland area known as the Mountains of the Moon.\n* '''The Dead Continent''' \u2013 North America, supposedly reduced to an irradiated wasteland by the Sixty Minute War. In ''[[Predator's Gold]]'', it is proven not to be completely dead; in the north there are forests with some animals that survived the Sixty Minute War.\n* '''Asia''' \u2013 The stronghold of the Anti-Traction League. Eastern China is evidently irradiated by the War, and the [[Himalayas]] are now the centre of civilization, where the mountains make it impossible for cities to approach.\n* '''Nuevo Maya''' \u2013 New name for South America, severed from North America when \"slow bombs\" destroyed Central America during the war. Static settlements rule the [[Andes]], but the lowlands are filled with [[ziggurat]] Traction Cities. Protagonists Tom and Hester visit Nuevo Maya between the first two books, but it is never visited in the text. Philip Reeve has said that he will explore Nuevo Maya in more detail in the future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n* '''Antarctica''' \u2013 Mentioned only once, and evidently the domain of oil-drilling Traction Cities. Tom and Hester visit [[Antarctica]] between the first two books, but it is not described in the text.\n* '''Australia''' \u2013 Though not mentioned in the original series or [[Fever Crumb]], Philip Reeve says that he will explore places like Australia and Nuevo Maya in the future, as he never had a chance to do so in the original quartet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n* '''Anchorage-in-Vineland''' \u2013 The static and stable version of the Traction City of Anchorage, which had decided to stop wandering the Arctic wastes and settle in the green and unspoilt land of Vineland (in North America). When Anchorage was a Traction City, it was not predatory but gained its wealth by trading with other cities under more scrupulous leaders.\n\n==Title==\nThe title is a quotation from Act III, Scene iii of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Othello]]'' (\"Othello: And O you mortal engines whose rude throats/Th'immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit...\" \u2013 Line 352). It refers to the fact that the society of Municipal Darwinism is not [[sustainable living]] and that the cities' engines are indeed [[Death|mortal]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Mortal Engines===\n{{Main|Mortal Engines}}\nThe book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent to the \"Gut\" of London, where towns are stripped for resources, after he skips a chore. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground, and after an argument start following the city's tracks to reboard it.\n\nThe pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the Jenny Haniver to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a cyborg \"Stalker\" called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him.\n\nTom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London.\n\nHester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down and saving her life.\n\nValentine is sent away by Crome on a \"secret mission\", much to Katherine's dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London, and that the Guild of Engineers have reassembled it inside St Paul's Cathedral. The Cathedral's dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London. \n\nTom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent, and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League's northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the 13th Floor Elevator. Tom and Hester take the Jenny Haniver and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves.\n\nWith MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League's base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa in order to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester's mother Pandora, and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester's half sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA, but are caught in their attempt.\n\nThe Guild of Historians, led by Tom's boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul's Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the 13th Floor Elevator above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul's Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father's way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him.\n\nHester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the Jenny Haniver, apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads. \n\n===Predator's Gold===\n{{Main|Predator's Gold}}\nTom and Hester meet adventurer and author Nimrod Pennyroyal aboard Airhaven, who persuades them to take him as a passenger. They are soon pursued by airships of the Green Storm, a fanatical splinter group of the Anti-Traction League, who want the Jenny Haniver as they believe it was stolen from their deceased leader and friend to Tom and Hester, Anna Fang. Despite evading the airships, the Jenny Haniver is damaged and drifts helplessly over the Ice Wastes. They are rescued by Anchorage, which was once a thriving Traction City that relied primarily upon trade, but had recently been devastated by an excavated biological weapon that killed most of the inhabitants. The survivors have set a course for North America, which is believed to be a radioactive wasteland since the Sixty Minute War. The city is ruled by the young margravine Freya Rasmussen, who treats all three of them as honoured guests and appoints Pennyroyal as the city's chief navigator because of his past experiences (detailed in his book America the Beautiful) traveling in America. As Anchorage's harbormaster works to repair the Jenny Haniver, Hester becomes jealous of Tom's growing closeness to Freya, and is also disturbed by the sightings of \"ghosts\" in the city. Eventually she sees Tom kissing Freya, and flies away from the city in the Jenny Haniver. Thereafter, Hester sells Anchorage's course to Piotr Masgard, the leader of the \"Huntsmen\" of the Traction City of Arkangel, who intends to capture the city through an airship invasion; rather than accepting money as payment for this information, she insists that when Arkangel eats Anchorage, Tom be returned to her. As she returns to the Jenny Haniver, however, she is drugged and kidnapped by a Green Storm informant. \n\nHester is taken to Rogue's Roost, an island south of Greenland, where the Green Storm have converted Anna Fang's body into a Stalker. The commander, Sathya, hopes to restore Fang's memories by showing her Hester, but the resurrected Fang doesn't recognise her nor herself. Sathya reveals that, according to her intelligence, Hester's father was Thaddeus Valentine.\n\nTom realizes that Pennyroyal never went to America, and based his entire book on an old explorer's map in the Reykjav\u00edk library. On his way to reveal Pennyroyal's deception to the chief engineer, Tom finds out that the \"ghosts\" sighted around Anchorage are thieves, operating out of a parasitic submarine-like limpet attached to the bottom of the city, who call themselves the Lost Boys and work out of a larger group in the sunken city of Grimsby. With their secret discovered, they kidnap Tom and leave the city. Tom develops a sort of friendship with a reluctant Lost Boy, Caul, on their trip to Grimsby. Caul tells him that the city is ruled by \"Uncle\", a man who founded it as a base of thieves and keeps the Lost Boys under constant surveillance.\n\nWhen they arrive in Grimsby, Tom is taken to see Uncle, who tells him there is something valuable in Rogues' Roost which he wants Tom to steal for him. In return, Tom will have the chance to rescue Hester. Tom climbs a ladder up the rocky cliffs to infiltrate the base, but he is soon discovered and reunited with Hester in her cell. Realising that Uncle sent Tom to die as a diversion, Caul prematurely detonates the charges the Lost Boys were positioning inside the Roost, sabotaging the operation, but saving Tom and Hester. In the confusion, most of the Lost Boys make their way to the chamber where the Stalker Fang is kept, but the Stalker easily kills them all. She then pursues Tom and Hester into the island hangar where the Jenny Haniver is kept, but lets them escape when she seemingly recognises Tom, and then takes command of the Green Storm forces from Sathya.\n\nIn Grimsby, after Uncle severely beats Caul for his betrayal, then leaves him to die by hanging, and informs the younger man that he knew Anna Fang when he was younger. Fang was a slave in Arkangel, but Uncle began to love her and released her. She betrayed him by building an airship and escaping from slavery. After Uncle was disowned by his family, he built Grimsby to make sure that nobody kept a secret from him ever again. Uncle wanted to retrieve Fang from Rogue's Roost to reprogram her to become his slave. Caul is saved by fellow Lost Boy Gargle, who wanted to repay Caul's kindness to him. Gargle gives Caul the Reykjavik map that Uncle had all along, and sends him back to Anchorage on a limpet.\n\nFreya catches Pennyroyal secretly broadcasting a radio message asking for someone to come and get him off of Anchorage, and he subsequently admits to her that his claims of traveling to America were all lies. Arkangel chases Anchorage, leading to the Huntsmen led by Masgard capturing Anchorage and leaving it helpless on the ice to be eaten. Tom and Hester return to the city, where Pennyroyal has evaded capture. Hester sends Tom to hide, and later liberates the inhabitants, killing Masgard and the Hunstmen in the process. Tom confronts Pennyroyal, who knows that Hester sold Anchorage to Masgard, but doesn't tell Tom. Attempting to scare Tom off, Pennyroyal accidentally shoots Tom in the chest. He then steals the Jenny Haniver and escapes. Arkangel still pursues Anchorage, but becomes trapped over thin ice, leading Anchorage to drift on the ocean on an ice floe.\n\nWith the revelation that Pennyroyal is a fraud, the inhabitants lose hope in the salvation of their city, until Caul arrives with the Reykjavik map, and convinces them to continue. Meanwhile, Pennyroyal escapes to the Hunting Ground, and soon publishes a book reimagining the events of Anchorage's flight west, with himself as the hero and exposing the Lost Boys. Arkangel is evacuated and eventually sinks to the bottom of the ocean. In Asia, the Green Storm, under the leadership of the Stalker Fang, topples the old Anti-Traction League. Anchorage eventually makes it to North America, and finds it verdant and lush. Tom recovers from his wound, but is still very weak. Hester takes comfort in the knowledge that the city will be secret and safe in this new land, and is pleased to discover that she is pregnant.\n\n===Infernal Devices===\n{{Main|Infernal Devices (Reeve)}}\nSixteen years after the events of Predator's Gold, the former ice city of Anchorage has settled on an island in North America unaffected by the fallout from the Sixty Minute War and has become a static city named Anchorage-in-Vineland. Most of the inhabitants are happy with their new life, but Wren Natsworthy, the teenage daughter of Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw, is bored with her life and seeks adventure.\n\nWhen she sneaks out one night Wren encounters three Lost Boys, Remora, Fishcake and their older leader Gargle; who have come to Anchorage in search of a mysterious Rasmussen family artifact named the Tin Book. The Book, bearing the insignia of the President of the United States of America, contains the activation codes for the final remaining orbital weapons left over from the Sixty Minute War; potentially with firepower far greater than that of MEDUSA, which destroyed the Traction City of London in Mortal Engines. After meeting former Lost Boy now Anchorage resident Caul, who refuses to help him, Gargle persuades Wren to retrieve the Tin Book for him and to join them on their journeys around the world.\n\nWren begins her mission by asking the now-adult margravine Freya Rasmussen, knowing that the Book is in the palace's library. Freya tells Wren of the Book's origins but explains that no one knows its purpose or meaning. When Wren reports to Gargle he tells her that Nimrod Pennyroyal's book about the time he spent in Anchorage has revealed the Lost Boys' existence to the raft cities that they previously robbed. As a result, the Lost Boys have been forced to loot cities further afield, but most of the Lost Boys' limpets never return. Gargle explains that raft cities have also begun searching for Grimsby and claims the Tin Book contains information that could get the sunken city moving again; but in actuality he intends to sell it to Stalker Fang for protection.\n\nUnaware of Gargle's true intentions, Wren steals the Book and gives it to him, whilst Caul alerts to Tom and Hester that Wren is missing. Hester finds the limpet and, believing that Wren is in danger, shoots and kills Gargle and Remora. Fishcake, devastated by the death of his comrades, kidnaps Wren with the intention of taking her to Grimsby. En route to the sunken city, Fishcake receives a communication from the raft resort of Brighton, claiming that the parents of kidnapped Lost Boys have united to track down their missing children. Fishcake, believing that he will be reunited with his parents and persuaded by Wren who believes her best chance of escape is there, changes course to Brighton.\n\nArriving at the raft-city pleasure resort, the pair's limpet is captured and the two are taken in as slaves, the communication being a ruse to stop the Lost Boys. The owner of the slave trade company, Nabisco Skhin, intends to sell the two to Traction Cities in Nuevo Maya, but Wren convinces him to give them to Pennyroyal, who is now Mayor of Brighton; due to Wren's knowledge of Anchorage (and thus can expose Pennyroyal's lies). Skhin interrogates Fishcake, who reveals the location of Grimsby, prompting Brighton to change course and destroy it with depth charges. Skhin takes Wren up to Pennyroyal's floating palace above Brighton, Cloud 9. The slave-owner attempts to extort a hefty sum from Pennyroyal for Wren and to have the truth silenced, but Wren suddenly claims that she is a Lost Girl and has never been to Anchorage. She gives Pennyroyal the Tin Book and is employed in his household, to serve as a handmaiden for his overbearing wife Boo-Boo. Skhin, angered by Wren's lie, employs Fishcake to lead him to Anchorage and to enslave everyone there.\n\nTom and Hester take an old limpet with Caul and Freya to Grimsby to save Wren. When they arrive, they find the wreckage of the sunk city and the bodies of many Lost Boys. The four meet Uncle in his chamber, who informs them that Gargle's limpet hasn't returned and that Wren is likely in Brighton. Uncle seemingly wins Caul back to the Lost Boys, who locks Tom, Hester and Freya up; but Caul later frees them when Uncle is asleep. Uncle eventually discovers them, but is killed when he shoots the balloon holding his monitoring screens and they collapse on him. Tom and Hester take Caul's old limpet to find Wren, whilst Caul and Freya take the remaining Lost Boys back to Anchorage where the pair marry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stalker Shrike, who was seemingly killed by Tom in Mortal Engines is 're-resurrected' to mark the Stalker Fang's birthday by Dr. Oenone Zero; albeit with his previous memories wiped. Zero is promoted to Fang's Surgeon-Mechanic, though she intends to assassinate the Stalker as revenge for her aviator brother Eno being resurrected into a Stalker. Fang has the Green Storm armies extend their borders via bombing and destroying Traction Cities, starting a war with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Zero is followed by Shrike to a Christian chapel, where she confides aloud that she will kill the Stalker Fang with a mysterious weapon. He prepares to kill her, but cannot bring himself to, nor alert the authorities of her treachery. Shrike realises that Zero has implemented a barrier that disables him from betraying her; but he intends to stop her from assassinating Fang. \n\nWren makes friends with fellow slave Cynthia Twite and another young African slave, Theo Ngoni, who used to be a Green Storm kamikaze aviator that was captured. Wren plots to escape on Pennyroyal's private sky-yacht the Peewit by enlisting Theo's help, but he refuses. Skhin meets with Pennyroyal's advisor on Old-Tech, Walter Plovery, who explains what the Tin Book contains and orders him to retrieve it for him. The Moon Festival, a time when no city hunts nor eats each other, arrives as Brighton meets a few other cities on the shores of Africa. Plovery is invited to a dinner-party held by Pennyroyal and breaks into the Mayor's office, but is killed by an intruder. Wren and Theo are nearly arrested by Pennyroyal, as she tricked Cloud 9 aviators to refuel the Peewit, but Boo-Boo saves them, falsely believing that Wren and Theo are in love.\n\nTom and Hester arrive in Brighton, and split up to search for Wren. Hester discovers Pennyroyal's corrupted version of the events of Predator's Gold, including that she sold Anchorage to Arkangel and the renamed exhibited Jenny Haniver. Tom meets with Skhin to negotiate Wren's release but is captured. Skhin plans to use Tom and Wren to expose Pennyroyal is a fraud and retrieve the Tin Book to sell off to the highest bidder. Told by Tom via a note that he was going to the Pepperpot, Skhin's base of operations, Hester plans to release the slaves inside to create a panic.\n\nAt the Moon Festival, Skhin confronts Wren and asks her to fetch the Tin Book for him. Wren manages to get Theo's help and discovers a Green Storm Stalker-bird inside the safe. Destroying it and taking the Tin Book, the pair discover that Cloud 9 has been set adrift and that a Green Storm airship is heading toward Brighton. Hester breaks into the Pepperpot and releases the Lost Boy slaves. Fishcake visits Tom in his cell and tells him that Wren is on Cloud 9, and Tom promises to take Fishcake away to live in Anchorage. Tom and Fishcake meet Hester, who kills Skhin's men in the pandemonium.\n\nZero discovers the Stalker Fang has commanded General Naga, the Green Storm's second-in-command, to destroy Brighton. On board the Requiem Vortex, Fang's personal ship, Shrike finds out that Fang covets the Tin Book, after reading about Anchorage when she wanted to know more about Tom, whom she met at Rogue's Roost in Predator's Gold. Wren discovers that Cynthia is a Green Storm agent, that she killed Plovery, installed the Stalker-bird in the safe and set Cloud 9 adrift; she explains that the Tin Book will help the Green Storm win the war against the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Cynthia takes the Tin Book and holds them at gunpoint, but the two are saved by Pennyroyal who knocks Cynthia out. Making their way to the Peewit, they discover Skhin attempting to escape Brighton inside it. Skhin shoots Pennyroyal, seemingly takes the Tin Book and makes off on the Peewit, but the airship is destroyed by Stalker-birds.\n\nWren and Theo had tricked Skhin into taking a decoy, but are captured by Naga and brought before Fang. Fang takes the Book and memorizes the codes. Zero interrogates the pair, who explain to her what the Book contains. Knowing that Fang will kill thousands with it, Zero commands Shrike to kill Fang; he realises that he is the weapon she spoke of. Shrike manages to seemingly destroy Fang, scattering her battered pieces across the coastline of Africa. Suddenly remembering Hester, Shrike escapes from Naga. As Cloud 9 begins to burn and descend, the Tin Book's pages begin to blacken.\n\nTom and Hester recover the Jenny Haniver, but Hester leaves Fishcake behind as revenge for taking Wren, despite Tom's pleas to go back for him. Wren and Theo discover Pennyroyal survived his wounds and take him with them as they try to escape. Zero also attempts to escape but is blocked by Naga. Secretly disgusted by Fang's actions in the war and wasting men, Naga commends Zero for orchestrating the Stalker's demise and takes control of the Green Storm. Naga takes Zero and the passengers from Cloud 9 on board the Requiem Vortex and leave.\n\nPennyroyal tells Wren that Hester sold Anchorage to Arkangel, one of the few elements of his book that was true, but she doesn't believe him. Tom and Hester finds the three, but Hester attempts to kill Pennyroyal to make sure that her crime to Anchorage isn't discovered, but Wren tells Tom about what she did to stop her. Hester flees into the burning wreckage of Cloud 9 in despair, where Shrike finds her. Tom, Wren, Theo and Pennyroyal escape in the Jenny Haniver, as Cloud 9 finally collapses onto the African shore. As scavenger towns arrive, Shrike takes Hester's unconscious body into the nearby Sahara Desert.\n\nFishcake, escaping from the Lost Boys, swims to the African coast. Wandering alone on the dunes, he encounters the remains of the Stalker Fang, who asks him to rebuild her, which he agrees to. \n\n===A Darkling Plain===\n{{Main|A Darkling Plain}}\nSix months after the events of Infernal Devices, General Naga, the now-leader of the Green Storm after the supposed demise of the Stalker Fang, has formed a truce with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, blossoming a new era of trade and peace.\n\nTheo Ngoni, returning to his home of Zagwa and reuniting with his family, foils an assassination attempt on Oenone Zero, who is married to General Naga and has taken the title of Lady Naga. Zero was in Zagwa to facilitate peace terms with Zagwa and the Green Storm; and suspects that the attempt was made by Green Storm soldiers still loyal to the Stalker Fang. Due to the possibility of another attempt, Zero has an incognito merchant airship prepared that will take her an alternate route to Naga. As Theo saved her life, Zero wants him to accompany her; Theo agrees, hopeful that he might meet Wren. En route, Zero's servant Rohini is revealed to be Cynthia Twite, a Green Storm spy who survived the events of Infernal Devices, and attempts to kill her, but Theo intervenes. Cynthia escapes and downs the airship. The pair survive the crash, but Zero is captured by air-trader Napster Varley who plans to sell her to the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft; whilst Theo is saved from slavers by Hester Shaw and the Stalker Shrike, who is unable to kill due to Zero's tampering. After Theo informs them of Zero's capture, Hester and Shrike decide to find her, as Zero will be able to reverse Shrike's \"barrier\" she implemented.\n\nCynthia reaches Naga's base in Tienjing and lies to him that Zero was killed by the Zagwans, though Naga refuses to take action against Tractionists. Cynthia manages to weasle her way to serve in Naga's household.\n\nIn the Traction City of Peripatetiapolis, Tom Natsworthy discovers that the bullet that Nimrod Pennyroyal shot him with in Predator's Gold has damaged his heart and he has not long to live, though he doesn't tell his daughter Wren. Tom soon discovers a woman that resembles Clytie Potts, a London Apprentice Historian that he knew. When questioned, she tells him that her name is Cruwys Morchard and that she is transporting Old-Tech devices. Unconvinced, Tom and Wren decide to pursue her, travelling on the Jenny Haniver to Murnau, a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft city, where they meet Wolf von Kobold, the son of the Mayor of Murnau and commander of the traction city Harrowbarrow. Wolf believes that the survivors of MEDUSA may be still inside London, and the three agree to make an expedition to London.\n\nTom and Wren meet Wolf on Harrowbarrow, a burrowing Traction City, which takes them closer to London. With Wolf accompanying them, they fly the Jenny Haniver over the Green Storm border, and finally reaching the debris field of London. There they discover that the survivors of MEDUSA have rebuilt a society in London, led by Tom's old boss and now Mayor Chudleigh Pomeroy. Garamond, the paranoid head of security, convinces Pomeroy to keep them there as he suspects that they may inform others of London's survival. Tom, Wren and Wolf eventually discover a new traction town being rebuilt near the ruins, a project that was in-progress long before Magnus Crome decided to use MEDUSA. Noticing that \"New London\" has no wheels, the leading Engineer Dr. Childermass explains that it uses Magnetic Levitation to float above the ground, making it less harmful to the environment. Wolf slips away from the conversation and escapes back to Harrowbarrow, intent on devouring New London and to use the technology to make his city better.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Lost Boy Fishcake has partially rebuilt the Stalker Fang in Cairo. The Stalker Fang often malfunctions, alternating in personality between the kind and supportive Anna-side and the cold and merciless Stalker-side. Fishcake informs Fang that Cairo is stopping to trade with Lost Boy-ruled Brighton where they steal a limpet and make their way to the state of Shan Guo, where the Stalker will do something \"important\".\n\nWalking the rest of the way by foot, Fishcake and Fang stops at a hermitage, that is inhabited by Sathya, an exiled commander of the Green Storm and an old friend to Anna. The Anna-side of the Stalker doesn't wish to harm Sathya, and wants former London Engineer Dr. Popjoy, who resurrected her in Predator's Gold to eliminate the Stalker-side. Despite protestations, Fishcake accompanies her to Batmunkh Gompa. However, before meeting Popjoy, the Stalker-side returns and demands that he remove the Anna-side. Popjoy explains to her that the brain he fitted her with in Rogue's Roost was from a much older model he found in the Arctic and that it was from a \"Remembering Machine\" that helped to keep a nomad culture alive. When Popjoy discovers that the Stalker Fang will reactivate ODIN (standing for Orbital Defence Initiative), an orbital weapon with firepower similar to MEDUSA, he protests; but the Stalker kills him. The Stalker Fang takes Fishcake with her to Erdene Tezh, her old home.\n\nNapster Varely arrives in Airhaven, which is floating above the Traktionstadtgesellschaft, and unsuccessfully attempts to sell Zero to Wolf's father Kriegsmarschall von Kobold. Hester, Theo and Shrike arrive at the floating city and attempt to buy her from Varley, who asks for an extortionate price which they cannot pay. Hester and Theo discover Pennyroyal hiding in Airhaven in disgrace and debt after a newspaper exposed him as a fraud. Hester takes what remains of his money and heads to Varley's ship to buy Zero, with Theo accidentally mentioning to Pennyroyal about Zero being alive. With this knowledge and seeking to reclaim fame, Pennyroyal rounds up men from Manchester and marches to Varley's ship. Discovering a photograph of Zero that Varley placed on him, von Kobold attempts to rescue her to make further peace with Naga.\n\nHester's attempt to cheat Varley is discovered and he attacks her, but his abused wife kills him. As Hester and Zero make their way back, von Kobold finds them and helps them. Pennyroyal arrives with the Manchester men and a fight ensues where von Kobold is shot, but survives via his Old-Tech armour. Shrike manages to scare them away and gets Hester and Zero to their airship the Shadow Aspect and escape. Pennyroyal gets into an altercation with a journalist and falls from Airhaven and is assumed dead, but lands in the rigging of the Shadow Aspect. Stalker-birds arrive but escort the airship to a Green Storm air base where they are hailed as heroes. The base is soon attacked by the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft and Harrowbarrow. All escape in an airship heading east except Theo who stays behind to retrieve a letter that Wren sent him, but is seemingly killed by a bomb shell.\n\nWolf returns to Harrowbarrow and meets with von Kobold and the Mayor of Manchester Adlai Browne. With support from other Traktionstadtsgesellschaft cities, Browne intends to destroy the Green Storm, despite von Kobold wanting peace. In Tienjing, Naga is informed of the Green Storm air base being attacked but does nothing, disheartened by Zero's supposed death. Cynthia has been poisoning his green tea to make him helpless further and fanatically believes that the Stalker Fang will return.\n\nFishcake and the Stalker Fang, whose personalities seem to be merged, steal Popjoy's air yacht and reach Erdene Tezh and her old home. Inside, she starts to create a device which will relay orders to ODIN.\n\nTheo survives the attack on the airfield and treks east across the plains toward London, where Wren's letter told him she would be; whilst the surviving Green Storm soldiers are transported off to Forward Command, an old traction city where Hester, Shrike and Zero were taken. Theo eventually reaches New London and is reunited with Wren, as well as warning the residents that the war between the Green Storm and the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft has restarted.\n\nODIN is fired upon Manchester and other cities by the Stalker Fang, killing Browne. Orla Twombley, a pilot formerly from Brighton, observes the destruction and reports to von Kobold in Murnau, telling him and the remaining cities to retreat from a Green Storm weapon. Naga receives communication that Zero is alive, and, realising that Twite has deceived him confronts her. Twite attempts to kill him, but ODIN fires on Tienjing. Naga survives but Twite is killed instantly in the blast.\n\nThe residents of New London see the firepower of ODIN from afar, and fearing that it is a Green Storm weapon, make plans to head north when the city is finished. Tom, fearing for Wren, takes the Jenny Haniver to Tienjing, hoping to convince Naga to not use his supposed weapon. Tom leaves a letter to Wren saying his goodbyes and entrusting Theo to take care for her, admitting that he is dying. Wolf hears of Manchester's destruction and is determined to continue on to London, claiming to his underlings that Harrowbarrow's creeping nature will help them survive.\n\nHester, Shrike, Zero and Pennyroyal make their way to Batmunkh Gompa to reunite with Naga, who has been evacuated to there. They are told of the destruction of traction cities and Tienjing alike, which Shrike deduces is the work of the Stalker Fang. Zero intends to talk to Popjoy as he built the Stalker Fang and may know how to disable her for good.\n\nWren discovers Tom's letter and attempts to follow him with Theo, but they are stopped by Garamond, who believes they are Green Storm agents and are escaping to betray New London. It is revealed that Pomeroy had died in his sleep when Tom left New London and Garamond has taken his place. Garamond arrests the pair, but Childermass frees them and tells them to escape to a Green Storm settlement. It is revealed that Childermass is the mother of Bevis Pod.\n\nTom, flying the Jenny Haniver, is intercepted on his way to Tienjing and brought to Batmunkh Gompa, where he is interrogated by Naga. Tom pleads for Naga to not use the weapon on New London, but Naga mistakes him for a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft spy and disbelieves him. Hester and the others arrive in Batmunkh Gompa, where Zero discovers Popjoy is dead. When Zero meets with Naga, he accuses her of being a spy, believing that London is the master of the new weapon and that Popjoy faked his death to join them. Naga has Zero beaten and detained, then orders for their forces to attack London. Pennyroyal informs Hester and Shrike of Zero's predicament, and Hester is shakily reunited with Tom, who tells her that Theo is alive and with Wren in London. With Shrike, the pair escape on the Jenny Haniver. The Stalker Fang targets Zhan Shan, a volcano, with ODIN, triggering an eruption that will last for weeks and destroy many provinces. Tom and Hester deduce that the Stalker Fang has gone to Erdene Tezh and fly the Jenny Haniver there.\n\nWren and Theo hear Harrowbarrow approaching to devour New London. Wren boards it whilst Theo warns the Londoners of the approaching city. Wren confronts Wolf, and tricks him into diverting Harrowbarrow into an area that is full of energy left from MEDUSA. The Green Storm arrives and attacks, though Wolf continues ahead, having dealt with the Green Storm before, but Harrowbarrow is damaged by MEDUSA's left-over energy. Theo boards it and finds Wren, but Harrowbarrow starts moving again. Naga, informed of Harrowbarrow's approach, realises his error and defends New London, which finally begins to move, with Harrowbarrow in pursuit. Wolf confronts Wren and Theo on Harrowbarrow's back, but Wren accidentally kills Wolf when Naga's airship arrives and rescues them. Naga drops Wren and Theo on New London and pilots his airship straight into Harrowbarrow in a kamikaze attack, destroying the city and allowing New London to escape.\n\nOn board the Jenny Haniver, Shrike finds Pennyroyal hiding, and the three tie him up. Stalker-birds attack the airship, severely damaging it. Shrike manages to save the three from being killed, but falls out of the ship and into the mountains. The airship downs near Fang's old home, where Hester and Tom leave Pennyroyal. Fishcake, having heard the airship, confronts them and tries to kill Hester, but is stopped by the Stalker Fang. Fishcake demands she kills them, but the Stalker Fang hits him and Fishcake runs away. Tom's heart begins to strain and he collapses. The Stalker Fang, deciding not to kill them as they will all die soon enough, takes Tom into the house as Hester follows.\n\nThe Stalker Fang explains to Tom and Hester that she destroyed various traction cities and Green Storm bases to make the two sides fight each other, giving her time to send a command to ODIN. This command targets various volcanoes around the Earth, which will erupt and kill humanity in the resulting volcanic winter, but will \"make the world green again\". Fishcake finds Pennyroyal, and they plan to escape in Popjoy's sky-yacht, but need the keys around the Stalker Fang's neck. Pennyroyal finds an anti-Stalker weapon that Hester dropped and makes his way toward the house. Tom attempts to convince the Anna-side of the Stalker to destroy ODIN, and the Stalker flashes between the converging personalities. Pennyroyal suddenly enters and kills the Stalker Fang, which falls onto the ODIN transmitter and destroys it. Tom's heart strains and he collapses again, whilst Pennyroyal takes the key to the sky-yacht and attempt to bring it to them to save Tom. As Hester takes Tom outside, they see a twinkling star in the sky, and Hester realises that the Stalker Fang had ordered ODIN to destroy itself. Pennyroyal attempts to fly the sky-yacht to Tom and Hester, but is threatened by Fishcake to leave them behind as revenge for leaving him on Brighton. Hester watches the sky-yacht fly away, and she comforts Tom as he dies. Hester commits suicide shortly afterwards.\n\nZero is informed of Naga's demise, and is appointed leader of the Green Storm, which she reforms as the Anti-Traction League. She makes a treaty with von Kobold to cease fighting forever, with many traction cities subsequently becoming static. Popjoy's sky-yacht fails outside Batmunkh Gompa, and Fishcake abandons Pennyroyal, who travels back to Murnau and spends time in debtors' prison before writing a truthful account of the events he survived, titling it Ignorant Armies. However, it is never published due to his fraudulent activities, and Pennyroyal lives out the rest of his life in Peripatetiapolis with an old girlfriend. Fishcake makes his way to Sathya's hermitage, where he lives with her into adulthood and has children of his own. He comes to regret leaving Hester and Tom in Erdene Tezh, though he believes that they were resourceful enough to find a way to escape. Wren and Theo leave New London in the north a year later, and go to Zagwa to see Theo's family. When Airhaven arrives, Wren and Theo buy a new airship with Wolf's expedition money, calling it the Jenny Haniver II and become air-traders. New London thrives as it escapes predator cities and trades with anti-gravity furniture.\n\nMiles away, Shrike revives himself and arrives at Erdene Tezh too late, finding the remains of the Stalker Fang. Although her Stalker brain is dead, Shrike downloads memories from the older part of her brain. He then finds Tom and Hester's bodies, and considers taking Hester to be Resurrected, but decides against it when he sees that they held hands when they died. As he takes their bodies, Shrike recalls his own long-lost memories of his own two children (Ruan and Fern from Fever Crumb) before he was turned into a Stalker. Laying the bodies down in an outcrop nearby, Shrike shuts down and watches their bodies decompose over the years. As the years flash by him, an oak tree grows from Hester's body, and he eventually slows this time lapse when he notices human figures nearby. Finally out of his fugue state, Shrike discovers that a forest has grown round him, and meets a girl and a boy. The pair take him down into a village, where Shrike finds that he was considered an old shrine statue, and the people hung flowers around his neck for luck.\n\nThe Stalker discovers that the village has utilised Childermass\u2019 anti-gravity machines, and that he has woken hundreds, if not thousands of years into the future. When he asks if there are any traction cities in the world, the village people explain that they are thought to be fairy tales nowadays and find the idea ridiculous. When the people ask what he was for, Shrike responds that he is a \"Remembering Machine\", and is asked to tell his story.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main MEQ page  2.

Friends of Phillip Reeve are also occasionally mentioned in the books as characters; for instance 'Poskitt' is included as a god, clearly referring to [[Kjartan Poskitt]], a friend and the author of books that Reeve has illustrated in the past.\n\n* '''[[Hester Shaw]]''', a wild 15-year-old girl. She has copper hair and gray eyes.\n* '''[[Tom Natsworthy]]''', a 15-year-old boy who is an apprentice Historian at the beginning of the series. Tom eventually has many diverse adventures across the world. Tom greatly admires the head of historians, Valentine. Tom possesses the trait of having a very strong sense of curiosity.\n* '''[[Wren Natsworthy]]''', Tom and Hester's daughter who is kidnapped from their home and as a result, finds herself experiencing the same sort of adventures as her parents had. \n* '''[[Theo Ngoni]]''', an African aviator who runs away from his home to join the Green Storm, and later becomes very close to Wren. A former Green Storm tumbler pilot, now a slave aboard Brighton, he later escapes with Wren at the end of the book. They are married at the end of the quartet.\n* '''[[Nimrod Pennyroyal|Nimrod Beauregard Pennyroyal]]''', a supposed historian and author who is actually a fraud. He is selfish, narcissistic and cowardly, but has a knack for surviving dangerous experiences, and often shares adventures with the Natsworthy family. After surviving the events of A Darkling Plain, Pennyroyal writes a truthful book about what happened, but is ironically rebuffed due to his previous fraudulent actions being revealed. \n* '''[[Anna Fang]]''', an Asian pilot and former owner of the Jenny Haniver, she is also a leading agent of the Anti-Traction League. She is killed at the end of Mortal Engines but is Resurrected as the Stalker Fang, who overthrows the rulers of the League and installs herself as a military dictator.\n* '''[[Thaddeus Valentine]]''', a dashing and handsome Historian often idolised by younger Historians - though his less public image involves murder and thievery as an agent of London. He is killed in the destruction of London by MEDUSA. He is, in fact, Hester's biological father. \n* '''[[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]''' (also known in the American release of the series as '''Grike'''), an ancient Stalker who raised Hester after her parents were killed.\n* '''Katherine Valentine''', Thaddeus Valentine's daughter. After uncovering her father's dark secret, she attempts to stop him with help from Bevis Pod and the Guild of Historians. She is accidentally killed by Thaddeus shortly before the destruction of MEDUSA and London.\n\n==Traction Cities==\nSome Traction Cities bear present-day names, but some, such as Airhaven and Motoropolis, are invented. All Traction Cities consist of several 'tiers' fixed to a huge hull containing engine rooms, storage hangars, and a large 'gut' where captured towns are dismantled. At the sides are enormous tracks or wheels; and huge hydraulic 'jaws' at the bows to capture smaller towns. Various names are given below:\n\n* [[Bayreuth]]\n* [[Benghazi]]\n* [[Brighton]]\n* [[Speedwell, Bristol|Speedwell]]\n* [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]\n* [[Arkhangelsk|Arkangel]]\n* [[Anchorage]]\n* [[Airhaven]]\n* [[Cairo]]\n* [[Kom Ombo]]\n* [[London]]\n* [[Manchester]]\n* Salthook\n* [[Helsinki]]\n* Peripatetiopolis\n\n==Airship names==\nAirships in the quartet carry unusual or quirky names reminiscent of the style of the names of ships in [[Iain M. Banks]]' [[Culture series]].\n\n* ''[[Jenny Haniver]]'' \u2013 a dried-out skate or ray resembling a demon (this ship is later renamed the ''[[Arctic Roll]]'')\n* ''13th Floor Elevator'' \u2013 from the band of [[13th floor elevators|similar name]]\n* ''Invisible Worm'' \u2013 a reference to [[William Blake]]'s poem, [[The Sick Rose]]\n* ''Aerymouse'' \u2013 archaic name for a [[bat]]\n* ''[[Idiot Wind]]'' \u2013 a [[Bob Dylan]] song on the album [[Blood on the Tracks]]\n* ''[[My Sharona|My Shirona]]'' \u2013 from the hit single by [[The Knack]]\n* ''[[Mokele Mbembe]]'' \u2013 a cryptozoological creature of the Congo Basin\n* ''Garden Aeroplane Trap'' \u2013 a surrealist painting by [[Max Ernst]]\n* '' [[Zaynab (name)|Zainab]]'' \u2013 several women in Islamic history\n* ''Group Captain Mandrake'' \u2013 One of the main characters in the film [[Dr. Strangelove]]\n* ''[[Clear-air turbulence|Clear Air Turbulence]]'' \u2013 also the name of a 1976 [[Clear Air Turbulence (album)|album]] by Ian Gillan and a ship in ''[[Consider Phlebas]]''\n* ''Temporary Blip''\n* ''Plum Blossom Spring''\n* ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des Jungen Werther]]''\n* ''[[Shadow (psychology)|Shadow Aspect]]''\n* ''[[The Protection of the Mother of God|Protecting Veil]]''\n* ''[[Hungry ghost|Hungry Ghost]]''\n* ''Combat Wombat''\n\n==ODIN/MEDUSA==\nThe ''Orbital Defence Initiative'' (abbreviated ''ODIN'') is an orbital satellite weapon; a very powerful remnant of the Sixty Minute War and a major feature of the third and fourth books in the series: ''[[Infernal Devices (Reeve)|Infernal Devices]]'' and ''[[A Darkling Plain]]''. It was built as part of the [[arms race]] between the [[American imperialism|American Empire]] and [[Greater China]]. It and MEDUSA are the only superweapons known to have survived until the events of the series, although there are several references to other orbital superweapons (Diamond Bat, Jinju 14, and the Nine Sisters, for example). ODIN is more powerful than MEDUSA and is able to hit any target on the surface of the earth. ODIN is an American satellite, as the code for controlling the satellite comes off an American submarine, and it briefly searches for the American cities it was placed in orbit to defend after it is reawakened by the Stalker Fang. The other orbital weapons are hinted to have broken up over time and fallen from the sky.\n\nODIN is an energy weapon that converts a small nuclear bomb into a directed incinerating beam (a weapon concept similar to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]'s [[Project Excalibur]]). This has the power to exterminate cities (both traction and static) and provoke volcanic eruptions. Its beam can be seen for very long distances and seems to interfere with the mechanical minds of Stalkers. Only [[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]'s Old-Tech Stalker brain has the mettle to withstand this, although he goes into a fit-like state and it is hinted he is saved by Dr [[Oenone Zero]]. [[Anna Fang]] is unaffected. Other Stalkers lose all power.\n\nThe Tin Book, copied from a US Military document recovered by the refugees of the original [[Anchorage-in-Vineland|Anchorage]] from a submarine, is a codebook for controlling ODIN. It is stolen by the [[Lost Boys (Mortal Engines)|Lost Boys]] and, later, [[Brighton]]. It then falls into the hands of the Stalker Fang, who memorises its contents and then leaves it to be destroyed on Cloud&nbsp;9. It is then destroyed in a fire; when Fang is rebuilt by Fishcake, her Stalker alter-ego travels towards [[Batmunkh Gompa]] to steal parts for a transmitter with the power to reach ODIN, and then travels on Anna Fang's residence, where there is enough Old-Tech to finish the transmitter. The journey is delayed by Anna Fang's confused and caring personality. At Batmunkh Gompa the Stalker takes control until the final scene.\n\nWhen ODIN is fired, confusion ensues as both the Green Storm and Traction Cities are targeted. Both sides try to find the transmitter, leading to the Storm's assault of London, but it is [[Tom Natsworthy|Tom]], [[Hester Shaw|Hester]], Shrike, and [[Nimrod Pennyroyal|Pennyroyal]] who find Fang. As Fang prepares to target all the volcanoes on the earth and so destroy humanity, a final confrontation from Tom brings Anna to the fore once more and she orders ODIN to turn its beam weapon upon itself, destroying it completely.\n\nAs well as its immensely powerful weaponry, ODIN appears to show signs of intelligence. When it is awakened, it queries its new position and briefly searches for its old masters, and notes the vast difference in geography since its last awakening. It can also zoom in to an individual's face on the [[Earth]] and, although the picture is grainy, it is still identifiable. It can change its orbit when directed to target all over the globe. This, as well as the Stalker minds found among Old-Tech (and Shrike) seems to prove that [[robot]]s had, by the time of the Sixty Minute War, achieved sentience.\n\nMEDUSA is an Ancient superweapon that was reconstructed in London's Saint Paul's Cathedral in the events of the first book. It's alluded to being an energy beam that radiates from the weapon's firing head. Some people didn't like this as they said it was a waste, as they cannot salvage anything.\n\n==Influences==\nReeve has identified major influences on the ''Mortal Engines Quartet'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and others.\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.philip-reeve.com/books-that-inspired-mortal-engines/ | title = Ten Books That Inspired Mortal Engines | author = Philip Reeve | date = November 22, 2018 | publisher = Philip Reeve's official website | accessdate = 2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Philip Reeve - Literature | url = https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/philip-reeve | publisher = British Council Literature | accessdate = 2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nThe first volume, ''Mortal Engines'', won the 2002 Smarties Prize.

He began the first volume of the series, ''[[Mortal Engines]]'', in the 1980s, and it was published in 2001.

Also, a prequel series, ''[[Fever Crumb (series)|Fever Crumb]]'', set 600 years before the events of the Quartet, was published between 2009 and 2011.

Nations no longer exist except in the lands of the Anti-Traction League; whereas Traction Cities\u2014[[Walking City|mobile cities]] mounted on caterpillar tracks\u2014are fiercely independent [[city-states]] that use giant mechanical jaws to dismantle one another for resources. Trade is mostly accomplished by [[airship]], or between mobile cities of roughly equal size (unable to devour each other). Old-Tech (technology from before the Traction Era, some from the 21st century) is the most sought-after commodity.\n\n* '''The Great Hunting Ground''' \u2013 Consists of Europe and Northern Asia, and is the domain of the Traction Cities. It is a muddy wasteland, in which the constant movement of the cities has destroyed all vegetation. The land is identified by city-dwellers as the \"Out-Country\".\n* '''The Ice Wastes''' \u2013 New name for the [[Arctic]], wherein Traction Cities use iron runners to skate across the ice. In some places, the ice is thin, and they risk falling in the ocean.\n* '''Africa''' \u2013 Africa is split between the [[Sahara Desert]], governed by Traction Cities, and the southern regions, run by Anti-Tractionists. Areas of the southern continent include the static cities of Zagwa and Tibetsi, and the highland area known as the Mountains of the Moon.\n* '''The Dead Continent''' \u2013 North America, supposedly reduced to an irradiated wasteland by the Sixty Minute War. In ''[[Predator's Gold]]'', it is proven not to be completely dead; in the north there are forests with some animals that survived the Sixty Minute War.\n* '''Asia''' \u2013 The stronghold of the Anti-Traction League. Eastern China is evidently irradiated by the War, and the [[Himalayas]] are now the centre of civilization, where the mountains make it impossible for cities to approach.\n* '''Nuevo Maya''' \u2013 New name for South America, severed from North America when \"slow bombs\" destroyed Central America during the war. Static settlements rule the [[Andes]], but the lowlands are filled with [[ziggurat]] Traction Cities. Protagonists Tom and Hester visit Nuevo Maya between the first two books, but it is never visited in the text. Philip Reeve has said that he will explore Nuevo Maya in more detail in the future.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n* '''Antarctica''' \u2013 Mentioned only once, and evidently the domain of oil-drilling Traction Cities. Tom and Hester visit [[Antarctica]] between the first two books, but it is not described in the text.\n* '''Australia''' \u2013 Though not mentioned in the original series or [[Fever Crumb]], Philip Reeve says that he will explore places like Australia and Nuevo Maya in the future, as he never had a chance to do so in the original quartet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n* '''Anchorage-in-Vineland''' \u2013 The static and stable version of the Traction City of Anchorage, which had decided to stop wandering the Arctic wastes and settle in the green and unspoilt land of Vineland (in North America). When Anchorage was a Traction City, it was not predatory but gained its wealth by trading with other cities under more scrupulous leaders.\n\n==Title==\nThe title is a quotation from Act III, Scene iii of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Othello]]'' (\"Othello: And O you mortal engines whose rude throats/Th'immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit...\" \u2013 Line 352). It refers to the fact that the society of Municipal Darwinism is not [[sustainable living]] and that the cities' engines are indeed [[Death|mortal]].\n\n==Plot==\n===Mortal Engines===\n{{Main|Mortal Engines}}\nThe book starts with the traction city of London chasing and catching a small mining town called Salthook. Tom Natsworthy, a teenage Apprentice Historian, is sent to the \"Gut\" of London, where towns are stripped for resources, after he skips a chore. Tom incidentally meets the Head of the Guild of Historians, Thaddeus Valentine, along with his daughter, Katherine. One of Salthook's residents, teenager Hester Shaw, attempts to assassinate Valentine, but Tom interferes and chases her. She reveals a disfiguring scar on her face and claims Valentine caused it, before escaping the London police through a chute. When Tom informs Valentine of her name, Valentine pushes him down into the chute. Tom and Hester recover outside of London within the Hunting Ground, and after an argument start following the city's tracks to reboard it.\n\nThe pair eventually boards a small town called Speedwell, where the owner Orme Wreyland drugs them and plans to sell the pair as slaves for profit at a trading cluster. Tom and Hester escape from Wreyland, meeting a friendly airship pilot called Anna Fang, who takes them in her airship the Jenny Haniver to the neutral flying city of Airhaven where they can find passage to London. At Airhaven, they are then attacked by a cyborg \"Stalker\" called Shrike, who was sent after them by the London Mayor Magnus Crome to kill them and bring their bodies to him.\n\nTom and Hester escape by stealing a hot-air balloon and drift over the Hunting Ground. Hester reveals that when she was a child, her parents were killed by Valentine as they would not give up an Ancient machine. Valentine then injured her and believed that she was dead. Hester escaped, and Shrike took care of her for most of her childhood. Despite the fact that Shrike was not supposed to have feelings, he developed a fatherlike bond with her. Wanting to avenge her parents, Hester left Shrike despite his pleas for her to stay and travelled to London. Shrike followed her, reaching London first, but was captured by Crome and used to create more Stalkers for London.\n\nHester sees that a London-built scoutship is following them and lowers the balloon onto the Hunting Ground. The scoutship, with Shrike on board, finds the pair and the Stalker confronts them. Before he can explain why he wants Hester to die, two chasing towns run over him, and Tom and Hester manage to board the second of these, a pirate town called Tunbridge Wheels. The mayor, Chrysler Peavy, who knows Hester from her days with Shrike, frees Tom as he is a resident of London and Peavy wishes to learn etiquette worthy of a Londoner gentleman. Tom convinces him to free Hester, and Peavy informs them that he plans to consume the downed Airhaven. While charging at it over shallow water, Tunbridge Wheels beaches on a coral reef, sinking it whilst the survivors escape inland with Tom and Hester. Whilst attempting to feebly retake Airhaven, Peavy gets stuck in a bog and his pirate subordinates shoot him, then attempt to execute Tom and Hester, but Shrike intervenes and kills the remaining pirates. Shrike explains to Hester that Crome had agreed to resurrect her as a Stalker similar to him after he brings back her body. She agrees to this, but Tom intervenes by stabbing Shrike in the eye, shutting him down and saving her life.\n\nValentine is sent away by Crome on a \"secret mission\", much to Katherine's dismay. Suspicious of her father, Katherine begins investigating events in London with the help of Apprentice Engineer Bevis Pod, whom she befriends after discovering he witnessed Tom chasing Hester. They discover that Valentine salvaged a monstrous ancient weapon called MEDUSA for London, and that the Guild of Engineers have reassembled it inside St Paul's Cathedral. The Cathedral's dome splits open to reveal MEDUSA, which is then used to destroy a much larger city pursuing London. \n\nTom and Hester are rescued by Fang, who is revealed to be an Anti-Traction League agent, and takes them to the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa which protects the nation-state of the League. Fang suspects that the weapon that London has reassembled will be used to destroy the Shield Wall, and warns League Governor Khan of MEDUSA. Khan is skeptical that London will attack, but Fang insists that they should bomb London to destroy the weapon. Convinced that the League will kill innocent people and angry at the idea of destroying his home, Tom storms out and discovers Valentine has infiltrated Batmunkh Gompa as a monk. Tom raises the alarm, but Valentine successfully cripples the League's northern fleet of airships. Valentine duels and kills Fang by stabbing her in the neck, before escaping in his own airship the 13th Floor Elevator. Tom and Hester take the Jenny Haniver and fly it back to London in the hope of stopping Valentine and MEDUSA themselves.\n\nWith MEDUSA finally launched, Crome begins guiding London east towards the Anti-Traction League's base behind the Shield Wall of Batmunkh Gompa in order to destroy their defenses and devour all of their settlements. After Valentine returns, Katherine learns that MEDUSA was originally found by Hester's mother Pandora, and that he had killed her to steal it for London. He also admits that Katherine was likely Hester's half sister. Disillusioned, and horrified by the destructive power of the weapon, Katherine and Bevis conspire to plant a bomb to destroy MEDUSA, but are caught in their attempt.\n\nThe Guild of Historians, led by Tom's boss Chudleigh Pomeroy, come to their aid, and battle with the Engineers. Katherine travels up to the Top Tier to Saint Paul's Cathedral, with Bevis disguised as her captor. Tom and Hester arrive, and Hester attempts to fight her way to Valentine to avenge her parents. Tom is attacked by the 13th Floor Elevator above London and shoots it down. Bevis is killed when the airship crushes him, but Katherine is able to reach Saint Paul's Cathedral. Inside, she sees Hester brought before Valentine. When he attempts to kill her, Katherine jumps in her father's way and is fatally wounded. She falls onto a keyboard, interrupting the firing sequence of MEDUSA, and causing it to malfunction. Valentine and Hester, briefly putting aside their differences, try to take Katherine to Tom to get help, but she dies before they can reach him.\n\nHester leaves with Tom in the airship, while Valentine chooses to stay behind in London. MEDUSA finally misfires, obliterating most of the city and killing Valentine. Hester tries to comfort a grief-stricken Tom as they fly away in the Jenny Haniver, apparently the only survivors of the incident, and make their way to the Bird Roads. \n\n===Predator's Gold===\n{{Main|Predator's Gold}}\nTom and Hester meet adventurer and author Nimrod Pennyroyal aboard Airhaven, who persuades them to take him as a passenger. They are soon pursued by airships of the Green Storm, a fanatical splinter group of the Anti-Traction League, who want the Jenny Haniver as they believe it was stolen from their deceased leader and friend to Tom and Hester, Anna Fang. Despite evading the airships, the Jenny Haniver is damaged and drifts helplessly over the Ice Wastes. They are rescued by Anchorage, which was once a thriving Traction City that relied primarily upon trade, but had recently been devastated by an excavated biological weapon that killed most of the inhabitants. The survivors have set a course for North America, which is believed to be a radioactive wasteland since the Sixty Minute War. The city is ruled by the young margravine Freya Rasmussen, who treats all three of them as honoured guests and appoints Pennyroyal as the city's chief navigator because of his past experiences (detailed in his book America the Beautiful) traveling in America. As Anchorage's harbormaster works to repair the Jenny Haniver, Hester becomes jealous of Tom's growing closeness to Freya, and is also disturbed by the sightings of \"ghosts\" in the city. Eventually she sees Tom kissing Freya, and flies away from the city in the Jenny Haniver. Thereafter, Hester sells Anchorage's course to Piotr Masgard, the leader of the \"Huntsmen\" of the Traction City of Arkangel, who intends to capture the city through an airship invasion; rather than accepting money as payment for this information, she insists that when Arkangel eats Anchorage, Tom be returned to her. As she returns to the Jenny Haniver, however, she is drugged and kidnapped by a Green Storm informant. \n\nHester is taken to Rogue's Roost, an island south of Greenland, where the Green Storm have converted Anna Fang's body into a Stalker. The commander, Sathya, hopes to restore Fang's memories by showing her Hester, but the resurrected Fang doesn't recognise her nor herself. Sathya reveals that, according to her intelligence, Hester's father was Thaddeus Valentine.\n\nTom realizes that Pennyroyal never went to America, and based his entire book on an old explorer's map in the Reykjav\u00edk library. On his way to reveal Pennyroyal's deception to the chief engineer, Tom finds out that the \"ghosts\" sighted around Anchorage are thieves, operating out of a parasitic submarine-like limpet attached to the bottom of the city, who call themselves the Lost Boys and work out of a larger group in the sunken city of Grimsby. With their secret discovered, they kidnap Tom and leave the city. Tom develops a sort of friendship with a reluctant Lost Boy, Caul, on their trip to Grimsby. Caul tells him that the city is ruled by \"Uncle\", a man who founded it as a base of thieves and keeps the Lost Boys under constant surveillance.\n\nWhen they arrive in Grimsby, Tom is taken to see Uncle, who tells him there is something valuable in Rogues' Roost which he wants Tom to steal for him. In return, Tom will have the chance to rescue Hester. Tom climbs a ladder up the rocky cliffs to infiltrate the base, but he is soon discovered and reunited with Hester in her cell. Realising that Uncle sent Tom to die as a diversion, Caul prematurely detonates the charges the Lost Boys were positioning inside the Roost, sabotaging the operation, but saving Tom and Hester. In the confusion, most of the Lost Boys make their way to the chamber where the Stalker Fang is kept, but the Stalker easily kills them all. She then pursues Tom and Hester into the island hangar where the Jenny Haniver is kept, but lets them escape when she seemingly recognises Tom, and then takes command of the Green Storm forces from Sathya.\n\nIn Grimsby, after Uncle severely beats Caul for his betrayal, then leaves him to die by hanging, and informs the younger man that he knew Anna Fang when he was younger. Fang was a slave in Arkangel, but Uncle began to love her and released her. She betrayed him by building an airship and escaping from slavery. After Uncle was disowned by his family, he built Grimsby to make sure that nobody kept a secret from him ever again. Uncle wanted to retrieve Fang from Rogue's Roost to reprogram her to become his slave. Caul is saved by fellow Lost Boy Gargle, who wanted to repay Caul's kindness to him. Gargle gives Caul the Reykjavik map that Uncle had all along, and sends him back to Anchorage on a limpet.\n\nFreya catches Pennyroyal secretly broadcasting a radio message asking for someone to come and get him off of Anchorage, and he subsequently admits to her that his claims of traveling to America were all lies. Arkangel chases Anchorage, leading to the Huntsmen led by Masgard capturing Anchorage and leaving it helpless on the ice to be eaten. Tom and Hester return to the city, where Pennyroyal has evaded capture. Hester sends Tom to hide, and later liberates the inhabitants, killing Masgard and the Hunstmen in the process. Tom confronts Pennyroyal, who knows that Hester sold Anchorage to Masgard, but doesn't tell Tom. Attempting to scare Tom off, Pennyroyal accidentally shoots Tom in the chest. He then steals the Jenny Haniver and escapes. Arkangel still pursues Anchorage, but becomes trapped over thin ice, leading Anchorage to drift on the ocean on an ice floe.\n\nWith the revelation that Pennyroyal is a fraud, the inhabitants lose hope in the salvation of their city, until Caul arrives with the Reykjavik map, and convinces them to continue. Meanwhile, Pennyroyal escapes to the Hunting Ground, and soon publishes a book reimagining the events of Anchorage's flight west, with himself as the hero and exposing the Lost Boys. Arkangel is evacuated and eventually sinks to the bottom of the ocean. In Asia, the Green Storm, under the leadership of the Stalker Fang, topples the old Anti-Traction League. Anchorage eventually makes it to North America, and finds it verdant and lush. Tom recovers from his wound, but is still very weak. Hester takes comfort in the knowledge that the city will be secret and safe in this new land, and is pleased to discover that she is pregnant.\n\n===Infernal Devices===\n{{Main|Infernal Devices (Reeve)}}\nSixteen years after the events of Predator's Gold, the former ice city of Anchorage has settled on an island in North America unaffected by the fallout from the Sixty Minute War and has become a static city named Anchorage-in-Vineland. Most of the inhabitants are happy with their new life, but Wren Natsworthy, the teenage daughter of Tom Natsworthy and Hester Shaw, is bored with her life and seeks adventure.\n\nWhen she sneaks out one night Wren encounters three Lost Boys, Remora, Fishcake and their older leader Gargle; who have come to Anchorage in search of a mysterious Rasmussen family artifact named the Tin Book. The Book, bearing the insignia of the President of the United States of America, contains the activation codes for the final remaining orbital weapons left over from the Sixty Minute War; potentially with firepower far greater than that of MEDUSA, which destroyed the Traction City of London in Mortal Engines. After meeting former Lost Boy now Anchorage resident Caul, who refuses to help him, Gargle persuades Wren to retrieve the Tin Book for him and to join them on their journeys around the world.\n\nWren begins her mission by asking the now-adult margravine Freya Rasmussen, knowing that the Book is in the palace's library. Freya tells Wren of the Book's origins but explains that no one knows its purpose or meaning. When Wren reports to Gargle he tells her that Nimrod Pennyroyal's book about the time he spent in Anchorage has revealed the Lost Boys' existence to the raft cities that they previously robbed. As a result, the Lost Boys have been forced to loot cities further afield, but most of the Lost Boys' limpets never return. Gargle explains that raft cities have also begun searching for Grimsby and claims the Tin Book contains information that could get the sunken city moving again; but in actuality he intends to sell it to Stalker Fang for protection.\n\nUnaware of Gargle's true intentions, Wren steals the Book and gives it to him, whilst Caul alerts to Tom and Hester that Wren is missing. Hester finds the limpet and, believing that Wren is in danger, shoots and kills Gargle and Remora. Fishcake, devastated by the death of his comrades, kidnaps Wren with the intention of taking her to Grimsby. En route to the sunken city, Fishcake receives a communication from the raft resort of Brighton, claiming that the parents of kidnapped Lost Boys have united to track down their missing children. Fishcake, believing that he will be reunited with his parents and persuaded by Wren who believes her best chance of escape is there, changes course to Brighton.\n\nArriving at the raft-city pleasure resort, the pair's limpet is captured and the two are taken in as slaves, the communication being a ruse to stop the Lost Boys. The owner of the slave trade company, Nabisco Skhin, intends to sell the two to Traction Cities in Nuevo Maya, but Wren convinces him to give them to Pennyroyal, who is now Mayor of Brighton; due to Wren's knowledge of Anchorage (and thus can expose Pennyroyal's lies). Skhin interrogates Fishcake, who reveals the location of Grimsby, prompting Brighton to change course and destroy it with depth charges. Skhin takes Wren up to Pennyroyal's floating palace above Brighton, Cloud 9. The slave-owner attempts to extort a hefty sum from Pennyroyal for Wren and to have the truth silenced, but Wren suddenly claims that she is a Lost Girl and has never been to Anchorage. She gives Pennyroyal the Tin Book and is employed in his household, to serve as a handmaiden for his overbearing wife Boo-Boo. Skhin, angered by Wren's lie, employs Fishcake to lead him to Anchorage and to enslave everyone there.\n\nTom and Hester take an old limpet with Caul and Freya to Grimsby to save Wren. When they arrive, they find the wreckage of the sunk city and the bodies of many Lost Boys. The four meet Uncle in his chamber, who informs them that Gargle's limpet hasn't returned and that Wren is likely in Brighton. Uncle seemingly wins Caul back to the Lost Boys, who locks Tom, Hester and Freya up; but Caul later frees them when Uncle is asleep. Uncle eventually discovers them, but is killed when he shoots the balloon holding his monitoring screens and they collapse on him. Tom and Hester take Caul's old limpet to find Wren, whilst Caul and Freya take the remaining Lost Boys back to Anchorage where the pair marry.\n\nMeanwhile, the Stalker Shrike, who was seemingly killed by Tom in Mortal Engines is 're-resurrected' to mark the Stalker Fang's birthday by Dr. Oenone Zero; albeit with his previous memories wiped. Zero is promoted to Fang's Surgeon-Mechanic, though she intends to assassinate the Stalker as revenge for her aviator brother Eno being resurrected into a Stalker. Fang has the Green Storm armies extend their borders via bombing and destroying Traction Cities, starting a war with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Zero is followed by Shrike to a Christian chapel, where she confides aloud that she will kill the Stalker Fang with a mysterious weapon. He prepares to kill her, but cannot bring himself to, nor alert the authorities of her treachery. Shrike realises that Zero has implemented a barrier that disables him from betraying her; but he intends to stop her from assassinating Fang. \n\nWren makes friends with fellow slave Cynthia Twite and another young African slave, Theo Ngoni, who used to be a Green Storm kamikaze aviator that was captured. Wren plots to escape on Pennyroyal's private sky-yacht the Peewit by enlisting Theo's help, but he refuses. Skhin meets with Pennyroyal's advisor on Old-Tech, Walter Plovery, who explains what the Tin Book contains and orders him to retrieve it for him. The Moon Festival, a time when no city hunts nor eats each other, arrives as Brighton meets a few other cities on the shores of Africa. Plovery is invited to a dinner-party held by Pennyroyal and breaks into the Mayor's office, but is killed by an intruder. Wren and Theo are nearly arrested by Pennyroyal, as she tricked Cloud 9 aviators to refuel the Peewit, but Boo-Boo saves them, falsely believing that Wren and Theo are in love.\n\nTom and Hester arrive in Brighton, and split up to search for Wren. Hester discovers Pennyroyal's corrupted version of the events of Predator's Gold, including that she sold Anchorage to Arkangel and the renamed exhibited Jenny Haniver. Tom meets with Skhin to negotiate Wren's release but is captured. Skhin plans to use Tom and Wren to expose Pennyroyal is a fraud and retrieve the Tin Book to sell off to the highest bidder. Told by Tom via a note that he was going to the Pepperpot, Skhin's base of operations, Hester plans to release the slaves inside to create a panic.\n\nAt the Moon Festival, Skhin confronts Wren and asks her to fetch the Tin Book for him. Wren manages to get Theo's help and discovers a Green Storm Stalker-bird inside the safe. Destroying it and taking the Tin Book, the pair discover that Cloud 9 has been set adrift and that a Green Storm airship is heading toward Brighton. Hester breaks into the Pepperpot and releases the Lost Boy slaves. Fishcake visits Tom in his cell and tells him that Wren is on Cloud 9, and Tom promises to take Fishcake away to live in Anchorage. Tom and Fishcake meet Hester, who kills Skhin's men in the pandemonium.\n\nZero discovers the Stalker Fang has commanded General Naga, the Green Storm's second-in-command, to destroy Brighton. On board the Requiem Vortex, Fang's personal ship, Shrike finds out that Fang covets the Tin Book, after reading about Anchorage when she wanted to know more about Tom, whom she met at Rogue's Roost in Predator's Gold. Wren discovers that Cynthia is a Green Storm agent, that she killed Plovery, installed the Stalker-bird in the safe and set Cloud 9 adrift; she explains that the Tin Book will help the Green Storm win the war against the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft. Cynthia takes the Tin Book and holds them at gunpoint, but the two are saved by Pennyroyal who knocks Cynthia out. Making their way to the Peewit, they discover Skhin attempting to escape Brighton inside it. Skhin shoots Pennyroyal, seemingly takes the Tin Book and makes off on the Peewit, but the airship is destroyed by Stalker-birds.\n\nWren and Theo had tricked Skhin into taking a decoy, but are captured by Naga and brought before Fang. Fang takes the Book and memorizes the codes. Zero interrogates the pair, who explain to her what the Book contains. Knowing that Fang will kill thousands with it, Zero commands Shrike to kill Fang; he realises that he is the weapon she spoke of. Shrike manages to seemingly destroy Fang, scattering her battered pieces across the coastline of Africa. Suddenly remembering Hester, Shrike escapes from Naga. As Cloud 9 begins to burn and descend, the Tin Book's pages begin to blacken.\n\nTom and Hester recover the Jenny Haniver, but Hester leaves Fishcake behind as revenge for taking Wren, despite Tom's pleas to go back for him. Wren and Theo discover Pennyroyal survived his wounds and take him with them as they try to escape. Zero also attempts to escape but is blocked by Naga. Secretly disgusted by Fang's actions in the war and wasting men, Naga commends Zero for orchestrating the Stalker's demise and takes control of the Green Storm. Naga takes Zero and the passengers from Cloud 9 on board the Requiem Vortex and leave.\n\nPennyroyal tells Wren that Hester sold Anchorage to Arkangel, one of the few elements of his book that was true, but she doesn't believe him. Tom and Hester finds the three, but Hester attempts to kill Pennyroyal to make sure that her crime to Anchorage isn't discovered, but Wren tells Tom about what she did to stop her. Hester flees into the burning wreckage of Cloud 9 in despair, where Shrike finds her. Tom, Wren, Theo and Pennyroyal escape in the Jenny Haniver, as Cloud 9 finally collapses onto the African shore. As scavenger towns arrive, Shrike takes Hester's unconscious body into the nearby Sahara Desert.\n\nFishcake, escaping from the Lost Boys, swims to the African coast. Wandering alone on the dunes, he encounters the remains of the Stalker Fang, who asks him to rebuild her, which he agrees to. \n\n===A Darkling Plain===\n{{Main|A Darkling Plain}}\nSix months after the events of Infernal Devices, General Naga, the now-leader of the Green Storm after the supposed demise of the Stalker Fang, has formed a truce with the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft, blossoming a new era of trade and peace.\n\nTheo Ngoni, returning to his home of Zagwa and reuniting with his family, foils an assassination attempt on Oenone Zero, who is married to General Naga and has taken the title of Lady Naga. Zero was in Zagwa to facilitate peace terms with Zagwa and the Green Storm; and suspects that the attempt was made by Green Storm soldiers still loyal to the Stalker Fang. Due to the possibility of another attempt, Zero has an incognito merchant airship prepared that will take her an alternate route to Naga. As Theo saved her life, Zero wants him to accompany her; Theo agrees, hopeful that he might meet Wren. En route, Zero's servant Rohini is revealed to be Cynthia Twite, a Green Storm spy who survived the events of Infernal Devices, and attempts to kill her, but Theo intervenes. Cynthia escapes and downs the airship. The pair survive the crash, but Zero is captured by air-trader Napster Varley who plans to sell her to the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft; whilst Theo is saved from slavers by Hester Shaw and the Stalker Shrike, who is unable to kill due to Zero's tampering. After Theo informs them of Zero's capture, Hester and Shrike decide to find her, as Zero will be able to reverse Shrike's \"barrier\" she implemented.\n\nCynthia reaches Naga's base in Tienjing and lies to him that Zero was killed by the Zagwans, though Naga refuses to take action against Tractionists. Cynthia manages to weasle her way to serve in Naga's household.\n\nIn the Traction City of Peripatetiapolis, Tom Natsworthy discovers that the bullet that Nimrod Pennyroyal shot him with in Predator's Gold has damaged his heart and he has not long to live, though he doesn't tell his daughter Wren. Tom soon discovers a woman that resembles Clytie Potts, a London Apprentice Historian that he knew. When questioned, she tells him that her name is Cruwys Morchard and that she is transporting Old-Tech devices. Unconvinced, Tom and Wren decide to pursue her, travelling on the Jenny Haniver to Murnau, a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft city, where they meet Wolf von Kobold, the son of the Mayor of Murnau and commander of the traction city Harrowbarrow. Wolf believes that the survivors of MEDUSA may be still inside London, and the three agree to make an expedition to London.\n\nTom and Wren meet Wolf on Harrowbarrow, a burrowing Traction City, which takes them closer to London. With Wolf accompanying them, they fly the Jenny Haniver over the Green Storm border, and finally reaching the debris field of London. There they discover that the survivors of MEDUSA have rebuilt a society in London, led by Tom's old boss and now Mayor Chudleigh Pomeroy. Garamond, the paranoid head of security, convinces Pomeroy to keep them there as he suspects that they may inform others of London's survival. Tom, Wren and Wolf eventually discover a new traction town being rebuilt near the ruins, a project that was in-progress long before Magnus Crome decided to use MEDUSA. Noticing that \"New London\" has no wheels, the leading Engineer Dr. Childermass explains that it uses Magnetic Levitation to float above the ground, making it less harmful to the environment. Wolf slips away from the conversation and escapes back to Harrowbarrow, intent on devouring New London and to use the technology to make his city better.\n\nMeanwhile, the former Lost Boy Fishcake has partially rebuilt the Stalker Fang in Cairo. The Stalker Fang often malfunctions, alternating in personality between the kind and supportive Anna-side and the cold and merciless Stalker-side. Fishcake informs Fang that Cairo is stopping to trade with Lost Boy-ruled Brighton where they steal a limpet and make their way to the state of Shan Guo, where the Stalker will do something \"important\".\n\nWalking the rest of the way by foot, Fishcake and Fang stops at a hermitage, that is inhabited by Sathya, an exiled commander of the Green Storm and an old friend to Anna. The Anna-side of the Stalker doesn't wish to harm Sathya, and wants former London Engineer Dr. Popjoy, who resurrected her in Predator's Gold to eliminate the Stalker-side. Despite protestations, Fishcake accompanies her to Batmunkh Gompa. However, before meeting Popjoy, the Stalker-side returns and demands that he remove the Anna-side. Popjoy explains to her that the brain he fitted her with in Rogue's Roost was from a much older model he found in the Arctic and that it was from a \"Remembering Machine\" that helped to keep a nomad culture alive. When Popjoy discovers that the Stalker Fang will reactivate ODIN (standing for Orbital Defence Initiative), an orbital weapon with firepower similar to MEDUSA, he protests; but the Stalker kills him. The Stalker Fang takes Fishcake with her to Erdene Tezh, her old home.\n\nNapster Varely arrives in Airhaven, which is floating above the Traktionstadtgesellschaft, and unsuccessfully attempts to sell Zero to Wolf's father Kriegsmarschall von Kobold. Hester, Theo and Shrike arrive at the floating city and attempt to buy her from Varley, who asks for an extortionate price which they cannot pay. Hester and Theo discover Pennyroyal hiding in Airhaven in disgrace and debt after a newspaper exposed him as a fraud. Hester takes what remains of his money and heads to Varley's ship to buy Zero, with Theo accidentally mentioning to Pennyroyal about Zero being alive. With this knowledge and seeking to reclaim fame, Pennyroyal rounds up men from Manchester and marches to Varley's ship. Discovering a photograph of Zero that Varley placed on him, von Kobold attempts to rescue her to make further peace with Naga.\n\nHester's attempt to cheat Varley is discovered and he attacks her, but his abused wife kills him. As Hester and Zero make their way back, von Kobold finds them and helps them. Pennyroyal arrives with the Manchester men and a fight ensues where von Kobold is shot, but survives via his Old-Tech armour. Shrike manages to scare them away and gets Hester and Zero to their airship the Shadow Aspect and escape. Pennyroyal gets into an altercation with a journalist and falls from Airhaven and is assumed dead, but lands in the rigging of the Shadow Aspect. Stalker-birds arrive but escort the airship to a Green Storm air base where they are hailed as heroes. The base is soon attacked by the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft and Harrowbarrow. All escape in an airship heading east except Theo who stays behind to retrieve a letter that Wren sent him, but is seemingly killed by a bomb shell.\n\nWolf returns to Harrowbarrow and meets with von Kobold and the Mayor of Manchester Adlai Browne. With support from other Traktionstadtsgesellschaft cities, Browne intends to destroy the Green Storm, despite von Kobold wanting peace. In Tienjing, Naga is informed of the Green Storm air base being attacked but does nothing, disheartened by Zero's supposed death. Cynthia has been poisoning his green tea to make him helpless further and fanatically believes that the Stalker Fang will return.\n\nFishcake and the Stalker Fang, whose personalities seem to be merged, steal Popjoy's air yacht and reach Erdene Tezh and her old home. Inside, she starts to create a device which will relay orders to ODIN.\n\nTheo survives the attack on the airfield and treks east across the plains toward London, where Wren's letter told him she would be; whilst the surviving Green Storm soldiers are transported off to Forward Command, an old traction city where Hester, Shrike and Zero were taken. Theo eventually reaches New London and is reunited with Wren, as well as warning the residents that the war between the Green Storm and the Traktionstadtsgesellschaft has restarted.\n\nODIN is fired upon Manchester and other cities by the Stalker Fang, killing Browne. Orla Twombley, a pilot formerly from Brighton, observes the destruction and reports to von Kobold in Murnau, telling him and the remaining cities to retreat from a Green Storm weapon. Naga receives communication that Zero is alive, and, realising that Twite has deceived him confronts her. Twite attempts to kill him, but ODIN fires on Tienjing. Naga survives but Twite is killed instantly in the blast.\n\nThe residents of New London see the firepower of ODIN from afar, and fearing that it is a Green Storm weapon, make plans to head north when the city is finished. Tom, fearing for Wren, takes the Jenny Haniver to Tienjing, hoping to convince Naga to not use his supposed weapon. Tom leaves a letter to Wren saying his goodbyes and entrusting Theo to take care for her, admitting that he is dying. Wolf hears of Manchester's destruction and is determined to continue on to London, claiming to his underlings that Harrowbarrow's creeping nature will help them survive.\n\nHester, Shrike, Zero and Pennyroyal make their way to Batmunkh Gompa to reunite with Naga, who has been evacuated to there. They are told of the destruction of traction cities and Tienjing alike, which Shrike deduces is the work of the Stalker Fang. Zero intends to talk to Popjoy as he built the Stalker Fang and may know how to disable her for good.\n\nWren discovers Tom's letter and attempts to follow him with Theo, but they are stopped by Garamond, who believes they are Green Storm agents and are escaping to betray New London. It is revealed that Pomeroy had died in his sleep when Tom left New London and Garamond has taken his place. Garamond arrests the pair, but Childermass frees them and tells them to escape to a Green Storm settlement. It is revealed that Childermass is the mother of Bevis Pod.\n\nTom, flying the Jenny Haniver, is intercepted on his way to Tienjing and brought to Batmunkh Gompa, where he is interrogated by Naga. Tom pleads for Naga to not use the weapon on New London, but Naga mistakes him for a Traktionstadtsgesellschaft spy and disbelieves him. Hester and the others arrive in Batmunkh Gompa, where Zero discovers Popjoy is dead. When Zero meets with Naga, he accuses her of being a spy, believing that London is the master of the new weapon and that Popjoy faked his death to join them. Naga has Zero beaten and detained, then orders for their forces to attack London. Pennyroyal informs Hester and Shrike of Zero's predicament, and Hester is shakily reunited with Tom, who tells her that Theo is alive and with Wren in London. With Shrike, the pair escape on the Jenny Haniver. The Stalker Fang targets Zhan Shan, a volcano, with ODIN, triggering an eruption that will last for weeks and destroy many provinces. Tom and Hester deduce that the Stalker Fang has gone to Erdene Tezh and fly the Jenny Haniver there.\n\nWren and Theo hear Harrowbarrow approaching to devour New London. Wren boards it whilst Theo warns the Londoners of the approaching city. Wren confronts Wolf, and tricks him into diverting Harrowbarrow into an area that is full of energy left from MEDUSA. The Green Storm arrives and attacks, though Wolf continues ahead, having dealt with the Green Storm before, but Harrowbarrow is damaged by MEDUSA's left-over energy. Theo boards it and finds Wren, but Harrowbarrow starts moving again. Naga, informed of Harrowbarrow's approach, realises his error and defends New London, which finally begins to move, with Harrowbarrow in pursuit. Wolf confronts Wren and Theo on Harrowbarrow's back, but Wren accidentally kills Wolf when Naga's airship arrives and rescues them. Naga drops Wren and Theo on New London and pilots his airship straight into Harrowbarrow in a kamikaze attack, destroying the city and allowing New London to escape.\n\nOn board the Jenny Haniver, Shrike finds Pennyroyal hiding, and the three tie him up. Stalker-birds attack the airship, severely damaging it. Shrike manages to save the three from being killed, but falls out of the ship and into the mountains. The airship downs near Fang's old home, where Hester and Tom leave Pennyroyal. Fishcake, having heard the airship, confronts them and tries to kill Hester, but is stopped by the Stalker Fang. Fishcake demands she kills them, but the Stalker Fang hits him and Fishcake runs away. Tom's heart begins to strain and he collapses. The Stalker Fang, deciding not to kill them as they will all die soon enough, takes Tom into the house as Hester follows.\n\nThe Stalker Fang explains to Tom and Hester that she destroyed various traction cities and Green Storm bases to make the two sides fight each other, giving her time to send a command to ODIN. This command targets various volcanoes around the Earth, which will erupt and kill humanity in the resulting volcanic winter, but will \"make the world green again\". Fishcake finds Pennyroyal, and they plan to escape in Popjoy's sky-yacht, but need the keys around the Stalker Fang's neck. Pennyroyal finds an anti-Stalker weapon that Hester dropped and makes his way toward the house. Tom attempts to convince the Anna-side of the Stalker to destroy ODIN, and the Stalker flashes between the converging personalities. Pennyroyal suddenly enters and kills the Stalker Fang, which falls onto the ODIN transmitter and destroys it. Tom's heart strains and he collapses again, whilst Pennyroyal takes the key to the sky-yacht and attempt to bring it to them to save Tom. As Hester takes Tom outside, they see a twinkling star in the sky, and Hester realises that the Stalker Fang had ordered ODIN to destroy itself. Pennyroyal attempts to fly the sky-yacht to Tom and Hester, but is threatened by Fishcake to leave them behind as revenge for leaving him on Brighton. Hester watches the sky-yacht fly away, and she comforts Tom as he dies. Hester commits suicide shortly afterwards.\n\nZero is informed of Naga's demise, and is appointed leader of the Green Storm, which she reforms as the Anti-Traction League. She makes a treaty with von Kobold to cease fighting forever, with many traction cities subsequently becoming static. Popjoy's sky-yacht fails outside Batmunkh Gompa, and Fishcake abandons Pennyroyal, who travels back to Murnau and spends time in debtors' prison before writing a truthful account of the events he survived, titling it Ignorant Armies. However, it is never published due to his fraudulent activities, and Pennyroyal lives out the rest of his life in Peripatetiapolis with an old girlfriend. Fishcake makes his way to Sathya's hermitage, where he lives with her into adulthood and has children of his own. He comes to regret leaving Hester and Tom in Erdene Tezh, though he believes that they were resourceful enough to find a way to escape. Wren and Theo leave New London in the north a year later, and go to Zagwa to see Theo's family. When Airhaven arrives, Wren and Theo buy a new airship with Wolf's expedition money, calling it the Jenny Haniver II and become air-traders. New London thrives as it escapes predator cities and trades with anti-gravity furniture.\n\nMiles away, Shrike revives himself and arrives at Erdene Tezh too late, finding the remains of the Stalker Fang. Although her Stalker brain is dead, Shrike downloads memories from the older part of her brain. He then finds Tom and Hester's bodies, and considers taking Hester to be Resurrected, but decides against it when he sees that they held hands when they died. As he takes their bodies, Shrike recalls his own long-lost memories of his own two children (Ruan and Fern from Fever Crumb) before he was turned into a Stalker. Laying the bodies down in an outcrop nearby, Shrike shuts down and watches their bodies decompose over the years. As the years flash by him, an oak tree grows from Hester's body, and he eventually slows this time lapse when he notices human figures nearby. Finally out of his fugue state, Shrike discovers that a forest has grown round him, and meets a girl and a boy. The pair take him down into a village, where Shrike finds that he was considered an old shrine statue, and the people hung flowers around his neck for luck.\n\nThe Stalker discovers that the village has utilised Childermass\u2019 anti-gravity machines, and that he has woken hundreds, if not thousands of years into the future. When he asks if there are any traction cities in the world, the village people explain that they are thought to be fairy tales nowadays and find the idea ridiculous. When the people ask what he was for, Shrike responds that he is a \"Remembering Machine\", and is asked to tell his story.\n\n==Characters==\n<!-- Please remember that character information duplicates 1. on main MEQ page  2.

Entries in this list should be VERY BRIEF, with fuller exposition elsewhere. -->\n{{Main article|List of Mortal Engines Quartet and Fever Crumb characters}}\n\nA few of the people in the books are named after places in [[Devon]], where Reeve lives, including [[Chudleigh]], [[Tamerton Foliot]] and the [[River Plym]]. In the quartet, Miss Plym and Chudleigh Pomeroy are both in the Guild of Historians, and Tamarton Foliot is an \"Alternative\" historian. Both Shrike and Smew are named after birds, and Pennyroyal is named after a flower.<ref>{{Cite web\n  | last       = Jones\n  | first      = Rhys\n  | title      = An Interview with Philip Reeve\n  | website    = thirstforFiction.com\n  | url        = http://www.thirstforfiction.com/authors/philip-reeve/an-interview-with-philip-reeve\n  | accessdate = 30 October 2010 | date      = 2010-10-09\n  }}\n</ref> Many of the characters are named after ancient (in the context of the books) brands: [[Windolene]] [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]], [[Daz (detergent)|Daz]] Gravy, [[Nutella]] Eisberg, [[Napster]] Varley, and [[Nabisco]] Shkin for example. Friends of Phillip Reeve are also occasionally mentioned in the books as characters; for instance 'Poskitt' is included as a god, clearly referring to [[Kjartan Poskitt]], a friend and the author of books that Reeve has illustrated in the past.\n\n* '''[[Hester Shaw]]''', a wild 15-year-old girl. She has copper hair and gray eyes.\n* '''[[Tom Natsworthy]]''', a 15-year-old boy who is an apprentice Historian at the beginning of the series. Tom eventually has many diverse adventures across the world. Tom greatly admires the head of historians, Valentine. Tom possesses the trait of having a very strong sense of curiosity.\n* '''[[Wren Natsworthy]]''', Tom and Hester's daughter who is kidnapped from their home and as a result, finds herself experiencing the same sort of adventures as her parents had. \n* '''[[Theo Ngoni]]''', an African aviator who runs away from his home to join the Green Storm, and later becomes very close to Wren. A former Green Storm tumbler pilot, now a slave aboard Brighton, he later escapes with Wren at the end of the book. They are married at the end of the quartet.\n* '''[[Nimrod Pennyroyal|Nimrod Beauregard Pennyroyal]]''', a supposed historian and author who is actually a fraud. He is selfish, narcissistic and cowardly, but has a knack for surviving dangerous experiences, and often shares adventures with the Natsworthy family. After surviving the events of A Darkling Plain, Pennyroyal writes a truthful book about what happened, but is ironically rebuffed due to his previous fraudulent actions being revealed. \n* '''[[Anna Fang]]''', an Asian pilot and former owner of the Jenny Haniver, she is also a leading agent of the Anti-Traction League. She is killed at the end of Mortal Engines but is Resurrected as the Stalker Fang, who overthrows the rulers of the League and installs herself as a military dictator.\n* '''[[Thaddeus Valentine]]''', a dashing and handsome Historian often idolised by younger Historians - though his less public image involves murder and thievery as an agent of London. He is killed in the destruction of London by MEDUSA. He is, in fact, Hester's biological father. \n* '''[[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]''' (also known in the American release of the series as '''Grike'''), an ancient Stalker who raised Hester after her parents were killed.\n* '''Katherine Valentine''', Thaddeus Valentine's daughter. After uncovering her father's dark secret, she attempts to stop him with help from Bevis Pod and the Guild of Historians. She is accidentally killed by Thaddeus shortly before the destruction of MEDUSA and London.\n\n==Traction Cities==\nSome Traction Cities bear present-day names, but some, such as Airhaven and Motoropolis, are invented. All Traction Cities consist of several 'tiers' fixed to a huge hull containing engine rooms, storage hangars, and a large 'gut' where captured towns are dismantled. At the sides are enormous tracks or wheels; and huge hydraulic 'jaws' at the bows to capture smaller towns. Various names are given below:\n\n* [[Bayreuth]]\n* [[Benghazi]]\n* [[Brighton]]\n* [[Speedwell, Bristol|Speedwell]]\n* [[Murnau am Staffelsee|Murnau]]\n* [[Arkhangelsk|Arkangel]]\n* [[Anchorage]]\n* [[Airhaven]]\n* [[Cairo]]\n* [[Kom Ombo]]\n* [[London]]\n* [[Manchester]]\n* Salthook\n* [[Helsinki]]\n* Peripatetiopolis\n\n==Airship names==\nAirships in the quartet carry unusual or quirky names reminiscent of the style of the names of ships in [[Iain M. Banks]]' [[Culture series]].\n\n* ''[[Jenny Haniver]]'' \u2013 a dried-out skate or ray resembling a demon (this ship is later renamed the ''[[Arctic Roll]]'')\n* ''13th Floor Elevator'' \u2013 from the band of [[13th floor elevators|similar name]]\n* ''Invisible Worm'' \u2013 a reference to [[William Blake]]'s poem, [[The Sick Rose]]\n* ''Aerymouse'' \u2013 archaic name for a [[bat]]\n* ''[[Idiot Wind]]'' \u2013 a [[Bob Dylan]] song on the album [[Blood on the Tracks]]\n* ''[[My Sharona|My Shirona]]'' \u2013 from the hit single by [[The Knack]]\n* ''[[Mokele Mbembe]]'' \u2013 a cryptozoological creature of the Congo Basin\n* ''Garden Aeroplane Trap'' \u2013 a surrealist painting by [[Max Ernst]]\n* '' [[Zaynab (name)|Zainab]]'' \u2013 several women in Islamic history\n* ''Group Captain Mandrake'' \u2013 One of the main characters in the film [[Dr. Strangelove]]\n* ''[[Clear-air turbulence|Clear Air Turbulence]]'' \u2013 also the name of a 1976 [[Clear Air Turbulence (album)|album]] by Ian Gillan and a ship in ''[[Consider Phlebas]]''\n* ''Temporary Blip''\n* ''Plum Blossom Spring''\n* ''[[The Sorrows of Young Werther|Die Leiden des Jungen Werther]]''\n* ''[[Shadow (psychology)|Shadow Aspect]]''\n* ''[[The Protection of the Mother of God|Protecting Veil]]''\n* ''[[Hungry ghost|Hungry Ghost]]''\n* ''Combat Wombat''\n\n==ODIN/MEDUSA==\nThe ''Orbital Defence Initiative'' (abbreviated ''ODIN'') is an orbital satellite weapon; a very powerful remnant of the Sixty Minute War and a major feature of the third and fourth books in the series: ''[[Infernal Devices (Reeve)|Infernal Devices]]'' and ''[[A Darkling Plain]]''. It was built as part of the [[arms race]] between the [[American imperialism|American Empire]] and [[Greater China]]. It and MEDUSA are the only superweapons known to have survived until the events of the series, although there are several references to other orbital superweapons (Diamond Bat, Jinju 14, and the Nine Sisters, for example). ODIN is more powerful than MEDUSA and is able to hit any target on the surface of the earth. ODIN is an American satellite, as the code for controlling the satellite comes off an American submarine, and it briefly searches for the American cities it was placed in orbit to defend after it is reawakened by the Stalker Fang. The other orbital weapons are hinted to have broken up over time and fallen from the sky.\n\nODIN is an energy weapon that converts a small nuclear bomb into a directed incinerating beam (a weapon concept similar to the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]'s [[Project Excalibur]]). This has the power to exterminate cities (both traction and static) and provoke volcanic eruptions. Its beam can be seen for very long distances and seems to interfere with the mechanical minds of Stalkers. Only [[Shrike (Philip Reeve)|Shrike]]'s Old-Tech Stalker brain has the mettle to withstand this, although he goes into a fit-like state and it is hinted he is saved by Dr [[Oenone Zero]]. [[Anna Fang]] is unaffected. Other Stalkers lose all power.\n\nThe Tin Book, copied from a US Military document recovered by the refugees of the original [[Anchorage-in-Vineland|Anchorage]] from a submarine, is a codebook for controlling ODIN. It is stolen by the [[Lost Boys (Mortal Engines)|Lost Boys]] and, later, [[Brighton]]. It then falls into the hands of the Stalker Fang, who memorises its contents and then leaves it to be destroyed on Cloud&nbsp;9. It is then destroyed in a fire; when Fang is rebuilt by Fishcake, her Stalker alter-ego travels towards [[Batmunkh Gompa]] to steal parts for a transmitter with the power to reach ODIN, and then travels on Anna Fang's residence, where there is enough Old-Tech to finish the transmitter. The journey is delayed by Anna Fang's confused and caring personality. At Batmunkh Gompa the Stalker takes control until the final scene.\n\nWhen ODIN is fired, confusion ensues as both the Green Storm and Traction Cities are targeted. Both sides try to find the transmitter, leading to the Storm's assault of London, but it is [[Tom Natsworthy|Tom]], [[Hester Shaw|Hester]], Shrike, and [[Nimrod Pennyroyal|Pennyroyal]] who find Fang. As Fang prepares to target all the volcanoes on the earth and so destroy humanity, a final confrontation from Tom brings Anna to the fore once more and she orders ODIN to turn its beam weapon upon itself, destroying it completely.\n\nAs well as its immensely powerful weaponry, ODIN appears to show signs of intelligence. When it is awakened, it queries its new position and briefly searches for its old masters, and notes the vast difference in geography since its last awakening. It can also zoom in to an individual's face on the [[Earth]] and, although the picture is grainy, it is still identifiable. It can change its orbit when directed to target all over the globe. This, as well as the Stalker minds found among Old-Tech (and Shrike) seems to prove that [[robot]]s had, by the time of the Sixty Minute War, achieved sentience.\n\nMEDUSA is an Ancient superweapon that was reconstructed in London's Saint Paul's Cathedral in the events of the first book. It's alluded to being an energy beam that radiates from the weapon's firing head. Some people didn't like this as they said it was a waste, as they cannot salvage anything.\n\n==Influences==\nReeve has identified major influences on the ''Mortal Engines Quartet'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and others.\n<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.philip-reeve.com/books-that-inspired-mortal-engines/ | title = Ten Books That Inspired Mortal Engines | author = Philip Reeve | date = November 22, 2018 | publisher = Philip Reeve's official website | accessdate = 2019-10-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Philip Reeve - Literature | url = https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/philip-reeve | publisher = British Council Literature | accessdate = 2019-10-30}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nThe first volume, ''Mortal Engines'', won the 2002 Smarties Prize.

The IWOME also features illustrations by Amir Zand, Rob Turpin, Aedel Fahkrie and Philip Varbanov, and maps designed by Lowtuff and illustrated by Maxime Plasse.\n\n===Comic===\nPhilip Reeve has also mentioned the possibility of a comic set in the world of ''Mortal Engines''. He said that he has been discussing it with [[David Wyatt (artist)|David Wyatt]] and mentioned that a younger [[Anna Fang]] would be an interesting character to focus on.

He was known to his friends as \"Jeb\", from the initials of his given names. Stuart was a [[cavalry]] commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations. While he cultivated a cavalier image (red-lined gray cape, yellow sash, hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume, red flower in his lapel, often sporting cologne), his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army and inspired Southern morale.<ref>Donald R. Jermann, ''Civil War Battlefield Orders Gone Awry: The Written Word and Its Consequences in 13 Engagements'' (McFarland, 2012) p. 129.</ref>\n\nStuart graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1854, and served in Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army. In 1855, he married Flora Cooke. His father-in-law was the \"Father of the US Cavalry\", [[Philip St. George Cooke]]. Stuart was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and the violence of [[Bleeding Kansas]], and he participated in the capture of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. He resigned, when his home state of Virginia seceded, to serve in the Confederate Army, first under [[Stonewall Jackson]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], playing a role in all of that army's campaigns until his death.\n\nHe established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions (during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] and the [[Maryland Campaign]]) circumnavigated the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the [[northern United States|North]]. At the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson's infantry corps.\n\nStuart's most famous campaign, the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], was flawed when his long separation from Lee's army left Lee unaware of Union troop movements so that Lee was surprised and almost trapped at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Stuart received significant criticism from the Southern press as well as the proponents of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause movement]] after the war. During the 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], Union Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]'s cavalry launched an offensive to defeat Stuart, who was mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]].

Burke Davis described Flora as \"an accomplished horsewoman, and though not pretty, an effective charmer,\" to whom \"Stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle.\" <ref>Davis, p. 36.</ref> They became engaged in September, less than two months after meeting. Stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in [[Latin]], \"''[[Veni, vidi, vici|Veni, Vidi, Victus sum]]''\" (I came, I saw, I was conquered). Although a gala wedding was planned for [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], the death of Stuart's father on September 20 caused a change of plans and the marriage on November 14 was small and limited to family witnesses.<ref>Thomas, pp. 41\u201343; Davis, p. 37; Wert, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>  Their first child, a girl, had been born in 1856 but died the same day.

He was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with American Indians and the antebellum violence of [[Bleeding Kansas]]. He was wounded on July 29, 1857, while fighting at [[Solomon River]], [[Kansas]], against the [[Cheyenne]]. Col. Sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of Indian arrows. Scattering the warriors, Stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down, whom Stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol.

[[Joseph E. Johnston]]'s army as it withdrew up the [[Virginia Peninsula]] in the face of superior numbers. Stuart fought at the [[Battle of Williamsburg]], but in general the terrain and weather on the Peninsula did not lend themselves to cavalry operations. \n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=Stuart and Jackson were an unlikely pair: one outgoing, the other introverted; one flashily uniformed, the other plainly dressed; one [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] and the other [[Oliver Cromwell|Cromwell]].

Lee became commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he requested that Stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the Union army was vulnerable. Stuart set out with 1,200 troopers on the morning of June 12 and, having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable, took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the Union army, returning after 150 miles on June 15 with 165 captured Union soldiers, 260 horses and mules, and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies. His men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized Union cavalry, coincidentally commanded by his father-in-law, Col. Cooke, and their total casualties amounted to one man killed. The maneuver was a public relations sensation and Stuart was greeted with flower petals thrown in his path at Richmond. He had become as famous as Stonewall Jackson in the eyes of the Confederacy.<ref>Wert, pp. 93\u2013101; Davis, pp. 111\u201330.</ref>\n\n===Northern Virginia===\n[[File:JEBStuart.jpg|thumb|CSA Cavalry General J.E.B.

Stuart ordered Brig. Gen. [[Beverly Robertson]]'s brigade to pursue the Federals and in a sharp fight against Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]]'s brigade, Col. [[Thomas T. Munford]]'s [[2nd Virginia Cavalry]] was overwhelmed until Stuart sent in two more regiments as reinforcements. Buford's men, many of whom were new to combat, retreated across Lewis's Ford and Stuart's troopers captured over 300 of them.

He bears some responsibility for Robert E. Lee's lack of knowledge of the position and celerity of the pursuing Army of the Potomac under George B. McClellan. For a five-day period, Stuart rested his men and entertained local civilians at a gala ball at [[Urbana, Maryland]]. His reports make no reference to intelligence gathering by his scouts or patrols.<ref>Wert, p. 144.</ref> As the Union Army drew near to Lee's divided army, Stuart's men skirmished at various points on the approach to [[Frederick, Maryland|Frederick]] and Stuart was not able to keep his brigades concentrated enough to resist the oncoming tide. He misjudged the Union routes of advance, ignorant of the Union force threatening Turner's Gap, and required assistance from the infantry of Maj. Gen. [[Daniel Harvey Hill|D.H.

By mid-afternoon, Stonewall Jackson ordered Stuart to command a turning movement with his cavalry against the Union right flank and rear, which if successful would be followed up by an infantry attack from the West Woods. Stuart began probing the Union lines with more artillery barrages, which were answered with \"murderous\" counterbattery fire and the cavalry movement intended by Jackson was never launched.<ref>Wert, pp. 156\u201358; Davis, pp. 205\u201306.</ref>\n\nThree weeks after Lee's army had withdrawn back to Virginia, on October 10\u201312, 1862, Stuart performed another of his audacious circumnavigations of the Army of the Potomac, his [[Chambersburg Raid]]\u2014126 miles in under 60 hours, from [[Darkesville, West Virginia]] to as far north as [[Mercersburg]], Pennsylvania and [[Chambersburg, Pennsylvania|Chambersburg]] and around to the east through [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]] and south through [[Hyattstown, Maryland]] and [[White's Ferry|White's Ford]] to [[Leesburg, Virginia]]\u2014once again embarrassing his Union opponents and seizing horses and supplies, but at the expense of exhausted men and animals, without gaining much military advantage.

As Lee began moving to counter this, Stuart screened Longstreet's Corps and skirmished numerous times in early November against Union cavalry and infantry around [[Mountville, Virginia|Mountville]], [[Aldie, Virginia|Aldie]], and [[Upperville, Virginia|Upperville]]. On November 6, Stuart received sad news by telegram that his daughter Flora had died just before her fifth birthday of [[typhoid fever]] on November 3.<ref>Wert, pp. 179\u201383.</ref>\n\n===Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville===\n[[File:Stuart's sword.jpg|thumb|180px|Stuart's hat and sword]]\nIn the December 1862 [[Battle of Fredericksburg]], Stuart and his cavalry\u2014most notably his horse artillery under Major [[John Pelham (officer)|John Pelham]]\u2014protected Stonewall Jackson's flank at Hamilton's Crossing.

Tapping telegraph lines, his [[Signal Corps in the American Civil War|signalmen]] intercepted messages between Union commanders and Stuart sent a personal telegram to Union Quartermaster General [[Montgomery C.

The minor victory was marred by the death of Major Pelham, which caused Stuart profound grief, as he thought of him as close as a younger brother. He wrote to a Confederate Congressman, \"The noble, the chivalric, the gallant Pelham is no more. ... Let the tears of agony we have shed, and the gloom of mourning throughout my command bear witness.\" Flora was pregnant at the time and Stuart told her that if it were a boy, he wanted him to be named John Pelham Stuart.

Gen. [[A.P. Hill]], had been wounded. Hill, bypassing the next most senior infantry general in the corps, Brig. Gen. [[Robert E. Rodes]], sent a message ordering Stuart to take command of the [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]]. Although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of May 2, Stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day, launching a strong and well-coordinated attack against the Union right flank at Chancellorsville. When Union troops abandoned Hazel Grove, Stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the Union positions with artillery. Stuart relinquished his infantry command on May 6 when Hill returned to duty.<ref>Wert, pp. 222\u201331; Davis, pp. 290\u201398.</ref> [[Stephen W.

After Stuart and his entourage galloped past the line in review, the troopers in their turn saluted the reviewing stand in columns of squadrons. In performing a second \"march past,\" the squadrons started off at a trot, then spurred to a gallop.

By June 5, two of Lee's infantry corps were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast, holding the line of the Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, mostly near Brandy Station, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy. Stuart requested a full field review of his troops by Gen. Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (three&nbsp;km) southwest of Brandy Station.<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 39\u201340; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 62\u201364; Wert, pp. 238\u201339.</ref>\n[[File:Brandy Station Overview.png|thumb|left|260px|alt=A map showing Union actions and Stuart's responses at the Battle of Brandy Station|[[Battle of Brandy Station]], June 9, 1863]]\nLee was not able to attend the review, however, so it was repeated in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations.<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 40\u201341; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 62\u201364.</ref> Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.<ref>Salmon, p. 193; Wert, p. 239.</ref>\n\nArmy of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] interpreted Stuart's presence around Culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his army's supply lines. In reaction, he ordered his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. [[Alfred Pleasonton]], to take a [[combined arms]] force of 8,000 cavalrymen and 3,000 infantry on a \"spoiling raid\" to \"disperse and destroy\" the 9,500 Confederates.<ref>Salmon, p. 198; Wert, p. 240.</ref> Pleasonton's force crossed the Rappahannock in two columns on June 9, 1863, the first crossing at Beverly's Ford (Brig. Gen. [[John Buford]]'s division) catching Stuart by surprise, waking him and his staff to the sound of gunfire. The second crossing, at Kelly's Ford, surprised Stuart again, and the Confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat. A series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across Fleetwood Hill, which had been Stuart's headquarters the previous night. After ten hours of fighting, Pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the Rappahannock.<ref>Salmon, pp. 199\u2013203; Wert, pp. 241\u201348; Davis, pp. 305\u201312.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=If Gen.

However, the fact that the Southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of Union cavalry, and that they fell victim to a surprise attack, was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the Southern press. The fight also revealed the increased competency of the Union cavalry, and foreshadowed the decline of the formerly invincible Southern mounted arm.<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 65\u201386; Wert, pp. 249\u201352.</ref>\n\n===Stuart's ride in the Gettysburg Campaign===\n{{further|Gettysburg Campaign#stuart|l1=Gettysburg Campaign}}\n[[File:Gettysburg Campaign.png|thumb|alt=A map showing Union and Confederate movements at the corps level during the opening phases of the Gettysburg Campaign, with Stuart's cavalry ride shown with a red dotted line.|Stuart's ride (shown with a red dotted line) during the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], June 3 \u2013 July 3, 1863]]\nFollowing a series of small cavalry battles in June as Lee's army began marching north through the Shenandoah Valley, Stuart may have had in mind the glory of circumnavigating the enemy army once again, desiring to erase the stain on his reputation of the surprise at Brandy Station.

The exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since, but the essence was that Stuart was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the Army of Northern Virginia was still south of the Potomac, and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of Ewell's Second Corps. Instead of taking a direct route north near the Blue Ridge Mountains, however, Stuart chose to reach Ewell's flank by taking his three best brigades (those of Brig. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], Brig. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]], and Col. [[John R. Chambliss]], the latter replacing the wounded Brig. Gen. [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. \"Rooney\" Lee]]) between the Union army and Washington, moving north through [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] to [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]] and on into Pennsylvania, hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital. Stuart and his three brigades departed [[Marshall, Virginia|Salem Depot]] at 1 a.m. on June 25.<ref>Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 104\u201306; Longacre, pp. 148\u201352; Gottfried, p. 28; Coddington, p. 108.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Stuart's plan, the Union army's movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of Federal infantry, forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or General Lee had anticipated. This prevented Stuart from linking up with Ewell as ordered and deprived Lee of the use of his prime cavalry force, the \"eyes and ears\" of the army, while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory.<ref>Coddington, pp. 108\u201313; Longacre, pp. 152\u201353; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', p. 106; Gottfried, p. 28.</ref>\n\nStuart's command crossed the Potomac River at 3 a.m. on June 28. At Rockville they captured a wagon train of 140 brand-new, fully loaded wagons and mule teams. This wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to Stuart's advance, but he interpreted Lee's orders as placing importance on gathering supplies. The proximity of the Confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two Union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the Confederates. Stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses \"he would have marched down the 7th Street Road [and] took Abe & Cabinet prisoners.\"<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 19\u201332; Longacre, pp. 154\u201356; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 106, 130\u201331.</ref>\n\nIn Westminster on June 29, his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of Union cavalry, chasing them a long distance on the Baltimore road, which Stuart claimed caused a \"great panic\" in the city of [[Baltimore]].<ref>Coddington, pp. 199\u2013200; Longacre, pp. 156\u201358; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 47\u201364.</ref> The head of Stuart's column encountered Brig. Gen. [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick|Judson Kilpatrick]]'s cavalry as it passed through [[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]] and scattered it on June 30; the [[Battle of Hanover]] ended after Kilpatrick's men regrouped and drove the Confederates out of town. Stuart's brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with Kilpatrick. After a 20-mile trek in the dark, his exhausted men reached [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]] on the morning of July 1, as the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was commencing without them.<ref>Coddington, pp. 200\u201301; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 65\u2013117; Longacre, pp. 161, 172\u201379.</ref>\n\nStuart headed next for [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], hoping to find Ewell. He lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of July 1 and burned the [[Carlisle Barracks]] before withdrawing to the south towards Gettysburg. He and the bulk of his command reached Lee at Gettysburg the afternoon of July 2. He ordered Wade Hampton to cover the left rear of the Confederate battle lines, and Hampton fought with Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]] at the [[Battle of Hunterstown]] before joining Stuart at Gettysburg.<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 139\u201378; Longacre, pp. 193\u2013202.</ref>\n\n===Gettysburg and its aftermath {{anchor|Gettysburg}}===\nWhen Stuart arrived at Gettysburg on the afternoon of July 2\u2014bringing with him the caravan of captured Union supply wagons\u2014he received a rare rebuke from Lee. No one witnessed the private meeting between Lee and Stuart, but reports circulated at headquarters that Lee's greeting was \"abrupt and frosty.\" Colonel [[Edward Porter Alexander]] wrote, \"Although Lee said only, 'Well, General, you are here at last,' his manner implied rebuke, and it was so understood by Stuart.\"<ref>Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 257\u201358. Longacre, pp. 215\u201316, argues that a bitter confrontation never took place.</ref> On the final day of the battle, Stuart was ordered to move into the enemy's rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time [[Pickett's Charge]] was sent against the Union positions on [[Cemetery Ridge]], but his attack on [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles#East Cavalry Field|East Cavalry Field]] was repulsed by Union cavalry under Brig. Gens. [[David McMurtrie Gregg|David Gregg]] and [[George Armstrong Custer|George Custer]].<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 220\u201331.</ref>\n\nDuring the [[retreat from Gettysburg]], Stuart devoted his full attention to supporting the army's movement, successfully screening against aggressive Union cavalry pursuit and escorting thousands of wagons with wounded men and captured supplies over difficult roads and through inclement weather. Numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat. Stuart's men were the final units to cross the Potomac River, returning to Virginia in \"wretched condition\u2014completely worn out and broken down.\"<ref>Longacre, ''Lee's Cavalrymen'', pp. 223\u201337; Wert, pp. 292\u201398.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=The failure to crush the Federal army in Pennsylvania in 1863, in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the Army of Northern Virginia, can be expressed in five words\u2014''the absence of the cavalry''.\n|source= \u2014Confederate Maj. Gen. [[Henry Heth]]<ref name=Wert300>Wert, p. 300.</ref>}}\n\nThe Gettysburg Campaign was the most controversial of Stuart's career. He became one of the [[scapegoats]] (along with James Longstreet) blamed for Lee's loss at Gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause movement]], such as [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]].<ref>Coddington, p. 207.</ref> This was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers, such as Stuart's subordinate, [[Thomas L. Rosser]], who stated after the war that Stuart did, \"on this campaign, ''undoubtedly'', make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of Gettysburg.\" In General Lee's report on the campaign, he wrote\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information. ... By the route [Stuart] pursued, the Federal Army was interposed between his command and our main body, preventing any communication with him until his arrival at Carlisle. The march toward Gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the Federal Army been known.<ref name=Wert300/>}}\n\nOne of the most forceful postbellum defenses of Stuart was by Col. [[John S. Mosby]], who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general, writing, \"He made me all that I was in the war. ... But for his friendship I would never have been heard of.\" He wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in 1908, a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against Stuart.<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 219\u201328.</ref>\n\nHistorians remain divided on how much the defeat at Gettysburg was due to Stuart\u2019s failure to keep Lee informed. Edward G. Longacre argues that Lee deliberately gave Stuart wide discretion in his orders.  Edwin B. Coddington refers to the \"tragedy\" of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign and judges that when Fitzhugh Lee raised the question of \"whether Stuart exercised the discretion ''undoubtedly given to him, judiciously'',\" the answer is no. Agreeing that Stuart's absence permitted Lee to be surprised at Gettysburg, Coddington points out that the Union commander was just as surprised. Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi have concluded that there was \"plenty of blame to go around\" and the fault should be divided between Stuart, the lack of specificity in Lee's orders, and Richard S. Ewell, who might have tried harder to link up with Stuart northeast of Gettysburg. Jeffry D. Wert acknowledges that Lee, his officers, and fighting by the Army of the Potomac bear the responsibility for the Confederate loss at Gettysburg, but states that \"Stuart failed Lee and the army in the reckoning at Gettysburg. ... Lee trusted him and gave him discretion, but Stuart acted injudiciously.\"<ref>Longacre, ''Lee's Cavalrymen'', pp. 215\u201316; Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', p. 271; Coddington, pp. 205\u201308; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 263\u201398; Wert, pp. 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\nAlthough Stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the Gettysburg campaign, it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on September 9, 1863, did not carry with it a promotion to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]]. Edward Bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the Army of Northern Virginia carried this rank, Lee's decision to keep Stuart at major general rank, while at the same time promoting Stuart's subordinates [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and [[Fitzhugh Lee]] to major generals, could be considered an implied rebuke.<ref>Bonekemper, p. 139.</ref> Jeffry D. Wert wrote that there is no evidence Lee considered Stuart's performance during the Gettysburg Campaign and that it is \"more likely that Lee thought the responsibilities in command of a cavalry corps did not equal those of an infantry corps.\"<ref>Wert, pp. 308\u201309.</ref>\n\n[[File:Bristoe Campaign.png|thumb|alt=A map of the Bristoe Campaign|[[Bristoe Campaign]]|left]]\n\n===Fall 1863 and the 1864 Overland Campaign===\nLee reorganized his cavalry on September 9, creating a Cavalry Corps for Stuart with two divisions of three brigades each. In the [[Bristoe Campaign]], Stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemy's rear, but General Meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving Stuart any opportunities to take advantage of. On October 13, Stuart blundered into the rear guard of the Union [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]], resulting in the [[First Battle of Auburn]]. {{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n| quote = [The cavalry's success in the Bristoe Campaign can be attributed] to the generalship, boldness, and untiring energy of Major-General Stuart, for it was he who directed every movement of importance, and his generalship, boldness, and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men, and gave the prestige of success.\n| source = \u2014Confederate Colonel Oliver Funsten<ref>Wert, pp. 320\u201321.</ref>\n}}Ewell's corps was sent to rescue him, but Stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting III Corps moved on, and the assistance was not necessary. As Meade withdrew towards Manassas Junction, brigades from the Union [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] fought a rearguard action against Stuart's cavalry and the infantry of Brig. Gen. [[Harry T. Hays|Harry Hays]]'s division near Auburn on October 14. Stuart's cavalry boldly bluffed Warren's infantry and escaped disaster. After the Confederate repulse at [[Battle of Bristoe Station|Bristoe Station]] and an aborted advance on Centreville, Stuart's cavalry shielded the withdrawal of Lee's army from the vicinity of Manassas Junction. Judson Kilpatrick's Union cavalry pursued Stuart's cavalry along the [[U.S. Route 29|Warrenton Turnpike]], but were lured into an ambush near Chestnut Hill and routed. The Federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles (eight&nbsp;km) in an affair that came to be known as the [[Battle of Buckland Mills|\"Buckland Races\"]]. The Southern press began to mute its criticism of Stuart following his successful performance during the fall campaign.<ref>Wert, pp. 313\u201321; Davis, pp. 360\u201367.</ref>\n[[File:Overland-Richmond.png|thumb|alt=A map of the 1864 Overland Campaign, including the location of the Battle of Yellow Tavern|The 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], including the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]]]]\nThe [[Overland Campaign]], [[Lieutenant general (United States)|Lt. Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s offensive against Lee in the spring of 1864, began at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], where Stuart aggressively pushed Thomas L. Rosser's Laurel Brigade into a fight against George Custer's better-armed Michigan Brigade, resulting in significant losses. General Lee sent a message to Stuart: \"It is very important to save your Cavalry & not wear it out. ... You must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages.\" As the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], Stuart's cavalry fought delaying actions against the Union cavalry. His defense at Laurel Hill, also directing the infantry of Brig. Gen. [[Joseph B. Kershaw]], skillfully delayed the advance of the Federal army for nearly 5 critical hours.<ref>Wert, pp. 338\u201346; Davis, pp. 378\u201384.</ref>\n\n===Yellow Tavern and death===\nThe commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], and his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]], quarreled about the Union cavalry's performance in the first two engagements of the Overland Campaign. Sheridan heatedly asserted that he wanted to \"concentrate all of cavalry, move out in force against Stuart's command, and whip it.\" Meade reported the comments to Grant, who replied \"Did Sheridan say that? Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.\" Sheridan immediately organized a raid against Confederate supply and railroad lines close to Richmond, which he knew would bring Stuart to battle.<ref>Wert, p. 346; Davis, p. 384.</ref>\n\nSheridan moved aggressively to the southeast, crossing the [[North Anna River]] and seizing Beaver Dam Station on the [[Virginia Central Railroad]], where his men captured a train, liberating 3,000 Union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for Lee's army. Stuart dispatched a force of about 3,000 cavalrymen to intercept Sheridan's cavalry, which was more than three times their numbers. As he rode in pursuit, accompanied by his aide, Maj. Andrew R. Venable, they were able to stop briefly along the way to be greeted by Stuart's wife, Flora, and his children, Jimmie and Virginia. Venable wrote of Stuart, \"He told me he never expected to live through the war, and that if we were conquered, that he did not want to live.\"<ref>Wert, pp. 346\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] occurred May 11, at an abandoned inn located {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Richmond. The Confederate troops resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over three hours. After receiving a scouting report from [[Texas Jack Omohundro]], Stuart led a countercharge and pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop. Stuart, on horseback, shouted encouragement from in front of Company K of the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] while firing his revolver at the Union troopers.\n[[File:GWDorsey.jpg|thumb|left|165px|\"Dorsey...save your men\".]]\nAs the [[5th Michigan Cavalry]] streamed in retreat past Stuart, a dismounted Union private, 44-year-old John A. Huff, turned and shot Stuart with his .44-caliber revolver from a distance of 10\u201330 yards.<ref>Smith, p. 242; Salmon, p. 283; Starr, p. 107; Rhea, pp. 209, 390; Thomas, p. 292; Edward G. Longacre, writing in a June 2004 [http://www.historynet.com/wars_conflicts/american_civil_war/3027331.html?page=3&c=y ''Civil War Times'' article], claims that Huff's shot was from {{convert|400|yd}} away, an arguably impressive feat with a pistol; in his book, ''Lincoln's Cavalrymen'' (p. 268), Longacre states that Huff was able to advance \"close enough\" to Stuart to shoot him in the abdomen, although he was not aware at the time that his victim was Stuart. Private Huff was killed a month later at the [[Battle of Haw's Shop]]. Wert, pp. 347\u201358, disputes the possibility that Huff fired the mortal shot, stating that the evidence points to an unnamed trooper in either the 1st or 7th Michigan.</ref> Huff's bullet struck Stuart in the left side. It then sliced through his stomach and exited his back, one inch to the right of his spine.<ref>Smith, p. 357.</ref> Stuart fell into the arms of Company K's commander [[Gus W. Dorsey]].

Upon the death of her daughter Virginia, from complications in childbirth in 1898, Flora resigned from the Institute and moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she helped Virginia's widower, Robert Page Waller, in raising her grandchildren. She died in Norfolk on May 10, 1923, after striking her head in a fall on a city sidewalk.

He was known to his friends as \"Jeb\", from the initials of his given names. Stuart was a [[cavalry]] commander known for his mastery of reconnaissance and the use of cavalry in support of offensive operations. While he cultivated a cavalier image (red-lined gray cape, yellow sash, hat cocked to the side with an ostrich plume, red flower in his lapel, often sporting cologne), his serious work made him the trusted eyes and ears of [[Robert E. Lee]]'s army and inspired Southern morale.<ref>Donald R. Jermann, ''Civil War Battlefield Orders Gone Awry: The Written Word and Its Consequences in 13 Engagements'' (McFarland, 2012) p. 129.</ref>\n\nStuart graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] in 1854, and served in Texas and Kansas with the U.S. Army. In 1855, he married Flora Cooke. His father-in-law was the \"Father of the US Cavalry\", [[Philip St. George Cooke]]. Stuart was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]] and the violence of [[Bleeding Kansas]], and he participated in the capture of [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. He resigned, when his home state of Virginia seceded, to serve in the Confederate Army, first under [[Stonewall Jackson]] in the [[Shenandoah Valley]], but then in increasingly important cavalry commands of the [[Army of Northern Virginia]], playing a role in all of that army's campaigns until his death.\n\nHe established a reputation as an audacious cavalry commander and on two occasions (during the [[Peninsula Campaign]] and the [[Maryland Campaign]]) circumnavigated the [[Union Army|Union]] [[Army of the Potomac]], bringing fame to himself and embarrassment to the [[northern United States|North]]. At the [[Battle of Chancellorsville]], he distinguished himself as a temporary commander of the wounded Stonewall Jackson's infantry corps.\n\nStuart's most famous campaign, the [[Gettysburg Campaign]], was flawed when his long separation from Lee's army left Lee unaware of Union troop movements so that Lee was surprised and almost trapped at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]]. Stuart received significant criticism from the Southern press as well as the proponents of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause movement]] after the war. During the 1864 [[Overland Campaign]], Union Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]]'s cavalry launched an offensive to defeat Stuart, who was mortally wounded at the [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]]. Stuart's widow wore black for the rest of her life in remembrance of her deceased husband.\n\n==Early life and background==\n[[File:Jeb Stuart Birthplace.jpg|thumb|250px|Laurel Hill Farm overview, 2017]]\nStuart was born at [[Laurel Hill Farm]], a plantation in [[Patrick County, Virginia|Patrick County]], [[Virginia]], near the border with [[North Carolina]]. He was the eighth of eleven children and the youngest of the five sons to survive past early age.<ref>Wert, pp. 5\u20136, lists the children as Nancy Anne Dabney, born in 1818, Bethenia Pannill in 1819, Mary Tucker in 1821, David Pannill in 1823, William Alexander in 1826, John Dabney in 1828, Columbia Lafayette in 1830, James in 1833, an unnamed son who died at the age of three months in 1834, Virginia Josephine in 1836, and Victoria Augusta in 1838. Thomas, p. 7, claims that James was the youngest son of ten [unnamed] children.</ref>  His father, [[Archibald Stuart]], was a [[War of 1812]] veteran, slaveholder, attorney, and [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)#Jacksonian Democracy: 1828-1854|Democratic]] politician who represented Patrick County in both houses of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], and also served one term in the [[United States House of Representatives]].<ref>Wert, p. 5.</ref> His mother Elizabeth Letcher Pannill Stuart ran the family farm, and was known as a strict religious woman with a good sense for business.<ref name=Thomas5/>\n\nHe was of [[Scottish American|Scottish]] descent (including some [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]]).<ref>Life of Jeb Stuart by Mary Williamson. Christian Liberty Press, Jan 1, 1997 page 1</ref>  His great-grandfather, Major Alexander Stuart, commanded a regiment at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref name=Thomas5>Thomas, p. 5.</ref> His father Archibald was a cousin of attorney [[Alexander Hugh Holmes Stuart]].<ref name=Thomas5/>\n\n===Education===\nStuart was educated at home by his mother and tutors until the age of twelve, when he left Laurel Hill to be educated by various teachers in [[Wytheville, Virginia]], and at the home of his aunt Anne (Archibald's sister) and her husband Judge James Ewell Brown (Stuart's namesake) at [[Danville, Virginia|Danville]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 11\u201312; Wert, p. 8.</ref> He entered [[Emory and Henry College]] when he was fifteen, and attended from 1848 to 1850.<ref>Wert, p. 10.</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 1848, Stuart attempted to enlist in the U.S. Army, but was rejected as underaged. He obtained an appointment in 1850 to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], from [[United States House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Thomas H. Averett|Thomas Hamlet Averett]], the man who had defeated his father in the [[1848 United States House of Representatives elections|1848 election]].<ref>Wert, p. 11; Davis, p. 19.</ref> Stuart was a popular student and was happy at the Academy. Although not handsome in his teen years, his classmates called him by the nickname \"Beauty\", which they described as his \"personal comeliness in inverse ratio to the term employed.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 18.</ref> He quickly grew a beard after graduation and a fellow officer remarked that he was \"the only man he ever saw that [a] beard improved.\"{{efn|He possessed a chin \"so short and retiring as positively to disfigure his otherwise fine countenance.\"<ref>Davis, p. 33; Wert, p. 15.</ref>}}\n\nRobert E. Lee was appointed superintendent of the academy in 1852, and Stuart became a friend of the family, seeing them socially on frequent occasions. Lee's nephew, [[Fitzhugh Lee]], also arrived at the academy in 1852. In Stuart's final year, in addition to achieving the cadet rank of second captain of the corps, he was one of eight cadets designated as honorary \"cavalry officers\" for his skills in horsemanship.<ref>Wert, p. 18.</ref> Stuart graduated 13th in his class of 46 in 1854. He ranked tenth in his class in [[cavalry tactics]]. Although he enjoyed the civil engineering curriculum at the academy and did well in mathematics, his poor drawing skills hampered his engineering studies, and he finished 29th in that discipline.{{efn|A Stuart family tradition says he deliberately degraded his academic performance in his final year to avoid service in the elite, but dull, [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers]].<ref>Thomas, pp. 18\u201332; Davis, p. 27.</ref>}}\n\n==United States Army==\nStuart was commissioned a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] and assigned to the U.S. [[Regiment of Mounted Riflemen]] in Texas.<ref name=\"Eicher\" /> After an arduous journey, he reached [[Fort Davis National Historic Site|Fort Davis]] on January 28, 1855, and was a leader for three months on scouting missions over the [[San Antonio]] to [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]] Road.<ref>Wert, pp. 22\u201323.</ref> He was soon transferred to the newly formed [[1st Cavalry Regiment (1855)]] at [[Fort Leavenworth]], [[Kansas Territory]], where he became regimental [[quartermaster]]<ref>Thomas, pp. 40\u201341.</ref> and commissary officer under the command of [[Colonel (United States)|Col.]] [[Edwin Vose Sumner|Edwin V. Sumner]].<ref>Wert, p. 25.</ref> He was promoted to [[First Lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]] in 1855.<ref name=\"Eicher\" />\n\n===Marriage===\n[[File:young jeb stuart.jpg|thumb|200px|A young Stuart]]\nAlso in 1855, Stuart met Flora Cooke, the daughter of the commander of the [[2nd Stryker Cavalry Regiment|2nd U.S. Dragoon Regiment]], [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] Philip St. George Cooke. Burke Davis described Flora as \"an accomplished horsewoman, and though not pretty, an effective charmer,\" to whom \"Stuart succumbed with hardly a struggle.\" <ref>Davis, p. 36.</ref> They became engaged in September, less than two months after meeting. Stuart humorously wrote of his rapid courtship in [[Latin]], \"''[[Veni, vidi, vici|Veni, Vidi, Victus sum]]''\" (I came, I saw, I was conquered). Although a gala wedding was planned for [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]], the death of Stuart's father on September 20 caused a change of plans and the marriage on November 14 was small and limited to family witnesses.<ref>Thomas, pp. 41\u201343; Davis, p. 37; Wert, pp. 26\u201329.</ref>  Their first child, a girl, had been born in 1856 but died the same day. On November 14, 1857, Flora gave birth to another daughter, whom the parents named Flora after her mother. The family relocated in early 1858 to Fort Riley, where they remained for three years.<ref>Wert, p. 35.</ref> The couple owned two slaves until 1859, one inherited from his father's estate, the other purchased.<ref>Wert, pp. 30\u201331.</ref>\n\n===Bleeding Kansas===\nStuart's leadership capabilities were soon recognized. He was a veteran of the frontier conflicts with American Indians and the antebellum violence of [[Bleeding Kansas]]. He was wounded on July 29, 1857, while fighting at [[Solomon River]], [[Kansas]], against the [[Cheyenne]]. Col. Sumner ordered a charge with drawn sabers against a wave of Indian arrows. Scattering the warriors, Stuart and three other lieutenants chased one down, whom Stuart wounded in the thigh with his pistol. The Cheyenne turned and fired at Stuart with an old-fashioned pistol, striking him in the chest with a bullet, which did little more damage than to pierce the skin.<ref>Davis, p. 40; Wert, pp. 33\u201335.</ref> Stuart returned in September to Fort Leavenworth and was reunited with his wife.\n\n===John Brown===\nIn 1859, Stuart developed a new piece of cavalry equipment, for which he received [[United States patent law|patent]] number 25,684 on October 4\u2014a saber hook, or an \"improved method of attaching sabers to belts.\" The U.S. government paid Stuart $5,000 for a \"right to use\" license and Stuart contracted with Knorr, Nece and Co. of [[Philadelphia]] to manufacture his hook. While in [[Washington, D.C.]], to discuss government contracts, and in conjunction with his application for an appointment into the quartermaster department, Stuart heard about [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]]'s raid on the U.S. Arsenal at [[Harpers Ferry, West Virginia|Harpers Ferry]]. Stuart volunteered to be [[aide-de-camp]] to Col. Robert E. Lee and accompanied Lee with a company of [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] from the [[Marine Barracks, Washington, D.C.|Marine Barracks, 8th & I, Washington, DC]].<ref>Hoffman, Colonel Jon T., ''USMC: A Complete History'', Marine Corps Association, Quantico, VA, (2002), p. 84.</ref> and four companies of Maryland militia. While delivering Lee's written surrender ultimatum to the leader of the group, who had been calling himself Isaac Smith, Stuart recognized \"Old Osawatomie Brown\" from his days in Kansas.<ref>Wert, pp. 37\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Resignation===\nStuart was promoted to [[Captain (U.S. Army)|captain]] on April 22, 1861, but resigned from the U.S. Army on May 3, 1861, to join the [[Confederate States Army]], following the [[secession]] of Virginia.{{efn|His letter of resignation, sent from [[Cairo, Illinois]], was accepted by the [[United States Department of War|War Department]] on May 14.<ref>Wert, pp. 45, 52; Davis, pp. 47\u201340.</ref>}} On June 26, 1860, Flora gave birth to a son, Philip St. George Cooke Stuart, but his father changed the name to James Ewell Brown Stuart, Jr. (\"Jimmie\"), in late 1861 out of disgust with his father-in-law.<ref>Wert, pp. 42, 76.</ref> Upon learning that his father-in-law, Col. Cooke, would remain in the U.S. Army during the coming war, Stuart wrote to his brother-in-law (future Confederate Brig. Gen.

Lee became commander of the Army of Northern Virginia, he requested that Stuart perform reconnaissance to determine whether the right flank of the Union army was vulnerable. Stuart set out with 1,200 troopers on the morning of June 12 and, having determined that the flank was indeed vulnerable, took his men on a complete circumnavigation of the Union army, returning after 150 miles on June 15 with 165 captured Union soldiers, 260 horses and mules, and various quartermaster and ordnance supplies. His men met no serious opposition from the more decentralized Union cavalry, coincidentally commanded by his father-in-law, Col. Cooke, and their total casualties amounted to one man killed.

Rodes]], sent a message ordering Stuart to take command of the [[Second Corps, Army of Northern Virginia|Second Corps]]. Although the delays associated with this change of command effectively ended the flanking attack the night of May 2, Stuart performed credibly as an infantry corps commander the following day, launching a strong and well-coordinated attack against the Union right flank at Chancellorsville. When Union troops abandoned Hazel Grove, Stuart had the presence of mind to quickly occupy it and bombard the Union positions with artillery. Stuart relinquished his infantry command on May 6 when Hill returned to duty.<ref>Wert, pp. 222\u201331; Davis, pp. 290\u201398.</ref> [[Stephen W.

By June 5, two of Lee's infantry corps were camped in and around Culpeper. Six miles northeast, holding the line of the Rappahannock River, Stuart bivouacked his cavalry troopers, mostly near Brandy Station, screening the Confederate Army against surprise by the enemy. Stuart requested a full field review of his troops by Gen. Lee. This grand review on June 5 included nearly 9,000 mounted troopers and four batteries of horse artillery, charging in simulated battle at Inlet Station, about two miles (three&nbsp;km) southwest of Brandy Station.<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 39\u201340; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 62\u201364; Wert, pp. 238\u201339.</ref>\n[[File:Brandy Station Overview.png|thumb|left|260px|alt=A map showing Union actions and Stuart's responses at the Battle of Brandy Station|[[Battle of Brandy Station]], June 9, 1863]]\nLee was not able to attend the review, however, so it was repeated in his presence on June 8, although the repeated performance was limited to a simple parade without battle simulations.<ref>Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', pp. 40\u201341; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 62\u201364.</ref> Despite the lower level of activity, some of the cavalrymen and the newspaper reporters at the scene complained that all Stuart was doing was feeding his ego and exhausting the horses. Lee ordered Stuart to cross the Rappahannock the next day and raid Union forward positions, screening the Confederate Army from observation or interference as it moved north. Anticipating this imminent offensive action, Stuart ordered his tired troopers back into bivouac around Brandy Station.<ref>Salmon, p. 193; Wert, p. 239.</ref>\n\nArmy of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. [[Joseph Hooker]] interpreted Stuart's presence around Culpeper to be indicative of preparations for a raid on his army's supply lines. In reaction, he ordered his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen.

The second crossing, at Kelly's Ford, surprised Stuart again, and the Confederates found themselves assaulted from front and rear in a spirited melee of mounted combat. A series of confusing charges and countercharges swept back and forth across Fleetwood Hill, which had been Stuart's headquarters the previous night. After ten hours of fighting, Pleasonton ordered his men to withdraw across the Rappahannock.<ref>Salmon, pp. 199\u2013203; Wert, pp. 241\u201348; Davis, pp. 305\u201312.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=If Gen.

However, the fact that the Southern cavalry had not detected the movement of two large columns of Union cavalry, and that they fell victim to a surprise attack, was an embarrassment that prompted serious criticism from fellow generals and the Southern press.

General Lee gave orders to Stuart on June 22 on how he was to participate in the march north. The exact nature of those orders has been argued by the participants and historians ever since, but the essence was that Stuart was instructed to guard the mountain passes with part of his force while the Army of Northern Virginia was still south of the Potomac, and that he was to cross the river with the remainder of the army and screen the right flank of Ewell's Second Corps. Instead of taking a direct route north near the Blue Ridge Mountains, however, Stuart chose to reach Ewell's flank by taking his three best brigades (those of Brig. Gen. [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]], Brig. Gen. [[Fitzhugh Lee]], and Col. [[John R. Chambliss]], the latter replacing the wounded Brig. Gen. [[William Henry Fitzhugh Lee|W.H.F. \"Rooney\" Lee]]) between the Union army and Washington, moving north through [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]] to [[Westminster, Maryland|Westminster]] and on into Pennsylvania, hoping to capture supplies along the way and cause havoc near the enemy capital. Stuart and his three brigades departed [[Marshall, Virginia|Salem Depot]] at 1 a.m. on June 25.<ref>Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 104\u201306; Longacre, pp. 148\u201352; Gottfried, p. 28; Coddington, p. 108.</ref>\n\nUnfortunately for Stuart's plan, the Union army's movement was underway and his proposed route was blocked by columns of Federal infantry, forcing him to veer farther to the east than either he or General Lee had anticipated. This prevented Stuart from linking up with Ewell as ordered and deprived Lee of the use of his prime cavalry force, the \"eyes and ears\" of the army, while advancing into unfamiliar enemy territory.<ref>Coddington, pp. 108\u201313; Longacre, pp. 152\u201353; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', p. 106; Gottfried, p. 28.</ref>\n\nStuart's command crossed the Potomac River at 3 a.m. on June 28. At Rockville they captured a wagon train of 140 brand-new, fully loaded wagons and mule teams. This wagon train would prove to be a logistical hindrance to Stuart's advance, but he interpreted Lee's orders as placing importance on gathering supplies. The proximity of the Confederate raiders provoked some consternation in the national capital and two Union cavalry brigades and an artillery battery were sent to pursue the Confederates. Stuart supposedly said that were it not for his fatigued horses \"he would have marched down the 7th Street Road [and] took Abe & Cabinet prisoners.\"<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 19\u201332; Longacre, pp. 154\u201356; Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 106, 130\u201331.</ref>\n\nIn Westminster on June 29, his men clashed briefly with and overwhelmed two companies of Union cavalry, chasing them a long distance on the Baltimore road, which Stuart claimed caused a \"great panic\" in the city of [[Baltimore]].<ref>Coddington, pp. 199\u2013200; Longacre, pp. 156\u201358; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 47\u201364.</ref> The head of Stuart's column encountered Brig. Gen. [[Hugh Judson Kilpatrick|Judson Kilpatrick]]'s cavalry as it passed through [[Hanover, Pennsylvania|Hanover]] and scattered it on June 30; the [[Battle of Hanover]] ended after Kilpatrick's men regrouped and drove the Confederates out of town. Stuart's brigades had been better positioned to guard their captured wagon train than to take advantage of the encounter with Kilpatrick. After a 20-mile trek in the dark, his exhausted men reached [[Dover, Pennsylvania|Dover]] on the morning of July 1, as the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] was commencing without them.<ref>Coddington, pp. 200\u201301; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 65\u2013117; Longacre, pp. 161, 172\u201379.</ref>\n\nStuart headed next for [[Carlisle, Pennsylvania|Carlisle]], hoping to find Ewell. He lobbed a few shells into town during the early evening of July 1 and burned the [[Carlisle Barracks]] before withdrawing to the south towards Gettysburg. He and the bulk of his command reached Lee at Gettysburg the afternoon of July 2. He ordered Wade Hampton to cover the left rear of the Confederate battle lines, and Hampton fought with Brig. Gen. [[George Armstrong Custer]] at the [[Battle of Hunterstown]] before joining Stuart at Gettysburg.<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 139\u201378; Longacre, pp. 193\u2013202.</ref>\n\n===Gettysburg and its aftermath {{anchor|Gettysburg}}===\nWhen Stuart arrived at Gettysburg on the afternoon of July 2\u2014bringing with him the caravan of captured Union supply wagons\u2014he received a rare rebuke from Lee. No one witnessed the private meeting between Lee and Stuart, but reports circulated at headquarters that Lee's greeting was \"abrupt and frosty.\" Colonel [[Edward Porter Alexander]] wrote, \"Although Lee said only, 'Well, General, you are here at last,' his manner implied rebuke, and it was so understood by Stuart.\"<ref>Sears, ''Gettysburg'', pp. 257\u201358. Longacre, pp. 215\u201316, argues that a bitter confrontation never took place.</ref> On the final day of the battle, Stuart was ordered to move into the enemy's rear and disrupt its line of communications at the same time [[Pickett's Charge]] was sent against the Union positions on [[Cemetery Ridge]], but his attack on [[Battle of Gettysburg, Third Day cavalry battles#East Cavalry Field|East Cavalry Field]] was repulsed by Union cavalry under Brig.

Numerous skirmishes and minor battles occurred during the screening and delaying actions of the retreat. Stuart's men were the final units to cross the Potomac River, returning to Virginia in \"wretched condition\u2014completely worn out and broken down.\"<ref>Longacre, ''Lee's Cavalrymen'', pp. 223\u201337; Wert, pp. 292\u201398.</ref>\n\n{{quote box\n|align=right\n|width=35%\n|quote=The failure to crush the Federal army in Pennsylvania in 1863, in the opinion of almost all of the officers of the Army of Northern Virginia, can be expressed in five words\u2014''the absence of the cavalry''.\n|source= \u2014Confederate Maj.

He became one of the [[scapegoats]] (along with James Longstreet) blamed for Lee's loss at Gettysburg by proponents of the postbellum [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy|Lost Cause movement]], such as [[Jubal Anderson Early|Jubal Early]].<ref>Coddington, p. 207.</ref> This was fueled in part by opinions of less partisan writers, such as Stuart's subordinate, [[Thomas L. Rosser]], who stated after the war that Stuart did, \"on this campaign, ''undoubtedly'', make the fatal blunder which lost us the battle of Gettysburg.\" In General Lee's report on the campaign, he wrote\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;the absence of the cavalry rendered it impossible to obtain accurate information. ... By the route [Stuart] pursued, the Federal Army was interposed between his command and our main body, preventing any communication with him until his arrival at Carlisle. The march toward Gettysburg was conducted more slowly than it would have been had the movements of the Federal Army been known.<ref name=Wert300/>}}\n\nOne of the most forceful postbellum defenses of Stuart was by Col. [[John S. Mosby]], who had served under him during the campaign and was fiercely loyal to the late general, writing, \"He made me all that I was in the war. ... But for his friendship I would never have been heard of.\" He wrote numerous articles for popular publications and published a book length treatise in 1908, a work that relied on his skills as a lawyer to refute categorically all of the claims laid against Stuart.<ref>Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 219\u201328.</ref>\n\nHistorians remain divided on how much the defeat at Gettysburg was due to Stuart\u2019s failure to keep Lee informed. Edward G. Longacre argues that Lee deliberately gave Stuart wide discretion in his orders.  Edwin B. Coddington refers to the \"tragedy\" of Stuart in the Gettysburg Campaign and judges that when Fitzhugh Lee raised the question of \"whether Stuart exercised the discretion ''undoubtedly given to him, judiciously'',\" the answer is no. Agreeing that Stuart's absence permitted Lee to be surprised at Gettysburg, Coddington points out that the Union commander was just as surprised. Eric J. Wittenberg and J. David Petruzzi have concluded that there was \"plenty of blame to go around\" and the fault should be divided between Stuart, the lack of specificity in Lee's orders, and Richard S. Ewell, who might have tried harder to link up with Stuart northeast of Gettysburg. Jeffry D. Wert acknowledges that Lee, his officers, and fighting by the Army of the Potomac bear the responsibility for the Confederate loss at Gettysburg, but states that \"Stuart failed Lee and the army in the reckoning at Gettysburg. ... Lee trusted him and gave him discretion, but Stuart acted injudiciously.\"<ref>Longacre, ''Lee's Cavalrymen'', pp. 215\u201316; Longacre, ''Cavalry at Gettysburg'', p. 271; Coddington, pp. 205\u201308; Wittenberg and Petruzzi, pp. 263\u201398; Wert, pp. 299\u2013302.</ref>\n\nAlthough Stuart was not reprimanded or disciplined in any official way for his role in the Gettysburg campaign, it is noteworthy that his appointment to corps command on September 9, 1863, did not carry with it a promotion to [[Lieutenant General (CSA)|lieutenant general]]. Edward Bonekemper wrote that since all other corps commanders in the Army of Northern Virginia carried this rank, Lee's decision to keep Stuart at major general rank, while at the same time promoting Stuart's subordinates [[Wade Hampton III|Wade Hampton]] and [[Fitzhugh Lee]] to major generals, could be considered an implied rebuke.<ref>Bonekemper, p. 139.</ref> Jeffry D.

In the [[Bristoe Campaign]], Stuart was assigned to lead a broad turning movement in an attempt to get into the enemy's rear, but General Meade skillfully withdrew his army without leaving Stuart any opportunities to take advantage of. On October 13, Stuart blundered into the rear guard of the Union [[III Corps (Union Army)|III Corps]] near [[Warrenton, Virginia|Warrenton]], resulting in the [[First Battle of Auburn]]. {{quote box\n| align = right\n| width = 35%\n| quote = [The cavalry's success in the Bristoe Campaign can be attributed] to the generalship, boldness, and untiring energy of Major-General Stuart, for it was he who directed every movement of importance, and his generalship, boldness, and energy won the unbounded confidence of officers and men, and gave the prestige of success.\n| source = \u2014Confederate Colonel Oliver Funsten<ref>Wert, pp. 320\u201321.</ref>\n}}Ewell's corps was sent to rescue him, but Stuart hid his troopers in a wooded ravine until the unsuspecting III Corps moved on, and the assistance was not necessary. As Meade withdrew towards Manassas Junction, brigades from the Union [[II Corps (Union Army)|II Corps]] fought a rearguard action against Stuart's cavalry and the infantry of Brig. Gen. [[Harry T. Hays|Harry Hays]]'s division near Auburn on October 14. Stuart's cavalry boldly bluffed Warren's infantry and escaped disaster. After the Confederate repulse at [[Battle of Bristoe Station|Bristoe Station]] and an aborted advance on Centreville, Stuart's cavalry shielded the withdrawal of Lee's army from the vicinity of Manassas Junction. Judson Kilpatrick's Union cavalry pursued Stuart's cavalry along the [[U.S. Route 29|Warrenton Turnpike]], but were lured into an ambush near Chestnut Hill and routed. The Federal troopers were scattered and chased five miles (eight&nbsp;km) in an affair that came to be known as the [[Battle of Buckland Mills|\"Buckland Races\"]].

Gen.]] [[Ulysses S. Grant]]'s offensive against Lee in the spring of 1864, began at the [[Battle of the Wilderness]], where Stuart aggressively pushed Thomas L. Rosser's Laurel Brigade into a fight against George Custer's better-armed Michigan Brigade, resulting in significant losses. General Lee sent a message to Stuart: \"It is very important to save your Cavalry & not wear it out. ... You must use your good judgment to make any attack which may offer advantages.\" As the armies maneuvered toward their next confrontation at [[Battle of Spotsylvania Court House|Spotsylvania Court House]], Stuart's cavalry fought delaying actions against the Union cavalry. His defense at Laurel Hill, also directing the infantry of Brig. Gen. [[Joseph B. Kershaw]], skillfully delayed the advance of the Federal army for nearly 5 critical hours.<ref>Wert, pp. 338\u201346; Davis, pp. 378\u201384.</ref>\n\n===Yellow Tavern and death===\nThe commander of the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. [[George Meade]], and his cavalry commander, Maj. Gen. [[Philip Sheridan]], quarreled about the Union cavalry's performance in the first two engagements of the Overland Campaign. Sheridan heatedly asserted that he wanted to \"concentrate all of cavalry, move out in force against Stuart's command, and whip it.\" Meade reported the comments to Grant, who replied \"Did Sheridan say that? Well, he generally knows what he is talking about. Let him start right out and do it.\" Sheridan immediately organized a raid against Confederate supply and railroad lines close to Richmond, which he knew would bring Stuart to battle.<ref>Wert, p. 346; Davis, p. 384.</ref>\n\nSheridan moved aggressively to the southeast, crossing the [[North Anna River]] and seizing Beaver Dam Station on the [[Virginia Central Railroad]], where his men captured a train, liberating 3,000 Union prisoners and destroying more than one million rations and medical supplies destined for Lee's army. Stuart dispatched a force of about 3,000 cavalrymen to intercept Sheridan's cavalry, which was more than three times their numbers. As he rode in pursuit, accompanied by his aide, Maj. Andrew R. Venable, they were able to stop briefly along the way to be greeted by Stuart's wife, Flora, and his children, Jimmie and Virginia. Venable wrote of Stuart, \"He told me he never expected to live through the war, and that if we were conquered, that he did not want to live.\"<ref>Wert, pp. 346\u201349.</ref>\n\nThe [[Battle of Yellow Tavern]] occurred May 11, at an abandoned inn located {{convert|6|mi|km|spell=in}} north of Richmond. The Confederate troops resisted from the low ridgeline bordering the road to Richmond, fighting for over three hours. After receiving a scouting report from [[Texas Jack Omohundro]], Stuart led a countercharge and pushed the advancing Union troopers back from the hilltop. Stuart, on horseback, shouted encouragement from in front of Company K of the [[1st Virginia Cavalry]] while firing his revolver at the Union troopers.\n[[File:GWDorsey.jpg|thumb|left|165px|\"Dorsey...save your men\".]]\nAs the [[5th Michigan Cavalry]] streamed in retreat past Stuart, a dismounted Union private, 44-year-old John A.

Private Huff was killed a month later at the [[Battle of Haw's Shop]]. Wert, pp. 347\u201358, disputes the possibility that Huff fired the mortal shot, stating that the evidence points to an unnamed trooper in either the 1st or 7th Michigan.</ref> Huff's bullet struck Stuart in the left side. It then sliced through his stomach and exited his back, one inch to the right of his spine.<ref>Smith, p. 357.</ref> Stuart fell into the arms of Company K's commander [[Gus W. Dorsey]].  Dorsey caught him and took him from his horse.

Lee had recommended her before his death ten years earlier.<ref>Lee had been a member of the board of visitors of the school in 1865\u20131870 when he was president of Washington College in nearby Lexington, Virginia. He also had sent two daughters to the school for their educations. Wert, p. 368 for recommendation.</ref> In 1907, the Institute was renamed [[Stuart Hall School]] in her honor. Upon the death of her daughter Virginia, from complications in childbirth in 1898, Flora resigned from the Institute and moved to [[Norfolk, Virginia]], where she helped Virginia's widower, Robert Page Waller, in raising her grandchildren. She died in Norfolk on May 10, 1923, after striking her head in a fall on a city sidewalk.

An [[urban legend]] exists of [[President Theodore Roosevelt]] noticing a group of correspondents in the rain looking for sources for their stories and inviting them into the White House. Subsequent historical research outlines how reporters were able to start with small stories in the White House and then grew their presence and influence over a span of many years.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.whca.net/history.htm | title = HISTORY OF THE WHCA | work = WHCA | publisher = White House Correspondents' Association  | date = }}</ref>\n\n==Correspondents==\n\n===Current===\n\nOrdered by [[James S.

It won the Adult Library Services Association Best Books for Young Adults, among other awards. It was adapted into a film named ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' released in the United States on February 12, 2010. This novel is followed by ''[[The Sea of Monsters]]'' and spawned two sequel series and the extended universe of the [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|''Camp Half-Blood'' chronicles]].\n\n==Development and publication==\n[[File:Rick riordan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Rick Riordan, the author, at the release of ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'']]\nDevelopment for ''The Lightning Thief'' began when author Rick Riordan made up stories for his son Haley, who had been diagnosed with [[ADHD]] and [[dyslexia]]. His son had been studying [[Greek mythology]] in [[second grade]] and asked that his father come up with [[bedtime story|bedtime stories]] based on Greek myths. Riordan had been a Greek mythology teacher in middle school for many years and was able to remember enough stories to please his son. Soon Riordan ran out of myths and his son requested that Riordan make new ones using the characters from Greek myths with a new twist. Riordan created the fictional character Percy Jackson and his travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning bolt. In his new story, Riordan made ADHD and dyslexia part of a demigod's powers - respectively, heightened battle reflexes and a brain wired to read [[ancient Greek]] rather than English. After Riordan finished telling the story his son asked that his dad write a book based on Percy's adventures, and he did.\n\nWhile he gave his manuscript to his agent and editor to review, Riordan took his book to a group of middle schoolers to critique. With their help, he came up with the name of the book and invented Percy's magic sword.<ref name=\"Riordan Interview\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rickriordan.com/about/an-interview-with-rick | title=An Interview with Rick | publisher=Disney-Hyperion | work=rickriordan.com | accessdate=2015-07-25 | author=Riordan, Rick}}</ref> Riordan first sent out the manuscript for ''The Lightning Thief'' under a pseudonym, as he did not want to rely on anyone in the publisher industry, who would have known him through his [[Big Red Tequila|previous work]].<ref name=\"Riordan Blog\">{{cite web | url=http://rickriordan.com/2013/12/if-only-i-had-connections/ | title=If Only I Had Connections . . . | publisher=Disney-Hyperion | work=rickriordan.com | accessdate=2016-11-12 | author=Riordan, Rick}}</ref> After many rejections, an agent picked up the manuscript as she liked its premise.

While on a school trip to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], one of the chaperones, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Alecto|Mrs. Dodds]], turns into a [[Furies|Fury]] and attacks him. Percy's favorite teacher, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Chiron|Mr. Brunner]], lends Percy a [[Percy Jackson#Weapons|magical sword-pen]] to defeat her. After school lets out, Percy goes on a trip to Long Island with his [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#The%20Jackson%20family|mother]], Sally. In the middle of the night, Percy's friend [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Grover%20Underwood|Grover Underwood]] reveals himself as a [[satyr]], and tells them they are in danger. The three drive to a mysterious [[summer camp]], but the [[Minotaur]] attacks them, grabs Sally, and causes her to disappear in a blinding flash of gold light. Believing his mother has died, Percy kills the beast with one of its own horns, drags an unconscious Grover into the camp, and soon falls unconscious himself. When Percy awakens, he learns that the camp is called [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|Camp Half-Blood]] and that he is a demigod: the son of a human and a [[List of Greek mythological figures#Immortals|Greek god]]. He settles into camp life and meets several other demigods, including [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Luke%20Castellan|Luke Castellan]] and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Annabeth%20Chase|Annabeth Chase]]. After a [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20creatures|hellhound]] attacks him after a game of [[Capture the Flag]], he is saved by Chiron and then claimed by his father, the god [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Poseidon|Poseidon]]. Chiron explains to Percy how the three eldest male gods\u2014Poseidon, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Zeus|Zeus]], and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Hades|Hades]]\u2014swore an oath not to have children more than 70 years ago; Percy represents a violation of the oath. This, coupled with the fact that Zeus's master lightning bolt has recently been stolen, has bred much suspicion between the gods.\n\nPercy is given the task of locating Zeus's original lightning bolt before an all-out war can break out between the gods. He chooses Annabeth and Grover to accompany him to the realm of Hades, as Hades is the most likely culprit of the theft. Before he leaves, Percy is given Chiron's magic sword ''Anaklusmos'' (\"Riptide\") and Luke's flying sneakers. The trio travels towards [[Los Angeles]], where the entrance to Hades's realm resides. Along the way, they are attacked by several monsters, including the Furies, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20humanoids|Medusa]], [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20humanoids|Echidna]], and the [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20Humanoids|Chimera]]. They also do a favor for the god [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Ares|Ares]], who gives them a backpack full of supplies and safe transportation to [[Nevada]]. Percy gradually learns more about his companions, his powers, and the world of the Greek gods. When they arrive in Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into [[Tartarus]] by Luke's flying shoes. The battered group finally meets Hades, who reveals that his Helm of Darkness has also been mysteriously stolen, and accuses Percy of stealing it. Hades threatens to kill Sally Jackson (who is being held hostage by the god) and [[Undead|reanimate]] the dead unless his helm is returned. When Percy finds the missing master bolt inside Ares's backpack, the group realizes they've all been manipulated by Ares. Narrowly escaping the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel on the beach. After a long and tough fight, Percy wins, and he gives the Helm of Darkness to the Furies. Hades realizes that Percy is not the thief of the helm nor the master bolt, and returns Mrs. Jackson to their apartment in New York.\n\nPercy takes the master bolt back to Zeus on Mount Olympus, who rewards the young hero by not killing him. Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood as a hero and enjoys the rest of his summer there. On the last day of camp, however, he goes into the woods with Luke, who reveals himself to be the real thief of Hades's Helm and Zeus's bolt, following the orders of [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Kronos|Kronos]]. Kronos also manipulated the power-hungry Ares into taking part in the scheme. Luke explains his beliefs that the gods are too irresponsible and are poor leaders who need to be overthrown. He offers Percy the chance to join him, and when Percy refuses, Luke tries to kill him with a [[scorpion]]. Percy manages to kill it but is badly [[Poisoning|poisoned]] and faints. When he has awakened and recovered, Percy is given the choice of whether to return home for the school year or stay at camp year-round. After much thought, he decides to spend the school year with his mother, even though it will be more dangerous for him with Luke and Kronos on the loose. Grover and Annabeth also leave the camp for the year but promise to keep in touch with Percy.<ref name=\"Kidsreads Review\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kidsreads.com/reviews/0786838655.asp | title=The Lightning Thief Review | publisher=Kidsreads | date=2006-05-21 | accessdate=2009-09-01 | author=Oksner, Robert}}</ref><ref name=\"Reviews List\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rickriordan.com/Lightning_Thief_Reviews.htm | title=Reviews for The Lightning Thief | publisher=Hyperion-Books, Rick Riordan | accessdate=2009-05-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182407/http://www.rickriordan.com/Lightning_Thief_Reviews.htm | archivedate=April 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Thunder Child Review\">{{cite web | url=http://thethunderchild.com/Reviews/Books/Childrens/Thomason/June/LightningThief.html | title=The Lightning Thief Review | publisher=Thunder Child | accessdate=2009-09-01 | author=Thomason, Kathy}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Lightning Thief'' received mostly positive reviews.

It won the Adult Library Services Association Best Books for Young Adults, among other awards. It was adapted into a film named ''[[Percy Jackson & the Olympians: The Lightning Thief]]'' released in the United States on February 12, 2010. This novel is followed by ''[[The Sea of Monsters]]'' and spawned two sequel series and the extended universe of the [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|''Camp Half-Blood'' chronicles]].\n\n==Development and publication==\n[[File:Rick riordan 2007.jpg|right|thumb|Rick Riordan, the author, at the release of ''[[The Battle of the Labyrinth]]'']]\nDevelopment for ''The Lightning Thief'' began when author Rick Riordan made up stories for his son Haley, who had been diagnosed with [[ADHD]] and [[dyslexia]]. His son had been studying [[Greek mythology]] in [[second grade]] and asked that his father come up with [[bedtime story|bedtime stories]] based on Greek myths. Riordan had been a Greek mythology teacher in middle school for many years and was able to remember enough stories to please his son. Soon Riordan ran out of myths and his son requested that Riordan make new ones using the characters from Greek myths with a new twist. Riordan created the fictional character Percy Jackson and his travels across the United States to recover Zeus's lightning bolt. In his new story, Riordan made ADHD and dyslexia part of a demigod's powers - respectively, heightened battle reflexes and a brain wired to read [[ancient Greek]] rather than English.

Try and keep the synopsis at around 500 words. -->\n\n''The Lightning Thief'' is narrated in the [[First-person narrative|first person]] [[past tense]] by [[Percy Jackson]], a twelve-year-old diagnosed with [[dyslexia]] and [[ADHD]]. While on a school trip to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], one of the chaperones, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Alecto|Mrs. Dodds]], turns into a [[Furies|Fury]] and attacks him. Percy's favorite teacher, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Chiron|Mr. Brunner]], lends Percy a [[Percy Jackson#Weapons|magical sword-pen]] to defeat her. After school lets out, Percy goes on a trip to Long Island with his [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#The%20Jackson%20family|mother]], Sally. In the middle of the night, Percy's friend [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Grover%20Underwood|Grover Underwood]] reveals himself as a [[satyr]], and tells them they are in danger. The three drive to a mysterious [[summer camp]], but the [[Minotaur]] attacks them, grabs Sally, and causes her to disappear in a blinding flash of gold light. Believing his mother has died, Percy kills the beast with one of its own horns, drags an unconscious Grover into the camp, and soon falls unconscious himself. When Percy awakens, he learns that the camp is called [[Camp Half-Blood chronicles|Camp Half-Blood]] and that he is a demigod: the son of a human and a [[List of Greek mythological figures#Immortals|Greek god]]. He settles into camp life and meets several other demigods, including [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Luke%20Castellan|Luke Castellan]] and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Annabeth%20Chase|Annabeth Chase]]. After a [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20creatures|hellhound]] attacks him after a game of [[Capture the Flag]], he is saved by Chiron and then claimed by his father, the god [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Poseidon|Poseidon]]. Chiron explains to Percy how the three eldest male gods\u2014Poseidon, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Zeus|Zeus]], and [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Hades|Hades]]\u2014swore an oath not to have children more than 70 years ago; Percy represents a violation of the oath. This, coupled with the fact that Zeus's master lightning bolt has recently been stolen, has bred much suspicion between the gods.\n\nPercy is given the task of locating Zeus's original lightning bolt before an all-out war can break out between the gods. He chooses Annabeth and Grover to accompany him to the realm of Hades, as Hades is the most likely culprit of the theft. Before he leaves, Percy is given Chiron's magic sword ''Anaklusmos'' (\"Riptide\") and Luke's flying sneakers. The trio travels towards [[Los Angeles]], where the entrance to Hades's realm resides. Along the way, they are attacked by several monsters, including the Furies, [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20humanoids|Medusa]], [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20humanoids|Echidna]], and the [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Greco-Roman%20Humanoids|Chimera]]. They also do a favor for the god [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Ares|Ares]], who gives them a backpack full of supplies and safe transportation to [[Nevada]]. Percy gradually learns more about his companions, his powers, and the world of the Greek gods. When they arrive in Hades's realm, Grover is nearly dragged into [[Tartarus]] by Luke's flying shoes. The battered group finally meets Hades, who reveals that his Helm of Darkness has also been mysteriously stolen, and accuses Percy of stealing it. Hades threatens to kill Sally Jackson (who is being held hostage by the god) and [[Undead|reanimate]] the dead unless his helm is returned. When Percy finds the missing master bolt inside Ares's backpack, the group realizes they've all been manipulated by Ares. Narrowly escaping the Underworld, Percy challenges Ares to a duel on the beach. After a long and tough fight, Percy wins, and he gives the Helm of Darkness to the Furies. Hades realizes that Percy is not the thief of the helm nor the master bolt, and returns Mrs. Jackson to their apartment in New York.\n\nPercy takes the master bolt back to Zeus on Mount Olympus, who rewards the young hero by not killing him. Percy returns to Camp Half-Blood as a hero and enjoys the rest of his summer there. On the last day of camp, however, he goes into the woods with Luke, who reveals himself to be the real thief of Hades's Helm and Zeus's bolt, following the orders of [[List of characters in mythology novels by Rick Riordan#Kronos|Kronos]]. Kronos also manipulated the power-hungry Ares into taking part in the scheme. Luke explains his beliefs that the gods are too irresponsible and are poor leaders who need to be overthrown. He offers Percy the chance to join him, and when Percy refuses, Luke tries to kill him with a [[scorpion]]. Percy manages to kill it but is badly [[Poisoning|poisoned]] and faints. When he has awakened and recovered, Percy is given the choice of whether to return home for the school year or stay at camp year-round. After much thought, he decides to spend the school year with his mother, even though it will be more dangerous for him with Luke and Kronos on the loose. Grover and Annabeth also leave the camp for the year but promise to keep in touch with Percy.<ref name=\"Kidsreads Review\">{{cite web | url=http://www.kidsreads.com/reviews/0786838655.asp | title=The Lightning Thief Review | publisher=Kidsreads | date=2006-05-21 | accessdate=2009-09-01 | author=Oksner, Robert}}</ref><ref name=\"Reviews List\">{{cite web | url=http://www.rickriordan.com/Lightning_Thief_Reviews.htm | title=Reviews for The Lightning Thief | publisher=Hyperion-Books, Rick Riordan | accessdate=2009-05-21 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182407/http://www.rickriordan.com/Lightning_Thief_Reviews.htm | archivedate=April 20, 2008}}</ref><ref name=\"Thunder Child Review\">{{cite web | url=http://thethunderchild.com/Reviews/Books/Childrens/Thomason/June/LightningThief.html | title=The Lightning Thief Review | publisher=Thunder Child | accessdate=2009-09-01 | author=Thomason, Kathy}}</ref>\n\n==Critical reception==\n''The Lightning Thief'' received mostly positive reviews.

Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.\n\nThe views of [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Amit Chaudhuri]] expressed through their books ''The Vintage Book of Indian Writing'' and ''The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature'' respectively essentialise this battle. Rushdie's statement in his book&nbsp;\u2013 \"the ironic proposition that India's best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear\"&nbsp;\u2013 created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions&nbsp;\u2013 \"Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?\"\n\nChaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, Indian writing in English started employing [[magical realism]], bagginess, [[non-linear narrative]] and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as [[R. K. Narayan]] where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indian is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the [[vernacular literature]]. He further adds \"the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybrid by which the West celebrates not so much Indian, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself\".\n\nSome of these arguments form an integral part of what is called [[postcolonial theory]]. The very categorisation of IWE&nbsp;\u2013 as IWE or under post-colonial literature&nbsp;\u2013 is seen by some as limiting. [[Amitav Ghosh]] made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for his book ''[[The Glass Palace]]'' in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.\n\nThe renowned writer V. S. Naipaul, a third generation Indian from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate, is a person who belongs to the world and usually not classified under IWE. Naipaul evokes ideas of homeland, rootlessness and his own personal feelings towards India in many of his books.\n\nIndian authors like [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Rohinton Mistry]], [[Meena Alexander]], [[Arundhati Roy]] and [[Kiran Desai]] have written about their postcolonial experiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n{{cn span|The most significant novels of the current generation of [[Urdu literature|Indian novelists in Urdu]] are ''Makaan'' by [[Paigham Afaqui]] (born 1956), ''Do Gaz Zameen'' by [[Abdus Samad (writer)|Abdus Samad]], and ''Pani'' by [[Ghazanfer]].

Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. ''The Siege of Krishnapurn'' was inspired by events such as the sieges of [[Siege of Cawnpore]] ([[Kanpur]]) and [[Siege of Lucknow|Lucknow]], and details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] from the perspective of the British residents.

Distinctive [[Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century, and Welsh national feeling grew during the 20th century.

The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by Saunders Lewis and the burning of the [[Bombing School]] on the [[Lleyn Peninsula]] in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II.<ref>''The Pocket Guide'', p. 122.</ref> In poetry [[R.

However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. The [[Irish language]], however, remained the dominant language of [[Irish literature]] down to the 19th century, despite a slow decline which began in the 17th century with the expansion of English power.\n\nThe 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the traditional aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little sympathy for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms.<ref>TLG 201\u2013223.</ref> This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet [[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]] and the anonymous authors of ''[[Pairliment Chloinne Tom\u00e1is]]'', a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes.<ref>See the introduction to Williams (1981). The text is bilingual.</ref> Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of [[Geoffrey Keating]] (Seathr\u00fan C\u00e9itinn) and the compilation known as the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.\n\nThe consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included [[Eoghan Rua \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]] and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] of [[Sliabh Luachra]]. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.<ref>Caerwyn Williams and N\u00ed Mhuir\u00edosa (1979), pp. 252\u2013268, 282\u2013290.

The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, though Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the [[Gaelic Revival]] (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the [[Irish Literary Revival]].\n\nA [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and [[Northern Ireland]], which remained a part of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Poland===\n[[Clare Cavanagh]] believes that literature of Poland is postcolonial. <ref>[https://read.dukeupress.edu/common-knowledge/article-abstract/10/1/82/25271/Postcolonial-Poland?redirectedFrom=fulltext Postcolonial Poland]</ref> Dariusz Sk\u00f3rczewski supports her <ref>[http://rcin.org.pl/Content/51835/WA248_71046_P-I-2524_skorczew-post-colon.pdf Post-colonial Poland.

These cultures have all retained autonomy to some extent, making a compilation such as the controversial ''Southern African Literatures'' by [[Michael Chapman (South Africa)|Michael Chapman]], difficult. Chapman raises the question:\n<blockquote>\n[W]hose language, culture, or story can be said to have authority in South Africa when the end of apartheid has raised challenging questions as to what it is to be a South African, what it is to live in a new South Africa, whether South Africa is a nation, and, if so, what its mythos is, what requires to be forgotten and what remembered as we scour the past in order to understand the present and seek a path forward into an unknown future.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chapman|first=Michael |title=The Problem of Identity: South Africa, Storytelling, and Literary History |journal=New Literary History|volume=29|issue=1|year=1998|pages=85\u201399|doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0002 |jstor=20057469}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nSouth Africa has 11 national languages: [[Afrikaans]], English, [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda]], [[SiSwati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]. Any definitive literary history of South Africa should, it could be argued, discuss literature produced in all eleven languages. But the only literature ever to adopt characteristics that can be said to be \"national\" is Afrikaans. Olivier argues: \"Of all the literatures in South Africa, Afrikaans literature has been the only one to have become a national literature in the sense that it developed a clear image of itself as a separate entity, and that by way of institutional entrenchment through teaching, distribution, a review culture, journals, etc. it could ensure the continuation of that concept.\"{{cite quote|date=July 2019}} Part of the problem is that English literature has been seen within the greater context of English writing in the world, and has, because of English's global position as ''lingua franca'', not been seen as autonomous or indigenous to South Africa&nbsp;\u2013 in Olivier's words: \"English literature in South Africa continues to be a sort of extension of British or international English literature.\"{{sfn|Olivier|1995|p=}} The African languages, on the other hand, are spoken across the borders of Southern Africa - for example, Tswana is spoken in Botswana, and Tsonga in Zimbabwe, and Sotho in Lesotho. South Africa's borders were drawn up by the [[British Empire]] and, as with all other colonies, these borders were drawn without regard for the people living within them. Therefore: in a history of South African literature, do we include all Tswana writers, or only the ones with South African citizenship? Chapman bypasses this problem by including \"Southern\" African literatures. The second problem with the African languages is accessibility, because since the African languages are regional languages, none of them can claim the readership on a national scale comparable to Afrikaans and English. Sotho, for instance, while transgressing the national borders of the RSA, is on the other hand mainly spoken in the [[Free State (province)|Free State]], and bears a great amount of relation to the language of [[Natal (region)|Natal]] for example, Zulu. So the language cannot claim a national readership, while on the other hand being \"international\" in the sense that it transgresses the national borders.\n\nOlivier argues that \"There is no obvious reason why it should be unhealthy or abnormal for different literatures to co-exist in one country, each possessing its own infrastructure and allowing theoreticians to develop impressive theories about polysystems\".{{sfn|Olivier|1995|p=}} Yet political idealism proposing a unified \"South Africa\" (a remnant of the colonial British approach) has seeped into literary discourse and demands a unified national literature, which does not exist and has to be fabricated. It is unrealistic to ever think of South Africa and South African literature as homogenous, now or in the near or distant future, since the only reason it is a country at all is the interference of European colonial powers. This is not a racial issue, but rather has to do with culture, heritage and tradition (and indeed the constitution celebrates diversity). Rather, it seems more sensible to discuss South African literature as literature produced within the national borders by the different cultures and language groups inhabiting these borders. Otherwise the danger is emphasising one literary system at the expense of another, and more often than not, the beneficiary is English, with the African languages being ignored. The distinction \"black\" and \"white\" literature is further a remnant of colonialism that should be replaced by drawing distinctions between literary systems based on language affiliation rather than race.\n\nThe first texts produced by black authors were often inspired by missionaries and frequently deal with African history, in particular the history of kings such as [[Shaka|Chaka]]. Modern South African writing in the African languages tends to play at writing realistically, at providing a mirror to society, and depicts the conflicts between rural and urban settings, between traditional and modern norms, racial conflicts and most recently, the problem of AIDS.\n\nIn the first half of the 20th century, epics largely dominated black writing: historical novels, such as [[Sol T. Plaatje]]'s ''[[Mhudi: An Epic of South African Native Life a Hundred Years Ago]]'' (1930), [[Thomas Mofolo]]'s ''[[Chaka (novel)|Chaka]]'' (trans. 1925), and epic plays including those of [[H. I. E. Dhlomo]], or heroic epic poetry such as the work of [[Mazizi Kunene]]. These texts \"evince black African patriarchy in its traditional form, with men in authority, often as warriors or kings, and women as background figures of dependency, and/or mothers of the nation\".<ref>Cullhed, 2006: 21)</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=July 2019}} Female literature in the African languages is severely limited because of the strong influence of patriarchy, but over the last decade or two society has changed much and it can be expected that more female voices will emerge.\n\nThe following are notable white South African writers in English: [[Athol Fugard]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[J.

Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, [[V. S.

The various local variations in the language adopted from the colonial powers such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country.

Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.\n\nThe views of [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Amit Chaudhuri]] expressed through their books ''The Vintage Book of Indian Writing'' and ''The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature'' respectively essentialise this battle. Rushdie's statement in his book&nbsp;\u2013 \"the ironic proposition that India's best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear\"&nbsp;\u2013 created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions&nbsp;\u2013 \"Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?\"\n\nChaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, Indian writing in English started employing [[magical realism]], bagginess, [[non-linear narrative]] and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as [[R. K. Narayan]] where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indian is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the [[vernacular literature]]. He further adds \"the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybrid by which the West celebrates not so much Indian, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself\".\n\nSome of these arguments form an integral part of what is called [[postcolonial theory]]. The very categorisation of IWE&nbsp;\u2013 as IWE or under post-colonial literature&nbsp;\u2013 is seen by some as limiting. [[Amitav Ghosh]] made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for his book ''[[The Glass Palace]]'' in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.\n\nThe renowned writer V. S. Naipaul, a third generation Indian from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and a [[Nobel Prize]] laureate, is a person who belongs to the world and usually not classified under IWE. Naipaul evokes ideas of homeland, rootlessness and his own personal feelings towards India in many of his books.\n\nIndian authors like [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Rohinton Mistry]], [[Meena Alexander]], [[Arundhati Roy]] and [[Kiran Desai]] have written about their postcolonial experiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n{{cn span|The most significant novels of the current generation of [[Urdu literature|Indian novelists in Urdu]] are ''Makaan'' by [[Paigham Afaqui]] (born 1956), ''Do Gaz Zameen'' by [[Abdus Samad (writer)|Abdus Samad]], and ''Pani'' by [[Ghazanfer]].

Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. ''The Siege of Krishnapurn'' was inspired by events such as the sieges of [[Siege of Cawnpore]] ([[Kanpur]]) and [[Siege of Lucknow|Lucknow]], and details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] from the perspective of the British residents.

Distinctive [[Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century, and Welsh national feeling grew during the 20th century. The Welsh nationalist party, [[Plaid Cymru]], was formed in 1925 and the [[Welsh Language Society]] in 1962.\n\n[[Saunders Lewis]] (1893\u20131985), the noted [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh language poet, novelist, dramatist]], and nationalist, rejected the possibility of [[Anglo-Welsh]] literature, because of its use of English, the language of the British colonialists, affirming that \"the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature\".<ref>Michael J. Collins, \"Keeping the Flag Flying: Anglo-Welsh Poetry in the Twentieth Century\".

The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by Saunders Lewis and the burning of the [[Bombing School]] on the [[Lleyn Peninsula]] in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II.<ref>''The Pocket Guide'', p. 122.</ref> In poetry [[R. S. Thomas]] (1913\u20132000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century, beginning with ''The Stones of the Field'' in 1946 and concluding with ''No Truce with the Furies'' (1995). While he \"did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English\",<ref name=LATimesObit>''Los Angeles Times'', \"Obituary\", September 27, 2000</ref> he wanted the Welsh language to be made the first language of Wales, and the official policy of bilingualism abolished. He wrote his autobiography in Welsh, but said he lacked the necessary grasp of the language to employ it in his poems. Although an Anglican priest, he was a fervent nationalist and advocated non-violent action against English owners of holiday homes in Wales.<ref name=LATimesObit /> As an admirer of Saunders Lewis, Thomas defended his need to use English: \"Since there is in Wales a mother tongue that continues to flourish, a proper Welshman can only look on English as a means of rekindling interest in the Welsh language, and of leading people back to the mother tongue.\"<ref>R. S. Thomas, ''Selected Prose'', ed. Sandra Anstey. Brigend: Poetry Wales Press, 1986, p. 53.</ref>\n\nWith the creation the [[National Assembly for Wales]], under the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], Wales now has more local autonomy from the central government in England. The [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality. English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the ''de facto'' main language. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh.<ref name=\"2011 Census Language\">{{cite news|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286268 |title=2011 Census, Key Statistics for Unitary Authorities in Wales |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=11 December 2012|accessdate=11 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/English/publications/Publications/332.doc |title=Census 2001: Main statistics about Welsh |publisher=[[Welsh Language Board]] |accessdate=30 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063247/http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/english/publications/publications/332.doc |archivedate=24 May 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===Ireland===\n[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|''Birth of the Irish Republic\"\u00b4'' by [[Walter Paget (illustrator)|Walter Paget]], depicting the [[Dublin General Post Office]] being shelled during the [[Easter Uprising]] of 1916]]\nThe English language was introduced to [[Ireland]] in the 13th century, following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th\u201317th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. The [[Irish language]], however, remained the dominant language of [[Irish literature]] down to the 19th century, despite a slow decline which began in the 17th century with the expansion of English power.\n\nThe 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the traditional aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little sympathy for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms.<ref>TLG 201\u2013223.</ref> This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet [[D\u00e1ibh\u00ed \u00d3 Bruadair]] and the anonymous authors of ''[[Pairliment Chloinne Tom\u00e1is]]'', a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes.<ref>See the introduction to Williams (1981). The text is bilingual.</ref> Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of [[Geoffrey Keating]] (Seathr\u00fan C\u00e9itinn) and the compilation known as the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.\n\nThe consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included [[Eoghan Rua \u00d3 S\u00failleabh\u00e1in]] and [[Aog\u00e1n \u00d3 Rathaille]] of [[Sliabh Luachra]]. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.<ref>Caerwyn Williams and N\u00ed Mhuir\u00edosa (1979), pp. 252\u2013268, 282\u2013290. See Corkery (1925) for a detailed discussion of the social context.</ref> In the first half of the 18th century Dublin was the home of an Irish-language literary circle connected to the \u00d3 Neachtain (Naughton) family, a group with wide-ranging Continental connections.<ref>Caerwyn Williams and N\u00ed Mhuir\u00edosa (1979), pp. 279\u2013282.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, though Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the [[Gaelic Revival]] (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the [[Irish Literary Revival]].\n\nA [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and [[Northern Ireland]], which remained a part of the [[United Kingdom]].\n\n===Poland===\n[[Clare Cavanagh]] believes that literature of Poland is postcolonial. <ref>[https://read.dukeupress.edu/common-knowledge/article-abstract/10/1/82/25271/Postcolonial-Poland?redirectedFrom=fulltext Postcolonial Poland]</ref> Dariusz Sk\u00f3rczewski supports her <ref>[http://rcin.org.pl/Content/51835/WA248_71046_P-I-2524_skorczew-post-colon.pdf Post-colonial Poland.

{"title_page": "Matriculation exam (Finland)", "text_new": "[[Image:Ylioppilaslakki.jpg|thumb|right|The Finnish abitur gives the right to wear the [[student cap]]]]\n\nThe '''Finnish Matriculation Examination''' ([[Finnish language|Finnish]] ''ylioppilastutkinto'', [[Swedish language|Swedish]] ''studentexamen'') is [[matriculation examination|the examination]] taken at the end of [[secondary education]] to qualify for entry into [[university]]. The test also constitutes the high school's final exam(s); in other words, it is a high school graduation exam. Since 1919, the test has been arranged by a national body, the Matriculation Examination Board. Before that, the administration of the test was the responsibility of the [[University of Helsinki]].\n\nUnder a previous law, successful completion entitled one to enroll as a university student (hence \"[[matriculation]]\"). Although the legal requirement has been lifted, matriculation without completing the test is still an exception. The universities are now free to arrange their own entrance examinations in addition to considering scores from the matriculation examination. Thus, universities accept students based on the entrance exam points, the matriculation exam points, and also a combined score of these two. Successfully passing the test entitles one to wear the Finnish [[student cap]].\n\n==Exams==\nEach examinee is required to participate in at least four tests in order to pass the exam. {{as of|2005}} the only mandatory part of the test is that of ''\u00e4idinkieli'' (\"mother tongue\"; Finnish for most students, [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Northern Sami language|Northern S\u00e1mi]], [[Inari Sami language|Inari S\u00e1mi]], or [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt S\u00e1mi]] for some), including a composition test. The student then has to choose three other subjects from:\n* ''Second domestic language'': ([[Mandatory Swedish|Swedish for Finnish speakers]] or Finnish for [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish speakers]])\n* ''Foreign language'': Languages are separated into A and B levels depending on the demanded skill. The language counted as part of the four obligatory subjects must be one of A-level. However, if a student takes advanced level mathematics as an obligatory subject, he or she may take B-level language exams. English, German and French are the most popular choices among students, but in addition, the students may take Russian, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese, Latin, [[Inari Sami language|Inari S\u00e1mi]], and [[Northern S\u00e1mi]] exams. The foreign language exams include listening and reading comprehension tests, a grammar test and an essay.\n* ''Mathematics'': (ordinary or advanced level), including 15 assignments 10 of which must be completed.\n* ''Reaali'' (''real\u00e4mnen'' in Swedish): Here the examinees take exams in individual subjects and are only allowed to answer questions from a single subject per exam. There is no limitation in the number of individual exams taken, but as tests in multiple subjects are held at the same time, it is practically possible to attend two exams two times per year. The subjects taken by the examinee have to be chosen well in advance prior to the exam. Exams consist of questions which require answers in the form of an [[essay]]. The subjects in the ''reaali'' category are\n** Religion, Evangelical Lutheran\n** Religion, Orthodox Christian\n** Education on ethics and moral history\n** Philosophy\n** Psychology\n** History\n** Civics\n** Physics\n** Chemistry\n** Biology\n** Geography\n** Health education\n\n[[Image:Ylioppilastutkintolautakunnan logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|The emblem of the Finnish Matriculation Examination Board]]\nThe exam takes place at schools according to minute regulations laid out by the national board. Each exam takes six hours. After the exam, the teachers grade the papers and send the graded papers to the national board which then re-grades every paper. The grading of the exam may be appealed against. In this case, the board re-examines the grading. The result of the re-examination is final and cannot be appealed to any authority.\n\n==Scoring==\nThe score of each test varies with the subject. For example, the maximum score for the test in Finnish or Swedish as a first language is 120 points, in mathematics 66 points and in foreign languages 299 points. The tests are graded according to [[normal distribution]] into seven verbal [[Academic grading in Finland#Gymnasium|grades]] with [[Latin]] names: ''improbatur'' (I), ''approbatur'' (A), ''lubenter approbatur'' (B), ''cum laude approbatur'' (C), ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M), ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E) and ''laudatur'' (L), from bottom to top. (A rough literal translation of the grades is \"not approved\", \"approved\", \"gladly approved\", \"approved with praise\", \"approved with much praise\", \"approved with exceptional praise\", and \"praised\"/\"lauded\".) In general, at least the grade A is required for the test to be passed. The grades received by the students generally follow a distribution of:\n* 5% of students receive a ''laudatur'' (L)\n* 15% of students receive an ''eximia cum laude approbatur'' (E)\n* 20% of students receive a ''magna cum laude approbatur'' (M)\n* 24% of students receive a ''cum laude approbatur'' (C)\n* 20% of students receive a ''lubenter approbatur'' (B)\n* 11% of students receive an ''approbatur'' (A)\n* 5% of students receive an ''improbatur'' (I).\n\nThis distribution is such that one grade on the scale is equivalent to approximately one standard deviation; 64% are within M-B and 90% within E-A.\n\nTraditionally, the test is taken in the spring, but it is also arranged every autumn and may be taken in up to three parts. Thus completing the matriculation exam may take up to one and a half years. Usually, the last set of exams is taken at the end of the third year in upper secondary school. The exams take place in late March, but for the school-leavers, the school ends in mid-February, giving the students ample time to prepare for the test in solitary study. This occasion is celebrated by the traditional festivity of [[penkkarit]].\n\n==Compensation system==\nStudents who receive an ''improbatur'' in any of the obligatory exams fail the entire exam. However, a single failed obligatory exam may be compensated for by good results in other exams. Based on the compensation system, the total exam score of the student is calculated and compared with the result of the failed test. To receive their diploma, a student must accumulate sufficient compensation points from the other exams. The ''improbatur'' is divided into four classes (i+,&nbsp;i,&nbsp;i&minus;,&nbsp;i=), each describing the degree of a student's failure (i+ is the least failure), and each class has its own number of compensation points needed for an acceptable result (12, 14, 16 and 18 respectively). Points from accepted exams are awarded as follows: ''L'', seven points; ''E'', six; ''M'', five; ''C'', four; ''B'', three and ''A'', two.\n\n==Digitalisation==\nThe Matriculation Examination is currently under a process of digitalisation. The first digital tests were held in the autumn of 2016 in geography, philosophy and German language. The last test to become digital will be the mathematics test in spring 2019.
