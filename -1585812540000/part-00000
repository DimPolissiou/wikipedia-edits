They speculate that one of the early owners of [[Rancho Jurupa]] reassigned the name Pachappa to another, smaller hill, in order to expand the property of the Rancho.<ref>Patterson, ''A Colony...'', p. 82.</ref> Since Pachappa hill was designated as the southeast marker of the Jurupa Rancho, which was granted by the Mexican government to Juan Bandini in 1838, reassigning the name to the current [[Pachappa Hill]] would have expanded the Rancho Jurupa significantly, incorporating all of the area covered by today's downtown Riverside. It is also possible the United States government renamed the hills in order to satisfy acreage requirements of the original Mexican land Grant.<ref>Gunther, p. 337.</ref>\n\nIn 1906 [[Frank Augustus Miller|Frank Miller]], owner of the [[The Mission Inn Hotel & Spa|Mission Inn]], along with [[Henry E.

Joala Falls, to the east, is {{convert|110|m|ft}} wide and up to {{convert|6.5|m|ft}} high. The Estonian\u2013Russian border follows the eastern branch and goes through Joala Falls.<ref name=suuroja/>\n\nSince the creation of Narva Reservoir in 1955, the waterfalls are usually dry, but water is allowed to flow in the original channel for up to a few days every year. Access to the waterfalls is difficult as they are located in the border zone and the surrounding area on the Estonian side is closed industrial land belonging to [[Krenholm Manufacturing Company]].\n\n==History==\nThe Narva was used as a trade route during the [[Viking Age]], from 5th to 11th century.

Treaties from the 15th century between the [[Livonian Order]] and Novgorod Republic also recognize the Narva as the border.<ref name=selart/> During the time of [[Swedish Estonia]], when [[Ingria]] was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the [[Russian Empire]], from the end of the [[Great Northern War]] until the establishment of the [[History of Estonia#Republic of Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] in 1918, the Narva was the border of [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]], with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter. By the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], signed in 1920, the Estonian\u2013[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] border went slightly east of the river, up to {{convert|10|km|mi|0}}, and, in particular, the town of Ivangorod was assigned to Estonia. In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to [[Russian SFSR]] and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of [[Estonian SSR]], an internal border within [[USSR]]. In 1991 the same border became the ''de facto'' border of Estonia and Russia.

Treaties from the 15th century between the [[Livonian Order]] and Novgorod Republic also recognize the Narva as the border.<ref name=selart/> During the time of [[Swedish Estonia]], when [[Ingria]] was also part of Sweden, the importance of the river as a border diminished. During the [[Russian Empire]], from the end of the [[Great Northern War]] until the establishment of the [[History of Estonia#Republic of Estonia|Republic of Estonia]] in 1918, the Narva was the border of [[Governorate of Estonia]] and [[Saint Petersburg Governorate]], with the exception of the town of Narva, which was part of the latter. By the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]], signed in 1920, the Estonian\u2013[[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian]] border went slightly east of the river, up to {{convert|10|km|mi|0}}, and, in particular, the town of Ivangorod was assigned to Estonia. In 1944 the former Estonian territory east of the river was transferred to [[Russian SFSR]] and the Narva was thus established as the eastern border of [[Estonian SSR]], an internal border within [[USSR]].

The basic goal in any form of rummy is to build ''[[Meld (cards)|melds]]'' which consists of [[Set (cards)|sets]], three or four of a kind of the same rank; or [[Run (cards)|runs]], three or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. If a player discards a card, making a run in the discard pile, it may not be taken up without taking all cards below the top one. \nThe Mexican game of [[Conquian]] is considered by games scholar [[David Parlett]] to be ancestral to all rummy games, which itself is derived from a Chinese game called [[Khanhoo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> The rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century, and perhaps as early as the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parlett's Historic Card Games: Gin Rummy \u2013 David Parlett|url= http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/ginrummy.html}}</ref>\n\nRummy games are popular in India. It is likely that [[Indian Rummy|Indian rummy]] is an extension of [[gin rummy]] and [[500 rum]], which originated from the United States.\n\n==General features of rummy-style games==\n\n===Deal===\nDepending on the variation, each player receives a certain number of cards from either a standard deck of 52 cards, more than one deck or a special deck of cards used for specific games. The un-dealt cards are placed face down in a pile in the middle, which is known as the stock. In most variations a single card is turned face up next to the stock where players discard or shed cards, and this is known as the discard pile. In 10 Cards Rummy, which is often played with two, three or four players, each player gets ten cards. In rummy games with five players, each player is given six cards. In 500 Rummy, each player is given seven cards. In Indian Rummy, 13 cards are dealt to each player.\n\n===Melds===\nA meld can either be a set (also known as a book) or a run. A set consists of at least three cards of the same rank, for example {{cards|4h|4d|4s}} or {{cards|kh|kd|ks|kc}}. A run consists of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit {{cards|jc|qc|kc}} or {{cards|4h|5h|6h|7h}}. Very few variations allow runs that have mixed suits. In a few variations of rummy other patterns may be allowed. In some variations the melds (sets and runs) must be 3 or 4 cards, while other variations allow larger melds through the use of longer runs, for example: {{cards|8s|9s|10s|js|qs}} or, if multiple decks or [[wild card (cards)|wild cards]] are used, {{cards|5d|5d|5h|5s|5s}} or {{cards|qh|qd|Jkr|qc}}. Wild cards (such as a joker) may be used to represent any card in a meld. The number of wild cards in a meld may be restricted.\n\n===Gameplay===\nDepending on the variation of the game, players take turns adding and shedding cards from their hands. There are numerous and quite different ways of doing this though it usually involves picking a card from the stock and discarding a card to the discard pile. In some variations melds are revealed to all players by placing them face up on the table, in other variations each player keeps their hand hidden until the show. Some variations permit picking up the entire discard pile. A few variations permit stealing cards from their opponents melds.\n\n===Show===\nIn most variations a player must put all of their cards into at least two melds (though they may be allowed to shed one card to the discard pile before showing). Once the player has melded all their cards they reveal their entire hand and the player submits their hand to validation. All other players reveal their melds and deadweight. The action of submitting the cards is called Showing.\n\n===Scoring===\nAfter a successful show, the winner or all players score their hand. In most variations numbered cards have certain assigned points and the royal cards (J-Q-K) have assigned points and the A often has a different point value. Scoring  often involves each player adding up points in their melded cards (sets and runs) and deducting points from cards that have not been melded. The winner may also receive a bonus for winning. Some special or difficult melds may also give extra points to a hand. A player may have a negative score if their unmelded cards total more than their melded ones. Usually play continues until one player passes a threshold, for example 1,000 points.\n\n==Basic rummy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThere are many variations of the card game. Basic rummy is also called '''sai rummy'''. Another type is called '''sanka rummy'''. The version of rummy prevalent in India is called ''Indian rummy''. They all share a common set of features found in the basic game. A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The cards rank from 2 (low) to A (high). Rummy can be played to a certain score, or to a fixed number of deals. All rummy games are about card-melding, i.e., forming valid combinations of sequences and/or sets. Players pick and discard a card on their turns to achieve the goal. The one who successfully melds his/her cards before all others, is the winner in that game of rummy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Rummy Guide |url=https://www.rummypassion.com/rummy-wiki}}</ref>\n\n===Shuffle and deal===\nEach player draws a card. The player with the lowest card deals first. The deal then proceeds clockwise. The player on the dealer's gem right cuts (this is optional).\n\nThe number of cards dealt depends on the number of players. If there are two players, each player gets ten cards. In three or four player games, seven cards are dealt to each player. Five or six players may also play, in which case each player receives six cards.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n!Number of players\n!Number of cards dealt\n|-\n|2 players\n|10 cards \n|-\n|3 or 4 players\n|7 cards\n|-\n|5 or 6 players\n|6 or 7 cards\n|}\n\nStarting with the player to the dealer's left, cards are dealt clockwise, face down, one at a time. The dealer then puts the rest of the deck, face down, between the players. This forms the stock pile. A single card is then drawn and placed face up next to the stack. This is called the discard pile.\n\n===Playing===\nPlay begins with the player on the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise. On their turn, each player draws the top card from the stock or the discard pile. The player may then meld or lay off, which are both optional, before discarding a single card to the top of the discard pile to end their turn.\n\n====Melding====\nIf a player has three cards of the same suit in a sequence (called a sequence or a run), they may meld by laying these cards, face up, in front of them. If they have at least three cards of the same value, they may meld a group (also called a set or a book). Aces can be played as high or low or both, for example {{cards|Qs|Ks|As}, {{cards|As|2s|3s}} and {{cards|Ks|As|2s}} are legal. Melding is optional. A player may choose, for reasons of strategy, not to meld on a particular turn. The most important reason is to be able to declare \"rummy\" later in the game. If a run lies in the discard pile, such as 2-3-4, you cannot call rummy without taking all cards below the top card of said run.\n\n====Laying off====\nA player may also choose to \"lay off\" some cards on an existing meld. This means that if a player can add to a sequence or a group that is in front of them or any of the other players, they may do so. Another variation is that they cannot \"lay off\" unless they have already played a set of 3 or a run. For example: if another player had a sequence consisting of {{cards|Ah|2h|3h}} in front of them, the player would be able to add the {{cards|4h}}, or {{cards|4h|5h}}, and so on, thereby continuing the sequence. Some variations allow players to play the {{cards|Kh}} and wrap around.\n\n====Discarding====\nFinally, after any melds or lay offs, the player must discard a single card to the discard pile, face up. If the player drew from the discard pile instead of the stock on this turn, they may not replace the same card on top of the discard pile but must discard a different card.\n\n====Exhausting the stock====\nIf, while playing, the stock runs out, the next player may choose to draw from the discard pile or to turn the discard pile over to form a new stock. The discard pile is not shuffled in the process. After forming the new stock, the top card is drawn to form the new discard pile, just like after the deal. The player can call rummy if a point is discarded into the discard pile. They cannot however call rummy if the card becomes a point while in the discard pile.\n\n====Going out====\nWhen a player has gotten rid of all of their cards, they win the hand. There are two variations. Either the player must discard the last remaining card in their hand on the last turn, or they need not. Playing with this rule makes ending a hand slightly more difficult.\n\nFor example, if a player has only {{cards|7d|8d}} left in their hand, and they draw {{cards|9d}} (forming a sequence), then whether they win the hand or not depends on if they are playing the discard rule variation.  If they are playing this variation, they can not win the hand at this point, because they have to finish the turn by discarding one of the three cards in their hand, causing them to no longer have a sequence. However, if the player is allowed to lay off this sequence without a final discard, then the game ends when the player lays down the sequence.  And a player can lay down cards afterwards. A player may win if rummy is discarded as the last card. You may also pick up from the discard pile and discard that card only if it is with another card. The player that goes out first gets extra 10 points.\n\n===Declaring rummy===\nIf a player is able to meld all of their cards at once, they may say \"rummy\" on their turn and go out. To declare rummy, a player must not have melded or laid off any cards prior during the hand. If playing with the discard rule, they must also discard after melding. If a player goes rummy when a card can be played, that player is out for that turn. Game players are still in game but the hand goes dead.  Playing for rummy is more risky, but it carries the reward of double the score. Each player must wait until their second turn to go out. If there is a rummy lying in the pile, the player who called \"rummy\" can play that card while the player who laid the rummy must then draw 2 cards from the stock pile or pick up the entire discarded pile.\n\n===Scoring===\nAfter a player goes out, the hand ends, and the players count up their cards. Any cards left in each player's hand are counted up and added to the winner's score. The face cards count as 10 each, number cards as their face value, and aces as one. There are many variations. Common ones include counting an ace as 11 or 15.\n\n===Variations===\n[[File:Rommee1.jpg|thumb|Melding with a joker]]\nIn some instances, jokers are used as wildcards and can represent any card value when melding.<ref name=\"pagat\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pagat.com/rummy/rummy.html | title=Rules of Rummy | publisher=Pagat | accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref> They can be used in sets or runs but can not be replaced when 'melded', nor can a player lay off a card to replace it by themselves or their opponent. Jokers are not counted during the scoring.\n\nIn other variations, such as [[rummy 500]] and [[treppenromm\u00e9]], discards are placed so that all the cards are visible. At the beginning of his or her turn, a player may take any card from the discard pile, so long as they also pick up all the cards that are on top of it, and the last card picked up is played immediately.  If only picking up the top card, the player must keep it and discard a different card from their hand.\n\nIn a variation called ''block rummy'', players do not continue after going through the pack once \u2013 if no players are out, they all lose the points in their hands after the pack has been gone through once. ''Round the corner rummy'', also called ''continuity rummy'', is a variant where an ace may be simultaneously high and low to \"wrap around\" in a run, as in the following meld: Q-K-A-2.\n\n==Related card games==\nThere are a large number of games derived from rummy. Although in North America the word ''rummy'' is often used as a stand-in for the specific game [[gin rummy]], the term is applicable to a large family of games, including [[canasta]], [[mahjong]] and [[rummikub]].\n\n===Melding family===\n\nThe most basic form where play continues until the stock is exhausted or a player achieves a specific number of points. Different cards (and melds in some games) are worth specific points. In some variations the first meld must meet minimum point requirements or the final meld must include a discard.

The basic goal in any form of rummy is to build ''[[Meld (cards)|melds]]'' which consists of [[Set (cards)|sets]], three or four of a kind of the same rank; or [[Run (cards)|runs]], three or more cards in sequence, of the same suit. If a player discards a card, making a run in the discard pile, it may not be taken up without taking all cards below the top one. \nThe Mexican game of [[Conquian]] is considered by games scholar [[David Parlett]] to be ancestral to all rummy games, which itself is derived from a Chinese game called [[Khanhoo]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Parlett|first=David|title=The Penguin Book of Card Games|year=1978|isbn=978-0-14-103787-5}}</ref> The rummy principle of drawing and discarding with a view to melding appears in Chinese card games at least in the early 19th century, and perhaps as early as the 18th century.<ref>{{cite web|title=Parlett's Historic Card Games: Gin Rummy \u2013 David Parlett|url= http://www.parlettgames.uk/histocs/ginrummy.html}}</ref>\n\nRummy games are popular in India. It is likely that [[Indian Rummy|Indian rummy]] is an extension of [[gin rummy]] and [[500 rum]], which originated from the United States.\n\n==General features of rummy-style games==\n\n===Deal===\nDepending on the variation, each player receives a certain number of cards from either a standard deck of 52 cards, more than one deck or a special deck of cards used for specific games. The un-dealt cards are placed face down in a pile in the middle, which is known as the stock. In most variations a single card is turned face up next to the stock where players discard or shed cards, and this is known as the discard pile. In 10 Cards Rummy, which is often played with two, three or four players, each player gets ten cards. In rummy games with five players, each player is given six cards. In 500 Rummy, each player is given seven cards. In Indian Rummy, 13 cards are dealt to each player.\n\n===Melds===\nA meld can either be a set (also known as a book) or a run. A set consists of at least three cards of the same rank, for example {{cards|4h|4d|4s}} or {{cards|kh|kd|ks|kc}}. A run consists of at least three consecutive cards of the same suit {{cards|jc|qc|kc}} or {{cards|4h|5h|6h|7h}}. Very few variations allow runs that have mixed suits. In a few variations of rummy other patterns may be allowed. In some variations the melds (sets and runs) must be 3 or 4 cards, while other variations allow larger melds through the use of longer runs, for example: {{cards|8s|9s|10s|js|qs}} or, if multiple decks or [[wild card (cards)|wild cards]] are used, {{cards|5d|5d|5h|5s|5s}} or {{cards|qh|qd|Jkr|qc}}. Wild cards (such as a joker) may be used to represent any card in a meld. The number of wild cards in a meld may be restricted.\n\n===Gameplay===\nDepending on the variation of the game, players take turns adding and shedding cards from their hands. There are numerous and quite different ways of doing this though it usually involves picking a card from the stock and discarding a card to the discard pile. In some variations melds are revealed to all players by placing them face up on the table, in other variations each player keeps their hand hidden until the show. Some variations permit picking up the entire discard pile. A few variations permit stealing cards from their opponents melds.\n\n===Show===\nIn most variations a player must put all of their cards into at least two melds (though they may be allowed to shed one card to the discard pile before showing). Once the player has melded all their cards they reveal their entire hand and the player submits their hand to validation. All other players reveal their melds and deadweight. The action of submitting the cards is called Showing.\n\n===Scoring===\nAfter a successful show, the winner or all players score their hand. In most variations numbered cards have certain assigned points and the royal cards (J-Q-K) have assigned points and the A often has a different point value. Scoring  often involves each player adding up points in their melded cards (sets and runs) and deducting points from cards that have not been melded. The winner may also receive a bonus for winning. Some special or difficult melds may also give extra points to a hand. A player may have a negative score if their unmelded cards total more than their melded ones. Usually play continues until one player passes a threshold, for example 1,000 points.\n\n==Basic rummy==\n{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}\nThere are many variations of the card game. Basic rummy is also called '''sai rummy'''. Another type is called '''sanka rummy'''. The version of rummy prevalent in India is called ''Indian rummy''. They all share a common set of features found in the basic game. A standard deck of 52 cards is used. The cards rank from 2 (low) to A (high). Rummy can be played to a certain score, or to a fixed number of deals. All rummy games are about card-melding, i.e., forming valid combinations of sequences and/or sets. Players pick and discard a card on their turns to achieve the goal. The one who successfully melds his/her cards before all others, is the winner in that game of rummy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Basic Rummy Guide |url=https://www.rummypassion.com/rummy-wiki}}</ref>\n\n===Shuffle and deal===\nEach player draws a card. The player with the lowest card deals first. The deal then proceeds clockwise. The player on the dealer's gem right cuts (this is optional).\n\nThe number of cards dealt depends on the number of players. If there are two players, each player gets ten cards. In three or four player games, seven cards are dealt to each player. Five or six players may also play, in which case each player receives six cards.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n|+\n|-\n!Number of players\n!Number of cards dealt\n|-\n|2 players\n|10 cards \n|-\n|3 or 4 players\n|7 cards\n|-\n|5 or 6 players\n|6 or 7 cards\n|}\n\nStarting with the player to the dealer's left, cards are dealt clockwise, face down, one at a time. The dealer then puts the rest of the deck, face down, between the players. This forms the stock pile. A single card is then drawn and placed face up next to the stack. This is called the discard pile.\n\n===Playing===\nPlay begins with the player on the dealer's left and proceeds clockwise. On their turn, each player draws the top card from the stock or the discard pile. The player may then meld or lay off, which are both optional, before discarding a single card to the top of the discard pile to end their turn.\n\n====Melding====\nIf a player has three cards of the same suit in a sequence (called a sequence or a run), they may meld by laying these cards, face up, in front of them. If they have at least three cards of the same value, they may meld a group (also called a set or a book). Aces can be played as high or low or both, for example {{cards|Qs|Ks|As}, {{cards|As|2s|3s}} and {{cards|Ks|As|2s}} are legal. Melding is optional. A player may choose, for reasons of strategy, not to meld on a particular turn. The most important reason is to be able to declare \"rummy\" later in the game. If a run lies in the discard pile, such as 2-3-4, you cannot call rummy without taking all cards below the top card of said run.\n\n====Laying off====\nA player may also choose to \"lay off\" some cards on an existing meld. This means that if a player can add to a sequence or a group that is in front of them or any of the other players, they may do so. Another variation is that they cannot \"lay off\" unless they have already played a set of 3 or a run. For example: if another player had a sequence consisting of {{cards|Ah|2h|3h}} in front of them, the player would be able to add the {{cards|4h}}, or {{cards|4h|5h}}, and so on, thereby continuing the sequence. Some variations allow players to play the {{cards|Kh}} and wrap around.\n\n====Discarding====\nFinally, after any melds or lay offs, the player must discard a single card to the discard pile, face up. If the player drew from the discard pile instead of the stock on this turn, they may not replace the same card on top of the discard pile but must discard a different card.\n\n====Exhausting the stock====\nIf, while playing, the stock runs out, the next player may choose to draw from the discard pile or to turn the discard pile over to form a new stock. The discard pile is not shuffled in the process. After forming the new stock, the top card is drawn to form the new discard pile, just like after the deal. The player can call rummy if a point is discarded into the discard pile. They cannot however call rummy if the card becomes a point while in the discard pile.\n\n====Going out====\nWhen a player has gotten rid of all of their cards, they win the hand. There are two variations. Either the player must discard the last remaining card in their hand on the last turn, or they need not. Playing with this rule makes ending a hand slightly more difficult.\n\nFor example, if a player has only {{cards|7d|8d}} left in their hand, and they draw {{cards|9d}} (forming a sequence), then whether they win the hand or not depends on if they are playing the discard rule variation.  If they are playing this variation, they can not win the hand at this point, because they have to finish the turn by discarding one of the three cards in their hand, causing them to no longer have a sequence. However, if the player is allowed to lay off this sequence without a final discard, then the game ends when the player lays down the sequence.  And a player can lay down cards afterwards. A player may win if rummy is discarded as the last card. You may also pick up from the discard pile and discard that card only if it is with another card. The player that goes out first gets extra 10 points.\n\n===Declaring rummy===\nIf a player is able to meld all of their cards at once, they may say \"rummy\" on their turn and go out. To declare rummy, a player must not have melded or laid off any cards prior during the hand. If playing with the discard rule, they must also discard after melding. If a player goes rummy when a card can be played, that player is out for that turn. Game players are still in game but the hand goes dead.  Playing for rummy is more risky, but it carries the reward of double the score. Each player must wait until their second turn to go out. If there is a rummy lying in the pile, the player who called \"rummy\" can play that card while the player who laid the rummy must then draw 2 cards from the stock pile or pick up the entire discarded pile.\n\n===Scoring===\nAfter a player goes out, the hand ends, and the players count up their cards. Any cards left in each player's hand are counted up and added to the winner's score. The face cards count as 10 each, number cards as their face value, and aces as one. There are many variations. Common ones include counting an ace as 11 or 15.\n\n===Variations===\n[[File:Rommee1.jpg|thumb|Melding with a joker]]\nIn some instances, jokers are used as wildcards and can represent any card value when melding.<ref name=\"pagat\">{{cite web | url=http://www.pagat.com/rummy/rummy.html | title=Rules of Rummy | publisher=Pagat | accessdate=27 December 2015}}</ref> They can be used in sets or runs but can not be replaced when 'melded', nor can a player lay off a card to replace it by themselves or their opponent. Jokers are not counted during the scoring.\n\nIn other variations, such as [[rummy 500]] and [[treppenromm\u00e9]], discards are placed so that all the cards are visible. At the beginning of his or her turn, a player may take any card from the discard pile, so long as they also pick up all the cards that are on top of it, and the last card picked up is played immediately.  If only picking up the top card, the player must keep it and discard a different card from their hand.\n\nIn a variation called ''block rummy'', players do not continue after going through the pack once \u2013 if no players are out, they all lose the points in their hands after the pack has been gone through once. ''Round the corner rummy'', also called ''continuity rummy'', is a variant where an ace may be simultaneously high and low to \"wrap around\" in a run, as in the following meld: Q-K-A-2.\n\n==Related card games==\nThere are a large number of games derived from rummy. Although in North America the word ''rummy'' is often used as a stand-in for the specific game [[gin rummy]], the term is applicable to a large family of games, including [[canasta]], [[mahjong]] and [[rummikub]].\n\n===Melding family===\n\nThe most basic form where play continues until the stock is exhausted or a player achieves a specific number of points. Different cards (and melds in some games) are worth specific points. In some variations the first meld must meet minimum point requirements or the final meld must include a discard. Some of these are played for four players in partnerships of two. In most variations players may extensively add to or even rearrange their cards.\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n*[[500 Rum]]\n*5000 Rum\n*[[Bing rummy]]\n*[[Continental (card game)|Continental]]\n*Cuajo\n*[[Desmoche]]\n*[[German Rummy]]\n*[[Indian Marriage]]\n*Indonesian rummy (''remi'')\n*[[Machiavelli (Italian card game)|Machiavelli]]\n*[[Marriage (card game)|Marriage]]\n*Red three rummy\n*[[Panguingue]]\n*[[Penang rummy]]\n*[[:it:Scala 40|Scala 40]]\n*[[Seven bridge]]\n*[[Shanghai rum]]\n*[[Ten pennies]]\n*[[Three thirteen]]\n*[[Tong-its]]\n*[[Treppenromm\u00e9]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Contract family===\nIn contract rummy, players are either assigned specific objectives (known or unknown to the other players) or decides their own objectives and announces them before play begins.

Her hair became a source of great shame. But she quickly moves beyond the personal to examine African hair in wider contexts, such as in the period of [[American slavery]], and back to [[pre-colonial Africa]]. She writes that hair in Africa represented a complex visual language, which could indicate various things, such as religion, social status, marital status, and more; and that caring for one another's hair was a neutral form of bonding, before colonialism set a monetary value on how people spent their time.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nShe discusses how during slavery hair represented a rare form of freedom for slave women, and moves forward to the modern day and how [[cultural appropriation]] is expressed through hair. (Emma Dabiri does not have any slave ancestry whatsoever).

It was here that she was first spotted by a modeling scout, and later became known to television makers, leading to her hosting three series of [[BBC Four]]'s ''[[Britain's Lost Masterpieces]]'', Channel 4 documentaries such as ''Is Love Racist?'', and a radio show about [[Afrofuturism]], and ''The Six O'Clock Show'' on [[Virgin Media One]], among others.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite news|url=https://www.irishcentral.com/culture/entertainment/irish-rising-stars-2019|title=Irish writer and actor among the rising stars of 2019|date=11 January 2019|work=Irish Central|accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nDabiri is a frequent contributor to print and online media, including [[The Guardian]], [[Irish Times]], Dublin Enquirer, [[Vice (magazine)|Vice]], and others.<ref>{{cite web |title=Emma Dabiri |url=https://muckrack.com/emma-dabiri/articles |website=Muck Rack |accessdate=29 April 2019}}</ref> She has also published in academic journals.

She is married and has two children.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== ''Don't Touch My Hair'' ==\nIn her book, Dabiri recounts that not only was a great deal of the racism directed at her as a child centered on her hair (one friend called her hair \"pubes\", for example), but the fact that she didn't know any other people of African descent meant that she didn't know how to handle her hair, having neither the knowledge nor the tool. Her hair became a source of great shame. But she quickly moves beyond the personal to examine African hair in wider contexts, such as in the period of [[American slavery]], and back to [[pre-colonial Africa]]. She writes that hair in Africa represented a complex visual language, which could indicate various things, such as religion, social status, marital status, and more; and that caring for one another's hair was a neutral form of bonding, before colonialism set a monetary value on how people spent their time.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nShe discusses how during slavery hair represented a rare form of freedom for slave women, and moves forward to the modern day and how [[cultural appropriation]] is expressed through hair. (Emma Dabiri does not have any slave ancestry whatsoever). Finally, she also talks about [[decolonizing]] and how this concept relates to African hair.<ref name=\":2\">{{cite news |last1=de Waal |first1=Kit |title=Don't Touch My Hair review: A call to arms for black African culture |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/don-t-touch-my-hair-review-a-call-to-arms-for-black-african-culture-1.3858531 |accessdate=29 April 2019 |work=Irish Times |date=27 April 2019}}</ref> She is critical of natural hair discourse that ignores wider contexts, such as anti-consumerism, and point to the Black Panther and Black Pride movements of the 1970s as being truly politically radical, and rejecting beauty standards, especially European ones, in a way today's mainstream discourse fails to do.<ref>{{cite news |title=Don't Touch My Hair by Emma Dabiri review \u2013 groundbreaking |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/apr/23/dont-touch-my-hair-emma-dabiri-review |accessdate=29 April 2019 |work=The Guardian |date=23 April 2019}}</ref>\n\n== Publications ==\n* ''Don't Touch My Hair'', Allen Lane (an imprint of Penguin), London, Hardback {{ISBN|9780241308349}} Ebook {{ISBN|9780141986296}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb name}}\n* {{Twitter|EmmaDabiri}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Dabiri, Emma}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2019}}\n\n\n[[Category:Year of birth missing (living people)]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Irish women writers]]\n[[Category:Irish television presenters]]\n[[Category:Irish radio personalities]]\n[[Category:Irish expatriates in the United States]]\n[[Category:Irish expatriates in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Irish people of Yoruba descent]]\n[[Category:Alumni of SOAS University of London]]\n[[Category:Yoruba women writers]]\n[[Category:Yoruba television personalities]]\n[[Category:Irish people of Nigerian descent]]\n", "name_user": "Truthbomb99", "label": "safe", "comment": "She is part time, source states marital status.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Dabiri"}
