It is often prepared as a cold [[soup]], popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add [[bread]]. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with [[lettuce]] or [[carrot]]s.\n\nA thicker variation is sometimes known as \"dry tarator\" , or as \"''Snezhanka''\" salad (\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430\"), which means \"[[Snow white salad]]\", and is served as an appetizer or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water.  The cucumbers, garlic, minced [[walnuts]], [[salt]] and vegetable oil are then added. \n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], tarator is a popular meze (appetizer) but is also served as a side dish along with [[Shopska salad]] with most meals. [[Sunflower oil]] and [[Olive oil]] are more commonly used, and the [[walnut]]s are sometimes omitted. Tarator is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It's a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\n\nIn [[Albania]], tarator is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yoghurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with Tarator.\n\n===Cyprus===\nIn [[Cyprus]], the dish is known as \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\" (talattouri)<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Susanna|title=The olive and the caper: adventures in Greek cooking|year=2004|publisher=Workman|isbn=978-1-56305-848-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa|url-access=registration}}</ref> and is not a soup like Bulgarian tarator but more of a dipping sauce. \n\nIt is made from strained yogurt,  sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves and sprinkled with oregano and sometimes olive oil.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn [[Iraq]], ''jajeek'' is often served as [[meze]].<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/> It may  accompany alcoholic drinks, especially [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an [[Ouzo]]-like drink made from [[Date Palm|dates]]. In [[Iran]] it is known as ''mast o khiar''.<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/>\n\n===Similar dishes===\nA variation in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] mountains, called ovdukh, uses [[kefir]] instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and [[ham]] to create a variation of [[okroshka]], sometimes referred to as a 'Caucasus okroshka'. [[Mizeria]] is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.\n\nIn South Asia a similar dish is made with yoghurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called [[raita]].\n\nIn Iran, [[ash-e doogh]] is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as [[basil]], [[leek]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[black pepper]] and [[raisin]]s. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold borscht]]\n* [[Dipping sauce#List of common dips]]\n* [[List of hors d'oeuvre]]\n* [[List of yogurt-based dishes and beverages]]\n* [[List of dairy products]]\n* [[Qatiq]]\n* [[Raita]]\n* [[Snow white salad]]\n* [[Toum]]\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yogurts}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n{{Cuisine of the Mediterranean}}\n\n[[Category:Appetizers]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Cold soups]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Dips (food)]]\n[[Category:Fermented dairy products]]\n[[Category:Greek cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meze]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sauces]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish soups]]\n[[Category:Western Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:White sauces]]\n[[Category:Yogurt-based dishes]]\n", "text_old": "{{pp-pc1}}\n{{short description|Cold cucumber-yogurt soup}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2011}}\n{{Infobox prepared food\n| name             = Tzatziki\n| image = Cacik-1.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption          = \n| alternate_name   = \n| country          = [[Ottoman Empire]]\n| creator          = \n| course           = [[Appetizer]], [[side dish]], [[meze]]\n| type             = [[Dip (food)|Dip]] or [[soup]]\n| served           = Cold\n| main_ingredient  = [[Strained yogurt]], [[cucumber]]s, [[garlic]], [[olive oil]], [[salt]], sometimes [[lemon juice]], [[dill]], [[mentha|mint]], or [[parsley]]\n| variations       = With strained or diluted yoghurt and other herbs and vegetables\n| calories         = \n| other            = \n}}\n'''Tzatziki''', '''cac\u0131k''' or '''tarator''' is a [[Dip (food)|dip]], [[soup]], or [[sauce]] found in the cuisines of Southeast Europe and the Middle East.

It is often prepared as a cold [[soup]], popular in the summer. It is made of yogurt, cucumber, garlic, walnut, dill, vegetable oil, and water, and is served chilled or even with ice. Local variations may replace yogurt with water and vinegar, omit nuts or dill, or add [[bread]]. The cucumbers may on rare occasions be replaced with [[lettuce]] or [[carrot]]s.\n\nA thicker variation is sometimes known as \"dry tarator\" , or as \"''Snezhanka''\" salad (\u0441\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0442\u0430 \"\u0421\u043d\u0435\u0436\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0430\"), which means \"[[Snow white salad]]\", and is served as an appetizer or side dish. During preparation, the yogurt is hung for several hours in a kerchief and loses about half of its water.  The cucumbers, garlic, minced [[walnuts]], [[salt]] and vegetable oil are then added. \n\nIn [[Bulgaria]], tarator is a popular meze (appetizer) but is also served as a side dish along with [[Shopska salad]] with most meals. [[Sunflower oil]] and [[Olive oil]] are more commonly used, and the [[walnut]]s are sometimes omitted. Tarator is seasoned with garlic and dill, both of which can be omitted. It's a popular dish in Bulgaria and a common refresher during the summer.\n\nIn [[Albania]], tarator is a very popular dish in the summertime. It is usually served cold and is normally made from yoghurt, garlic, parsley, cucumber, salt and olive oil. Fried squid is often offered with Tarator.\n\n===Cyprus===\nIn [[Cyprus]], the dish is known as \"\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03c4\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\" (talattouri)<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoffman|first=Susanna|title=The olive and the caper: adventures in Greek cooking|year=2004|publisher=Workman|isbn=978-1-56305-848-6|pages=[https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa/page/149 149]|url=https://archive.org/details/olivecaper00susa|url-access=registration}}</ref> and is not a soup like Bulgarian tarator but more of a dipping sauce. \n\nIt is made from strained yogurt,  sliced cucumbers, minced garlic cloves and sprinkled with oregano and sometimes olive oil.\n\n===Middle East===\nIn [[Iraq]], ''jajeek'' is often served as [[meze]].<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/> It may  accompany alcoholic drinks, especially [[Arak (distilled beverage)|Arak]], an [[Ouzo]]-like drink made from [[Date Palm|dates]]. In [[Iran]] it is known as ''mast o khiar''.<ref name=\"Marks 2010\"/>\n\n===Similar dishes===\nA variation in the [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]] mountains, called ovdukh, uses [[kefir]] instead of the yogurt. This can be poured over a mixture of vegetables, eggs and [[ham]] to create a variation of [[okroshka]], sometimes referred to as a 'Caucasus okroshka'. [[Mizeria]] is another variation from Poland, using the same ingredients but substituting sour cream for yogurt.\n\nIn South Asia a similar dish is made with yoghurt, cucumber, salt and ground cumin (sometimes also including onions) called [[raita]].\n\nIn Iran, [[ash-e doogh]] is another type of yogurt soup; instead of cucumbers it contains a variety of herbs such as [[basil]], [[leek]], [[Mentha|mint]], [[black pepper]] and [[raisin]]s. In this style, sometimes dried bread chips, chopped nuts or raisins are put in the dish just before serving.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cold borscht]]\n* [[Dipping sauce#List of common dips]]\n* [[List of hors d'oeuvre]]\n* [[List of yogurt-based dishes and beverages]]\n* [[List of dairy products]]\n* [[Qatiq]]\n* [[Raita]]\n* [[Snow white salad]]\n* [[Toum]]\n{{portal bar|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Yogurts}}\n{{Cuisine of Greece}}\n{{Cuisine of the Mediterranean}}\n\n[[Category:Appetizers]]\n[[Category:Assyrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Bulgarian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Cold soups]]\n[[Category:Cypriot cuisine]]\n[[Category:Dips (food)]]\n[[Category:Fermented dairy products]]\n[[Category:Greek cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iranian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Iraqi cuisine]]\n[[Category:Jordanian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Lebanese cuisine]]\n[[Category:Levantine cuisine]]\n[[Category:Meze]]\n[[Category:Palestinian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Sauces]]\n[[Category:Syrian cuisine]]\n[[Category:Turkish soups]]\n[[Category:Western Armenian cuisine]]\n[[Category:White sauces]]\n[[Category:Yogurt-based dishes]]\n", "name_user": "Houraisan", "label": "safe", "comment": "\"Cac\u0131k\" is a more common name, since its place of origin is the Ottoman Empire.

Techniques can include [[reforestation]], [[pest control]], [[nitrification]] and [[denitrification]], [[irrigation]], [[coppicing]] and [[hedge laying]].\n\nGame keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well-being of game and may include the killing of other animals which share the same [[Ecological niche|niche]] or predators to maintain a high population of more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', [[Aldo Leopold]], one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \"the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\".\n\nPest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife, farmers, game keepers or human safety. In the United States, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wildlife management is undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the [[Forestry Commission]], Charities such as the [[RSPB]] and [[The Wildlife Trusts]] and privately hired [[gamekeeper]]s and contractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act]] 1981. The UK government also give [[Subsidy farming|farmers subsidies]] through the [[Countryside Stewardship Scheme]] to improve the conservation value of their farms.\n\n==History==\n===Game laws===\n{{Main|Game law}}\n\nThe history of wildlife management begins with the game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). In Britain game laws developed out of the [[forest laws]], which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under [[William the Conqueror]], it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game.\n\nThe [[Game Act 1831|Game Act of 1831]] protected [[game birds]] by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of [[gamekeeper]]s around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.state.co.us/NR/rdonlyres/4557FC8F-2737-452F-8F56-C3C4759244BE/0/WILDLIFE_CONSERVATION_MANAGEMENT.pdf|title=Wildlife Conservation Management}}</ref>\n[[File:Phasianus colchicus 2 tom (Lukasz Lukasik).jpg|right|thumb|The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales]]\n\nEarly game laws were also enacted in the US; in 1839 [[Rhode Island]] closed the hunting season for white-tailed deer from May to November.<ref name=\"Bolen, Eric G. 1999\">Bolen, Eric G., Robinson, William. (1999). Wildlife Ecology and Management. Prentice Hall.</ref> Other regulations during this time focused primarily on restricting hunting. At this time, lawmakers did not consider population sizes or the need for preservation or restoration of wildlife habitats.<ref name=\"Bolen, Eric G. 1999\"/>\n\n===Emergence of wildlife conservation===\n{{Main|Wildlife conservation}}\n\nThe late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G.

The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007}}</ref> The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the [[ornithologist]] Professor [[Alfred Newton]].<ref name=\"milestones\"/>\n\nThe [[National Trust]] formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\" On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of [[Wicken Fen]] with a donation from the amateur naturalist [[Charles Rothschild]], establishing the first nature reserve in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wicken.org.uk/|title=Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve|publisher=Wicken Fen}}.</ref> Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at [[Woodwalton Fen]], near [[Huntingdon]], in 1910.<ref>[http://www.wildlifebcnp.org/whats-new-story360.htm Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough]</ref> During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at [[Ashton Wold]]<ref name = \"Pevsner\">{{Cite book | author=Pevsner, Nikolaus| authorlink= | title=The Buildings of England \u2013 Northamptonshire| year=1961 | publisher=Yale University Press | location=London and New Haven | isbn=978-0-300-09632-3 | pages=94\u20135}}</ref> in [[Northamptonshire]] to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]].\n\nDuring the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist [[natural history|naturalists]] and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in [[Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]]. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish [[nature reserve]]s in the geographical areas they served.\n\n===Wildlife management in the US===\nThe profession of wildlife management was established in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s by [[Aldo Leopold]] and others who sought to transcend the purely restrictive policies of the previous generation of conservationists, such as anti-hunting activist [[William T. Hornaday]]. Leopold and his close associate [[Herbert Stoddard]], who had both been trained in scientific forestry, argued that modern science and technology could be used to restore and improve wildlife habitat and thus produce abundant \"crops\" of ducks, deer, and other valued wild animals.\n\nThe institutional foundations of the profession of wildlife management were established in the 1930s, when Leopold was granted the first university professorship in wildlife management (1933, [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]), when Leopold's textbook 'Game Management' was published (1933), when [[The Wildlife Society]] was founded, when the Journal of Wildlife Management began publishing, and when the first Cooperative Wildlife Research Units were established. Conservationists planned many projects throughout the 1940s. Some of which included the harvesting of female mammals such as deer to decrease rising populations. Others included waterfowl and wetland research. The Fish and Wildlife Management Act was put in place to urge farmers to plant food for wildlife and to provide cover for them.\n\nIn 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) was passed in the U.S.. This law was an important advancement in the field of wildlife management. It placed a 10% tax on sales of guns and ammunition. The funds generated were then distributed to the states for use in wildlife management activities and research. This law is still in effect today.\n\nWildlife management grew after World War II with the help of the GI Bill and a postwar boom in recreational hunting. An important step in wildlife management in the United States national parks occurred after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. In 1963, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management. In a paper known as the [[Leopold Report]], the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended active management of Yellowstone's elk population.<ref>Leopold, A. Starker, ''et al''. 1963. \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/leopold/leopold4.htm The Goal of Park Management in the United States]\". ''Wildlife Management in the National Parks''. [[National Park Service]]. Retrieved on September 19, 2009.</ref>\n\n[[Elk]] overpopulation in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] is thought by many wildlife biologists, such as Douglas Smith, to have been primarily caused by the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of wolves from the park and surrounding environs. After wolves were removed, elk herds increased in population, reaching new highs during the mid-1930s. The increased number of elk apparently resulted in overgrazing in parts of Yellowstone. Park officials decided that the elk herd should be managed. For approximately thirty years, the park elk herds were culled: Each year some were captured and shipped to other locations, a certain number were killed by park rangers, and hunters were allowed to take more elk that migrated outside the park. By the late 1960s the herd populations dropped to historic lows (less than 4,000 for the Northern Range herd). This caused outrage among both conservationists and hunters. The park service stopped culling elk in 1968. The elk population then rebounded. Twenty years later there were 19,000 elk in the Northern Range herd, a historic high.\n\nSince the tumultuous 1970s, when [[animal rights]] activists and [[environmentalist]]s began to challenge some aspects of wildlife management, the profession has been overshadowed by the rise of [[conservation biology]]. Although wildlife managers remain central to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and other wildlife conservation policies, conservation biologists have shifted the focus of conservation away from wildlife management's concern with the protection and restoration of single species and toward the maintenance of ecosystems and [[biodiversity]].\n\n==Types of wildlife management==\nThere are two general types of wildlife management:\n\n* '''Manipulative management''' acts on a population, either changing its numbers by direct means or influencing numbers by the indirect means of altering food supply, habitat, density of predators, or prevalence of disease. This is appropriate when a population is to be harvested, or when it slides to an unacceptably low density or increases to an unacceptably high level. Such densities are inevitably the subjective view of the land owner, and may be disputed by [[animal welfare]] interests.\n* '''Custodial management''' is preventive or protective. The aim is to minimize external influences on the population and its habitat. It is appropriate in a national park where one of the stated goals is to protect ecological processes. It is also appropriate for conservation of a threatened species where the threat is of external origin rather than being intrinsic to the system. [[Do not feed the animals|Feeding of animals by visitors]] is generally discouraged.\n\n==Opposition==\nThe control of wildlife through killing and hunting has been criticized by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] activists.<ref name=LACS1>[http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1594&ArticleID=1660 League Against Cruel Sports - Consequences of the Shoot]</ref> Critics object to the real or perceived [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] involved in some forms of wildlife management. They also argue against the deliberate breeding of certain animals by [[Environmental organization|environmental organisations]]\u2014who hunters pay money to kill\u2014in pursuit of profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/|title=Hunting|date=2010-06-24|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Additionally, they draw attention to the attitude that it is acceptable to kill animals in the name of ecosystem or biodiversity preservation, yet it is seen as unacceptable to kill humans for the same purpose; asserting that such attitudes are a form of discrimination based on species-membership i.e. [[speciesism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/animals-used-for-entertainment-and-as-companions-introduction/hunting/|title=Hunting|last=Ethics|first=Animal|date=2016-03-29|website=Animal Ethics|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have also opposed hunting where they believe it is unnecessary or will negatively affect biodiversity.<ref name=\"RSPB1\">[http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/campaigns/birdsofprey/threatened.asp RSPB - Which birds are threatened]</ref> Critics of game keeping note that habitat manipulation and predator control are often used to maintain artificially inflated populations of valuable game animals (including introduced exotics) without regard to the ecological integrity of the habitat.\n\nGame keepers in the UK claim it to be necessary for wildlife conservation as the amount of countryside they look after exceeds by a factor of nine the amount in nature reserves and national parks.<ref>[http://www.gamekeeperstrust.org.uk/ National Gamekeepers' Organisation Charitable Trust]</ref>'''\n\n==Management of hunting seasons==\nWildlife management studies, research and lobbying by interest groups help designate times of the year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and bag limits are determined by guidelines set by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and bag limits for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers.\n\nOpen and closed season on deer in the UK is legislated for in the [[Deer Act 1991]] and the [[Deer Act (Scotland) 1996]].\n\n===Open season===\n[[Hunting season|Open season]] is when wildlife is allowed to be hunted by law and is usually not during the [[breeding season]]. Hunters may be restricted by sex, age or class of animal, for instance there may be an open season for any male deer with 4 points or better on at least one side.\n\n===Limited entry===\nWhere the number of animals taken is to be tightly controlled, managers may have a type of lottery system called limited. Many apply, few are chosen. These hunts may still have age, sex or class restrictions.\n\n===Closed season===\nClosed season is when wildlife is protected from hunting and is usually during its breeding season. Closed season is enforced by law, any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or [[poaching]].\n\n===Type of weapon used===\nIn wildlife management one of the conservation principles is that the weapon used for hunting should be the one that causes the least damage to the animal and is sufficiently effective so that it hits the target.

Techniques can include [[reforestation]], [[pest control]], [[nitrification]] and [[denitrification]], [[irrigation]], [[coppicing]] and [[hedge laying]].\n\nGame keeping is the management or control of wildlife for the well-being of game and may include the killing of other animals which share the same [[Ecological niche|niche]] or predators to maintain a high population of more profitable species, such as pheasants introduced into woodland. In his 1933 book ''Game Management'', [[Aldo Leopold]], one of the pioneers of wildlife management as a science, defined it as \"the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use\".\n\nPest control is the control of real or perceived pests and can be used for the benefit of wildlife, farmers, game keepers or human safety. In the United States, wildlife management practices are often implemented by a governmental agency to uphold a law, such as the Endangered Species Act.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, wildlife management is undertaken by several organizations including government bodies such as the [[Forestry Commission]], Charities such as the [[RSPB]] and [[The Wildlife Trusts]] and privately hired [[gamekeeper]]s and contractors. Legislation has also been passed to protect wildlife such as the [[Wildlife and Countryside Act]] 1981. The UK government also give [[Subsidy farming|farmers subsidies]] through the [[Countryside Stewardship Scheme]] to improve the conservation value of their farms.\n\n==History==\n===Game laws===\n{{Main|Game law}}\n\nThe history of wildlife management begins with the game laws, which regulated the right to kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). In Britain game laws developed out of the [[forest laws]], which in the time of the Norman kings were very oppressive. Under [[William the Conqueror]], it was as great a crime to kill one of the king's deer as to kill one of his subjects. A certain rank and standing, or the possession of a certain amount of property, were for a long time qualifications indispensably necessary to confer upon any one the right of pursuing and killing game.\n\nThe [[Game Act 1831|Game Act of 1831]] protected [[game birds]] by establishing close seasons when they could not be legally taken. The act made it lawful to take game only with the provision of a game licence and provided for the appointment of [[gamekeeper]]s around the country. The purposes of the law was to balance the needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wildlife.state.co.us/NR/rdonlyres/4557FC8F-2737-452F-8F56-C3C4759244BE/0/WILDLIFE_CONSERVATION_MANAGEMENT.pdf|title=Wildlife Conservation Management}}</ref>\n[[File:Phasianus colchicus 2 tom (Lukasz Lukasik).jpg|right|thumb|The Game Act 1831 protects game birds in England and Wales]]\n\nEarly game laws were also enacted in the US; in 1839 [[Rhode Island]] closed the hunting season for white-tailed deer from May to November.<ref name=\"Bolen, Eric G. 1999\">Bolen, Eric G., Robinson, William. (1999). Wildlife Ecology and Management. Prentice Hall.</ref> Other regulations during this time focused primarily on restricting hunting. At this time, lawmakers did not consider population sizes or the need for preservation or restoration of wildlife habitats.<ref name=\"Bolen, Eric G. 1999\"/>\n\n===Emergence of wildlife conservation===\n{{Main|Wildlife conservation}}\n\nThe late 19th century saw the passage of the first pieces of wildlife conservation legislation and the establishment of the first nature conservation societies. The [[Sea Birds Preservation Act 1869|Sea Birds Preservation Act of 1869]] was passed in Britain as the first nature protection law in the world<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3540740023|title=Coastal Dunes: Ecology and Conservation|author=G.

The group gained popularity and eventually amalgamated with the Fur and Feather League in Croydon to form the RSPB.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=RSPB |accessdate=19 February 2007}}</ref> The Society attracted growing support from the suburban middle-classes as well as support from many other influential figures, such as the [[ornithologist]] Professor [[Alfred Newton]].<ref name=\"milestones\"/>\n\nThe [[National Trust]] formed in 1895 with the manifesto to \"...promote the permanent preservation, for the benefit of the nation, of lands, ...to preserve (so far practicable) their natural aspect.\" On 1 May 1899, the Trust purchased two acres of [[Wicken Fen]] with a donation from the amateur naturalist [[Charles Rothschild]], establishing the first nature reserve in Britain.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wicken.org.uk/|title=Wicken Fen National Nature Reserve|publisher=Wicken Fen}}.</ref> Rothschild was a pioneer of wildlife conservation in Britain, and went on to establish many other nature reserves, such as one at [[Woodwalton Fen]], near [[Huntingdon]], in 1910.<ref>[http://www.wildlifebcnp.org/whats-new-story360.htm Wildlife Trust for Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Northamptonshire and Peterborough]</ref> During his lifetime he built and managed his estate at [[Ashton Wold]]<ref name = \"Pevsner\">{{Cite book | author=Pevsner, Nikolaus| authorlink= | title=The Buildings of England \u2013 Northamptonshire| year=1961 | publisher=Yale University Press | location=London and New Haven | isbn=978-0-300-09632-3 | pages=94\u20135}}</ref> in [[Northamptonshire]] to maximise its suitability for wildlife, especially butterflies. Concerned about the loss of wildlife habitats, in 1912 he set up the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, the forerunner of [[The Wildlife Trusts partnership]].\n\nDuring the society's early years, membership tended to be made up of specialist [[natural history|naturalists]] and its growth was comparatively slow. The first independent Trust was formed in Norfolk in 1926 as the Norfolk Naturalists Trust, followed in 1938 by the Pembrokeshire Bird Protection Society which after several subsequent changes of name is now the Wildlife Trust of South and West Wales and it was not until the 1940s and 1950s that more Naturalists' Trusts were formed in [[Yorkshire]], [[Lincolnshire]], [[Leicestershire]] and [[Cambridgeshire]]. These early Trusts tended to focus on purchasing land to establish [[nature reserve]]s in the geographical areas they served.\n\n===Wildlife management in the US===\nThe profession of wildlife management was established in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s by [[Aldo Leopold]] and others who sought to transcend the purely restrictive policies of the previous generation of conservationists, such as anti-hunting activist [[William T. Hornaday]]. Leopold and his close associate [[Herbert Stoddard]], who had both been trained in scientific forestry, argued that modern science and technology could be used to restore and improve wildlife habitat and thus produce abundant \"crops\" of ducks, deer, and other valued wild animals.\n\nThe institutional foundations of the profession of wildlife management were established in the 1930s, when Leopold was granted the first university professorship in wildlife management (1933, [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]), when Leopold's textbook 'Game Management' was published (1933), when [[The Wildlife Society]] was founded, when the Journal of Wildlife Management began publishing, and when the first Cooperative Wildlife Research Units were established. Conservationists planned many projects throughout the 1940s. Some of which included the harvesting of female mammals such as deer to decrease rising populations. Others included waterfowl and wetland research. The Fish and Wildlife Management Act was put in place to urge farmers to plant food for wildlife and to provide cover for them.\n\nIn 1937, the Federal Aid in Wildlife Restoration Act (also known as the Pittman-Robertson Act) was passed in the U.S.. This law was an important advancement in the field of wildlife management. It placed a 10% tax on sales of guns and ammunition. The funds generated were then distributed to the states for use in wildlife management activities and research. This law is still in effect today.\n\nWildlife management grew after World War II with the help of the GI Bill and a postwar boom in recreational hunting. An important step in wildlife management in the United States national parks occurred after several years of public controversy regarding the forced reduction of the elk population in [[Yellowstone National Park]]. In 1963, [[United States Secretary of the Interior]] [[Stewart Udall]] appointed an advisory board to collect scientific data to inform future wildlife management. In a paper known as the [[Leopold Report]], the committee observed that culling programs at other national parks had been ineffective, and recommended active management of Yellowstone's elk population.<ref>Leopold, A. Starker, ''et al''. 1963. \"[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/leopold/leopold4.htm The Goal of Park Management in the United States]\". ''Wildlife Management in the National Parks''. [[National Park Service]]. Retrieved on September 19, 2009.</ref>\n\n[[Elk]] overpopulation in [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] is thought by many wildlife biologists, such as Douglas Smith, to have been primarily caused by the [[Local extinction|extirpation]] of wolves from the park and surrounding environs. After wolves were removed, elk herds increased in population, reaching new highs during the mid-1930s. The increased number of elk apparently resulted in overgrazing in parts of Yellowstone. Park officials decided that the elk herd should be managed. For approximately thirty years, the park elk herds were culled: Each year some were captured and shipped to other locations, a certain number were killed by park rangers, and hunters were allowed to take more elk that migrated outside the park. By the late 1960s the herd populations dropped to historic lows (less than 4,000 for the Northern Range herd). This caused outrage among both conservationists and hunters. The park service stopped culling elk in 1968. The elk population then rebounded. Twenty years later there were 19,000 elk in the Northern Range herd, a historic high.\n\nSince the tumultuous 1970s, when [[animal rights]] activists and [[environmentalist]]s began to challenge some aspects of wildlife management, the profession has been overshadowed by the rise of [[conservation biology]]. Although wildlife managers remain central to the implementation of the Endangered Species Act and other wildlife conservation policies, conservation biologists have shifted the focus of conservation away from wildlife management's concern with the protection and restoration of single species and toward the maintenance of ecosystems and [[biodiversity]].\n\n==Types of wildlife management==\nThere are two general types of wildlife management:\n\n* '''Manipulative management''' acts on a population, either changing its numbers by direct means or influencing numbers by the indirect means of altering food supply, habitat, density of predators, or prevalence of disease. This is appropriate when a population is to be harvested, or when it slides to an unacceptably low density or increases to an unacceptably high level. Such densities are inevitably the subjective view of the land owner, and may be disputed by [[animal welfare]] interests.\n* '''Custodial management''' is preventive or protective. The aim is to minimize external influences on the population and its habitat. It is appropriate in a national park where one of the stated goals is to protect ecological processes. It is also appropriate for conservation of a threatened species where the threat is of external origin rather than being intrinsic to the system. [[Do not feed the animals|Feeding of animals by visitors]] is generally discouraged.\n\n==Opposition==\nThe control of wildlife through killing and hunting has been criticized by [[animal rights]] and [[animal welfare]] activists.<ref name=LACS1>[http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1594&ArticleID=1660 League Against Cruel Sports - Consequences of the Shoot]</ref> Critics object to the real or perceived [[Cruelty to animals|cruelty]] involved in some forms of wildlife management. They also argue against the deliberate breeding of certain animals by [[Environmental organization|environmental organisations]]\u2014who hunters pay money to kill\u2014in pursuit of profit.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-in-entertainment/cruel-sports/hunting/|title=Hunting|date=2010-06-24|website=PETA|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref> Additionally, they draw attention to the attitude that it is acceptable to kill animals in the name of ecosystem or biodiversity preservation, yet it is seen as unacceptable to kill humans for the same purpose; asserting that such attitudes are a form of discrimination based on species-membership i.e. [[speciesism]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.animal-ethics.org/animals-used-for-entertainment-and-as-companions-introduction/hunting/|title=Hunting|last=Ethics|first=Animal|date=2016-03-29|website=Animal Ethics|access-date=2019-10-11}}</ref>\n\n[[Environmentalism|Environmentalists]] have also opposed hunting where they believe it is unnecessary or will negatively affect biodiversity.<ref name=\"RSPB1\">[http://www.rspb.org.uk/supporting/campaigns/birdsofprey/threatened.asp RSPB - Which birds are threatened]</ref> Critics of game keeping note that habitat manipulation and predator control are often used to maintain artificially inflated populations of valuable game animals (including introduced exotics) without regard to the ecological integrity of the habitat.\n\nGame keepers in the UK claim it to be necessary for wildlife conservation as the amount of countryside they look after exceeds by a factor of nine the amount in nature reserves and national parks.<ref>[http://www.gamekeeperstrust.org.uk/ National Gamekeepers' Organisation Charitable Trust]</ref>'''\n\n==Management of hunting seasons==\nWildlife management studies, research and lobbying by interest groups help designate times of the year when certain wildlife species can be legally hunted, allowing for surplus animals to be removed. In the United States, hunting season and bag limits are determined by guidelines set by the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] for migratory game such as waterfowl and other migratory gamebirds. The hunting season and bag limits for state regulated game species such as deer are usually determined by State game Commissions, which are made up of representatives from various interest groups, wildlife biologists, and researchers.\n\nOpen and closed season on deer in the UK is legislated for in the [[Deer Act 1991]] and the [[Deer Act (Scotland) 1996]].\n\n===Open season===\n[[Hunting season|Open season]] is when wildlife is allowed to be hunted by law and is usually not during the [[breeding season]]. Hunters may be restricted by sex, age or class of animal, for instance there may be an open season for any male deer with 4 points or better on at least one side.\n\n===Limited entry===\nWhere the number of animals taken is to be tightly controlled, managers may have a type of lottery system called limited. Many apply, few are chosen. These hunts may still have age, sex or class restrictions.\n\n===Closed season===\nClosed season is when wildlife is protected from hunting and is usually during its breeding season. Closed season is enforced by law, any hunting during closed season is punishable by law and termed as illegal hunting or [[poaching]].\n\n===Type of weapon used===\nIn wildlife management one of the conservation principles is that the weapon used for hunting should be the one that causes the least damage to the animal and is sufficiently effective so that it hits the target. Given State and Local laws, types of weapon can also vary depending on type, size, sex of game and also the geographical layout of that specific hunting area.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Animals|Environment}} \n* [[Anti-hunting]]\n* [[British Association for Shooting and Conservation]]\n* [[Fisheries management]]\n* [[Game law]]\n* [[Game Warden]]\n* [[Goose egg addling]]\n* [[List of politically endorsed exterminations of animals]]\n* [[Nuisance wildlife management]]\n* [[Pest control]]\n* [[Range condition scoring]]\n* [[Rangeland management]]\n* [[Recreation resource planning]]\n* [[Reintroduction]]\n* [[Remote-controlled animal]]\n* [[Threshold host density]]\n* [[Wildlife conservation]]\n* [[International Anti-Poaching Foundation]]\n* [[Wildlife law in England and Wales]]\n* [[Wildlife crossing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Bolen, Eric G., Robinson, William.

He studied at the Imperial High School in Aleppo, and continued his studies at the Ottoman Law Academy of the prestigious M\u00fclkiye school in Constantinople.

Later, he joined the bureaucracy of the [[Ottoman Empire]], only to retire and manage his estates. One Syrian source from the [[United Arab Republic]] era indicates that having embraced nationalism when the [[Arab Revolt]] broke out in 1916, Hananu joined the Arab army of [[Faisal I]] and entered Aleppo with the Allies in 1918.<ref>Adham al-Jundi, ''Tarikh al-thawrat al-suriyya fi 'ahd al-intidab al-faransi'', Damascus, 1960.</ref> Supposedly, he also joined the secret nationalist society [[al-Fatat]], though there is no corroborating evidence for this. Along with many of the prominent merchants in Aleppo, Hananu became associated with the League of National Defense and the Arab Club of Aleppo.\n\n==The Hananu Revolt==\n{{main|Hananu Revolt}}\nBreaking out in the autumn of 1919 in the countryside surrounding Aleppo, when the French army had landed on the Syrian coast and was preparing to occupy all of Syria, Hananu launched his revolt, bringing [[Aleppo]], [[Idlib]] and [[Antioch]] into a coordinated campaign against French forces. Hananu was responsible for the disarmament of many French troops, the destruction of railroads and telegraph lines, the sabotage of tanks, and the foiling of French attacks on Aleppo. On July 23, 1920, when the French army successfully attacked Aleppo, Hananu was forced to retreat back to his village of [[Kafr Takharim Nahiyah]] and began to reorganize the revolt with [[:ar:\u0646\u062c\u064a\u0628 \u0639\u0648\u064a\u062f|Najeb Awad]]. The rebels decided to form a [[civilian government]] based in [[Armanaz Nahiyah|Armanaz]], and sent Hananu to Turkey as a representative of the new civilian government to request for aid in fighting against the French.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.discover-syria.com/news/13629#|title=\u0627\u0628\u0631\u0627\u0647\u064a\u0645 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0646\u0648 \"Ibrahim Hananu\"|last=Kaddour|first=Mohammad|date=1 April 2012|website=\u0627\u0643\u062a\u0634\u0641 \u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627 \"Discover Syria\"|publisher=|access-date=20 July 2016}}</ref> He received aid from the Turkish nationalist movement of [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], which was battling the French army of the [[Levant]] for control of [[Cilicia]] and southern [[Anatolia]]. With the withdrawal of Turkish military assistance following the signing of the [[Franklin-Bouillon Agreement]] in October 1921, Hananu and his men could no longer sustain a revolt, and their struggle collapsed. Despite the failure of the revolt, the organization of the northern areas of Syria with Turkish help has been interpreted as a prototype for self-government that Hananu and other Syrians built upon in later years.<ref>James Gelvin, Divided Loyalties: Nationalism and Mass Politics in Syria at the Close of the Empire, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA, 1998, pp. 133-134.</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nIn 1922 Ibrahim Hananu was arrested and presented to the French military criminal court on charges of criminal acts, and the first sessions was on 15 March 1922 . One of the best lawyers at that time, [[Fathallah Saqqal]] defended Hananu, advocated for Hananu's innocence, and argued that Hananu was a political opponent not a criminal.\n\nOn 25 March 1922 the French Attorney General requested the execution of Hananu, and he said \"if Hananu has seven heads I will cut them all\", but the French judge ultimately released Hananu following an agreement between him and the French government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.esyria.sy/eidleb/index.php?p=stories&category=characters&filename=2008082000150427|title=Ibrahim Hananu|last=Kanafani|first=Adnan|date=20 August 2008|website=Idleb website|publisher=|access-date=18 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Later Years==\nHananu was put under house arrest following the trial and his movements were monitored by the French intelligence. However, Hananu was released after the [[Great Syrian Revolt]] of 1925. Hananu went on to play an active role in the Syrian national movement. He was one of the founding fathers of the [[National Bloc (Syria)|National Bloc]] which steered the course of the independence struggle in Syria until its achievement in 1946.

Later, he joined the bureaucracy of the [[Ottoman Empire]], only to retire and manage his estates. One Syrian source from the [[United Arab Republic]] era indicates that having embraced nationalism when the [[Arab Revolt]] broke out in 1916, Hananu joined the Arab army of [[Faisal I]] and entered Aleppo with the Allies in 1918.<ref>Adham al-Jundi, Tarikh al-thawrat al-suriyya fi 'ahd al-intidab al-faransi, Damascus, 1960.</ref> Supposedly, he also joined the secret nationalist society [[al-Fatat]], though there is no corroborating evidence for this. Along with many of the prominent merchants in Aleppo, Hananu became associated with the League of National Defense and the Arab Club of Aleppo.\n\n==The Hananu Revolt==\n{{main|Hananu Revolt}}\nBreaking out in the autumn of 1919 in the countryside surrounding Aleppo, when the French army had landed on the Syrian coast and was preparing to occupy all of Syria, Hananu launched his revolt, bringing [[Aleppo]], [[Idlib]] and [[Antioch]] into a coordinated campaign against French forces. Hananu was responsible for the disarmament of many French troops, the destruction of railroads and telegraph lines, the sabotage of tanks, and the foiling of French attacks on Aleppo. On July 23, 1920, when the French army successfully attacked Aleppo, Hananu was forced to retreat back to his village of [[Kafr Takharim Nahiyah]] and began to reorganize the revolt with [[:ar:\u0646\u062c\u064a\u0628 \u0639\u0648\u064a\u062f|Najeb Awad]].

With the withdrawal of Turkish military assistance following the signing of the [[Franklin-Bouillon Agreement]] in October 1921, Hananu and his men could no longer sustain a revolt, and their struggle collapsed. Despite the failure of the revolt, the organization of the northern areas of Syria with Turkish help has been interpreted as a prototype for self-government that Hananu and other Syrians built upon in later years.<ref>James Gelvin, Divided Loyalties: Nationalism and Mass Politics in Syria at the Close of the Empire, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA, 1998, pp. 133-134.</ref>\n\n==Trial==\nIn 1922 Ibrahim Hananu was arrested and presented to the French military criminal court on charges of criminal acts, and the first sessions was on 15 March 1922 .

Born near [[Savannah, Georgia]] at [[Bonaventure Plantation]] in the early 1760s (he was the first native-born Georgian governor after the state was admitted into the Union) to Mary Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall, he studied at [[Eton School]] before joining [[Anthony Wayne]]'s troops at Ebenezer during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Smith, p. 343</ref>  After the war, he was elected brigadier general of the 1st Regiment in the [[Georgia Militia]].

Born near [[Savannah, Georgia]] at Bonaventure Plantation in the early 1760s (he was the first native-born Georgian governor after the state was admitted into the Union) to Mary Mullryne and Josiah Tattnall, he studied at [[Eton School]] before joining [[Anthony Wayne]]'s troops at Ebenezer during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref>Smith, p. 343</ref>  After the war, he was elected brigadier general of the 1st Regiment in the [[Georgia Militia]]. He helped to rescind the [[Yazoo land scandal|Yazoo land fraud of 1795]].<ref>Smith, p. 344</ref>  He died in [[Nassau, New Providence]].<ref>Smith, p. 344</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nAlong with his father-in-law, John Mullryne, Tattnall bought Bonaventure (Italian for \"good fortune\") plantation around 1764. Mullryne, who also built the third [[Tybee Lighthouse]] in 1773, established a small family graveyard on the grounds, which eventually formed the nucleus of the present-day [[Bonaventure Cemetery]]. Bonaventure was one of the largest structures in the colony of Georgia.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Pressly|first1=Paul M.|title=On the rim of the Caribbean : colonial Georgia and the British Atlantic world|date=2013|publisher=University of Georgia Press|location=Athens|isbn=9780820335674|page=190|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=e000xna&AN=516915&site=eds-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_190|accessdate=June 10, 2016}}</ref>\n\nTattnall and his family left Georgia at the outbreak of the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Josiah Tattnall joined the [[Continental army]] under General [[Anthony Wayne]], helping remove [[Capture of Savannah|Savannah]] from British rule. After the war, Tattnall bought back a portion of Bonaventure from [[John Habersham]] and continued his interest in the military. He commanded the Georgia militia in 1787 and led troops against the [[Creek Indians]] in 1788 and 1793. He was captain of the Chatham Artillery, the oldest militia unit in Georgia, and later colonel of an infantry regiment. President George Washington nominated him for marshal of Georgia in 1794.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Washington|first1=George|title=From George Washington to the United States Senate, 5 March 1794|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Washington/05-15-02-0251|website=Founders Online|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=May 17, 2016}}</ref> He was promoted to brigadier general shortly before his election as governor in 1801.\n\n==Political life==\n\nTattnall served his state as a member of the [[Georgia General Assembly]] from 1795 to 1796.

Jackson resigned his position as [[U.S. senator]] to return to the Georgia General Assembly, where he and Tattnall led the campaign against the sale of the Yazoo lands. After the Rescinding Act of 1796 was passed, Tattnall was elected by the General Assembly to take Jackson's Senate seat, where he served from 1796 to 1799.\n\nAfter serving in the U.S. Senate, Tattnall returned to Georgia and to his beloved Bonaventure. He was elected [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]], but only served for one year. During his administration, the [[University of Georgia]] (formerly [[Franklin College of Arts and Sciences|Franklin College]]) moved to its present campus in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], and the Hawkins Line was run by [[Benjamin Hawkins]], establishing Georgia's northern border with the [[Cherokee Nation]].

The couple had several children, but only three lived to adulthood.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;...

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting, the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff_(military)#British_and_Commonwealth_staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|[[Brockhaus Enzyklop\u00e4die]]}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

They were talked out of this by a Canadian engineer unit as Mittelsten's civilians were running an army sawmill.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=258}}\n\n===Post-war===\nIn early 1946 Vokes heard an appeal against the death sentence of [[Kurt Meyer]], a convicted German war criminal.
