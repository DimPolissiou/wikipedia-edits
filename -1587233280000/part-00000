In 1911, he was signed by D.W. Griffith. His first film for Griffith was ''The Sorrowful Shore'', a sea story.<ref name=bde2/>\n\nOne of his most popular roles was as the good-hearted outlaw Cheyenne Harry. The Cheyenne Harry franchise spanned two decades, from ''[[A Knight of the Range]]'' (1916) to ''Aces Wild'' (1936).<ref>Gallagher, Tag (1986); ''John Ford: The Man and His Films''; University of California Press, USA. See pp.502ff.</ref> Carey starred in director [[John Ford]]'s first feature film, ''[[Straight Shooting]]'' (1917).\n\nCarey's rugged frame and craggy features were well suited to westerns and outdoor adventures. When sound films arrived, Carey displayed an assured, gritty baritone voice that suited his rough-hewn screen personality. He was the logical choice for the title role in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s outdoor jungle epic ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]''. By this time Carey, already in his fifties, was too mature for most leading roles, and the only starring roles that he was offered were in low-budget westerns and [[serial (film)|serials]]. He soon settled into a comfortable career as a solid, memorable character actor; he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as the President of the Senate in the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''. Among his other notable later roles were that of M/Sgt.

Carey made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage debut in 1940, in ''Heavenly Express'' with [[John Garfield]].\n\n==Personal life==\nCarey married at least twice and possibly a third time.

He was contracted to make four films\u2014not only acting but also doing his own stunt work.<ref name=sbcs/> He is best remembered as one of the first stars of the [[Western film]] genre.\n\nIn 1909, Carey began working for the [[Biograph Company]]. In 1911, he was signed by D.W. Griffith. His first film for Griffith was ''The Sorrowful Shore'', a sea story.<ref name=bde2/>\n\nOne of his most popular roles was as the good-hearted outlaw Cheyenne Harry. The Cheyenne Harry franchise spanned two decades, from ''[[A Knight of the Range]]'' (1916) to ''Aces Wild'' (1936).<ref>Gallagher, Tag (1986); ''John Ford: The Man and His Films''; University of California Press, USA. See pp.502ff.</ref> Carey starred in director [[John Ford]]'s first feature film, ''[[Straight Shooting]]'' (1917).\n\nCarey's rugged frame and craggy features were well suited to westerns and outdoor adventures. When sound films arrived, Carey displayed an assured, gritty baritone voice that suited his rough-hewn screen personality. He was the logical choice for the title role in [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]'s outdoor jungle epic ''[[Trader Horn (1931 film)|Trader Horn]]''. By this time Carey, already in his fifties, was too mature for most leading roles, and the only starring roles that he was offered were in low-budget westerns and [[serial (film)|serials]]. He soon settled into a comfortable career as a solid, memorable character actor; he received an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for his role as the President of the Senate in the 1939 film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]''. Among his other notable later roles were that of M/Sgt. Robert White, crew chief of the bomber \"Mary Ann\" in the 1943 [[Howard Hawks]] film ''[[Air Force (film)|Air Force]]'' and Mr. Melville, the cattle buyer, in Hawks's ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]''. Carey made his [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage debut in 1940, in ''Heavenly Express'' with [[John Garfield]].\n\n==Personal life==\nCarey married at least twice and possibly a third time.

He is best known as a director of [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], especially starring [[Randolph Scott]] and [[John Wayne]]. He directed [[Gary Cooper]] in seven films.\n\n==Background==\nBorn '''Henri L\u00e9opold de Fiennes Hathaway''' in [[Sacramento, California]],<ref name=HHathawayBorn-LATimes>{{cite news|url=http://projects.latimes.com/hollywood/star-walk/henry-hathaway/|title=Hollywood Star Walk: Henry Hathaway|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}\n*<sup>a</sup> \"Born March 13, 1898 in Sacramento, CA.\" \u2014 \u00b6 1.</ref> he was the son of an American actor and stage manager, Rhody Hathaway (1868\u20131944), and a [[Austria-Hungary|Hungarian]]-born [[Belgium|Belgian]] aristocrat, the Marquise Lillie de Fiennes ([[Budapest]], 1876\u20131938), who acted under the name Jean Hathaway.\n\nThis branch of the De Fiennes family came to America in the 19th century on behalf of [[Leopold I of Belgium|King Leopold I of Belgium]] and was part of the negotiations with the Belgian Prime Minister, [[Charles Rogier]] (1800\u20131885), to secure the 1862 treaty <ref>{{cite web|url=http://hawaiiankingdom.org/treaty_belgium.shtml|title=Kingdom of Hawaii Treaty with Belgium - 1862|website=hawaiiankingdom.org}}</ref> between [[Belgium]] and what was then known as the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] and is now called [[Hawaii]].\n\nThe title 'Marquis', commissioned by the King of the Belgians, comes from his grandfather, Marquis Henri L\u00e9opold de Fiennes, who settled in [[San Francisco, California]] after failing to acquire the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] for his King.  Hathaway served in the [[United States Army]] during [[World War I]].\n\n==Early career==\nIn 1925, Hathaway began working in [[silent film]]s as an assistant to notable directors such as [[Victor Fleming]] and [[Josef von Sternberg]] and made the transition to sound with them. He was the assistant director to [[Fred Niblo]] in the 1925 version of ''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' starring [[Francis X. Bushman]] and [[Ramon Novarro]]. During the remainder of the 1920s, Hathaway learned his craft as an assistant, helping direct future stars such as Gary Cooper, [[Marlene Dietrich]], [[Adolphe Menjou]], [[Fay Wray]], [[Walter Huston]], [[Clara Bow]], and  [[Noah Beery]].\n\n==Director==\n\n===Randolph Scott Westerns===\nHenry Hathaway made his directorial debut with a [[Western film]] production at Paramount, ''[[Heritage of the Desert (1932 film)|Heritage of the Desert]]'' (1932). Based on a [[Zane Grey]] novel, Hathaway gave Randolph Scott his first starring role in film that led to a lengthy career for Scott as a cowboy star. \n\nIt kicked off a series of Hathaway-directed Scott Westerns from Grey novels, ''[[Wild Horse Mesa (1932 film)|Wild Horse Mesa]]'' (1932), ''[[The Thundering Herd (1933 film)|The Thundering Herd]]'' (1933), ''[[Under the Tonto Rim (1933 film)|Under the Tonto Rim]]'' (1933), ''[[Sunset Pass (1933 film)|Sunset Pass]]'' (1933), ''[[To the Last Man (1933 film)|To the Last Man]]'' (1933), ''[[Man of the Forest (1933 film)|Man of the Forest]]'' (1933) and ''[[The Last Round-Up (1934 film)|The Last Round-Up]]'' (1934).\n\nHathaway directed an action film set in the Philippines, ''[[Come On Marines!]]'' (1934), followed by a drama ''[[The Witching Hour (1934 film)|The Witching Hour]]'' (1934), and an early [[Shirley Temple]] film, ''[[Now and Forever (1934 film)|Now and Forever]]'' (1934). The latter also starred [[Carole Lombard]] and [[Gary Cooper]]\n\n===''Lives of a Bengal Lancer'' (1935) and Action Films===\nHathaway's next film was with Cooper, ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer (film)|The Lives of a Bengal Lancer]]'' (1935). Hathaway spent some time in India supervising filming of scenes.<ref>BECALMED HOLLYWOOD SHAKES OUT HER SAILS. (1934, Jul 29). New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from https://search.proquest.com/docview/101195511</ref> The movie was a huge hit and received seven [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and for which Hathaway won his only nomination for the [[Academy Award for Directing]]. \n\nHathaway was now established as one of the main directors on the Paramount lot. He made another with Cooper, ''[[Peter Ibbetson]]'' (1935). This was followed by ''[[The Trail of the Lonesome Pine (1936 film)|The Trail of the Lonesome Pine]]'' (1936), his first movie in color. He also worked on the troubled ''[[I Loved a Soldier]]'' (1936) which was never finished, and did a [[Mae West]] movie, ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936).\n\nHathaway was back with Cooper for the anti-slaving adventure story, ''[[Souls at Sea]]'' (1937), co-starring [[George Raft]]. With Raft and Henry Fonda he made ''[[Spawn of the North]]'' (1938).\n\n''[[The Real Glory]]'' (1939), with Cooper, was a reprise of ''Bengal Lancers'' set in the Philippines.\n\n==20th Century Fox==\nHathaway moved over to 20th Century Fox. where he directed the studio's biggest male star, Tyrone Power, in ''[[Johnny Apollo (film)|Johnny Apollo]]'' (1940) and ''[[Brigham Young (film)|Brigham Young]]'' (1940).\n\nHe went back to Paramount to direct [[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Shepherd of the Hills (film)|The Shepherd of the Hills]]'' (1941). For [[Walter Wanger]] at United Artists he made another Imperial action film, ''[[Sundown (1941 film)|Sundown]]'' (1941).\n\nBack at Fox he made ''[[Ten Gentlemen from West Point]]'' (1942), ''[[China Girl (1942 film)|China Girl]]'' (1942), ''[[Wing and a Prayer]]'' (1944), ''[[Home in Indiana]]'' (1944) and ''[[Nob Hill (film)|Nob Hill]]'' (1945).\n\nDuring the 1940s, Hathaway began making films in a [[semidocumentary]] vein, often using the [[film noir]] style. These included ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' (1945), for which he was nominated for a Best Director award by the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], ''[[The Dark Corner]]'' (1946), ''[[13 Rue Madeleine]]'' (1947), ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'' (1947) and ''[[Call Northside 777]]'' (1948), in which Hathaway presented one of the first on-screen uses of a [[Fax|Fax machine]]. \n\nHathaway returned to adventure films with ''[[Down to the Sea in Ships (1949 film)|Down to the Sea in Ships]]'' (1949). He was reunited with Power for ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (1950).\n\n''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]]'' (1951) was a biopic of [[General Rommel]]. It was followed by ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), a noir about a man going to commit suicide, ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'' (1951), a military comedy with Cooper, and two with Power: ''[[Rawhide (1951 film)|Rawhide]]'' (1951), a Western, and ''[[Diplomatic Courier]]'' (1952).\n\nHathaway directed the film noir ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953) which was [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s breakthrough role and ''[[White Witch Doctor (film)|White Witch Doctor]]'' (1953) with Susan Hayward and Robert Mitchum. He was reunited with Cooper on ''[[Garden of Evil]]'' (1954), a Western, then did the swashbuckler ''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'' (1954).\n\nAfter ''[[The Racers]]'' (1955), with Zanuck's mistress [[Bella Darvi]], Hathaway left Fox.<ref>HESTON KEPT BUSY IN 4 SCREEN ROLES New York Times 23 Aug 1954: 2</ref>\n==Post-Fox career==\nHe made two thrillers with [[Van Johnson]]: ''[[The Bottom of the Bottle]]'' (1956) and ''[[23 Paces to Baker Street]]'' (1956). \n\nJohn Wayne hired him to make ''[[Legend of the Lost]]'' (1957) for Wayne's company. Back at Fox he made the Western, ''[[From Hell to Texas]]'' (1958). During the movie, [[Dennis Hopper]] attempted to assert himself artistically on the set. Perhaps influenced by his recent experience with fellow actor [[James Dean]]'s rebellious attitude on the sets of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), Hopper forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene before he acquiesced to Hathaway's demands. After the shoot, Hathaway reportedly told the young actor that his career in Hollywood was over. Hopper later admitted he was wrong to have disrespected Hathaway as a youth and called him \"the finest director I have ever worked with\", working again with Hathaway on ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965) and ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969).\n\nHathaway then made a melodrama ''[[Woman Obsessed]]'' (1959) and thriller ''[[Seven Thieves]]'' (1960). He was reunited with Wayne on the comedy-action \"northern\", ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960).\n\n==Later career ==\nHathaway was one of three directors on the epic [[Cinerama]] Western, ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), directing the bulk of the film, including the river, prairie, and train robbery sequences. He went to Spain to work with Wayne again on ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964). Wayne asked Hathaway to cast [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]] in the role of Steve McCabe in the film; Smith from 1959 to 1963 had played the part of rancher Slim  Sherman on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' series. According to Smith's Internet biography, Hathaway developed an intense dislike for Smith and stopped him from landing choice roles thereafter in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonygill.co.uk/Johnsmith/bio.htm|title=John Smith Biography|publisher=tonygill.co.uk|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> \n\n''Circus World'' was a box office disappointment but Wayne and Hathaway's  next movie together, ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), was a big hit. So too was ''[[Nevada Smith]]'' (1966), a Western starring [[Steve McQueen]] that was extrapolated from a brief section of [[Harold Robbins]]' novel ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]''. \n\nHe went to Africa to make ''[[The Last Safari]]'' (1967), then did the Western ''[[5 Card Stud]]'' (1968) with Dean Martin and Robert Mitchum. It was a mild success but ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), produced by Hal Wallis, was extremely popular, and won John Wayne a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nHe may have stepped in for [[George Seaton]] in directing some winter outdoor scenes for the all-star ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), which stars [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Dean Martin]]. \n\nHe made a war movie with Richard Burton, ''[[Raid on Rommel]]'' (1971),  then made another Western for [[Hal Wallis]], ''[[Shoot Out]]'' (1971). Hathaway's  65th and final film was ''[[Hangup]]'' (1974), a blaxploitation movie.\n==Death==\nHathaway died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1985 in Hollywood and is interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California. His body of work earned him a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1638 Vine Street.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (assistant for [[Cecil B. de Mille]] - uncredited) (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (assistant for [[B.

These included ''[[The House on 92nd Street]]'' (1945), for which he was nominated for a Best Director award by the [[New York Film Critics Circle]], ''[[The Dark Corner]]'' (1946), ''[[13 Rue Madeleine]]'' (1947), ''[[Kiss of Death (1947 film)|Kiss of Death]]'' (1947) and ''[[Call Northside 777]]'' (1948), in which Hathaway presented one of the first on-screen uses of a [[Fax|Fax machine]]. \n\nHathaway returned to adventure films with ''[[Down to the Sea in Ships (1949 film)|Down to the Sea in Ships]]'' (1949). He was reunited with Power for ''[[The Black Rose]]'' (1950).\n\n''[[The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel]]'' (1951) was a biopic of [[General Rommel]]. It was followed by ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), a noir about a man going to commit suicide, ''[[You're in the Navy Now]]'' (1951), a military comedy with Cooper, and two with Power: ''[[Rawhide (1951 film)|Rawhide]]'' (1951), a Western, and ''[[Diplomatic Courier]]'' (1952).\n\nHathaway directed the film noir ''[[Niagara (film)|Niagara]]'' (1953) which was [[Marilyn Monroe]]'s breakthrough role and ''[[White Witch Doctor (film)|White Witch Doctor]]'' (1953) with Susan Hayward and Robert Mitchum. He was reunited with Cooper on ''[[Garden of Evil]]'' (1954), a Western, then did the swashbuckler ''[[Prince Valiant (1954 film)|Prince Valiant]]'' (1954).\n\nAfter ''[[The Racers]]'' (1955), with Zanuck's mistress [[Bella Darvi]], Hathaway left Fox.<ref>HESTON KEPT BUSY IN 4 SCREEN ROLES New York Times 23 Aug 1954: 2</ref>\n==Post-Fox career==\nHe made two thrillers with [[Van Johnson]]: ''[[The Bottom of the Bottle]]'' (1956) and ''[[23 Paces to Baker Street]]'' (1956). \n\nJohn Wayne hired him to make ''[[Legend of the Lost]]'' (1957) for Wayne's company. Back at Fox he made the Western, ''[[From Hell to Texas]]'' (1958). During the movie, [[Dennis Hopper]] attempted to assert himself artistically on the set. Perhaps influenced by his recent experience with fellow actor [[James Dean]]'s rebellious attitude on the sets of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955) and ''[[Giant (1956 film)|Giant]]'' (1956), Hopper forced Hathaway to shoot more than 80 takes of a scene before he acquiesced to Hathaway's demands. After the shoot, Hathaway reportedly told the young actor that his career in Hollywood was over. Hopper later admitted he was wrong to have disrespected Hathaway as a youth and called him \"the finest director I have ever worked with\", working again with Hathaway on ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965) and ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969).\n\nHathaway then made a melodrama ''[[Woman Obsessed]]'' (1959) and thriller ''[[Seven Thieves]]'' (1960). He was reunited with Wayne on the comedy-action \"northern\", ''[[North to Alaska]]'' (1960).\n\n==Later career ==\nHathaway was one of three directors on the epic [[Cinerama]] Western, ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' (1962), directing the bulk of the film, including the river, prairie, and train robbery sequences. He went to Spain to work with Wayne again on ''[[Circus World (film)|Circus World]]'' (1964). Wayne asked Hathaway to cast [[John Smith (actor)|John Smith]] in the role of Steve McCabe in the film; Smith from 1959 to 1963 had played the part of rancher Slim  Sherman on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Laramie (TV series)|Laramie]]'' series. According to Smith's Internet biography, Hathaway developed an intense dislike for Smith and stopped him from landing choice roles thereafter in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tonygill.co.uk/Johnsmith/bio.htm|title=John Smith Biography|publisher=tonygill.co.uk|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}</ref> \n\n''Circus World'' was a box office disappointment but Wayne and Hathaway's  next movie together, ''[[The Sons of Katie Elder]]'' (1965), was a big hit. So too was ''[[Nevada Smith]]'' (1966), a Western starring [[Steve McQueen]] that was extrapolated from a brief section of [[Harold Robbins]]' novel ''[[The Carpetbaggers]]''. \n\nHe went to Africa to make ''[[The Last Safari]]'' (1967), then did the Western ''[[5 Card Stud]]'' (1968) with Dean Martin and Robert Mitchum. It was a mild success but ''[[True Grit (1969 film)|True Grit]]'' (1969), produced by Hal Wallis, was extremely popular, and won John Wayne a Best Actor Oscar.\n\nHe may have stepped in for [[George Seaton]] in directing some winter outdoor scenes for the all-star ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970), which stars [[Burt Lancaster]] and [[Dean Martin]]. \n\nHe made a war movie with Richard Burton, ''[[Raid on Rommel]]'' (1971),  then made another Western for [[Hal Wallis]], ''[[Shoot Out]]'' (1971). Hathaway's  65th and final film was ''[[Hangup]]'' (1974), a blaxploitation movie.\n==Death==\nHathaway died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]] in 1985 in Hollywood and is interred at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California. His body of work earned him a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 1638 Vine Street.\n\n==Filmography==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*''[[The Ten Commandments (1923 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (assistant for [[Cecil B. de Mille]] - uncredited) (1923)\n*''[[Ben-Hur (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' (assistant for [[B.

The club is located on {{convert|16|acre}} of land on Mugg's Island, one of the islands in the [[Toronto Islands]]. The club is accessible from April to October using the club's private boat from downtown.

Social activities include holiday buffets and barbecues, sailing lessons and camps, family and children's activities, and boating events including: cruises, sailpasts and sailboat racing. Dockage is available for both power and sailboats. The clubhouse incorporates a dining room, bar, lounge, locker rooms and a children's club annex.

This clubhouse was built to replace the original clubhouse, which burned down in June 2004.\n\n==History==\nThe Island Yacht Club was founded in 1951 by a small group of Jewish sailing enthusiasts.\n\nAccording to an article by [[Pierre Berton]] published in ''Maclean\u2019s Magazine'' on November 1, 1948: \"Segregation by race at which Canadians are apt to look askance when it is practiced in the southern United States, is just as strong in the Canadian social world as it is in the economic world. There are golf clubs which make no bones about the fact that they won\u2019t accept Jewish members, college fraternities and sororities, which exclude Jewish students. Members of these clubs have argued that in private, social organizations they should be allowed to choose the people they associate with.\"\n\nIt was in this social climate that Carl Keyfetz was retained in the spring of 1951 to obtain a Provincial Charter for a Social Club to be located on Mugg\u2019s Island that would be dedicated to the promotion of \"yachting, badminton, squash, tennis, bowling, skating, swimming, curling and other games of sport and to arrange matches and competitions of every nature and to offer or grant and contribute towards prizes awards and distinctions\". \n[[File:Inside IYC.jpg|thumb|Clubhouse Lounge]]\nA lease for a parcel of land on Muggs Island \u2013 {{convert|250|ft|m}} deep by {{convert|600|ft|m}} along the water \u2013 was negotiated with the [[City of Toronto government]]. On October 16, 1951 an organizing meeting was held at the home of Cecil Yolles with Jack and Estelle Morris, Bill Ackerman, Bob Singer, Dick Lorie, Bert Jacobs, Mel Gould, Eon Gilmore, Norm Kirzner, Leo Perkel, Dr. S. Leibel, Cecil Yolles, Denny Yolles, Dr. Bernard \"Bunny\" Willinsky, John Bussin, Joe Kitz, Barney Alper, [[Ben Dunkelman]], [[Irving Gould]] and Mark Speyer in attendance. The first directors were John Bliss, salesman; Irving and Malville Gould, managers and Carl Keyfetz, solicitor.\n\nOnly qualified and proven sailors were to be allowed to fly the IYC burgee. Training was mandatory. A Disciplinary Committee was established under the chairmanship of the Sailing Master with power to penalize, fine or expel members who did not conform with government regulations or any regulations that the club might, from time to time, see fit to pass. With Johnny Bussin responsible for seamanship instruction, Bunny Willinsky sharing his knowledge of boat handling and safety at sea and Irving Gould in charge of navigation and chart work, all members were expected to become qualified skippers so that they would not injure themselves or embarrass the rest of the members or the club. In addition to \"fostering sportsmanship and seamanship among Jewish youth and its members\", the club was to provide \"social facilities to all visiting yachtsmen\" and to \"foster a better understanding between Jewish and Gentile yachtsmen\". The first Commodore of the Island Yacht Club and a major force for the growth of the club was Dr. Bunny Willinsky. Membership peaked at 350 in the 1970s and has steadily dropped since then.\n\nThe fundamental issue of whether or not it was to be an exclusively \"Jewish yacht club\" was addressed and decided quickly. Notwithstanding the way that others had treated them, the answer from the founders was a principled and emphatic \"no\". At a meeting on February 4, 1952 \"upon motion regularly made and seconded, it was unanimously decided that all applications for membership from persons of other than the Jewish faith would be given the same consideration as all other applications.\" This was a first for private clubs in Toronto and a policy that continues to this day.\n\nThe clubhouse was built in 2006 to replace the original clubhouse, which burned down in June 2004. The original clubhouse housed the formal dining room, bar, cafeteria style snack bar, where Friday nights were movie night; men's and ladies' locker rooms with saunas and lounges, the Junior Club where young sailors and children of members could relax with their peers and the Sailor's Lounge where you could often find members playing cards or relaxing, either inside the lounge, or outside on the deck.  Although some of these activities have been discontinued (e.g., movie night) there is an active youth program that helps cement the club as a family-oriented facility. Other adult activities include Weekday Mah Jong, tennis tournaments, adult sail, canoeing and kayaking.\n\n[[File:Monday Night Racing.jpg|thumb|Organized social activities including sailboat racing.]]\n\n==Club features==\n* Social and boating memberships\n* Docks for both power and sailboats\n* Marine services including secure winter storage\n* Sailboats and kayaks for member use\n* Four tennis courts\n* Heated outdoor swimming pool- with supervised hours\n* Men's and women's locker rooms\n* Family and children's programs & activities\n* Supervised children's playground, arts & crafts house and playhouse\n* Casual and gourmet dining and social areas\n* Meeting and catering facilities\n*Private tender to the club from 539 Queen's Quay W.

{"title_page": "Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=January 2017}}\n'''Thai Industrial Standard 620-2533''', commonly referred to as '''TIS-620''', is the most common [[character set]] and [[character encoding]] for the [[Thai language]].  The standard is published  by the  [[Thai Industrial Standards Institute]] (TISI), an organ of the Ministry of Industry under the Royal Thai Government, and is the sole official standard for encoding Thai in [[Thailand]].  The descriptive name of the standard is \"Standard for Thai Character Codes for Computers\" (Thai: \u0e23\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e02\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e27\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c). \"2533\" refers to year 2533 of the [[Buddhist Era]] (1990), the year the present version of the standard was published; a previous revision, TIS 620-2529 (1986), is now obsolete.\n\n'''TIS-620''' is the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] preferred charset name for TIS-620, and that charset name is used also for [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] (which adds a no-break space character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] from [[ISO/IEC 6429]].\n\n==Structure==\nTIS-620 is a conventionally structured [[Extended ASCII]] national character set that retains full compatibility with 7-bit [[ASCII]] and uses the 8-bit range hex A1 to FB for encoding the [[Thai alphabet]].  Due to the complex combining nature of Thai vowels and diacritics, TIS-620 is intended for information interchange only, and an additional display engine is required to compose characters correctly.\n\n==Variants==\nA nearly identical version of TIS-620 has been adopted as [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] in 2001, the sole difference being that ISO/IEC 8859-11 defines hex A0 as a [[non-breaking space]], while TIS-620 leaves it undefined but reserved.  (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)\n\nThe ISO/IEC 8859-11 set has also been registered as '''ISO-IR-166''' by [[Ecma International]], but this variation adds explicit escape codes for signaling the beginning and end of Thai character sequences.\n\nThe TIS-620 character set ordering has been used essentially as is within [[Unicode]] ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) as well.  Unicode's [[Thai (Unicode block)|Thai block]] is U+0E01 through U+0E7F, and TIS-620 Thai characters can be converted to [[UTF-16]] simply by prefixing each byte with 0E and subtracting hex A0 from the value.\n\n==Character set==\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|TIS-620<ref>{{Citation|title=TCCII 2533 1009 / TIS 620

The standard is published  by the  [[Thai Industrial Standards Institute]] (TISI), an organ of the Ministry of Industry under the Royal Thai Government, and is the sole official standard for encoding Thai in [[Thailand]].  The descriptive name of the standard is \"Standard for Thai Character Codes for Computers\" (Thai: \u0e23\u0e2b\u0e31\u0e2a\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e23\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e2d\u0e31\u0e01\u0e02\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22\u0e17\u0e35\u0e48\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e01\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e04\u0e2d\u0e21\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e27\u0e40\u0e15\u0e2d\u0e23\u0e4c). \"2533\" refers to year 2533 of the [[Buddhist Era]] (1990), the year the present version of the standard was published; a previous revision, TIS 620-2529 (1986), is now obsolete.\n\n'''TIS-620''' is the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] preferred charset name for TIS-620, and that charset name is used also for [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] (which adds a no-break space character at 0xA0, which is unassigned in TIS-620). When the IANA name is used the codes are supplemented with the [[C0 and C1 control codes]] from [[ISO/IEC 6429]].\n\n==Structure==\nTIS-620 is a conventionally structured [[Extended ASCII]] national character set that retains full compatibility with 7-bit [[ASCII]] and uses the 8-bit range hex A1 to FB for encoding the [[Thai alphabet]].  Due to the complex combining nature of Thai vowels and diacritics, TIS-620 is intended for information interchange only, and an additional display engine is required to compose characters correctly.\n\n==Variants==\nA nearly identical version of TIS-620 has been adopted as [[ISO/IEC 8859-11]] in 2001, the sole difference being that ISO/IEC 8859-11 defines hex A0 as a [[non-breaking space]], while TIS-620 leaves it undefined but reserved.  (In practice, this small distinction is usually ignored.)\n\nThe ISO/IEC 8859-11 set has also been registered as '''ISO-IR-166''' by [[Ecma International]], but this variation adds explicit escape codes for signaling the beginning and end of Thai character sequences.\n\nThe TIS-620 character set ordering has been used essentially as is within [[Unicode]] ([[ISO/IEC 10646]]) as well.  Unicode's [[Thai (Unicode block)|Thai block]] is U+0E01 through U+0E7F, and TIS-620 Thai characters can be converted to [[UTF-16]] simply by prefixing each byte with 0E and subtracting hex A0 from the value.\n\n==Character set==\n\n{|{{chset-tableformat}}\n{{chset-table-header|TIS-620<ref>{{Citation|title=TCCII 2533 1009 / TIS 620
