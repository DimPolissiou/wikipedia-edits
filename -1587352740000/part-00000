Hanssen restarted his espionage activities in 1985 and continued until 1991 when he broke off communications during the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]], fearing he would be exposed. He restored communications the next year and continued until his arrest. Throughout his spying, Hanssen remained anonymous to the Russians.\n\nHanssen sold thousands of classified documents to the [[KGB]] that detailed U.S. strategies in the event of nuclear war, developments in military weapons technologies, and aspects of the U.S. counterintelligence program.<ref name=\"oig\" /> He was spying at the same time as [[Aldrich Ames]] in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). Both Ames and Hanssen compromised the names of KGB agents working secretly for the United States, some of whom were executed for their betrayal. Hanssen also revealed a multimillion-dollar eavesdropping tunnel built by the FBI under the [[Russian ambassador's residence in Washington, D.C.|Soviet Embassy in Washington]]. After Ames's arrest in 1994, some of these intelligence breaches still remained unsolved. The FBI paid $7 million to a KGB agent to obtain a file on an anonymous [[Mole (espionage)|mole]], whom the FBI later identified as Hanssen through fingerprint and voice analysis.\n\nHanssen was arrested on February 18, 2001, at [[Foxstone Park]]<ref>{{cite web |first=Adrian |last=Havill |work=crimelibrary.com |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hanssen/2.html |title=His fate is sealed |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907223240/http://www.crimelibrary.com/terrorists_spies/spies/hanssen/2.html |archivedate=September 7, 2007 |accessdate=September 10, 2007 }}</ref> near his home in [[Vienna, Virginia]] after leaving a package of classified materials at a [[dead drop]] site.

In 1978, Hanssen and his growing family (of three children and eventually six) moved to [[New York City]] when the FBI transferred him to its field office there.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=18\u201319}}</ref> The next year, Hanssen was moved into [[counter-intelligence]] and given the task of compiling a database of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] intelligence for the Bureau.\n\nIn 1979, Hanssen approached the Soviet [[Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU)]] and offered his services. He never indicated any political or ideological motive for his actions, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was financial.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=21}}</ref> During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen provided a significant amount of information to the GRU, including details of the FBI's bugging activities and lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak was the betrayal of [[Dmitri Polyakov]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] informant who passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while rising to the rank of General in the [[Soviet Army]]. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act against Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] [[Aldrich Ames]] in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, while Hanssen's attempt was not revealed until after his 2001 capture.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=21\u201324}}</ref>\n\n==FBI counterintelligence unit, further espionage activities (1985\u20131991)==\n[[File:Ellis dead drop.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Ellis\" dead drop site in [[Foxstone Park]] used by Hanssen, including on the day of his arrest]]\n\nIn 1981, Hanssen was transferred to [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and moved to the suburb of [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia]]. His new job in the FBI's budget office gave him access to information involving many different FBI operations. This included all the FBI activities related to [[wiretapping]] and [[electronic surveillance]], which were Hanssen's responsibility. He became known in the Bureau as an expert on computers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=28\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, Hanssen transferred to the FBI's Soviet analytical unit, which was responsible for studying, identifying, and capturing Soviet spies and intelligence operatives in the United States. Hanssen's section was in charge of evaluating Soviet agents who volunteered to give intelligence to determine whether they were genuine or [[re-doubled agent]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=37\u201338}}</ref> In 1985, Hanssen was again transferred to the FBI's field office in New York, where he continued to work in counter-intelligence against the Soviets. It was after the transfer, while on a business trip back to Washington, that he resumed his career in espionage.\n\nOn October 1, 1985, Hanssen sent an anonymous letter to the [[KGB]] offering his services and asking for $100,000 in cash. In the letter, he gave the names of three KGB agents secretly working for the FBI: [[Boris Yuzhin]], Valery Martynov, and Sergei Motorin. Although Hanssen was unaware of it, all three agents had already been exposed earlier that year by Ames.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Yuzhin had returned to Moscow in 1982, and had been put under intensive investigation by the KGB there due to having lost a concealed camera in the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, but he was not arrested until being exposed by Ames and Hanssen. <ref>Lynch, Christopher, The C.I. Desk: FBI and CIA Counterintelligence As Seen From My Cubicle Dog Ear Publishing 2010</ref> Martynov and Motorin were recalled to [[Moscow]], where they were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of espionage against the USSR.  Martynov and Motorin were condemned to death and executed via a gun-shot to the back of the head. Yuzhin was imprisoned for six years before he was released under a general amnesty to political prisoners, and subsequently emigrated to the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> Because the FBI blamed Ames for the leak, Hanssen was not suspected nor investigated. The October 1 letter was the beginning of a long, active espionage period for Hanssen. During this time he lived in the suburban town of Yorktown Heights north of New York City.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHanssen was recalled yet again to Washington in 1987. He was given the task of making a study of all known and rumored penetrations of the FBI in order to find the man who had betrayed Martynov and Motorin; this meant that he was looking for himself. Hanssen ensured that he did not unmask himself with his study, but in addition, he turned over the entire study\u2014including the list of all Soviets who had contacted the FBI about FBI moles\u2014to the KGB in 1988.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=3\u20134, 67\u201368, 82\u201383}}</ref> That same year, Hanssen, according to a government report, committed a \"serious security breach\" by revealing secret information to a Soviet [[defector]] during a debriefing. The agents working underneath him reported this breach to a supervisor, but no action was taken.<ref name=\"oig\"/>\n\nIn 1989, Hanssen compromised the FBI investigation of [[Felix Bloch (diplomatic officer)|Felix Bloch]], a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official who had come under suspicion for espionage. Hanssen warned the KGB that Bloch was under investigation, causing the KGB to abruptly break off contact with Bloch. The FBI was unable to produce any hard evidence, and as a result, Bloch was never charged with a crime, although the State Department later terminated his employment and denied his [[pension]]. The failure of the Bloch investigation and the FBI's investigation of how the KGB found out they were investigating Bloch drove the mole hunt that eventually led to the arrest of Hanssen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=111\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Hanssen handed over extensive information about American planning for [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence]] (MASINT), an umbrella term for intelligence collected by a wide array of electronic means, such as [[radar]], spy satellites, and signal intercepts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=246}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=95}}</ref> When the Soviets began construction on a new embassy in 1977, the FBI dug a tunnel beneath their decoding room. The FBI planned to use it for eavesdropping, but never did for fear of being caught. Hanssen disclosed this information to the Soviets in September 1989 and received a $55,000 payment the next month.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=98\u2013110}}</ref> On two occasions, Hanssen gave the Soviets a complete list of American [[double agent]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=159}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Hanssen's brother-in-law, Mark Wauck, who was also an FBI employee, recommended to the Bureau that Hanssen be investigated for espionage; this came after Bonnie Hanssen's sister Jeanne Beglis had found a pile of cash sitting on a dresser in the Hanssens' house. Bonnie had previously told her brother that Hanssen once talked about retiring in [[Poland]], then part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Wauck also knew that the FBI was hunting for a mole and so spoke with his supervisor, who took no action.<ref name=\"oig\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=120\u2013128}}.</ref>\n\n==Later FBI career, continued espionage activities (1992\u20132001)==\nWhen the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] in December 1991, Hanssen, possibly worried that he could be exposed during the ensuing political upheaval, broke off communications with his handlers for a time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=141}}</ref> The following year, after the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] took over the defunct USSR's spy agencies, Hanssen made a risky approach to the GRU, with whom he had not been in contact in ten months. He went in person to the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C.|Russian embassy]] and physically approached a GRU officer in the parking garage. Hanssen, carrying a package of documents, identified himself by his Soviet [[code name]], \"Ramon Garcia,\" and described himself as a \"disaffected FBI agent\" who was offering his services as a spy. The Russian officer, who evidently did not recognize the code name, drove off. The Russians then filed an official protest with the State Department, believing Hanssen to be a triple agent. Despite having shown his face, disclosed his code name, and revealed his FBI affiliation, Hanssen escaped arrest when the Bureau's investigation into the incident did not advance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=160}}</ref>\n\nHanssen continued to take risks in 1993, when he hacked into the computer of a fellow FBI agent, Ray Mislock, printed out a classified document from Mislock's computer, and took the document to Mislock, saying, \"You didn't believe me that the system was insecure.\" His superiors were not amused and launched an investigation. In the end, officials believed Hanssen's claim that he was merely demonstrating flaws in the FBI's security system. Mislock has since theorized that Hanssen probably went onto his computer to see if his superiors were investigating him for espionage, and invented the document story to cover his tracks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanssen expressed interest in a transfer to the new [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Center]], which coordinated counter-intelligence activities. When told that he would have to take a [[lie detector]] test to join, Hanssen changed his mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=176\u2013177}}</ref> Three years later, convicted FBI mole [[Earl Edwin Pitts]] told the Bureau that he suspected Hanssen was dirty due to the Mislock incident. Pitts was the second FBI agent to mention Hanssen by name as a possible mole, but superiors were still unconvinced. No action was taken.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=181}}</ref>\n\nIT personnel from the National Security Division's IIS Unit were sent to investigate Hanssen's desktop computer following a reported failure. NSD chief Johnnie Sullivan ordered the computer impounded after it appeared to have been tampered with. A digital investigation found that an attempted hacking had taken place using a [[password cracking]] program installed by Hanssen, which caused a security alert and lockup. Following confirmation by the FBI CART Unit, Sullivan filed a report with the Office of Professional Responsibility requesting further investigation of Hanssen's attempted hack. Hanssen claimed that he was attempting to connect a color printer to his computer, but needed the password cracker to bypass the administrative password. The FBI believed his story and Hanssen was let off with a warning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=188}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same time period, Hanssen searched the FBI's internal computer case record to see if he was under investigation. He was indiscreet enough to type his own name into FBI search engines. Finding nothing, Hanssen decided to resume his spy career after eight years without contact with the Russians. He established contact with the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (the successor to the Soviet-era KGB) in the fall of 1999. He continued to perform highly incriminating searches of FBI files for his own name and address.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=190\u2013192}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation and arrest==\nThe existence of two Russian moles working in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment simultaneously\u2014Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI\u2014complicated counterintelligence efforts in the 1990s. Ames was arrested in 1994; his exposure explained many of the asset losses American intelligence suffered in the 1980s, including the arrest and execution of Martynov and Motorin. However, two cases\u2014the Bloch investigation and the embassy tunnel\u2014stood out and remained unsolved. Ames had been stationed in [[Rome]] at the time of the Bloch investigation, and could not have had knowledge of that case or of the tunnel under the embassy, as he did not work for the FBI.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[CBS News]] |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-not-so-secret-tunnel/ |title=A Not-So-Secret Tunnel |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=170}}</ref>\n\nThe FBI and CIA formed a joint mole-hunting team in 1994 to find the suspected second intelligence leak. They formed a list of all agents known to have access to cases that were compromised. The FBI's codename for the suspected spy was \"Graysuit.\" Some promising suspects were cleared, and the mole hunt found other penetrations such as CIA officer [[Harold James Nicholson]]. However, Hanssen escaped notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=173}}</ref>\n\nBy 1998, using FBI criminal profiling techniques, the pursuers zeroed in on an innocent man: [[Brian Kelley (CIA officer)|Brian Kelley]], a CIA operative involved in the Bloch investigation. The CIA and FBI searched his house, tapped his phone and put him under surveillance, following him and his family everywhere. In November 1998, they had a man with a foreign accent come to Kelley's door, warn him that the FBI knew he was a spy and tell him to show up at a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station the next day in order to escape. Kelley instead reported the incident to the FBI. In 1999, the FBI even interrogated Kelley, his ex-wife, two sisters and three children. All denied everything. He was eventually placed on administrative leave, where he remained [[falsely accused]] until after Hanssen was arrested.<ref name=\"oig\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=205\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nFBI investigators later made progress during an operation in which they paid off disaffected Russian intelligence officers to deliver information on moles.

Waguespack listened to the tape again and recognized the voice as belonging to Hanssen.

In order to bring him back to FBI headquarters, where he could be closely monitored and kept away from sensitive data, they promoted him in December 2000 and gave him a new job supervising FBI computer security. In January 2001, Hanssen was given an office and an assistant, [[Eric O'Neill]], who in reality was a young FBI agent who had been assigned to watch Hanssen. O'Neill ascertained that Hanssen was using a [[Palm III]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] to store his information.

He also believed he was hearing noises on his car radio that indicated that it was bugged, although the FBI was later unable to reproduce the noises Hanssen claimed to have heard. In the last letter he wrote to the Russians, which was picked up by the FBI when he was arrested, Hanssen said that he had been promoted to a \"[[sinecure|do-nothing job]]&nbsp;... outside of regular access to information,\" and that, \"Something has aroused the sleeping tiger.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=236\u2013239}}</ref>\n[[File:ELLIS Drop Site-Hanssen case.jpg|thumb|left|Foxstone Park, where Hanssen was arrested]]\n\nHowever, his suspicions did not stop him from making one more [[dead drop]]. After dropping his friend off at the airport on February 18, 2001, Hanssen drove to Virginia's [[Foxstone Park]]. He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site.

He never indicated any political or ideological motive for his actions, telling the FBI after he was caught that his only motivation was financial.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=21}}</ref> During his first espionage cycle, Hanssen provided a significant amount of information to the GRU, including details of the FBI's bugging activities and lists of suspected Soviet intelligence agents. His most important leak was the betrayal of [[Dmitri Polyakov]], a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] informant who passed enormous amounts of information to American intelligence while rising to the rank of General in the [[Soviet Army]]. For unknown reasons, the Soviets did not act against Polyakov until he was betrayed a second time by CIA [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] [[Aldrich Ames]] in 1985. Polyakov was arrested in 1986 and executed in 1988. Ames was officially blamed for giving Polyakov's name to the Soviets, while Hanssen's attempt was not revealed until after his 2001 capture.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=21\u201324}}</ref>\n\n==FBI counterintelligence unit, further espionage activities (1985\u20131991)==\n[[File:Ellis dead drop.jpg|thumb|200px|\"Ellis\" dead drop site in [[Foxstone Park]] used by Hanssen, including on the day of his arrest]]\n\nIn 1981, Hanssen was transferred to [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI headquarters]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] and moved to the suburb of [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia]]. His new job in the FBI's budget office gave him access to information involving many different FBI operations. This included all the FBI activities related to [[wiretapping]] and [[electronic surveillance]], which were Hanssen's responsibility. He became known in the Bureau as an expert on computers.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=28\u201333}}</ref>\n\nThree years later, Hanssen transferred to the FBI's Soviet analytical unit, which was responsible for studying, identifying, and capturing Soviet spies and intelligence operatives in the United States. Hanssen's section was in charge of evaluating Soviet agents who volunteered to give intelligence to determine whether they were genuine or [[re-doubled agent]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=37\u201338}}</ref> In 1985, Hanssen was again transferred to the FBI's field office in New York, where he continued to work in counter-intelligence against the Soviets. It was after the transfer, while on a business trip back to Washington, that he resumed his career in espionage.\n\nOn October 1, 1985, Hanssen sent an anonymous letter to the [[KGB]] offering his services and asking for $100,000 in cash. In the letter, he gave the names of three KGB agents secretly working for the FBI: [[Boris Yuzhin]], Valery Martynov, and Sergei Motorin. Although Hanssen was unaware of it, all three agents had already been exposed earlier that year by Ames.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=50\u201351}}</ref> Yuzhin had returned to Moscow in 1982, and had been put under intensive investigation by the KGB there due to having lost a concealed camera in the Soviet consulate in San Francisco, but he was not arrested until being exposed by Ames and Hanssen. <ref>Lynch, Christopher, The C.I. Desk: FBI and CIA Counterintelligence As Seen From My Cubicle Dog Ear Publishing 2010</ref> Martynov and Motorin were recalled to [[Moscow]], where they were arrested, charged, tried, and convicted of espionage against the USSR.  Martynov and Motorin were condemned to death and executed via a gun-shot to the back of the head. Yuzhin was imprisoned for six years before he was released under a general amnesty to political prisoners, and subsequently emigrated to the U.S.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=56\u201357}}</ref> Because the FBI blamed Ames for the leak, Hanssen was not suspected nor investigated. The October 1 letter was the beginning of a long, active espionage period for Hanssen. During this time he lived in the suburban town of Yorktown Heights north of New York City.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nHanssen was recalled yet again to Washington in 1987. He was given the task of making a study of all known and rumored penetrations of the FBI in order to find the man who had betrayed Martynov and Motorin; this meant that he was looking for himself. Hanssen ensured that he did not unmask himself with his study, but in addition, he turned over the entire study\u2014including the list of all Soviets who had contacted the FBI about FBI moles\u2014to the KGB in 1988.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=3\u20134, 67\u201368, 82\u201383}}</ref> That same year, Hanssen, according to a government report, committed a \"serious security breach\" by revealing secret information to a Soviet [[defector]] during a debriefing. The agents working underneath him reported this breach to a supervisor, but no action was taken.<ref name=\"oig\"/>\n\nIn 1989, Hanssen compromised the FBI investigation of [[Felix Bloch (diplomatic officer)|Felix Bloch]], a [[United States Department of State|State Department]] official who had come under suspicion for espionage. Hanssen warned the KGB that Bloch was under investigation, causing the KGB to abruptly break off contact with Bloch. The FBI was unable to produce any hard evidence, and as a result, Bloch was never charged with a crime, although the State Department later terminated his employment and denied his [[pension]]. The failure of the Bloch investigation and the FBI's investigation of how the KGB found out they were investigating Bloch drove the mole hunt that eventually led to the arrest of Hanssen.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=111\u2013119}}</ref>\n\nLater that year, Hanssen handed over extensive information about American planning for [[Measurement and Signature Intelligence]] (MASINT), an umbrella term for intelligence collected by a wide array of electronic means, such as [[radar]], spy satellites, and signal intercepts.<ref>{{Harvnb|Cherkashin|Feifer|2005|p=246}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=95}}</ref> When the Soviets began construction on a new embassy in 1977, the FBI dug a tunnel beneath their decoding room. The FBI planned to use it for eavesdropping, but never did for fear of being caught. Hanssen disclosed this information to the Soviets in September 1989 and received a $55,000 payment the next month.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=98\u2013110}}</ref> On two occasions, Hanssen gave the Soviets a complete list of American [[double agent]]s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=159}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Hanssen's brother-in-law, Mark Wauck, who was also an FBI employee, recommended to the Bureau that Hanssen be investigated for espionage; this came after Bonnie Hanssen's sister Jeanne Beglis had found a pile of cash sitting on a dresser in the Hanssens' house. Bonnie had previously told her brother that Hanssen once talked about retiring in [[Poland]], then part of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. Wauck also knew that the FBI was hunting for a mole and so spoke with his supervisor, who took no action.<ref name=\"oig\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=120\u2013128}}.</ref>\n\n==Later FBI career, continued espionage activities (1992\u20132001)==\nWhen the [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union collapsed]] in December 1991, Hanssen, possibly worried that he could be exposed during the ensuing political upheaval, broke off communications with his handlers for a time.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=141}}</ref> The following year, after the [[Russia|Russian Federation]] took over the defunct USSR's spy agencies, Hanssen made a risky approach to the GRU, with whom he had not been in contact in ten months. He went in person to the [[Embassy of Russia in Washington, D.C.|Russian embassy]] and physically approached a GRU officer in the parking garage. Hanssen, carrying a package of documents, identified himself by his Soviet [[code name]], \"Ramon Garcia,\" and described himself as a \"disaffected FBI agent\" who was offering his services as a spy. The Russian officer, who evidently did not recognize the code name, drove off. The Russians then filed an official protest with the State Department, believing Hanssen to be a triple agent. Despite having shown his face, disclosed his code name, and revealed his FBI affiliation, Hanssen escaped arrest when the Bureau's investigation into the incident did not advance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=160}}</ref>\n\nHanssen continued to take risks in 1993, when he hacked into the computer of a fellow FBI agent, Ray Mislock, printed out a classified document from Mislock's computer, and took the document to Mislock, saying, \"You didn't believe me that the system was insecure.\" His superiors were not amused and launched an investigation. In the end, officials believed Hanssen's claim that he was merely demonstrating flaws in the FBI's security system. Mislock has since theorized that Hanssen probably went onto his computer to see if his superiors were investigating him for espionage, and invented the document story to cover his tracks.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=160\u2013161}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, Hanssen expressed interest in a transfer to the new [[Office of the National Counterintelligence Executive|National Counterintelligence Center]], which coordinated counter-intelligence activities. When told that he would have to take a [[lie detector]] test to join, Hanssen changed his mind.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=176\u2013177}}</ref> Three years later, convicted FBI mole [[Earl Edwin Pitts]] told the Bureau that he suspected Hanssen was dirty due to the Mislock incident. Pitts was the second FBI agent to mention Hanssen by name as a possible mole, but superiors were still unconvinced. No action was taken.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=181}}</ref>\n\nIT personnel from the National Security Division's IIS Unit were sent to investigate Hanssen's desktop computer following a reported failure. NSD chief Johnnie Sullivan ordered the computer impounded after it appeared to have been tampered with. A digital investigation found that an attempted hacking had taken place using a [[password cracking]] program installed by Hanssen, which caused a security alert and lockup. Following confirmation by the FBI CART Unit, Sullivan filed a report with the Office of Professional Responsibility requesting further investigation of Hanssen's attempted hack. Hanssen claimed that he was attempting to connect a color printer to his computer, but needed the password cracker to bypass the administrative password. The FBI believed his story and Hanssen was let off with a warning.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=188}}</ref>\n\nDuring the same time period, Hanssen searched the FBI's internal computer case record to see if he was under investigation. He was indiscreet enough to type his own name into FBI search engines. Finding nothing, Hanssen decided to resume his spy career after eight years without contact with the Russians. He established contact with the [[Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)|SVR]] (the successor to the Soviet-era KGB) in the fall of 1999. He continued to perform highly incriminating searches of FBI files for his own name and address.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=190\u2013192}}</ref>\n\n==Investigation and arrest==\nThe existence of two Russian moles working in the U.S. security and intelligence establishment simultaneously\u2014Ames at the CIA and Hanssen at the FBI\u2014complicated counterintelligence efforts in the 1990s. Ames was arrested in 1994; his exposure explained many of the asset losses American intelligence suffered in the 1980s, including the arrest and execution of Martynov and Motorin. However, two cases\u2014the Bloch investigation and the embassy tunnel\u2014stood out and remained unsolved. Ames had been stationed in [[Rome]] at the time of the Bloch investigation, and could not have had knowledge of that case or of the tunnel under the embassy, as he did not work for the FBI.<ref>{{cite news |work=[[CBS News]] |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-not-so-secret-tunnel/ |title=A Not-So-Secret Tunnel |date=March 5, 2001 |accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=170}}</ref>\n\nThe FBI and CIA formed a joint mole-hunting team in 1994 to find the suspected second intelligence leak. They formed a list of all agents known to have access to cases that were compromised. The FBI's codename for the suspected spy was \"Graysuit.\" Some promising suspects were cleared, and the mole hunt found other penetrations such as CIA officer [[Harold James Nicholson]]. However, Hanssen escaped notice.<ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|p=173}}</ref>\n\nBy 1998, using FBI criminal profiling techniques, the pursuers zeroed in on an innocent man: [[Brian Kelley (CIA officer)|Brian Kelley]], a CIA operative involved in the Bloch investigation. The CIA and FBI searched his house, tapped his phone and put him under surveillance, following him and his family everywhere. In November 1998, they had a man with a foreign accent come to Kelley's door, warn him that the FBI knew he was a spy and tell him to show up at a [[Washington Metro|Metro]] station the next day in order to escape. Kelley instead reported the incident to the FBI. In 1999, the FBI even interrogated Kelley, his ex-wife, two sisters and three children. All denied everything. He was eventually placed on administrative leave, where he remained [[falsely accused]] until after Hanssen was arrested.<ref name=\"oig\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Wise|2003|pp=205\u2013213}}</ref>\n\nFBI investigators later made progress during an operation in which they paid off disaffected Russian intelligence officers to deliver information on moles.

In January 2001, Hanssen was given an office and an assistant, [[Eric O'Neill]], who in reality was a young FBI agent who had been assigned to watch Hanssen. O'Neill ascertained that Hanssen was using a [[Palm III]] [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]] to store his information.

He placed a white piece of tape on a park sign, which was a signal to his Russian contacts that there was information at the dead drop site. He then followed his usual routine, taking a package consisting of a sealed garbage bag of classified material and taping it to the bottom side of a wooden footbridge over a creek.

She leaves in a panic to travel to the side of her friend Hillary [[Whitney family|Whitney]], a [[San Francisco]] [[heiress]] and [[lawyer]]. Unable to get a flight to San Francisco because of [[fog]], she rents a car and drives overnight, reflecting on her lifelong friendship with Hillary.\n\nHillary and C.C. meet in 1958, under the boardwalk on the beach in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Hillary is lost and C.C. is hiding from her overbearing [[stage mother]]. They become fast friends, growing up and bonding through letters of support to each other. Hillary becomes a [[human rights]] lawyer, while C.C.'s singing career does not exactly take off. Hillary shows up at the New York City [[dive bar]] where C.C. is performing, their first meeting since Atlantic City. She moves in with C.C. and gets a job with the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]. C.C. is now performing [[singing telegrams]], leading to a job offer from John, the artistic director of the Falcon Players, after she sings his birthday telegram.\n\nA love triangle ensues as Hillary and John are instantly attracted to one another, leaving C.C. resenting her best friend. Hillary and John sleep together on the opening night of C.C.'s first lead role in an [[off-Broadway]] production. When Hillary returns home to care for her ailing father, the two friends resolve their issues about John as John does not have romantic feelings for C.C. After her father passes away, Hillary spends time at her family beach house with lawyer Michael Essex, eventually marrying him. C.C. and John spend a lot of time together, start dating and eventually marry. Hillary and Michael travel to New York to see C.C. perform on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], where she has become a star. When C.C. finds out that Hillary has stopped working as a lawyer, she accuses her of giving up on her dreams. Hillary responds that C.C. has become obsessed with her career. After the argument, Hillary ignores C.C.'s letters, throwing herself into being a dutiful, but unchallenged, wife.\n\nJohn tells C.C. that her self-centeredness and obsession with her career have him feeling left behind and he asks for a divorce. C.C. turns to her mother for advice. Her mother tells her that she has given up a lot for her daughter, and C.C. starts to understand when her mother tells her the effect that her selfishness has had on those closest to her.\n\nHillary discovers her husband is having an affair. When Hillary learns that C.C. is performing in San Francisco, she makes contact for the first time in years. They learn of each other's divorces, then discover that they have been secretly jealous of each other for years: Hillary is upset that she has none of C.C.'s talent or charisma, while C.C. admits she has always been envious of Hillary's beauty and intelligence.\n\nHillary tells C.C. that she is pregnant and has already decided to raise the child as a [[single parent]]. This wins her admiration from the feisty and independent C.C., who promises to stay and help her out. C.C. starts talking of settling down and having a family of her own, having become engaged to Hillary's obstetrician. However, when C.C.'s agent calls with the perfect comeback gig for her, C.C. abandons her fianc\u00e9 and races back to New York City. Hillary gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria Cecilia. When Victoria is a young girl, Hillary develops [[viral cardiomyopathy]], requiring a heart transplant. Having a rare tissue type, she realizes she will most likely die before a heart is found.\n\nC.C. has become a big star, having won a Tony award and completed her latest hit album. When she learns of Hillary's illness, she accompanies Hillary and Victoria to the beach house for the summer. Hillary becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] due to her debilitated state and takes her frustration out on C.C. whom she sees having fun with and connecting with Victoria. Hillary eventually begins to accept her prognosis bravely, appreciating her time with Victoria and C.C. Hillary and Victoria return to San Francisco, while C.C. heads to Los Angeles for a concert. Hillary collapses, leading to the note C.C. receives that prompts her to leave her rehearsal.

She leaves in a panic to travel to the side of her friend Hillary Whitney, a San Francisco heiress and lawyer. Unable to get a flight to San Francisco because of [[fog]], she rents a car and drives overnight, reflecting on her lifelong friendship with Hillary.\n\nHillary and C.C. meet in 1958, under the boardwalk on the beach in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey]]. Hillary is lost and C.C. is hiding from her overbearing [[stage mother]]. They become fast friends, growing up and bonding through letters of support to each other. Hillary becomes a [[human rights]] lawyer, while C.C.'s singing career does not exactly take off. Hillary shows up at the New York City [[dive bar]] where C.C. is performing, their first meeting since Atlantic City. She moves in with C.C. and gets a job with the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]]. C.C. is now performing [[singing telegrams]], leading to a job offer from John, the artistic director of the Falcon Players, after she sings his birthday telegram.\n\nA love triangle ensues as Hillary and John are instantly attracted to one another, leaving C.C. resenting her best friend. Hillary and John sleep together on the opening night of C.C.'s first lead role in an [[off-Broadway]] production. When Hillary returns home to care for her ailing father, the two friends resolve their issues about John as John does not have romantic feelings for C.C. After her father passes away, Hillary spends time at her family beach house with lawyer Michael Essex, eventually marrying him. C.C. and John spend a lot of time together, start dating and eventually marry. Hillary and Michael travel to New York to see C.C. perform on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]], where she has become a star. When C.C. finds out that Hillary has stopped working as a lawyer, she accuses her of giving up on her dreams. Hillary responds that C.C. has become obsessed with her career. After the argument, Hillary ignores C.C.'s letters, throwing herself into being a dutiful, but unchallenged, wife.\n\nJohn tells C.C. that her self-centeredness and obsession with her career have him feeling left behind and he asks for a divorce. C.C. turns to her mother for advice. Her mother tells her that she has given up a lot for her daughter, and C.C. starts to understand when her mother tells her the effect that her selfishness has had on those closest to her.\n\nHillary discovers her husband is having an affair. When Hillary learns that C.C. is performing in San Francisco, she makes contact for the first time in years. They learn of each other's divorces, then discover that they have been secretly jealous of each other for years: Hillary is upset that she has none of C.C.'s talent or charisma, while C.C. admits she has always been envious of Hillary's beauty and intelligence.\n\nHillary tells C.C. that she is pregnant and has already decided to raise the child as a [[single parent]]. This wins her admiration from the feisty and independent C.C., who promises to stay and help her out. C.C. starts talking of settling down and having a family of her own, having become engaged to Hillary's obstetrician. However, when C.C.'s agent calls with the perfect comeback gig for her, C.C. abandons her fianc\u00e9 and races back to New York City. Hillary gives birth to a daughter, whom she names Victoria Cecilia. When Victoria is a young girl, Hillary develops [[viral cardiomyopathy]], requiring a heart transplant. Having a rare tissue type, she realizes she will most likely die before a heart is found.\n\nC.C. has become a big star, having won a Tony award and completed her latest hit album. When she learns of Hillary's illness, she accompanies Hillary and Victoria to the beach house for the summer. Hillary becomes [[Depression (mood)|depressed]] due to her debilitated state and takes her frustration out on C.C. whom she sees having fun with and connecting with Victoria. Hillary eventually begins to accept her prognosis bravely, appreciating her time with Victoria and C.C. Hillary and Victoria return to San Francisco, while C.C. heads to Los Angeles for a concert. Hillary collapses, leading to the note C.C. receives that prompts her to leave her rehearsal. C.C. takes Hillary and Victoria to the beach house, where Hillary dies.\n\nAfter the funeral, C.C. takes custody of Victoria, and the two console each other in their grief. C.C. goes forward with her concert and concludes it by singing \"The Glory of Love,\" the first song Hillary heard her sing 30 years ago; as the song ends, C.C. tearfully waves toward the sky, in tribute to her. After the show, she leaves hand-in-hand with Victoria and begins telling stories of when she first met her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bette Midler]] as Cecilia Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom\n** [[Mayim Bialik]] as 11-year-old Cecilia Carol \"C.C.\" Bloom\n* [[Barbara Hershey]] as Hillary Whitney\n** Marcie Leeds as 11-year-old Hillary Whitney\n* [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]] as John Pierce\n* [[Spalding Gray]] as Dr. Richard Milstein\n* [[James Read]] as Michael Essex\n* [[Lainie Kazan]] as Leona Bloom\n* Grace Johnston as Victoria Essex\n* [[Lynda Goodfriend]] as Mrs. Myandowski\n* [[Tracy Reiner]] as Department Store Clerk\n* [[Jenifer Lewis]] as Diva\n* [[Joe Grifasi]] as Otto Titsling\n* [[Phil Leeds]] as Sammy Pinkers\n* [[Frank Campanella]] as Doorman\n* [[Kathleen Marshall]] as Delivery Room Nurse #1\n* Barbara Marshall as I.C.
