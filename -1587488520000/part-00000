The members parted ways for a while to study at university, reuniting in 2007. The current members found [[Peter Jones (keyboardist)|Peter Jones]] on keyboards and [[Raymond Hearne]] on drums. Jones left soon after, and was replaced by [[Diego Tejeida]]. [[Charlie Griffiths]] was found on guitar, and Henshall brought in To-Mera bandmate Tom Maclean on bass.\n\nHenshall has composed most of Haken's songs by himself and contributed to some of the lyrics. He composed the whole ''[[Aquarius (Haken album)|Aquarius]]'' album alone, most of ''[[Visions (Haken album)|Visions]]'' (except \"Premonition\", co-written with [[keyboardist]] Diego Tejeida and bassist Thomas MacLean; and \"Insomnia\", written by all members), and most of ''[[The Mountain (Haken album)|The Mountain]]'' (except \"As Death Embraces\", written by Tejeida). In this album, Henshall (as well as every other instrumentalist in the band) contributed with lyrics for the first time, on the song \"Cockroach King\". He would be credited as a lyricist again in the band's 2014 EP ''[[Restoration (EP)|Restoration]]'', for the song \"Crystallised\" (co-written with Hearne and Griffiths). ''[[Affinity (Haken album)|Affinity]]'' (2016) and ''[[Vector (Haken album)|Vector]]'' (2018) both credited all songwriting to every band member.\n\n==Formation of Opinaut==\nOpinaut formed in early 2011 around a group of four musicians working at the Sutton Music Centre. All four are talented multi-instrumentalists who work in music full-time as session players and tutors. Jon Hart \u2013 Singer, John Vince \u2013 Drums, Richard Henshall \u2013 Guitar, Samuel Brooks \u2013 Bass. Opinaut are a merge of drum & bass rock with dreamy electro vibes and epic chord sequences. \nTheir E.P 'Oxygen' was released in 2011 and is available online.\n\n==Influences==\nHenshall has named many influences, such as Jazz and conventional Progressive rock, as well as many notable acts, such as [[Dream Theater]], [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[John Petrucci]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Pain of Salvation]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Debussy]], [[Rachmaninov]], [[Chopin]], [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Mozart]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Jordan Rudess]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Beatles]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John Williams]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Ray Charles]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[De La Soul]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[EPMD]], [[James Brown]], [[Symphony X]], [[Adagio (band)|Adagio]], [[Devin Townsend]], [[Knuckledust]], [[Stampin]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Sigur R\u00f3s]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Opeth]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Rage Against the Machine|RATM]], [[Sikth]], [[Hatebreed]], and [[Mike Oldfield]], among others.<ref>[http://s298973778.websitehome.co.uk/theband.html To-Mera band members bio, with influences]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n[[File:Richard-henshall-1361087590.jpg|thumb|Henshall in 2012.]]\n\n===Solo===\n*(2019) ''[[The Cocoon]]''\n\n===With [[To-Mera]]===\n*(2009) ''[[Earthbound (To-Mera EP)|Earthbound]]'' (EP)\n*(2012) ''Exile''<ref name = TMbio/>\n\n===With [[Haken (band)|Haken]]===\n*''Enter the 5th Dimension'' (Demo) (2008) \n*''[[Aquarius (Haken album)|Aquarius]]'' (2010) \n*''[[Visions (Haken album)|Visions]]'' (2011) \n*''[[The Mountain (Haken album)|The Mountain]]'' (2013) \n*''[[Restoration (EP)|Restoration]]'' (EP) (2014) \n*''[[Affinity (Haken album)|Affinity]]'' (2016)\n*''[[L-1VE]]'' (Live Album) (2018)\n*''[[Vector (Haken album)|Vector]]'' (2018)\n*''[[Virus (Haken album)|Virus]]'' (2020)\n\n===With Nova Collective===\n*''The Further Side'' (2017)\n\n===With Opinaut===\n*(2011) ''Oxygen'' (EP)<ref>[http://haken.fr/albums_aquarius_en.htm Haken homepage, with discography]</ref>\n\n===With Rainmask===\n*(2018) ''Walls'' (Single)\n*(2018) ''Lighting Up The Sky'' (Single)\n\n=== With Alma West ===\n\n* (2019) Redemption<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progressiverockfanatics.wordpress.com/2019/04/28/cinematic-progressive-power-metal/|title=ALMA WEST: Redemption|date=2019-04-28|website=Progressive Rock Fanatics|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== With Andy Simmons ===\n* (2020) ''Duplicated Motion'' (EP)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Haken}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henshall, Richard}}\n[[Category:Progressive metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal keyboardists]]\n[[Category:English rock bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:Male bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal drummers]]\n[[Category:English composers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century drummers]]\n[[Category:21st-century bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:21st-century British male musicians]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2014}}\n{{Use British English|date=August 2014}}\n{{BLP primary sources|date=September 2013}}\n{{Infobox musical artist\n| name                = Richard Henshall\n| image               = Richard Henshall in 2011.jpg\n| alt                 =\n| caption             = Richard Henshall performing live with Haken at the 2011 Lorelei.\n| image_size            =\n| background          = solo_singer\n| alias               = Hen\n| birth_date          = {{birth date and age|df=yes|1984|8|8}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Another birthday?|url=https://www.facebook.com/HakenOfficial/posts/10152705226079744|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=9 January 2015}}</ref>\n| origin              = England\n| instrument          = Guitar, piano, [[electric keyboard|keyboards]], vocals, [[clarinet]], drums, bass guitar\n| genre               = [[Progressive metal]], [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]\n| occupation          = Musician\n| years_active        = 2004\u2013present\n| label               = [[Candlelight Records]], Sensory Records\n| associated_acts     = [[Haken (band)|Haken]], [[To-Mera]], Nova Collective\n| website                 = [http://s298973778.websitehome.co.uk/index.html To-Mera Home], [https://www.hakenmusic.com/ Haken home]\n}}\n'''Richard \"Hen\" Henshall''' is a British [[progressive metal]] multi-instrumentalist.

The members parted ways for a while to study at university, reuniting in 2007. The current members found [[Peter Jones (keyboardist)|Peter Jones]] on keyboards and [[Raymond Hearne]] on drums. Jones left soon after, and was replaced by [[Diego Tejeida]]. [[Charlie Griffiths]] was found on guitar, and Henshall brought in To-Mera bandmate Tom Maclean on bass.\n\nHenshall has composed most of Haken's songs by himself and contributed to some of the lyrics. He composed the whole ''[[Aquarius (Haken album)|Aquarius]]'' album alone, most of ''[[Visions (Haken album)|Visions]]'' (except \"Premonition\", co-written with [[keyboardist]] Diego Tejeida and bassist Thomas MacLean; and \"Insomnia\", written by all members), and most of ''[[The Mountain (Haken album)|The Mountain]]'' (except \"As Death Embraces\", written by Tejeida). In this album, Henshall (as well as every other instrumentalist in the band) contributed with lyrics for the first time, on the song \"Cockroach King\". He would be credited as a lyricist again in the band's 2014 EP ''[[Restoration (EP)|Restoration]]'', for the song \"Crystallised\" (co-written with Hearne and Griffiths). ''[[Affinity (Haken album)|Affinity]]'' (2016) and ''[[Vector (Haken album)|Vector]]'' (2018) both credited all songwriting to every band member.\n\n==Formation of Opinaut==\nOpinaut formed in early 2011 around a group of four musicians working at the Sutton Music Centre. All four are talented multi-instrumentalists who work in music full-time as session players and tutors. Jon Hart \u2013 Singer, John Vince \u2013 Drums, Richard Henshall \u2013 Guitar, Samuel Brooks \u2013 Bass. Opinaut are a merge of drum & bass rock with dreamy electro vibes and epic chord sequences. \nTheir E.P 'Oxygen' was released in 2011 and is available online.\n\n==Influences==\nHenshall has named many influences, such as Jazz and conventional Progressive rock, as well as many notable acts, such as [[Dream Theater]], [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Shawn Lane]], [[John Petrucci]], [[Wes Montgomery]], [[Chet Atkins]], [[Jerry Reed]], [[Yes (band)|Yes]], [[Pain of Salvation]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], [[Debussy]], [[Rachmaninov]], [[Chopin]], [[Gomez (band)|Gomez]], [[Muse (band)|Muse]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Mozart]], [[Aphex Twin]], [[Magnum (band)|Magnum]], [[Earth, Wind & Fire]], [[Jordan Rudess]], [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], [[Michael Jackson]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]], [[The Beatles]], [[Ocean Colour Scene]], [[Al Di Meola]], [[John Williams]], [[Danny Elfman]], [[Ray Charles]], [[The Pharcyde]], [[De La Soul]], [[Jeff Beck]], [[EPMD]], [[James Brown]], [[Symphony X]], [[Adagio (band)|Adagio]], [[Devin Townsend]], [[Knuckledust]], [[Stampin]], [[Emerson, Lake & Palmer|ELP]], [[Bj\u00f6rk]], [[Sigur R\u00f3s]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Opeth]], [[Curtis Mayfield]], [[Rage Against the Machine|RATM]], [[Sikth]], [[Hatebreed]], and [[Mike Oldfield]], among others.<ref>[http://s298973778.websitehome.co.uk/theband.html To-Mera band members bio, with influences]</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n[[File:Richard-henshall-1361087590.jpg|thumb|Henshall in 2012.]]\n\n===Solo===\n*(2019) ''[[The Cocoon]]''\n\n===With [[To-Mera]]===\n*(2009) ''[[Earthbound (To-Mera EP)|Earthbound]]'' (EP)\n*(2012) ''Exile''<ref name = TMbio/>\n\n===With [[Haken (band)|Haken]]===\n*''Enter the 5th Dimension'' (Demo) (2008) \n*''[[Aquarius (Haken album)|Aquarius]]'' (2010) \n*''[[Visions (Haken album)|Visions]]'' (2011) \n*''[[The Mountain (Haken album)|The Mountain]]'' (2013) \n*''[[Restoration (EP)|Restoration]]'' (EP) (2014) \n*''[[Affinity (Haken album)|Affinity]]'' (2016)\n*''[[L-1VE]]'' (Live Album) (2018)\n*''[[Vector (Haken album)|Vector]]'' (2018)\n*''[[Virus (Haken album)|Virus]]'' (2020)\n\n===With Nova Collective===\n*''The Further Side'' (2017)\n\n===With Opinaut===\n*(2011) ''Oxygen'' (EP)<ref>[http://haken.fr/albums_aquarius_en.htm Haken homepage, with discography]</ref>\n\n===With Rainmask===\n*(2018) ''Walls'' (Single)\n*(2018) ''Lighting Up The Sky'' (Single)\n\n=== With Alma West ===\n\n* (2019) Redemption<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://progressiverockfanatics.wordpress.com/2019/04/28/cinematic-progressive-power-metal/|title=ALMA WEST: Redemption|date=2019-04-28|website=Progressive Rock Fanatics|language=en|access-date=2019-11-24}}</ref>\n\n=== With Andy Simmons ===\n* (2020) Duplicated Motion (EP)\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Haken}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Henshall, Richard}}\n[[Category:Progressive metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal keyboardists]]\n[[Category:English rock bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:Male bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:English heavy metal drummers]]\n[[Category:English composers]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1984 births]]\n[[Category:21st-century drummers]]\n[[Category:21st-century bass guitarists]]\n[[Category:21st-century British male musicians]]\n", "name_user": "Victor Lopes", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWith Andy Simmons:wikifying", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Henshall"}

The short attempts to humorously examine what the characters were doing during the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. It was produced as a side project before Waititi began production of his film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' for [[Marvel Studios]]. The short was met with enthusiasm from fans and spawned two sequels.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] were fighting, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] took a short break in Australia. He lives with a local ordinary office worker Darryl Jacobson while trying to figure out what is going on in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. As he does this he is interviewed by a news team and talks about daily life in Australia and shows short segments of events, such as his visit to a kindergarten, an attempt to send an email to Tony Stark concerning his conflict with Captain America with Darryl's help, and drawing a painting about the connections among the Avengers team members, [[Nick Fury]] and [[Thanos]], who he describes as \"the purple man in the floating chair\". Lastly, Thor and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] meet at a cafe, where Banner receives a phone call from Tony Stark and does not appear to want to talk to Thor.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-mockumentary-debuts-at-comic-con-913972|title=Comic-Con: 'Thor: Ragnarok' Director Reveals What Thor and Hulk Were Doing During 'Civil War'|date=July 23, 2016|author=Galuppo, Mia|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]\n*[[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]\n*Daley Pearson as Darryl Jacobson\n\n==Production==\nThe short was produced in Australia and was made with a mockumentary style, the same type of style Taika Waititi had done previously with the film ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]''.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|author= Kreps, Daniel|date=August 28, 2016|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/watch-thor-explain-civil-war-absence-in-hilarious-short-w436541|title=Watch Thor Explain 'Civil War' Absence in Hilarious Short|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Filming of the short began about one month before the shooting of ''Thor: Ragnarok'' started and Waititi expressed that it was something that he and the crew of the film simply wanted to do for fun.<ref name=\"denofgeek.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/taika-waititi/52768/thor-ragnarok-director-taika-waititi-interview|title=Thor: Ragnarok \u2013 director Taika Waititi interview|date=October 24, 2017|author=Leane, Rob|accessdate=2018-03-02|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film debuted at a screening on Sunday July 23 at San Diego Comic-Con 2016, three days later it was released online for free viewing and later released as part of ''Captain America: Civil War''{{'}}s home media releases.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|url=https://nerdist.com/captain-america-civil-war-blu-ray-makes-you-choose-sides-review/|title=CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR Blu-ray Is Just Shy of Perfect (Review)|author=LUKE Y.

Nonetheless, both this short and its sequel have influenced Hemsworth's portrayal of the character in future films.  In ''Thor: Ragnarok'', Thor refers to an e-mail as an \"electronic letter\", as he does when writing to Tony in this short, and Doctor Strange references that he does not have a phone, which Thor mentions to Bruce in the short as well.

The short attempts to humorously examine what the characters were doing during the events of ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''. It was produced as a side project before Waititi began production of his film ''[[Thor: Ragnarok]]'' for [[Marvel Studios]]. The short was met with enthusiasm from fans and spawned two sequels.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile [[Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Iron Man]] and [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] were fighting, [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]] took a short break in Australia. He lives with a local ordinary office worker Darryl Jacobson while trying to figure out what is going on in [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. As he does this he is interviewed by a news team and talks about daily life in Australia and shows short segments of events, such as his visit to a kindergarten, an attempt to send an email to Tony Stark concerning his conflict with Captain America with Darryl's help, and drawing a painting about the connections among the Avengers team members, [[Nick Fury]] and [[Thanos]], who he describes as \"the purple man in the floating chair\". Lastly, Thor and [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]] meet at a cafe, where Banner receives a phone call from Tony Stark and does not appear to want to talk to Thor.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/thor-mockumentary-debuts-at-comic-con-913972|title=Comic-Con: 'Thor: Ragnarok' Director Reveals What Thor and Hulk Were Doing During 'Civil War'|date=July 23, 2016|author=Galuppo, Mia|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n*[[Chris Hemsworth]] as [[Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Thor]]\n*[[Mark Ruffalo]] as [[Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Bruce Banner]]\n*Daley Pearson as Darryl Jacobson\n\n==Production==\nThe short was produced in Australia and was made with a mockumentary style, the same type of style Taika Waititi had done previously with the film ''[[What We Do in the Shadows]]''.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|author= Kreps, Daniel|date=August 28, 2016|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/watch-thor-explain-civil-war-absence-in-hilarious-short-w436541|title=Watch Thor Explain 'Civil War' Absence in Hilarious Short|publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> Filming of the short began about one month before the shooting of ''Thor: Ragnarok'' started and Waititi expressed that it was something that he and the crew of the film simply wanted to do for fun.<ref name=\"denofgeek.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.denofgeek.com/uk/movies/taika-waititi/52768/thor-ragnarok-director-taika-waititi-interview|title=Thor: Ragnarok \u2013 director Taika Waititi interview|date=October 24, 2017|author=Leane, Rob|accessdate=2018-03-02|publisher=[[Den of Geek]]}}</ref>\n\n==Release and reception==\nThe film debuted at a screening on Sunday July 23 at San Diego Comic-Con 2016, three days later it was released online for free viewing and later released as part of ''Captain America: Civil War''{{'}}s home media releases.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-02|url=https://nerdist.com/captain-america-civil-war-blu-ray-makes-you-choose-sides-review/|title=CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR Blu-ray Is Just Shy of Perfect (Review)|author=LUKE Y.

They had to write down their sum in Roman numerals on the back of the postcard and show it to a pair of [[Gregory Peck]] and [[Audrey Hepburn]] from ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' impersonators at the top of the steps. If they had the right answer of MCMXXIV (1,924), they would receive their next clue; otherwise, they had to go back down to the chestnut vendor to get a new postcard and try again.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*At the start of the leg, teams were told to travel to \"The Eternal City\" and find [[Hadrian]]'s Bridge to retrieve their next clue, leaving them to figure out that they had to travel to [[Rome]] and find the [[Ponte Sant'Angelo]].\n*After the Detour, teams were told to visit the \"piazza of [[John Keats]]' [[John Keats#Last months: Rome|unhappy Roman Holiday]]\", leaving them to figure out it referred to the [[Piazza di Spagna]] at the base of the [[Spanish Steps]]. \n*After the Roadblock, teams were told to head to \"where the leg of the ''Race'' ends and the [[Via Flaminia]] begins\": the [[Piazza del Popolo]].\n\n===Leg 8 (Italy)===\n[[File:Urlaubsbilder Bolsenasee 082.jpg|thumb|Teams visited the historic town of [[Civita di Bagnoregio]] for the Detour on this leg of the Race.]]\n'''Airdate''': April 20, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-amazing-race-all-stars-2014/episode-8-season-24/the-amazing-race-all-stars/630877 |title=The Amazing Race: All-Stars Episode Guide 2014 Season 24 - The Amazing Race: All-Stars, Episode 8 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}</ref>\n*Rome ([https://www.italialiberty.it/scheda/villacagiati/ Villa Cagiati])\n*[[Bagnoregio]] ([[Civita di Bagnoregio]]) {{TAR clue|Detour|Donkey Run|Donkey Build}}\n*Bagnoregio (Hostaria del Ponte) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|double=yes|Brendon & Rachel|Dave & Connor|Dave & Connor|Leo & Jamal}}\n*[[Orvieto]] ([http://www.labadiahotel.it/ La Badia di Orvieto]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's got the write stuff?}}\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Orvieto ([[Orvieto Funicular]])\n*Orvieto ([[Pozzo di S.

In Donkey Run, teams had to pick a pair of donkeys and then participate in a traditional donkey race, ''Palio della Tonna''. If they could make three laps before the band stopped playing, they would win their next clue. In Donkey Build, teams headed to \"Geppetto's Workshop\" where they built a wooden donkey-shaped trolley using all of the pieces provided, including the crate the pieces were held in. Once they were done, it was loaded with wood and they then had to deliver the wood to \"[[Mister Geppetto|Geppetto]]\" himself for their next clue.\n\nIn the Roadblock, one team member had to copy a page out of an [[illuminated manuscript]], just as [[monk]]s traditionally did before the invention of the printing press. Once they properly copied the page's [[calligraphy]] and [[gold leaf]] to the head monk's approval, they received their next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*At the start of the leg, teams had to choose a marked [[Ford Fiesta]] to drive themselves to [[Civita di Bagnoregio]] in the Italian countryside.\n\n;Additional note\n*Teams began the eight leg at the Villa Cagiati.\n\n===Leg 9 (Italy \u2192 Switzerland)===\n[[File:Titlis from Grassen biwak.jpg|thumb|The Pit Stop for this leg was at the top of [[Switzerland]]'s Mount [[Titlis]].]]\n'''Airdate''': April 27, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-amazing-race-all-stars-2014/episode-9-season-24/the-amazing-race-all-stars/630877 |title=The Amazing Race: All-Stars Episode Guide 2014 Season 24 - The Amazing Race: All-Stars, Episode 9 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref>\n*{{TAR travel|train}} Rome ([[Roma Termini railway station|Roma Termini Railway Station]]) to [[Chiasso]], '''[[Switzerland]]''' {{flagicon|SWI}} ([[Chiasso railway station|Chiasso Railway Station]])\n*[[Altdorf, Uri|Altdorf]] ([[Tell Monument]])\n*[[Lucerne]] ([[Kapellbr\u00fccke|Chapel Bridge]])\n*Lucerne ([https://www.schweizerhof-luzern.ch/en/ Hotel Schweizerhof])\n*Lucerne ([[Swiss Museum of Transport]])\n*[[Wolfenschiessen]] (Oberrickenbach)\n*{{TAR travel|gondola}} {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who's ready to be milked to oblivion?}} Wolfenschiessen ([[Bannalpsee]])\n*{{TAR travel|gondola}} [[Engelberg]] (Engelberg Cable Car Station) to [[Tr\u00fcbsee]] ([https://www.hoteltruebsee.ch/en Berghotel Tr\u00fcbsee]) to [[Titlis|Mount Titlis]] {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|9}}\n\nIn this Roadblock, one team member had to pick a [[Bernese Mountain Dog]] with a cart containing two empty milk jugs and guide their dog to one of two [[aerial tramway|gondola]] stations. After unloading the milk jugs and riding the gondola to the top station, the team member had to carry the milk jugs to a dairy farm and trade the empty jugs for full ones. They then had to carry the full jugs back to the gondola and down to their dog, before bringing the dog and full milk jugs to the milk truck to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*After arriving in [[Chiasso]], teams drove themselves in a marked [[Ford Focus (third generation)|Ford Focus]] to [[Altdorf, Switzerland|Altdorf]] and waited at the [[Tell Monument]] for a [[William Tell]] impersonator who would give them their next clue instructing them to find the oldest wooden bridge in Europe, [[Kapellbr\u00fccke|Chapel Bridge]], to find their next clue.\n*At Hotel Schweizerhof, teams had to clean a room that they were told was trashed by a rock band's party. After picking up a room number at the front desk and changing into cleaning staff outfits, they cleaned the rooms and then had to set them back to perfectly match an example room. Once the room was set properly, the hotel's [[gouvernante]] Helga would give teams their next clue.\n*At the Swiss Museum of Transport, teams had search the grounds for a marked artifact and had to figure out that the artifact was a massive drill bit for a [[tunnel boring machine]] to receive their next clue. Teams then had to search the museum for its [[Ford Mustang]] exhibit and pick a classic Mustang with their next clue instructing them to use the road signs on the museum that listed distances to other Swiss cities and a formula included in their clue to calculate the model year of the Mustang they chose. Once teams had the correct answer, they had to show it to the president of the Swiss Mustang Club to receive their next clue.\n*At Oberrickenbach in [[Wolfenschiessen]], teams had to search for a milk tanker that had their next clue.\n\n===Leg 10 (Switzerland \u2192 Spain)===\n[[File:PANO 20140718 130005.jpg|thumb|In [[Seville]], teams visited the Patio de las Doncellas inside [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Real Alc\u00e1zar]] in the [[History of Seville#Muslim al-Andalus|Muslim section]] of old city.]]\n'''Airdate''': May 4, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-amazing-race-all-stars-2014/episode-10-season-24/the-amazing-race-all-stars/630877 |title=The Amazing Race: All-Stars Episode Guide 2014 Season 24 - The Amazing Race: All-Stars, Episode 10 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-09}}</ref>\n*Engelberg (Engelberg Cable Car Station)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} [[Zurich metropolitan area|Z\u00fcrich]] ([[Zurich Airport]]) to [[Seville]], '''[[Spain]]''' {{flagicon|ESP}} ([[Seville Airport]])\n*Seville ([[Alameda de H\u00e9rcules|La Alameda]] \u2013 Statue of [[Hercules]] and [[Julius Caesar]])\n*Seville (Melado Peluqueros) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to be a Barber of Seville?}}\n*Seville ([[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville|Real Alc\u00e1zar]] \u2013 [[Alc\u00e1zar of Seville#Patio de las Doncellas|Patio de las Doncellas]])\n**{{TAR clue|Speed Bump|Ham It Up}} Seville ([http://www.lasteresas.es/ Las Teresas Caf\u00e9 Bar])\n*{{TAR clue|Detour|Spanish Steps|Running with the Ballz|after=yes}} Seville ([[:es:Museo del Baile Flamenco|Museo del Baile Flamenco]] {{in lang|es}} ''or'' [[Santa Cruz, Seville|Calle Lope de Rueda]])\n*Seville ([[General Archive of the Indies]]) {{TAR clue|U-Turn|double=yes|Leo & Jamal|Jet & Cord|Caroline & Jennifer|Brendon & Rachel|failed2=yes}}\n*Seville ([[Plaza de Am\u00e9rica]]) ''(Unaired)''\n*Seville ([[Plaza de Espa\u00f1a, Seville|Plaza de Espa\u00f1a]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop|10}}\n\nIn the Roadblock, one team member paid homage to the opera ''[[The Barber of Seville]]'' by becoming a barber in Seville. They had to properly apply shaving cream to a balloon and then use a [[straight razor]] to remove all of the shaving cream within 60 seconds to receive their next clue from a barber. If they popped the balloon or ran out of time, they had to start over.\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Spanish Steps and Running with the Ballz. In Spanish Steps, teams had to learn a traditional [[flamenco]] routine and correctly perform on stage to receive their next clue. In Running with the Ballz, teams wore [[zorbing|bumperz]] designed to look like bulls and ran through the streets of Seville, trying to avoid other \"bulls\", and looking for fragments of a motto printed on several posters along the route. Once the teams reached the end of the course and could recite the full motto (\"A [[matador]] never thinks about his own death\") to the ''mayoral,'' the teams would receive their next clue.\n\nFor their Speed Bump, Caroline & Jennifer had to deliver six ''[[Jam\u00f3n ib\u00e9rico|jam\u00f3nes ib\u00e9ricos]]'' through the streets and alleys of Seville to Las Teresas Caf\u00e9 Bar before they could continue racing.\n\n;Additional notes\n*Teams began the tenth leg at the cable car station in Engelberg.\n*At Plaza de Am\u00e9rica, teams boarded a horse-drawn carriage that took them to the Pit Stop.

After the 15-minute boat ride to the other side of the aqueduct was complete, the team member disembarked the boat and recited the poem from memory to a waiting linguist. If the team member could recite the poem perfectly, the linguist would award them their next clue.\n\nThe Detour was a choice between Shoot It and Boot It. In Shoot It, teams participated in [[clay pigeon shooting]] using a 12-gauge [[shotgun]]. Once they hit a total of 16 clay pigeons, they would be given their next clue. In Boot It, teams participated in [[boot throwing]]. After searching through a pile of [[Wellington boot]]s to find a pair of either size-9 or size-11 boots, the teams filled them with water and threw them along a course until they reached the finish line. At the end of the course, a \"Wellie official\" would confirm that the teams had found the correct-sized boots and give them their next clue.\n\n;Additional task\n*After landing in London, teams drove themselves in a Ford Focus to [[Liverpool]]'s [[Anfield]] stadium. At Anfield, each team member had to score two [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kick]]s against a professional [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]].\n\n===Leg 12 (United Kingdom \u2192 United States)===\n[[File:Nascarvegas05.jpg|thumb|The Finish Line of the second installment of ''The Amazing Race: All-Stars'' was at the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]].]]\n'''Airdate''': May 18, 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/the-amazing-race-all-stars-2014/episode-12-season-24/the-amazing-race-all-stars/630877 |title=The Amazing Race: All-Stars Episode Guide 2014 Season 24 - The Amazing Race: All-Stars, Episode 12 |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-24}}</ref>\n*[[Chester]] (Carden Park Luxury Hotel)\n*{{TAR travel|flight}} London (Heathrow Airport) to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] {{flagicon|Nevada}}, '''United States''' {{flagicon|USA}} ([[McCarran International Airport]])\n*[[North Las Vegas]] (Desert)\n*[[Las Vegas]] ([[MGM Grand Las Vegas]]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Do You Believe in Magic?}}\n*Las Vegas ([[Neon Museum#Boneyard|Neon Museum Boneyard]])\n*Las Vegas ([[The Mirage]])\n*[[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]] ([https://www.maverickhelicopter.com/ Maverick Helicopters]) {{TAR clue|Roadblock|Who wants to be a UFO?}}\n*Las Vegas ([[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]) {{TAR clue|Pit Stop}}\n\nIn the first Roadblock of the leg, one team member participated in an illusion with magician [[David Copperfield (illusionist)|David Copperfield]]. After opening up the box they previously dug up from the desert, retrieving the keys inside, the team member performing the Roadblock was shackled to the inside of a box and once the box was closed, their partner would hand over the keys through a hole in the box. Copperfield then escorted the teammate sitting out the Roadblock to a television monitor to watch their partner attempt the challenge. After the team member inside the box found the right key and unlocked the shackles, they had to retrieve [[lock picking|lockpicks]] from the top of the box, after which the box was lifted off of the ground and lit on fire. Once the racer in the box said that they were complete, the partner, under Copperfield's instruction, set off a series of switches that dropped the box into a burning pile of wood and set off a fiery explosion. Copperfield then informed the partner that they would have to get the fire department's assistance, and the racer in the box would appear wearing a firefighter uniform, completely unharmed. Copperfield would then give them their next clue, after a bit of [[sleight of hand]].\n\nFor final Roadblock of the ''Race'', the team member who sat out the first Roadblock had to get in a helicopter, wearing a special futuristic jumpsuit, and search the [[Las Vegas Strip]] for a sign at the [[Aria Resort and Casino]] that told them the name of their drop zone and location of the Finish Line: the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]]. After informing their pilot, they would tandem skydive {{convert|10000|foot|m|adj=on}} onto the racetrack's infield, spewing fireworks along the way, to join their partner and cross the Finish Line.\n\n;Additional tasks\n*After landing in Las Vegas, teams were chauffeured by a driver in one of three [[Ford Explorer#Fifth generation (2011\u2013)|Ford Explorers]] to an isolated location in the desert. Upon arrival, the chauffeurs simply told the teams to get out of the car and dig. Teams eventually unearthed a box that said \"Property of David Copperfield\". After retrieving the box, they returned to the car and were driven to the MGM Grand.\n*The clue from the [[Neon Museum]]'s \"[[wrecking yard|bone yard]]\" instructed teams to take a light bulb from a silver and red question mark sign and take it with them to The Mirage.\n*At The Mirage, teams were hoisted on a window washing scaffold to one of the hotel's signs atop the tower, where they had to replace all of the light bulbs in the sign's letter \"I\". Once they replaced all of the bulbs, they had to tell the employees how many bulbs they used (241) in order to receive their next clue.\n\n;Additional note\n*Teams began the final leg at Carden Park Luxury Hotel in [[Chester]].\n\n==Ratings==\nNo episode aired on April 6, 2014, due to the CBS broadcast of the [[Academy of Country Music Awards]].\n\n===U.S. Nielsen ratings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| No.\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Airdate\n!rowspan=\"2\"| Episode\n!

After the team member inside the box found the right key and unlocked the shackles, they had to retrieve [[lock picking|lockpicks]] from the top of the box, after which the box was lifted off of the ground and lit on fire. Once the racer in the box said that they were complete, the partner, under Copperfield's instruction, set off a series of switches that dropped the box into a burning pile of wood and set off a fiery explosion. Copperfield then informed the partner that they would have to get the fire department's assistance, and the racer in the box would appear wearing a firefighter uniform, completely unharmed. Copperfield would then give them their next clue, after a bit of [[sleight of hand]].\n\nFor final Roadblock of the ''Race'', the team member who sat out the first Roadblock had to get in a helicopter, wearing a special futuristic jumpsuit, and search the [[Las Vegas Strip]] for a sign at the [[Aria Resort and Casino]] that told them the name of their drop zone and location of the Finish Line: the [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway]].
