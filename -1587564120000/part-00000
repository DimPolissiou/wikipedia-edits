Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada]], but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the [[Confidence and supply#Confidence|confidence]] of the elected [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But if that leader lacks the support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.<ref>{{Citation| last=Forsey| first=Eugene| author-link=Eugene Forsey| title=How Canadians Govern Themselves| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2005| edition=6| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf| page=38| isbn=0-662-39689-8| accessdate=24 March 2011| ref=CITEREF_Forsey_2005| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229155255/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf| archivedate=29 December 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the [[Constitution of Canada]]; [[executive authority]] is formally vested in [[Monarchy of Canada|the sovereign]] and exercised on his or her behalf by the governor general. The prime ministership is part of Canada's constitutional convention tradition. The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time. Sir [[John A. Macdonald]] was commissioned by the [[Charles Monck, 4th Viscount Monck|Viscount Monck]] on 24 May 1867, to form the first [[Government of Canada|government]] of the [[Canadian Confederation]]. On 1 July 1867, the [[1st Canadian Ministry|first ministry]] assumed office.<ref name=1July/>\n\nThe date for which a prime minister begins his or her term has been determined by the date that he or she is sworn into his or her [[Ministry (government department)|portfolio]], as an [[oath of office]] as prime minister is not required.<ref name=Guide>{{cite web|title=Guide to Canadian Ministries since Confederation: Life of a Ministry|url=http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/mgm/#LIFE|publisher=Government of Canada [[Privy Council Office (Canada)|Privy Council Office]]|date=14 October 2009|accessdate=24 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315135020/http://www.pco-bcp.gc.ca/mgm/#LIFE|archive-date=15 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, since 1957, the incoming prime minister has sworn an oath as prime minister.<ref name=Guide/> Before 1920, prime ministers' resignations were accepted immediately by the governor general and the last day of the ministries were the date he died or the date of resignation.<ref name=Guide/> Since 1920, the outgoing prime minister has only formally resigned when the new government is ready to be formed.<ref name=Guide/> The Interpretation Act of 1967 states that \"where an appointment is made effective or terminates on a specified day, that appointment is considered to be effective or to terminate after the end of the previous day\".<ref name=Guide/> Thus, although the outgoing prime minister formally resigns only hours before the incoming ministry swears their oaths, both during the day, the ministries are effectively changed at midnight the night before.

Officially, the prime minister is appointed by the [[Governor General of Canada]], but by constitutional convention, the prime minister must have the [[Confidence and supply#Confidence|confidence]] of the elected [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]]. Normally, this is the leader of the party caucus with the greatest number of seats in the house. But if that leader lacks the support of the majority, the governor general can appoint another leader who has that support or may dissolve parliament and call a new election. By [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]], a prime minister holds a seat in parliament and, since the early 20th century, this has more specifically meant the House of Commons.<ref>{{Citation| last=Forsey| first=Eugene| author-link=Eugene Forsey| title=How Canadians Govern Themselves| place=Ottawa| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| year=2005| edition=6| url=http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf| page=38| isbn=0-662-39689-8| accessdate=24 March 2011| ref=CITEREF_Forsey_2005| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229155255/http://www2.parl.gc.ca/Sites/LOP/AboutParliament/Forsey/PDFs/How_Canadians_Govern_Themselves-6ed.pdf| archivedate=29 December 2009| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe office is not outlined in any of the documents that constitute the written portion of the [[Constitution of Canada]]; [[executive authority]] is formally vested in [[Monarchy of Canada|the sovereign]] and exercised on his or her behalf by the governor general. The prime ministership is part of Canada's constitutional convention tradition. The office was modelled after that which existed in Britain at the time. Sir [[John A.

{"title_page": "Aggregate function", "text_new": "In [[database management]], an '''aggregate function''' or '''aggregation function''' is a [[subroutine|function]] where the values of multiple rows are grouped together to form a single [[summary statistics|summary value]].\n\nCommon aggregate functions include :\n\n* [[Average]] (i.e., [[arithmetic mean]])\n* [[Counting|Count]]\n* [[Maximum]]\n* [[Median]]\n* [[Minimum]]\n* [[Mode (statistics)|Mode]]\n* [[Range (statistics)|Range]]\n* [[Summation|Sum]]\n\nOthers include:\n\n* Nanmean (mean ignoring NaN values, also known as \"nil\" or \"null\")\n* [[Standard deviation|Stddev]]\n\nFormally, an aggregate function takes input a [[set (computer science)|set]], a [[Multiset (abstract data type)|multiset]] (bag), or a [[list (computing)|list]] from some input domain {{mvar|''I''}} and outputs an element of an output domain {{mvar|''O''}}.{{sfn|Jesus|Baquero|Almeida|2011|loc=2 Problem Definition, pp. 3}} The input and output domains may be the same, such as for <code>SUM</code>, or may be different, such as for <code>COUNT</code>.\n\nAggregate functions occur commonly in numerous [[programming language]]s, in [[spreadsheet]]s, and in [[relational algebra]].\n\nThe <code>listagg</code> function, as defined in the [[SQL:2016]] standard<ref name=\":0\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://dzone.com/articles/big-news-in-databases-new-sql-standard-cloud-wars\n |title= Big News in Databases: New SQL Standard, Cloud Wars, and ACIDRain (Spring 2017)\n |last= Winand\n |first= Markus\n |date= 2017-05-15\n |publisher= DZone\n |access-date= 2017-06-10\n |quote= In December 2016, ISO released a new version of the SQL standard.

In [[distributed computing]], it is desirable to divide such computations into smaller pieces, and distribute the work, usually [[parallel computing|computing in parallel]], via a [[divide and conquer algorithm]].\n\nSome aggregate functions can be computed by computing the aggregate for subsets, and then aggregating these aggregates; examples include <code>COUNT, MAX, MIN,</code> and <code>SUM</code>. In other cases the aggregate can be computed by computing auxiliary numbers for subsets, aggregating these auxiliary numbers, and finally computing the overall number at the end; examples include <code>AVERAGE</code> (tracking sum and count, dividing at the end) and <code>RANGE</code> (tracking max and min, subtracting at the end). In other cases the aggregate cannot be computed without analyzing the entire set at once, though in some cases approximations can be distributed; examples include <code>DISTINCT COUNT, MEDIAN,</code> and <code>MODE</code>.\n\nSuch functions are called '''decomposable aggregation functions'''{{sfn|Jesus|Baquero|Almeida|2011|loc=2.1 Decomposable functions, pp. 3\u20134}} or '''decomposable aggregate functions'''. The simplest may be referred to as '''self-decomposable aggregation functions''', which are defined as those functions {{mvar|''f''}} such that there is a ''merge operator'' {{tmath|\\diamond}} such that\n:<math>f(X \\uplus Y) = f(X) \\diamond f(Y)</math>\nwhere {{tmath|\\uplus}} is the union of multisets.\n\nFor example, <code>SUM</code>:\n:<math>\\operatorname{SUM}({x}) = x</math>, for a singleton;\n:<math>\\operatorname{SUM}(X \\uplus Y) = \\operatorname{SUM}(X) + \\operatorname{SUM}(Y)</math>, meaning that merge {{tmath|\\diamond}} is simply addition.\n<code>COUNT</code>:\n:<math>\\operatorname{COUNT}({x}) = 1</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{COUNT}(X \\uplus Y) = \\operatorname{COUNT}(X) + \\operatorname{COUNT}(Y)</math>.\n<code>MAX</code>:\n:<math>\\operatorname{MAX}({x}) = x</math>,\n:<math>\\operatorname{MAX}(X \\uplus Y) = \\max\\bigl(\\operatorname{MAX}(X), \\operatorname{MAX}(Y)\\bigr)</math>.\n<code>MIN</code>:\n:<math display=\"inline\">\\operatorname{MIN}({x}) = x</math><ref name=\":0\">\n{{cite web\n |url=https://dzone.com/articles/big-news-in-databases-new-sql-standard-cloud-wars\n |title= Big News in Databases: New SQL Standard, Cloud Wars, and ACIDRain (Spring 2017)\n |last= Winand\n |first= Markus\n |date= 2017-05-15\n |publisher= DZone\n |access-date= 2017-06-10\n |quote= In December 2016, ISO released a new version of the SQL standard.

For example, <code>AVERAGE</code>=<code>SUM</code>/<code>COUNT</code> and <code>RANGE</code>=<code>MAX</code>\u2212<code>MIN</code>.\n\nIn the [[MapReduce]] framework, these steps are known as InitialReduce (value on individual record/singleton set), Combine (binary merge on two aggregations), and FinalReduce (final function on auxiliary values),{{sfn|Yu|Gunda|Isard|2009|loc=2.

In other cases the aggregate can be computed by computing auxiliary numbers for subsets, aggregating these auxiliary numbers, and finally computing the overall number at the end; examples include <code>AVERAGE</code> (tracking sum and count, dividing at the end) and <code>RANGE</code> (tracking max and min, subtracting at the end). In other cases the aggregate cannot be computed without analyzing the entire set at once, though in some cases approximations can be distributed; examples include <code>DISTINCT COUNT, MEDIAN,</code> and <code>MODE</code>.\n\nSuch functions are called '''decomposable aggregation functions'''{{sfn|Jesus|Baquero|Almeida|2011|loc=2.1 Decomposable functions, pp. 3\u20134}} or '''decomposable aggregate functions'''.

The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently.

Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the [[polar region]]s, they interact with their [[ecosystem]]s in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and [[fungus|fungi]], break down animal and plant debris, and eat other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]], while others such as [[Coccinellidae]] (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.\n\nBeetles typically have a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] including the [[Elytron|elytra]], though some such as the [[rove beetles]] have very shirt legs that stick out so m7ch and protrude like bunny teeth.biology 8s really sim0le 8f u put us ahead to 8t......yha5 is all\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Coleoptera SMNK.jpg|thumb|Coleoptera at the [[Staatliches Museum f\u00fcr Naturkunde Karlsruhe]], Germany]]\n\nThe name of the taxonomic order, Coleoptera, comes from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''koleopteros'' (\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b5\u03cc\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2), given to the group by [[Aristotle]] for their [[elytron|elytra]], hardened shield-like forewings, from ''koleos'', sheath, and ''pteron'', wing.

The antennae arises between the eye and the mandibles and in the Tenebrionidae, the antennae rise in front of a notch that breaks the usually circular outline of the compound eye.

The tergum in almost all species is membranous, or usually soft and concealed by the wings and elytra when not in flight. The pleura are usually small or hidden in some species, with each pleuron having a single spiracle.

Digestion takes place mostly in the anterior [[midgut]], although in predatory groups like the [[Carabidae]], most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the [[Elateridae]], the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes.<ref name=insenc/> The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. This is followed by the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\n===Nervous system===\nThe [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n===Respiratory system===\n[[File:DytiscusSpiracles.png|thumb|''[[Dytiscus]]'' [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s (right) on upper side of abdomen, normally covered by the elytra, are in contact with an air bubble when the beetle dives.|left|175x175px]]Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for the [[oxygen]] it contains, and exhale [[carbon dioxide]], via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]].

Such a bubble may be contained under the elytra or against the body by specialized [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] hairs. The bubble covers at least some of the spiracles, permitting air to enter the tracheae.<ref name=insenc/> The function of the bubble is not only to contain a store of air but to act as a [[Gill#Plastron|physical gill]].

The typical form of metamorphosis in beetles passes through four main stages: the [[Egg (biology)|egg]], the [[larva]], the [[pupa]], and the [[imago]] or adult. The larvae are commonly called [[Larva|grubs]] and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final [[instar]]. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families [[Meloidae]] and [[Rhipiphoridae]], go further, undergoing [[hypermetamorphosis]] in which the first instar takes the form of a [[triungulin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242221698 |author1=Ozbek, H. |author2=Szalokia, D. |date=1998 |title=A contribution to the knowledge of the Meloidae (Coleoptera) fauna of Turkey along with new record |journal=Turkish Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |pages=23\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Mating===\n[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]\n\nSome beetles have intricate mating behaviour. [[Pheromone]] communication is often important in locating a mate.\nDifferent species use different pheromones. Scarab beetles such as the [[Rutelinae]] use pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarabs such as the [[Melolonthinae]] use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates is seen in the [[Firefly|fireflies]] (Lampyridae) which are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.<ref name=insenc/>\n\nBefore mating, males and females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his antennae on her head, palps, and antennae. In ''[[Eupompha]]'', the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.<ref name=insenc/> This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a [[Russia]]n population of [[tansy Beetle|tansy beetle]] (''Chysolina graminis'') is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Medvedev, L.

Many male beetles are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours. During copulation, [[Spermatozoon|sperm cell]]s are transferred to the female to [[fertilization|fertilize]] the egg.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\n===Life cycle===\n[[File:Life cycle of stag beetle.svg|thumb|300px|The life cycle of the [[stag beetle]] includes three [[instar]]s.]]\n\n====Egg====\nEssentially all beetles lay eggs, though some [[myrmecophily|myrmecophilous]] [[Aleocharinae]] and some [[Chrysomelinae]] which live in mountains or the subarctic are [[ovoviviparous]], laying eggs which hatch almost immediately. Beetle eggs generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the [[Cupedidae]] have hard eggs. Eggs vary widely between species: the eggs tend to be small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of eggs.\nA female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime, depending on the extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which house, feed and protect their young.

Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of [[skin beetle]]s undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity. The cycle can be repeated many times (see [[Biological immortality]]).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Beck |first1=S. D. |last2=Bharadwaj |first2=R.

Like adult beetles, the larvae are varied in appearance, particularly between beetle families. Beetles with somewhat flattened, highly mobile larvae include the ground beetles and rove beetles; their larvae are described as campodeiform. Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the [[click beetle]] (Elateridae) and [[darkling beetle]] (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms.

In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host. This is known as [[hypermetamorphosis]]; it occurs in the [[Meloidae]], [[Micromalthidae]], and [[Ripiphoridae]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Krinsky, W. L. |editor1=Mullen, G. R. |editor2=Durden, L.

In another week it moults and assumes the appearance of a [[Scarabaeidae|scarabaeid larva]] \u2013 the scarabaeidoid stage.

Some are [[omnivore]]s, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s ([[Staphylinidae]]), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey, such as earthworms and snails. While most predatory beetles are generalists, a few species have more specific prey requirements or preferences.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/eng/biol3.htm|title=feeding|author=Lobanov, A.L. |year=2002|work=Beetle Biology And Ecology|publisher=Beetles (Coleoptera) and Coleopterologist|accessdate=March 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nDecaying organic matter is a primary diet for many species.

In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the [[avocado]] weevil ''[[Heilipus apiatus]]'' to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects.<ref name=\"Evans27\"/> Many beetles that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of that substrate.<ref name=\"Evans126\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]], p. 126</ref>\n\n====Mimicry and aposematism====\n[[File:Clyte b\u00e9lier - MHNT - Vue dorsale.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of wasps]]\n{{further|Mimicry|Aposematism}}\n\nSome [[longhorn beetle]]s (Cerambycidae) are effective [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of [[wasp]]s. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or poisonous, and are often [[aposematic]], where bright or contrasting [[animal coloration|coloration]] warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\n[[File:Blister beetle (26390828032).jpg|thumb|Blister beetles such as ''[[Hycleus]]'' have brilliant [[aposematic]] coloration, warning of their toxicity.]]\n[[File:Bloody -nosed Beetle^ Timarcha tenebricosa - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|The bloody-nosed beetle, ''[[Timarcha tenebricosa]]'', [[antipredator adaptation|defending itself]] by releasing a droplet of noxious red liquid (base of leg, on right)|left|172x172px]]\n\nChemical defense is important in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some [[Tenebrionidae]] use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/>\n\nOther species have special glands to produce deterrent chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, ''[[Anthia]]'' and ''[[Thermophilum]]'' \u2013 ''Thermophilum'' is sometimes included within ''[[Anthia]]'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].<ref name=\"Evans\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]]</ref> [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], the other holding hydrogen peroxide and [[catalase]] enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around {{convert|100|C|F}}, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n====Other defences====\nLarge ground-dwelling beetles such as [[Carabidae]], the [[rhinoceros beetle]] and the longhorn beetles defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/> Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a drop-off reflex. Some combine it with [[thanatosis]], in which they close up their appendages and \"play dead\".<ref name=\"insenc199\">[[#refMcHugh|McHugh (2009)]], p. 199</ref> The click beetles ([[Elateridae]]) can suddenly catapult themselves out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum.<ref name=\"Evans27\"/> Some species startle an attacker by producing sounds through a process known as [[stridulation]].<ref name= \"stridulation\"/>\n\n===Parasitism===\nA few species of beetles are [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasitic]] on mammals. One such species, ''[[Platypsyllus castoris]]'', parasitises beavers ([[Beaver|''Castor'']] spp.).

They are suitable for this as their taxonomy is stable; their life history is well described; they are large and simple to observe when visiting a site; they occur around the world in many habitats, with species specialised to particular habitats; and their occurrence by species accurately indicates other species, both vertebrate and invertebrate.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pearson |first1=David L. |last2=Cassola |first2=Fabio |title=World-Wide Species Richness Patterns of Tiger Beetles (Coleoptera: Cicindelidae): Indicator Taxon for Biodiversity and Conservation Studies |journal=Conservation Biology |date=1992 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=376\u2013391 |jstor=2386038 |doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.06030376.x}}</ref> According to the habitats, many other groups such as the rove beetles in human-modified habitats, dung beetles in savannas<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2664.2002.00743.x |title=The verification and application of bioindicators: A case study of dung beetles in a savanna ecosystem |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=661\u2013672 |year=2002 |last1=McGeoch |first1=Melodie A. |last2=Van Rensburg |first2=Berndt J. |last3=Botes |first3=Antoinette}}</ref> and saproxylic beetles in forests<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ecolind.2012.04.013|title=Saproxylic beetles as indicator species for dead-wood amount and temperature in European beech forests |journal=Ecological Indicators |volume=23 |pages=323\u2013331 |year=2012 |last1=Lachat |first1=Thibault |last2=Wermelinger |first2=Beat |last3=Gossner |first3=Martin M. |last4=Bussler |first4=Heinz |last5=Isacsson |first5=Gunnar |last6=M\u00fcller |first6=J\u00f6rg}}</ref> have been suggested as potential indicator species.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-8809(99)00043-2 |title=Staphylinid beetles as bioindicators |journal=Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment |volume=74 |issue=1\u20133 |pages=357\u2013372 |year=1999 |last1=Bohac |first1=Jaroslav|url=http://www.zin.ru/animalia/coleoptera/pdf/bohac_1999_357-372.pdf |citeseerx=10.1.1.496.4273 }}</ref>\n\n===In art and adornment===\n{{main|Beetlewing|Live insect jewelry}}\n\n[[File:Zopheridae jewelry sjh.jpg|thumb|[[Zopheridae]] in [[jewellery]] at the [[Texas A&M University]] Insect Collection]]\n[[File:Pendant watch in shape of beetle Switzerland 1850-1900 gold, diamond, enamel.jpg|thumb|Pendant watch in shape of beetle, Switzerland 1850-1900 gold, diamond, enamel|left|225x225px]]\n\nMany beetles have beautiful and durable elytra that have been used as material in arts, with [[beetlewing]] the best example.<ref>[http://www.malaeng.com/blog/?p=4262 Life cycle of the rounded jewel beetles, Sternocera spp. \u0e27\u0e07\u0e08\u0e23\u0e0a\u0e35\u0e27\u0e34\u0e15\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e21\u0e25\u0e07\u0e17\u0e31\u0e1a\u0e01\u0e25\u0e21\u0e43\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e40\u0e27\u0e25\u0e32\u0e19\u0e32\u0e19\u0e16\u0e36\u0e07 2 \u0e1b\u0e35 \u2013 Siam Insect Zoo-Museum].

Their front pair of wings are hardened into wing-cases, [[Elytron|elytra]], distinguishing them from most other insects. The Coleoptera, with about 400,000 species, is the largest of all orders, constituting almost 40% of described insects and 25% of all known animal life-forms; new species are discovered frequently. The largest of all [[Family (biology)|families]], the [[Curculionidae]] (weevils), with some 83,000 member species,\nbelongs to this order. Found in almost every habitat except the sea and the [[polar region]]s, they interact with their [[ecosystem]]s in several ways: beetles often feed on plants and [[fungus|fungi]], break down animal and plant debris, and eat other [[invertebrate]]s. Some species are serious agricultural pests, such as the [[Colorado potato beetle]], while others such as [[Coccinellidae]] (ladybirds or ladybugs) eat [[aphid]]s, [[scale insect]]s, [[thrips]], and other plant-sucking insects that damage crops.\n\nBeetles typically have a particularly hard [[exoskeleton]] including the [[Elytron|elytra]], though some such as the [[rove beetles]] have very short elytra while [[blister beetle]]s have softer elytra. The general [[anatomy]] of a beetle is quite uniform and typical of insects, although there are several examples of novelty, such as adaptations in [[water beetle]]s which trap air bubbles under the elytra for use while diving. Beetles are [[Endopterygota|endopterygotes]], which means that they undergo complete [[metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], with a series of conspicuous and relatively abrupt changes in body structure between hatching and becoming adult after a relatively immobile [[pupa]]l stage. Some, such as [[stag beetle]]s, have a marked [[sexual dimorphism]], the males possessing enormously enlarged [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]] which they use to fight other males. Many beetles are [[aposematism|aposematic]], with bright colours and patterns warning of their toxicity, while others are harmless [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of such insects. Many beetles, including those that live in sandy places, have effective [[camouflage]].\n\nBeetles are prominent [[insects in culture|in human culture]], from the [[Scarab (artifact)|sacred scarabs]] of [[ancient Egypt]] to [[beetlewing]] art and use as [[pet]]s or [[insect fighting|fighting insects]] for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species are [[entomophagy|used as food]], mostly as [[larva]]e; species widely consumed include [[mealworm]]s and [[Dynastinae|rhinoceros beetle]] larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural [[Pest (organism)|pests]].

In the cerambycid ''[[Onychocerus albitarsis]]'', the antennae have venom injecting structures used in defence, which is unique among [[arthropod]]s.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s00114-007-0316-1|pmid=18004534|title=Convergent evolution in the antennae of a cerambycid beetle, ''Onychocerus albitarsis'', and the sting of a scorpion|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=95|issue=3|pages=257\u201361|year=2007|last1=Berkov|first1=Amy|last2=Rodr\u00edguez|first2=Nelson|last3=Centeno|first3=Pedro|bibcode=2008NW.....95..257B}}</ref> Antennae vary greatly in form, sometimes between the sexes, but are often similar within any given family. Antennae may be [[Wiktionary:clavate|clubbed]], [[Wiktionary:filiform|threadlike]], [[Wiktionary:geniculate|angled]], [[Wiktionary:moniliform|shaped like a string of beads]], [[Wiktionary:pectinate|comb-like]] (either on one side or both, bipectinate), or [[Wiktionary:serrate|toothed]]. The physical variation of antennae is important for the identification of many beetle groups. The Curculionidae have elbowed or geniculate antennae. Feather like flabellate antennae are a restricted form found in the Rhipiceridae and a few other families. The Silphidae have a capitate antennae with a spherical head at the tip. The Scarabaeidae typically have lamellate antennae with the terminal segments extended into long flat structures stacked together. The Carabidae typically have thread-like antennae. The antennae arises between the eye and the mandibles and in the Tenebrionidae, the antennae rise in front of a notch that breaks the usually circular outline of the compound eye. They are segmented and usually consist of 11 parts, the first part is called the scape and the second part is the pedicel. The other segments are jointly called the flagellum.<ref name='Antennae' /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://bugs.bio.usyd.edu.au/learning/resources/Entomology/externalMorphology/antennaTypes.html |title=Antennae Types |publisher=University of Sydney |accessdate=2017-01-26}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=American Beetles, Volume I: Archostemata, Myxophaga, Adephaga, Polyphaga: Staphyliniformia |author1= Arnett, Jr., R.

The [[mandible (insect)|mandibles]] appear as large pincers on the front of some beetles. The mandibles are a pair of hard, often tooth-like structures that move horizontally to grasp, crush, or cut food or enemies (see [[#Defence|defence]], below). Two pairs of finger-like appendages, the maxillary and labial palpi, are found around the mouth in most beetles, serving to move food into the mouth. In many species, the mandibles are sexually dimorphic, with those of the males enlarged enormously compared with those of females of the same species.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\n===Thorax===\nThe thorax is [[segmentation (biology)|segmented]] into the two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although flexibly articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax is that part from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax.<ref name=insenc/> When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the [[pronotum]], which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's [[insect wing|wings]].

Digestion takes place mostly in the anterior [[midgut]], although in predatory groups like the [[Carabidae]], most digestion occurs in the crop by means of midgut enzymes. In the [[Elateridae]], the larvae are liquid feeders that extraorally digest their food by secreting enzymes.<ref name=insenc/> The alimentary canal basically consists of a short, narrow [[pharynx]], a widened expansion, the crop, and a poorly developed [[gizzard]]. This is followed by the midgut, that varies in dimensions between species, with a large amount of [[cecum]], and the hindgut, with varying lengths. There are typically four to six [[Malpighian tubule]]s.<ref name=\"Gilliott\"/>\n\n===Nervous system===\nThe [[nervous system]] in beetles contains all the types found in insects, varying between different species, from three thoracic and seven or eight abdominal ganglia which can be distinguished to that in which all the thoracic and abdominal ganglia are fused to form a composite structure.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n===Respiratory system===\n[[File:DytiscusSpiracles.png|thumb|''[[Dytiscus]]'' [[Spiracle (arthropods)|spiracle]]s (right) on upper side of abdomen, normally covered by the elytra, are in contact with an air bubble when the beetle dives.|left|175x175px]]Like most insects, beetles inhale air, for the [[oxygen]] it contains, and exhale [[carbon dioxide]], via a [[invertebrate trachea|tracheal system]].

The larvae are commonly called [[Larva|grubs]] and the pupa sometimes is called the chrysalis. In some species, the pupa may be enclosed in a cocoon constructed by the larva towards the end of its final [[instar]]. Some beetles, such as typical members of the families [[Meloidae]] and [[Rhipiphoridae]], go further, undergoing [[hypermetamorphosis]] in which the first instar takes the form of a [[triungulin]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/242221698 |author1=Ozbek, H. |author2=Szalokia, D. |date=1998 |title=A contribution to the knowledge of the Meloidae (Coleoptera) fauna of Turkey along with new record |journal=Turkish Journal of Zoology |volume=22 |pages=23\u201340}}</ref>\n\n===Mating===\n[[File:Punctate Flower Chafer.jpg|thumb|[[Punctate flower chafer]]s (''Neorrhina punctata'', Scarabaeidae) mating]]\n\nSome beetles have intricate mating behaviour. [[Pheromone]] communication is often important in locating a mate.\nDifferent species use different pheromones. Scarab beetles such as the [[Rutelinae]] use pheromones derived from [[fatty acid synthesis]], while other scarabs such as the [[Melolonthinae]] use [[amino acid]]s and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates is seen in the [[Firefly|fireflies]] (Lampyridae) which are [[bioluminescence|bioluminescent]], with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage in a complex dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.<ref name=insenc/>\n\nBefore mating, males and females may stridulate, or vibrate the objects they are on. In the Meloidae, the male climbs onto the dorsum of the female and strokes his antennae on her head, palps, and antennae. In ''[[Eupompha]]'', the male draws his antennae along his longitudinal vertex. They may not mate at all if they do not perform the precopulatory ritual.<ref name=insenc/> This mating behaviour may be different amongst dispersed populations of the same species. For example, the mating of a [[Russia]]n population of [[tansy Beetle|tansy beetle]] (''Chysolina graminis'') is preceded by an elaborate ritual involving the male tapping the female's eyes, pronotum and antennae with its antennae, which is not evident in the population of this species in the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Medvedev, L.

Many male beetles are [[Territory (animal)|territorial]] and fiercely defend their territories from intruding males. In such species, the male often has horns on the head or thorax, making its body length greater than that of a female. Copulation is generally quick, but in some cases lasts for several hours.

Beetle eggs generally have smooth surfaces and are soft, though the [[Cupedidae]] have hard eggs. Eggs vary widely between species: the eggs tend to be small in species with many instars (larval stages), and in those that lay large numbers of eggs.\nA female may lay from several dozen to several thousand eggs during her lifetime, depending on the extent of parental care. This ranges from the simple laying of eggs under a leaf, to the parental care provided by [[Scarabaeidae|scarab beetles]], which house, feed and protect their young.

Larvae tend to feed voraciously once they emerge from their eggs. Some feed externally on plants, such as those of certain leaf beetles, while others feed within their food sources. Examples of internal feeders are most [[Buprestidae]] and longhorn beetles. The larvae of many beetle families are predatory like the adults (ground beetles, ladybirds, rove beetles). The larval period varies between species, but can be as long as several years. The larvae of [[skin beetle]]s undergo a degree of reversed development when starved, and later grow back to the previously attained level of maturity.

Some beetle larvae resemble hardened worms with dark head capsules and minute legs. These are elateriform larvae, and are found in the [[click beetle]] (Elateridae) and [[darkling beetle]] (Tenebrionidae) families. Some elateriform larvae of click beetles are known as wireworms.

In many species, the larvae simply increase in size with each successive instar as more food is consumed. In some cases, however, more dramatic changes occur. Among certain beetle families or genera, particularly those that exhibit parasitic lifestyles, the first instar (the [[planidium]]) is highly mobile to search out a host, while the following instars are more sedentary and remain on or within their host.

Some are [[omnivore]]s, eating both plants and animals. Other beetles are highly specialized in their diet. Many species of leaf beetles, longhorn beetles, and weevils are very host-specific, feeding on only a single species of plant. [[Ground beetle]]s and [[rove beetle]]s ([[Staphylinidae]]), among others, are primarily carnivorous and catch and consume many other [[arthropod]]s and small prey, such as earthworms and snails.

In some species, sculpturing or various coloured scales or hairs cause beetles such as the [[avocado]] weevil ''[[Heilipus apiatus]]'' to resemble bird dung or other inedible objects.<ref name=\"Evans27\"/> Many beetles that live in sandy environments blend in with the coloration of that substrate.<ref name=\"Evans126\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]], p. 126</ref>\n\n====Mimicry and aposematism====\n[[File:Clyte b\u00e9lier - MHNT - Vue dorsale.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Clytus arietis]]'' ([[Longhorn beetle|Cerambycidae]]), a [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimic]] of wasps]]\n{{further|Mimicry|Aposematism}}\n\nSome [[longhorn beetle]]s (Cerambycidae) are effective [[Batesian mimicry|Batesian mimics]] of [[wasp]]s. Beetles may combine coloration with behavioural mimicry, acting like the wasps they already closely resemble. Many other beetles, including [[Coccinellidae|ladybirds]], [[blister beetle]]s, and [[Lycidae|lycid beetles]] secrete distasteful or toxic substances to make them unpalatable or poisonous, and are often [[aposematic]], where bright or contrasting [[animal coloration|coloration]] warn off predators; many beetles and other insects mimic these chemically protected species.<ref name=\"Evans\"/>\n\n[[File:Blister beetle (26390828032).jpg|thumb|Blister beetles such as ''[[Hycleus]]'' have brilliant [[aposematic]] coloration, warning of their toxicity.]]\n[[File:Bloody -nosed Beetle^ Timarcha tenebricosa - Flickr - gailhampshire.jpg|thumb|The bloody-nosed beetle, ''[[Timarcha tenebricosa]]'', [[antipredator adaptation|defending itself]] by releasing a droplet of noxious red liquid (base of leg, on right)|left|172x172px]]\n\nChemical defense is important in some species, usually being advertised by bright aposematic colours. Some [[Tenebrionidae]] use their posture for releasing noxious chemicals to warn off predators. Chemical defences may serve purposes other than just protection from vertebrates, such as protection from a wide range of microbes. Some species sequester chemicals from the plants they feed on, incorporating them into their own defenses.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/>\n\nOther species have special glands to produce deterrent chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce a variety of [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[phenol]]s, [[quinone]]s, [[ester]]s, and [[acid]]s released from an opening at the end of the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, ''[[Anthia]]'' and ''[[Thermophilum]]'' \u2013 ''Thermophilum'' is sometimes included within ''[[Anthia]]'') employ the same chemicals as ants: [[formic acid]].<ref name=\"Evans\">[[#refEvans|Evans & Bellamy (2000)]]</ref> [[Bombardier beetle]]s have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for [[hydroquinone]]s and [[hydrogen peroxide]], the other holding hydrogen peroxide and [[catalase]] enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around {{convert|100|C|F}}, with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.<ref name=insenc/>\n\n====Other defences====\nLarge ground-dwelling beetles such as [[Carabidae]], the [[rhinoceros beetle]] and the longhorn beetles defend themselves using strong [[Mandible (insect)|mandibles]], or heavily sclerotised (armored) spines or horns to deter or fight off predators.<ref name=\"Evans126\"/> Many species of weevil that feed out in the open on leaves of plants react to attack by employing a drop-off reflex. Some combine it with [[thanatosis]], in which they close up their appendages and \"play dead\".<ref name=\"insenc199\">[[#refMcHugh|McHugh (2009)]], p. 199</ref> The click beetles ([[Elateridae]]) can suddenly catapult themselves out of danger by releasing the energy stored by a click mechanism, which consists of a stout spine on the prosternum and a matching groove in the mesosternum.<ref name=\"Evans27\"/> Some species startle an attacker by producing sounds through a process known as [[stridulation]].<ref name= \"stridulation\"/>\n\n===Parasitism===\nA few species of beetles are [[Parasitism#Types|ectoparasitic]] on mammals.

It is patchily distributed in [[Queensland]], roughly southeast of a line between [[Mackay, Queensland|Mackay]] and [[Charleville, Queensland|Charleville]]; it is somewhat more common in the southeast of the state. In [[New South Wales]], it occurs throughout the [[New England Tablelands (biogeographic region)|New England Tablelands]] and the [[South West Slopes]], extending westward to the [[Pilliga Scrub]] and to [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] in the [[Riverina]], and eastwards into the [[Hunter Valley]]. It is fairly common in the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. In [[Victoria]], the speckled warbler is found within a broad strip, including the [[Chiltern Box-Ironbark National Park|Chiltern Box-Ironbark]] and [[Warby-Ovens National Park]]s, the [[Bendigo]] region, the [[Brisbane Ranges]] and [[You Yangs Regional Park|You Yangs]], across to Balmoral on the western side of the [[Grampians National Park|Grampians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ebird.org/map/spewar3|title=eBirdmap: Speckled warbler|accessdate=2020-04-22}}</ref> It is scarce to moderately common within its range.<ref name=Morcombe></ref> Its preferred habitat is open eucalypt woodland with rocky gullies, tussocky grass, scattered logs, and sparse shrubbery.<ref name=Morcombe></ref>\n\n==Behaviour==\nThe speckled warbler is quiet and well camouflaged.
