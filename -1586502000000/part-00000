The film was based on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') character [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], created by Sweeney, an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] misfit whose sex is never revealed.\n\n[[Dave Foley]] plays Pat's partner, Chris, and [[Charles Rocket]], another ''SNL'' alumnus, plays Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen.\n\n==Plot==\nPat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminate gender who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat encounters Chris, whose sex is also unrevealed. The two fall in love, and get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen, develops an unhealthy obsession with unveiling Pat's sex, and begins [[stalker (stalking)|stalking]] Pat. Kyle sends in a tape of Pat performing [[karaoke]] to a TV show called ''America's Creepiest People'', bringing Pat to the attention of the band [[Ween]], who feature Pat in one of their performances; Pat plays the [[tuba]]. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use Pat for one gig, Pat and Chris break up.\n\nKyle steals the laptop containing Pat's diary and tries to coerce Pat into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files. Pat's only answer is that the word is in the [[dictionary attack|dictionary]]. Kyle then begins to type in every single word in the dictionary.\n\nMeanwhile, a gang of thugs intent on discovering Pat's sex begin harassing Pat, and Pat becomes distraught over the thugs' androgynous nature. Pat goes to complain to Kathy, a friend who is a [[Therapy|therapist]] and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat.\n\nKyle ends up going through the entire dictionary until he reaches the last word, \"[[zythum]]\" (an Egyptian malt beer), which is the password. After reading through the diary, he discovers no new information in regards to Pat's sex, and finally snaps.\n\nKyle calls into Pat's radio show, and tells Pat to meet him at the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!#Museums|Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum]], stating that this is the only chance for Pat to retrieve the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a [[Ween]] concert. After Kyle corners Pat on a [[catwalk]], Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an [[epilogue]], Pat and Chris get married.\n\nDuring the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is none other than Kyle,  whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Sweeney]] as [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat Riley]]\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Chris\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Kyle Jacobsen\n* [[Kathy Griffin]] as Herself\n* Julie Hayden as Stacy Jacobsen\n* [[Timothy Stack]] as Doctor\n* [[Mary Scheer]] as Nurse\n* [[Beverly Leech]] as Mrs. Riley\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as KVIB-FM manager\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as Stage manager\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Postal supervisor\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Tippy\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as Sushi chef\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Concert Guard\n* [[Dean Ween|Dean]] and [[Gene Ween]] as themselves\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by Sweeney, Jim Emerson (Sweeney's friend from their days with [[The Groundlings]],<ref name=\"seattle\" />), and Sweeney's former husband, Stephen Hibbert.<ref name=\"seattle\">[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930131&slug=1682852 Pat's World &mdash; It's Funny Business, Hard Work And A Little Too Much Attention For Julia Sweeney], a January 1993 article from ''[[The Seattle Times]]''</ref> While at the Groundlings, Emerson suggested that the character Pat, at the time a \"character based on annoying co-workers who don't leave you alone\", be made androgynous.<ref name=\"seattle\" />\n\nThree months before the film's release, Sweeney commented on her initial reluctance to do a film based on Pat:<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DC1130F93BA35756C0A962958260 Up From the Tube, but Then Down the Drain], a May 1994 article from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\n:I resisted it completely.

The film was based on the ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') character [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat]], created by Sweeney, an [[Androgyny|androgynous]] misfit whose sex is never revealed.\n\n[[Dave Foley]] plays Pat's partner, Chris, and [[Charles Rocket]], another ''SNL'' alumnus, plays Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen.\n\n==Plot==\nPat Riley is a chubby, whiny, and obnoxious job-hopper of indeterminate gender who is searching for a steady foundation in life. Pat encounters Chris, whose sex is also unrevealed. The two fall in love, and get engaged. Meanwhile, Pat's neighbor, Kyle Jacobsen, develops an unhealthy obsession with unveiling Pat's sex, and begins [[stalker (stalking)|stalking]] Pat. Kyle sends in a tape of Pat performing [[karaoke]] to a TV show called ''America's Creepiest People'', bringing Pat to the attention of the band [[Ween]], who feature Pat in one of their performances; Pat plays the [[tuba]]. When Pat learns that Ween intended to only use Pat for one gig, Pat and Chris break up.\n\nKyle steals the laptop containing Pat's diary and tries to coerce Pat into revealing the computer's password, so he can access the files. Pat's only answer is that the word is in the [[dictionary attack|dictionary]]. Kyle then begins to type in every single word in the dictionary.\n\nMeanwhile, a gang of thugs intent on discovering Pat's sex begin harassing Pat, and Pat becomes distraught over the thugs' androgynous nature. Pat goes to complain to Kathy, a friend who is a [[Therapy|therapist]] and host of a radio talk show. When Pat gives acerbic reactions to call-in listeners, the station fires Kathy and replaces her with Pat.\n\nKyle ends up going through the entire dictionary until he reaches the last word, \"[[zythum]]\" (an Egyptian malt beer), which is the password. After reading through the diary, he discovers no new information in regards to Pat's sex, and finally snaps.\n\nKyle calls into Pat's radio show, and tells Pat to meet him at the [[Ripley's Believe It Or Not!#Museums|Ripley's Believe It or Not! Museum]], stating that this is the only chance for Pat to retrieve the laptop. Pat arrives to find Kyle dressed exactly like Pat. Kyle demands that Pat strip naked, but Pat runs off into a [[Ween]] concert. After Kyle corners Pat on a [[catwalk]], Pat falls, and Pat's clothes get caught on a hook. This tears off Pat's pants and lowers Pat in front of the cheering audience, though Pat's genitals are revealed neither to Kyle nor to the moviegoer. Kyle is subsequently taken away by security guards. Pat then runs to see Chris, just as Chris is leaving on an ocean liner. In an [[epilogue]], Pat and Chris get married.\n\nDuring the end credits, Kathy is now hosting her radio show again and the first caller is none other than Kyle,  whose obsession with Pat has driven him to cross-dressing.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Julia Sweeney]] as [[Pat (Saturday Night Live)|Pat Riley]]\n* [[Dave Foley]] as Chris\n* [[Charles Rocket]] as Kyle Jacobsen\n* [[Kathy Griffin]] as Herself\n* Julie Hayden as Stacy Jacobsen\n* [[Timothy Stack]] as Doctor\n* [[Mary Scheer]] as Nurse\n* [[Beverly Leech]] as Mrs. Riley\n* [[Tim Meadows]] as KVIB-FM manager\n* [[Phil LaMarr]] as Stage manager\n* [[Larry Hankin]] as Postal supervisor\n* [[Kathy Najimy]] as Tippy\n* [[Jerry Tondo]] as Sushi chef\n* [[Mitch Pileggi]] as Concert Guard\n* [[Dean Ween|Dean]] and [[Gene Ween]] as themselves\n\n==Production==\nThe film was written by Sweeney, Jim Emerson (Sweeney's friend from their days with [[The Groundlings]],<ref name=\"seattle\" />), and Sweeney's former husband, Stephen Hibbert.<ref name=\"seattle\">[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19930131&slug=1682852 Pat's World &mdash; It's Funny Business, Hard Work And A Little Too Much Attention For Julia Sweeney], a January 1993 article from ''[[The Seattle Times]]''</ref> While at the Groundlings, Emerson suggested that the character Pat, at the time a \"character based on annoying co-workers who don't leave you alone\", be made androgynous.<ref name=\"seattle\" />\n\nThree months before the film's release, Sweeney commented on her initial reluctance to do a film based on Pat:<ref name=\"nyt\">[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D00E4DC1130F93BA35756C0A962958260 Up From the Tube, but Then Down the Drain], a May 1994 article from ''[[The New York Times]]''</ref>\n\n:I resisted it completely.

He debuted as one of the two [[Player character|playable]] characters of the 1998 video game ''[[Resident Evil 2]]''. Leon later returned as the lead protagonist of ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'' and as one of the seven playable characters of ''[[Resident Evil 6]]''. Leon was met with positive critical reception.\n\nDuring the events of ''Resident Evil 2'', Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed [[Raccoon City]] late for his first day on the job, only to confront a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] outbreak first-hand. During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor [[Claire Redfield]], rescues the young [[Sherry Birkin]], and is aided by the mysterious [[Ada Wong]]. Six years later, in ''Resident Evil 4'', Leon returns as a secret service agent for the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] assigned to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley, from a sinister cult. In ''Resident Evil 6'', he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and a grown-up Sherry.\n\nLeon also appears as a player character in several other video games, and has a leading role in three CG animated films: ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Resident Evil: Damnation]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Resident Evil: Vendetta]]'' in 2017, in which he is a special agent for the government. The version of Leon in the [[Resident Evil (film series)|live-action film series]] is portrayed by [[Johann Urb]] in ''[[Resident Evil: Retribution]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\nLeon debuted in ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' (1998), as one of the game's two protagonists alongside [[Claire Redfield]]. In the story, he is a police officer on his first day who arrives in the Midwestern United States town of [[Raccoon City]] just after a viral outbreak started. He meets Claire by chance as she is chased by zombies created by the T-virus. Together, they flee towards the Raccoon City Police Department building but soon get separated and go on their own ways. They eventually meet again at the [[Umbrella Corporation]] underground research complex responsible for the viral outbreak.<ref name=psu/> Along the way, Leon teams-up with [[Ada Wong]], a mysterious woman eventually revealed as a spy seeking a sample of the even more powerful G-virus. During the final confrontation against the seemingly unstoppable T-103 [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]] that constantly pursues the characters, Ada tosses Leon (or Claire, depending on the scenario) a rocket launcher to destroy the creature.

Leon was met with positive critical reception.\n\nDuring the events of ''Resident Evil 2'', Leon is a rookie police officer who arrives in the doomed [[Raccoon City]] late for his first day on the job, only to confront a [[Zombie (fictional)|zombie]] outbreak first-hand. During the course of the game, he teams up with civilian survivor [[Claire Redfield]], rescues the young [[Sherry Birkin]], and is aided by the mysterious [[Ada Wong]]. Six years later, in ''Resident Evil 4'', Leon returns as a secret service agent for the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]] assigned to rescue the president's daughter, Ashley, from a sinister cult. In ''Resident Evil 6'', he continues to work for the U.S. government and reunites with Ada and a grown-up Sherry.\n\nLeon also appears as a player character in several other video games, and has a leading role in three CG animated films: ''[[Resident Evil: Degeneration]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Resident Evil: Damnation]]'' in 2012 and ''[[Resident Evil: Vendetta]]'' in 2017, in which he is a special agent for the government.

He meets Claire by chance as she is chased by zombies created by the T-virus. Together, they flee towards the Raccoon City Police Department building but soon get separated and go on their own ways. They eventually meet again at the [[Umbrella Corporation]] underground research complex responsible for the viral outbreak.<ref name=psu/> Along the way, Leon teams-up with [[Ada Wong]], a mysterious woman eventually revealed as a spy seeking a sample of the even more powerful G-virus. During the final confrontation against the seemingly unstoppable T-103 [[Tyrant (Resident Evil)|Tyrant]] that constantly pursues the characters, Ada tosses Leon (or Claire, depending on the scenario) a rocket launcher to destroy the creature. In the end, Leon faces and kills the grotesquely mutated Umbrella scientist [[William Birkin]], and escapes from the self-destructing facility along with Claire and Birkin's young daughter [[Sherry Birkin|Sherry]].<ref name=psu/>\n\nAn epilogue obtained after completing ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'' reveals that Leon later joined the U.S. federal government.

Before joining Philippine showbiz, Bonnevie was first-runner in the Miss Magnolia 1979 Beauty Contest. She landed her first acting assignment in the campy ''[[Temptation Island (1980 film)|Temptation Island]]'' in 1980 with [[Joey Gosiengfiao]] at the helm. However, the following year, [[Regal Films]] launched her to lead star status via Joey Gosingfiao's ''Katorse'' opposite then boyfriend, Alfie Anido. The same film introduced a young Gabby Concepcion who essayed the role of a naughty brat of a man.\n\nIn 1981, while doing ''Age Doesn't Matter'' with fellow Regal babies, Maricel Soriano and Snooky Serna and the wacky Tito, Vic & Joey, she fell in love with Vic Sotto. The following years, she went into semi-retirement by focusing on her domestic life, but seen on television via the sitcom ''2 + 2 = Gulo'' with then husband, Vic Sotto and supported by Maricel Soriano and William Martinez, plus a young Herbert Bautista. In 1985, Viva Films assigned her the role of a young disturbed woman via ''Tinik sa Dibdib'' with Nora Aunor in the lead. She took home the FAMAS and FAP best-supporting actress statuettes.\n\nIn 1986 she snagged her string of best actress trophies from the CMMA, FAMAS and FAP for ''Magdusa Ka!''. In the said movie, she essayed the role of Christine, a young woman disowned by her mother, Toyang (Nida Blanca) after getting impregnated by boyfriend, Rod (Christopher de Leon). She ran away from Rod after frequent misunderstandings with her drunkard mother-in-law, Metring (Perla Bautista). She sought refuge from her rich but lameduck father, Bernardo (Dindo Fernando) but is sent away by her aristocratic grandmother Do\u00f1a Perla (Armida Siguion Reyna). She asked the help of her best friend Violy (Jobelle Salvador) but was mistreated by the latter's mother (Angie Ferro). Christine after all the tribulations managed to stand up and healing followed.\n\nHer Viva Films assignments were  ''Sana'y Wala ng Wakas'' (1986), ''Alabok sa Ulap'' (1987), ''Ang Lahat ng Ito, Pati ang Langit'' (1989), ''Ang Babaing Nawawala sa Sarili'' (1990); ''Kung Kasalanan Man'' (1990), ''Gumapang Ka sa Lusak'' (1990) among others.\n\nHer acting nominations followed in 1987 for ''Maging Akin Ka Lamang'', 1988 for ''Huwag Mong Itanong Kung Bakit'', 1990 for ''Gumapang Ka sa Lusak'' and 2004 for ''Bridal Shower''.\n\n==Early life and background==\n\nBonnevie was born January 27, 1961 to [[Swiss people|Swiss]] mother Jeannette Sch\u00e4er and [[French people|French]]-[[Italian people|Italian]]-[[Filipino people|Filipino]] father Honesto Bonnevie. Her paternal grandfather was Pedro Jos\u00e9 de Bonnevie, a significant landowner in the [[Bicol region]], who hails from [[\u00c9vian-les-Bains|\u00c9vian-les-Bains, France]] and was part French and Italian.<ref>{{cite web |author=PEP.ph |url=http://www.pep.ph/photos/106/Dina_Bonnevie%27s_home |title=Dina Bonnevie's home &#124; Gallery &#124; PEP.ph: The Number One Site for Philippine Showbiz |publisher=PEP.ph |date= |accessdate=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830151942/http://www.pep.ph/photos/106/Dina_Bonnevie's_home |archive-date=2017-08-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Her grandmother was pre-[[World War II]] actress Rosita Rivera, also from Bicol. She is a cousin of singer [[Lou Bonnevie]]. She has two children from her previous marriage with comedian [[Vic Sotto]], [[Oyo Boy Sotto]] and Danica, both of whom are now in the entertainment industry as well.\n\nShe was educated at St. Theresa's College, [[Manila]] and finished her elementary and secondary education at [[St. Agnes' Academy Legazpi City|St. Agnes' Academy]] in [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi City]], where she was very active in drama guilds. In 1979, she was first runner-up in Miss Magnolia contest, where Joanna Paras took home the title. \n\nIn 1980 she enrolled in Communication Arts at the Ateneo de Manila University and, later, the [[University of the Philippines]], unfortunately, she did not graduate and finish her degree. Introduced by young actor [[Alfie Anido]] to director [[Joey Gosiengfiao]], she first appeared in teen dramas ''Underage'' (1980) and ''[[Temptation Island (1980 film)|Temptation Island]]'' (1980), but her breakout movie was ''[[Katorse]]'' (1980) with Anido and [[Gabby Concepcion]]. This film established her as one of the \"Regal Babies\" (named after the studio, Regal Films). She then appeared in a longer slew of teenage love or growing-pains dramas. ''Bakit Ba Ganyan?'' (1981) was a film whose theme song she sang and popularized.\n\nIn 1981, she starred in ''Age Doesn't Matter'' and was paired with Vic Sotto. What started as a reel romance turned real. The couple started a sitcom from 1982 to 1986 over [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]] channel 2 every Saturday at 8 pm entitled, ''2 + 2 = Gulo'', sharing stellar billing with Maricel Soriano, William Martinez and Herbert Bautista.

Before joining Philippine showbiz, Bonnevie was first-runner in the Miss Magnolia 1979 Beauty Contest. She landed her first acting assignment in the campy ''[[Temptation Island (1980 film)|Temptation Island]]'' in 1980 with [[Joey Gosiengfiao]] at the helm. However, the following year, [[Regal Films]] launched her to lead star status via Joey Gosingfiao's ''Katorse'' opposite then boyfriend, Alfie Anido. The same film introduced a young Gabby Concepcion who essayed the role of a naughty brat of a man.\n\nIn 1981, while doing ''Age Doesn't Matter'' with fellow Regal babies, Maricel Soriano and Snooky Serna and the wacky Tito, Vic & Joey, she fell in love with Vic Sotto. The following years, she went into semi-retirement by focusing on her domestic life, but seen on television via the sitcom ''2 + 2 = Gulo'' with then husband, Vic Sotto and supported by Maricel Soriano and William Martinez, plus a young Herbert Bautista. In 1985, Viva Films assigned her the role of a young disturbed woman via ''Tinik sa Dibdib'' with Nora Aunor in the lead. She took home the FAMAS and FAP best-supporting actress statuettes.\n\nIn 1986 she snagged her string of best actress trophies from the CMMA, FAMAS and FAP for ''Magdusa Ka!''. In the said movie, she essayed the role of Christine, a young woman disowned by her mother, Toyang (Nida Blanca) after getting impregnated by boyfriend, Rod (Christopher de Leon). She ran away from Rod after frequent misunderstandings with her drunkard mother-in-law, Metring (Perla Bautista). She sought refuge from her rich but lameduck father, Bernardo (Dindo Fernando) but is sent away by her aristocratic grandmother Do\u00f1a Perla (Armida Siguion Reyna). She asked the help of her best friend Violy (Jobelle Salvador) but was mistreated by the latter's mother (Angie Ferro). Christine after all the tribulations managed to stand up and healing followed.\n\nHer Viva Films assignments were  ''Sana'y Wala ng Wakas'' (1986), ''Alabok sa Ulap'' (1987), ''Ang Lahat ng Ito, Pati ang Langit'' (1989), ''Ang Babaing Nawawala sa Sarili'' (1990); ''Kung Kasalanan Man'' (1990), ''Gumapang Ka sa Lusak'' (1990) among others.\n\nHer acting nominations followed in 1987 for ''Maging Akin Ka Lamang'', 1988 for ''Huwag Mong Itanong Kung Bakit'', 1990 for ''Gumapang Ka sa Lusak'' and 2004 for ''Bridal Shower''.\n\n==Early life and background==\n\nBonnevie was born January 27, 1961 to [[Swiss people|Swiss]] mother Jeannette Sch\u00e4er and [[French people|French]]-[[Italian people|Italian]]-[[Filipino people|Filipino]] father Honesto Bonnevie.

This film established her as one of the \"Regal Babies\" (named after the studio, Regal Films). She then appeared in a longer slew of teenage love or growing-pains dramas. ''Bakit Ba Ganyan?'' (1981) was a film whose theme song she sang and popularized.\n\nIn 1981, she starred in ''Age Doesn't Matter'' and was paired with Vic Sotto. What started as a reel romance turned real.

Bonnevie also topbilled ''Tatarin ''(2001), based on the short story ''Summer Solstice'' by Nick Joaquin; critics nearly panned the movie but appreciated Bonnevie's nuanced characterization of Lupe Moreta.\n\n==Television career==\nBonnevie started in hot soaps such as ''May Bukas Pa'' with Viva Television and IBC-13 in 1999-2001. In 2001-2003, she joined GMA-7 with the evening soap ''Ikaw Lang Ang Mamahalin''.

In 2005-2006, she was seen less on television. In 2007, she came back with soaps like ''Walang Kapalit'' and ''Natutulog Ba Ang Diyos?''. In 2008, she decided to do another \"sinenovela\", ''Babangon Ako\u2019t Dudurugin Kita'' with GMA Network. In 2009, another soap ''May Bukas Pa'', a religious themed soap (which was the same title as her 1999-2001 soap) and earned her many nominations as the soap ran for a year on television with an ensemble cast. In 2010-2012, she was with Viva and TV5 doing multiple guestings and soaps in 2013 she returned to ABS-CBN to do the crime soap ''Bukas Na Lang Kita Mamahalin'' with Dawn Zulueta and Gerald Anderson this time as a antagonist in 2015 she did the soap ''Beautiful Strangers'' with GMA-7 again with her ''Hiram'' co-star Heart Evangelista and her first time working with Lovi Poe, Rocco Nacinno and again with Christopher De Leon\n\nExcept for her stints on soap operas and for judging a recent TV talent contest (and appearing unclothed on the cover of the local FHM Magazine), Bonnevie disappeared from the limelight during 2005 and 2006; she was in the [[United States]] for business purposes. She is a guest-judge in [[U Can Dance|U Can Dance Version 2]].\n\n==Music==\nHer first and only album ''Bakit Ba Ganyan'', released in 1981 by [[EMI|Octo Arts International]] (now PolyEast Records formerly EMI Music Philippines, Inc.), became a Gold Record.

Deborah Meiers, a leading national proponent of the concept of a small school education, saw Willis\u2019 design approach to the MVA as a remedy to learning difficulties of high school students.\n\nLocated on three floors of two existing [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux's Arts-style]] office buildings, the Board of Education's proposed plan for the loft was a set of standard plans for a series of classrooms off a corridor. Willis devised a locus plan\u2212 \u201ca cluster of classrooms for each grade around an interior quad space, where teachers have a selection of a variety of spaces to fit a personalized approach to their students\u2019 needs.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=AIA Committee on Architecture|title=Educational Facilities- Exemplary Learning Environments|date=2002|publisher=American Institute of Architects|location=New York}}</ref> At the Manhattan Village Academy, \u201cthe educational philosophy is embedded in the architecture.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Merkel|first1=Jayne|title=Back to School|journal=Oculus|date=September 1995|volume=|page=10}}</ref> In addition to the reconfiguration of the classroom layout, Willis rejected the original plan's main entrance at the rear, adjacent to the freight exit.  Instead, Willis designed \u201ca grand high school faced in miniature; just inside the doors, four Greek-temple steps, done in marble, ascend to an aluminum spiral staircase, leading to the school\u2019s second floor lobby.\u201d<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Thrush|first1=Glenn|title=One Size Fits None|journal=Metropolis|date=September 1994|page=57}}</ref>\n\nThe open space of the locus plan center accommodates up to 100 students and is surrounded by three interconnected classrooms and a science laboratory with a folding wall that opens up to one of the classrooms. The building also contains a cafeteria, library, home economics classroom, and auditorium. The design incorporates glass walls and office windows that look out onto corridors and common areas to allow for continuous monitoring of student activity.\n\n== Dress Code ==\nThe school observes a strict [[school uniform|uniform]] policy.
