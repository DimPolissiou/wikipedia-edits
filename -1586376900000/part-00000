He won Junior Scholarships in the Science Division of the Faculty of Arts, 1858\u20139, 1859\u201360 and 1860\u20131. He was awarded the B.A. degree in mathematics with first-class honours in 1861, and pursued a varied postgraduate career \u2013 from initial study of the sciences (with Senior Scholarships in Mathematics, 1861\u20132, and Natural Philosophy, 1862-3) he moved into Law, gaining a first-class Diploma in Elementary Law in 1864. A further Senior Scholarship, this time in Law, followed, and he graduated with a first-class LL.B. in 1865.

In January 1893, having left the office of Attorney-General, he called a motion at a [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionist]] meeting in County [[Fermanagh]] declaring renewed opposition to [[Home Rule]]. At a meeting in March of that year (1893) at Leinster Hall Atkinson declared that a breach in the Union between the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]] would mean an end to civil and religious liberty. In December 1893 he was selected to represent the Unionist Party in [[North Londonderry (UK Parliament constituency)|North Londonderry]]. His candidature was endorsed by [[Arthur Balfour]], then leader of the House of Commons, with the words \u2013\"it is important that the loyalists of Ulster be represented by eloquent and able men\". Atkinson was elected a Conservative M.P. for North Londonderry in 1895; upon his election, he was again appointed Attorney-General, an office he held for the next ten years. During this time, he was closely involved in the framing of many significant pieces of legislation, including the Irish Land Act, 1896, and the Local Government Act, 1898.\n\n==Appointed as a law lord==\nOn 19 December 1905, he was appointed to the [[House of Lords]] as a [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary]] and [[life peer]] under the title '''Baron Atkinson''', ''of Glenwilliam in the County of [[Limerick]]'',<ref>{{London Gazette |issue=27866 |date=22 December 1905 |page=9173}}</ref> the first Irish barrister to be appointed as a Law Lord directly from his practice at the bar \u2013 Judges [[John FitzGerald, Baron FitzGerald|John Fitzgerald]] and [[Michael Morris, 1st Baron Killanin|Michael Morris]] had served on the Irish Bench for many years before their respective appointments.

Atkinson's appointment, however, was not met with universal approval by his profession. As a former member of the cabinet he was seen as a political judge, however his industry and keen sense of justice came to be seen as a valuable addition to the bench. On his appointment as a Law Lord, he withdrew from active politics, limiting his contributions on political matters in the House of Lords to the discussion of Irish matters, such as the Irish Land Bill in 1909, to which he tabled several amendments.

It also premiered on the Canadian television channel [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n''Ni Hao, Kai-Lan'' is based on the childhood memories of the show's creator, [[Karen Chau]], growing up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household. \"Ni hao\" means \"Hello\" in Mandarin, and Kai-Lan is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen. It was also based on the classic short series ''Downward Doghouse''.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of Kai-Lan and her group of talking anthropomorphic animal companions. The group consists of Kai-Lan, a seven-year old Asian girl; Rintoo, the yellow tiger; Tolee, the gray koala; Lulu, the pink rhino; and Hoho, the white monkey. Each episode is based around a series of events that occur during Kai-Lan's day, along with obstacles that she and her friends are forced to overcome (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, playing games, and working together. Common rituals may involve Kai-Lan resolving temper tantrums from her friends Rintoo and Hoho when they misbehave. To help Rintoo and Hoho, Kai-Lan shows them and the audience why they are having temper tantrums. Usually, once Rintoo and Hoho discover that their actions are wrong, they apologize and promise to work together better. Another obstacle is Hoho's aversion to trying new things; when the group goes to visit Lulu's house, Hoho refuses to try new foods before Kai-Lan and Lulu change Hoho's mind with the viewer's help. The audience is usually presented two musical sing-alongs where Kai-Lan sings about what must be done to overcome her and her friends' challenges. The episode always ends with Kai-Lan successfully helping her friends and everyone getting along. In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. \n\nEpisodes generally feature breaking the [[fourth wall]], 11 minutes of interactivity,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan: Tigers and Dragons and Mandarin Lessons|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225527/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|archivedate=2009-06-27}}</ref> a target word that is repeated multiple times,<ref name=\"weiss interview\">{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|title=Toon Zone Interviews Nick SVP Teri Weiss About \"Ni Hao, Kai-lan\"|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=2008-01-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420113112/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|archivedate=2008-04-20}}</ref>  a few words of [[Mandarin Chinese]] vocabulary, one or more of Kai-lan's friends having a negative emotional response to some action or activity (problem), Kai-lan thinking out loud (observation), cause-and-effect problem solving, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, \"You make my heart feel super happy!\" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: \"Ni rang wo hao kai xin!\" ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' introduces its viewers to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] language, along with elements of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture and values]], and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n{{:List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n\n==Major characters==\n\n===Kai-Lan===\nKai-Lan (voiced by Jade Lianna Peters) is a playful, adventurous young girl with a big heart. She has black hair that she wears in two space buns with red flowers. The character is often shown wearing a blue t-shirt, orange shorts, and red sneakers. She wears a necklace with a green jade pendant around her neck in every episode. Kai-Lan tries to help all of the characters she meets. She wants to help her friends when she sees that they are not happy or acting out in temper tantrums, even when her friends refuse to compromise, she fails to display actual anger. She gives others a chance to change their minds and do the right thing. Kai-Lan values her family (throughout the show only her grandpa, Ye-Ye, is seen) and she is very fond of her friends: Rintoo, Tolee, Lulu, and Hoho. Kai-Lan speaks both English and Mandarin Chinese. She loves to share her language, her culture, and her playtime with her animal friends and the viewers at home. Kai-Lan is a natural leader, but she is also thoughtful and always ready to help someone in need. Her favorite animal is a dinosaur. In her music group, she plays the tambourine.  \n\n===Rintoo===\nRintoo (voiced by Jack Samson) is a rambunctious and energetic 5-year-old young tiger with a frontal lisp who often acts before he thinks. He often fails to see when he is having a temper tantrum and needs his friends to subtly guide him towards learning to act with more manners. Rintoo enjoys playing sports and he is an avid fan of dragons and racecars. Rintoo hates losing at anything and will often do a tiger roar when he feels angry that he lost.   However, he is always willing to correct his behavior and work better with his friends. Rintoo, along with Hoho, is often seen as the character who get into trouble. He plays the xylophone in Kai-Lan's music group. \n\n===Tolee===\nTolee (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is a gray 5-year-old koala who loves pandas and eating fruit, especially apples, bananas, and pineapples. He is intelligent, sensitive, and always thinks before he acts; however, Tolee often overthinks and worries too much. He dislikes feeling left out of the group, such as when his friends are playing a game where they need to pair up and everyone is paired up before he is. Tolee is Rintoo's [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. Whereas Rintoo is talkative and acts before he thinks, Tolee is thoughtful and will deeply consider his actions before making a decision. When Tolee feels sad or has his feelings hurt, he starts to cry, but his friends can always cheer him up. Tolee loves playing with his friends. Kai-Lan and her friends can always rely on him for good ideas. Tolee also has a stuffed panda that he affectionately named Pandy. Tolee is the vocalist in Kai-Lan's music group.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Beverly Duan]]) is a sweet and intelligent 6-year-old pink rhinoceros. Lulu has a red balloon tied around her horn that helps her fly in the sky. She likes to help her friends, using her red balloon to fly to their aid when they call her name. Lulu gives others a chance to try their hands at tasks even when she herself might have an easier time with them. Lulu values all of the characters she meets and is always friendly and willing to help. She demonstrates compassion and diplomacy, and will often be the first (besides Kai-Lan) to compromise and work out a resolution among her friends. Lulu enjoys dressing up like a princess, having tea parties, and dancing to disco music. She tries to introduce her traditions and customs subtly and without compulsion to those who are not familiar with them. Lulu lives in a floating castle in the sky. Lulu is also a musician, skilled at playing the piano and singing. She's indicated to be best friends with Kai-Lan. Her instrument in Kai-Lan's music group is the keyboard, and her favorite fruit is the lychee.  \n\n===Hoho===\nHoho (voiced by Angie Wu) is an energetic white 3-year-old monkey and is the youngest of Kai-Lan's friends. When he participates in activities, he often goes first. He is full of energy and enjoys being the center of attention. He is a picky eater and can be stubborn towards change such as when his friends want to play a different game. Despite his initial difficulties towards accepting new foods and games, Hoho often to his surprise finds that he loves the thing that he was reluctant to try. Whenever he jumps a springing sound can be heard. He can often be found jumping on his friends' heads or playing his turntables as the DJ in Kai-Lan's music group. Aside from his turntables and his friends, Hoho loves bananas.\n\n===Ye-Ye===\nYe-Ye (voiced by Clem Cheung and Ben Wang) is Kai-lan's playful, thoughtful, and caring grandfather. He was born in Hong Kong and lovingly passes on his exciting traditions to his granddaughter. He provides Kai-lan with gentle guidance, leading her to find her own answers, at her own pace. (Kai-lan's parents and other grandparents are not known.) He can play the tuba, and enjoys picking apples and making dumplings for Kai-lan and all her animal friends.  \n\n===Mr. Sun===\nAt the start of almost every episode, Kai-Lan wakes up Mr. Sun so she can start her day. With the help of the viewer, Mr. Sun rises and showers down smiling sun fuzzies to Kai-Lan and she gets tickled by them. He also knows how to play the trumpet, so Kai-Lan and the ladybugs (playing the [[pipa]]) join him as a little music group at the beginning of '''Tolee's Rhyme Time''' and later joins Kai-Lan and her friends in the music show.\n\n===The Ants===\nIn one corner of Kai-Lan's backyard is a teeming mini-metropolis of ants called Ant City. The ants serve very important roles in the community: they deliver mail, they build things, and they love to play with Kai-Lan and her friends. San San is their leader along with his two right-hand ants, Bubu and Fufu.\n\nSan San is voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], Bubu is voiced by Luke Manriquez, and Fufu is voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski.\n\n===Other, grown-up, and minor characters===\n* Howard (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is an owl who first appears in \"The Dragonboat Festival.\" He delivers letters and only speaks in hoots.  \n* Mr. Fluffy (voiced by Elan Garfias) is a hamster and baker who first appears in \"Everybody's Hat Parade.\"  \n* Mei Mei (voiced by [[Laura Marano]]) is a shy blue polar bear.  \n* Stompy the Elephant (voiced by Hsiang Lo) is a big, playful blue elephant who made his first appearance in \"Safari Pals.\" Nothing makes Stompy happier than being able to play with his friends.   \n* GuNaiNai (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is Kai-Lan's great-aunt and YeYe's sister.

He appears in \"Princess Kai-Lan.\"   \n* The Fox King (voiced by [[James Siang'a]]) is a fox in The Fox Kingdom. He creates magic bamboo forests to keep the bears away. He usually gets mad, and he could not get his sleep and talk to his friends, because of the dancing bears.  \n* The Foxes are red foxes that live in The Fox Kingdom.

animation|anime-influenced]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/arts/television/15davi.html|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan! - China - Animation - TV|first=Michael|last=Davis|publisher=}}</ref>) [[interactive]] [[children's television series]] that premiered in Canadian channel [[Treehouse TV|Treehouse]] on November 5, 2007, and eventually on [[Nick Jr. (TV programming block)|Nick Jr.]] in the United States on February 7, 2008 (it was originally planned to premiere in October 2007, but was delayed). It also premiered on the Canadian television channel [[T\u00e9l\u00e9-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n''Ni Hao, Kai-Lan'' is based on the childhood memories of the show's creator, [[Karen Chau]], growing up in a bicultural (Chinese-American) household. \"Ni hao\" means \"Hello\" in Mandarin, and Kai-Lan is the Chinese name Chau was given at birth, which was later anglicized to Karen. It was also based on the classic short series ''Downward Doghouse''.\n\n==Premise==\nThe series follows the adventures of Kai-Lan and her group of talking anthropomorphic animal companions. The group consists of Kai-Lan, a seven-year old Asian girl; Rintoo, the yellow tiger; Tolee, the gray koala; Lulu, the pink rhino; and Hoho, the white monkey. Each episode is based around a series of events that occur during Kai-Lan's day, along with obstacles that she and her friends are forced to overcome (with \"assistance\" from the viewing audience) relating to riddles, playing games, and working together. Common rituals may involve Kai-Lan resolving temper tantrums from her friends Rintoo and Hoho when they misbehave. To help Rintoo and Hoho, Kai-Lan shows them and the audience why they are having temper tantrums. Usually, once Rintoo and Hoho discover that their actions are wrong, they apologize and promise to work together better. Another obstacle is Hoho's aversion to trying new things; when the group goes to visit Lulu's house, Hoho refuses to try new foods before Kai-Lan and Lulu change Hoho's mind with the viewer's help. The audience is usually presented two musical sing-alongs where Kai-Lan sings about what must be done to overcome her and her friends' challenges. The episode always ends with Kai-Lan successfully helping her friends and everyone getting along. In the Season 1 finale, it is stated that they all live in California. \n\nEpisodes generally feature breaking the [[fourth wall]], 11 minutes of interactivity,<ref name=\"interview\">{{cite web|url=http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|title=Ni Hao, Kai-lan: Tigers and Dragons and Mandarin Lessons|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|date=2007-12-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627225527/http://mag.awn.com/index.php?ltype=pageone&article_no=3588|archivedate=2009-06-27}}</ref> a target word that is repeated multiple times,<ref name=\"weiss interview\">{{cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|title=Toon Zone Interviews Nick SVP Teri Weiss About \"Ni Hao, Kai-lan\"|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=2008-01-21|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420113112/http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=21597|archivedate=2008-04-20}}</ref>  a few words of [[Mandarin Chinese]] vocabulary, one or more of Kai-lan's friends having a negative emotional response to some action or activity (problem), Kai-lan thinking out loud (observation), cause-and-effect problem solving, and before saying goodbye (at the end of each episode), Kai-lan says, \"You make my heart feel super happy!\" Later installments added Kai-lan saying this phrase in Mandarin after she said it in English: \"Ni rang wo hao kai xin!\" ''Ni Hao, Kai-lan'' introduces its viewers to the [[Mandarin Chinese]] language, along with elements of [[Culture of China|Chinese culture and values]], and intergenerational families (e.g., Kai-lan and her relationship with Ye Ye).\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n{{:List of Ni Hao, Kai-Lan episodes}}\n\n==Major characters==\n\n===Kai-Lan===\nKai-Lan (voiced by Jade Lianna Peters) is a playful, adventurous young girl with a big heart. She has black hair that she wears in two space buns with red flowers. The character is often shown wearing a blue t-shirt, orange shorts, and red sneakers. She wears a necklace with a green jade pendant around her neck in every episode. Kai-Lan tries to help all of the characters she meets. She wants to help her friends when she sees that they are not happy or acting out in temper tantrums, even when her friends refuse to compromise, she fails to display actual anger. She gives others a chance to change their minds and do the right thing. Kai-Lan values her family (throughout the show only her grandpa, Ye-Ye, is seen) and she is very fond of her friends: Rintoo, Tolee, Lulu, and Hoho. Kai-Lan speaks both English and Mandarin Chinese. She loves to share her language, her culture, and her playtime with her animal friends and the viewers at home. Kai-Lan is a natural leader, but she is also thoughtful and always ready to help someone in need. Her favorite animal is a dinosaur. In her music group, she plays the tambourine.  \n\n===Rintoo===\nRintoo (voiced by Jack Samson) is a rambunctious and energetic 5-year-old young tiger with a frontal lisp who often acts before he thinks. He often fails to see when he is having a temper tantrum and needs his friends to subtly guide him towards learning to act with more manners. Rintoo enjoys playing sports and he is an avid fan of dragons and racecars. Rintoo hates losing at anything and will often do a tiger roar when he feels angry that he lost.   However, he is always willing to correct his behavior and work better with his friends. Rintoo, along with Hoho, is often seen as the character who get into trouble. He plays the xylophone in Kai-Lan's music group. \n\n===Tolee===\nTolee (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is a gray 5-year-old koala who loves pandas and eating fruit, especially apples, bananas, and pineapples. He is intelligent, sensitive, and always thinks before he acts; however, Tolee often overthinks and worries too much. He dislikes feeling left out of the group, such as when his friends are playing a game where they need to pair up and everyone is paired up before he is. Tolee is Rintoo's [[Foil (literature)|foil]]. Whereas Rintoo is talkative and acts before he thinks, Tolee is thoughtful and will deeply consider his actions before making a decision. When Tolee feels sad or has his feelings hurt, he starts to cry, but his friends can always cheer him up. Tolee loves playing with his friends. Kai-Lan and her friends can always rely on him for good ideas. Tolee also has a stuffed panda that he affectionately named Pandy. Tolee is the vocalist in Kai-Lan's music group.\n\n===Lulu===\nLulu (voiced by [[Beverly Duan]]) is a sweet and intelligent 6-year-old pink rhinoceros. Lulu has a red balloon tied around her horn that helps her fly in the sky. She likes to help her friends, using her red balloon to fly to their aid when they call her name. Lulu gives others a chance to try their hands at tasks even when she herself might have an easier time with them. Lulu values all of the characters she meets and is always friendly and willing to help. She demonstrates compassion and diplomacy, and will often be the first (besides Kai-Lan) to compromise and work out a resolution among her friends. Lulu enjoys dressing up like a princess, having tea parties, and dancing to disco music. She tries to introduce her traditions and customs subtly and without compulsion to those who are not familiar with them. Lulu lives in a floating castle in the sky. Lulu is also a musician, skilled at playing the piano and singing. She's indicated to be best friends with Kai-Lan. Her instrument in Kai-Lan's music group is the keyboard, and her favorite fruit is the lychee.  \n\n===Hoho===\nHoho (voiced by Angie Wu) is an energetic white 3-year-old monkey and is the youngest of Kai-Lan's friends. When he participates in activities, he often goes first. He is full of energy and enjoys being the center of attention. He is a picky eater and can be stubborn towards change such as when his friends want to play a different game. Despite his initial difficulties towards accepting new foods and games, Hoho often to his surprise finds that he loves the thing that he was reluctant to try. Whenever he jumps a springing sound can be heard. He can often be found jumping on his friends' heads or playing his turntables as the DJ in Kai-Lan's music group. Aside from his turntables and his friends, Hoho loves bananas.\n\n===Ye-Ye===\nYe-Ye (voiced by Clem Cheung and Ben Wang) is Kai-lan's playful, thoughtful, and caring grandfather. He was born in Hong Kong and lovingly passes on his exciting traditions to his granddaughter. He provides Kai-lan with gentle guidance, leading her to find her own answers, at her own pace. (Kai-lan's parents and other grandparents are not known.) He can play the tuba, and enjoys picking apples and making dumplings for Kai-lan and all her animal friends.  \n\n===Mr. Sun===\nAt the start of almost every episode, Kai-Lan wakes up Mr. Sun so she can start her day. With the help of the viewer, Mr. Sun rises and showers down smiling sun fuzzies to Kai-Lan and she gets tickled by them. He also knows how to play the trumpet, so Kai-Lan and the ladybugs (playing the [[pipa]]) join him as a little music group at the beginning of '''Tolee's Rhyme Time''' and later joins Kai-Lan and her friends in the music show.\n\n===The Ants===\nIn one corner of Kai-Lan's backyard is a teeming mini-metropolis of ants called Ant City. The ants serve very important roles in the community: they deliver mail, they build things, and they love to play with Kai-Lan and her friends. San San is their leader along with his two right-hand ants, Bubu and Fufu.\n\nSan San is voiced by [[Zachary Gordon]], Bubu is voiced by Luke Manriquez, and Fufu is voiced by Kyla Rae Kowalewski.\n\n===Other, grown-up, and minor characters===\n* Howard (voiced by [[Khamani Griffin]]) is an owl who first appears in \"The Dragonboat Festival.\" He delivers letters and only speaks in hoots.  \n* Mr. Fluffy (voiced by Elan Garfias) is a hamster and baker who first appears in \"Everybody's Hat Parade.\"  \n* Mei Mei (voiced by [[Laura Marano]]) is a shy blue polar bear.  \n* Stompy the Elephant (voiced by Hsiang Lo) is a big, playful blue elephant who made his first appearance in \"Safari Pals.\" Nothing makes Stompy happier than being able to play with his friends.   \n* GuNaiNai (voiced by [[Ming-Na Wen]]) is Kai-Lan's great-aunt and YeYe's sister.

He appears in \"Princess Kai-Lan.\"   \n* The Fox King (voiced by [[James Siang'a]]) is a fox in The Fox Kingdom. He creates magic bamboo forests to keep the bears away.

In a letter to [[T. E. Ellis]], Lewis wrote to his friend, then Chief Whip: 'I will never again fight a constituency as an official Liberal.' Although he later recanted, this episode was illustrative of Herbert Lewis' moral seriousness. With Lloyd George, Lewis was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Cymru Fydd]], a nationalist movement within Welsh Liberalism. Along with Lloyd George and David Alfred Thomas, he opposed the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] at the 1900 General Election.

He was awarded the gold medal of the [[Honourable Society of Cymmrodorion]] in 1927.\n\nLewis was a keen supporter of the [[National Library of Wales]], located in [[Aberystwyth]]. In 1909 he became a Vice President of the Library.

With Lloyd George, Lewis was an enthusiastic supporter of [[Cymru Fydd]], a nationalist movement within Welsh Liberalism. Along with Lloyd George and David Alfred Thomas, he opposed the [[Second Boer War|Boer War]] at the 1900 General Election.

Wayne Reitz|Reitz]] in 1957.]]\n'''Florida Blue Key''' is a student leadership [[honor society]] at the [[University of Florida]] which was founded in 1923. \n\n==History==\n\n===Founding and early years===\n[[Image:Aamurphree.jpg|right|150px|thumb|President [[Albert Murphree]]]]\n\"Florida Blue Key was founded on November 1, 1923, several days prior to the University's Homecoming celebration.<ref name=Thompson2014>{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=David|url=https://www.gatorcountry.com/feature/silencing-growl/|title=The silencing of the Growl|website=GatorCountry.com|date=October 16, 2014|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> At the suggestion of President Albert E. Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Separation with national chapters===\n\nThe concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea.  Through Dean Riley's travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn't long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization between 1932 and 1935.  The Florida group thought the proposed Constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average.  The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped. The Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. \n\nThe Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country.  Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida.  The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.\n\nThe parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students.  The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members.  The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it.  Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution.  Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.\n\nToday, it is still part of the orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society.  A transfer student to the University of Florida often assumes his membership in a Blue Key National Honor Society chapter at another institution provides him with reciprocal membership in Florida Blue Key only to find out that is not the case.   To this day, Florida Blue Key controls the use of all trademark and intellectual property rights related to Blue Key.  Furthermore, Blue Key National Honor Society is prohibited from chartering or forming chapters at any institution within the State of Florida.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Grapski lawsuit===\n\nIn 1995, Florida Blue Key was sued by graduate student Charles Grapski, who claimed that some of the organization's members had [[defamation|defamed]] him during his candidacy for student body president. In his complaint, Grapski charged that several members of Florida Blue Key conspired to alter Grapski's criminal record, adding a false charge of child molestation, and circulate it on campus.  <ref>{{cite news|last1=Word|first1=Ron|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=https://apnews.com/5ea6b70315cdd87c4a4845fe7e4893d7|accessdate=3 April 2019|work=Associated Press News|date=April 16, 1998}}</ref> \n\nAccording to a 1997 lawsuit by Charles Grapski, Florida Blue Key maintains tight control over the Student Government and University of Florida. Florida Blue Key was found guilty of [[slander and libel|defamation of character]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy to defame]], and held liable for damages of $250,000. Grapski and FBK eventually settled for $85,000, and Florida Blue Key has since claimed no liability.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boedy|first1=Matthew|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/031500/State/Suit_over_fliers_brin.shtml|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=March 15, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Current responsibilities===\n[[Image:Miss UF.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Miss University of Florida]] in 1958]]\nThe organization continues to sponsor and organize the University of Florida's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration and [[Gator Growl]].<ref name=Bell1998>{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Maya|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1998-04-19-9804190028-story.html|title=Scandal, Revelations Shake UF's Exclusive Leaders Club|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|date=April 19, 1998|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> These events are widely recognized as the largest Homecoming celebration in the country, which has grown to encompass dozens of events and community activities throughout the fall semester.\n\nGator Growl is billed as the largest student-run [[pep rally]] in the world; an estimated 75,000 people have attended the event in past years. Gator Growl, nicknamed \"Growl\" by some students, usually features comedians such as [[Bill Cosby]], [[Frank Thornton]], and [[Dane Cook]] in addition to the school rallies, but occasionally a top-tier musical act headlines the show. The first Gator Growl occurred in 1932, and has been a tradition at the University of Florida for over 80 years.\n\nThe Blue Key Speech & Debate Tournament, sponsored by FBK since the early 1980s, is one of the largest and most prestigious [[high school]] speech & debate tournaments in the country.\n\nOther responsibilities include organizing UF's Legal Day, sponsoring the [[Miss University of Florida]] pageant, lobbying efforts on behalf of the university, and various community debates regarding issues concerning [[Florida]] and UF.\n\n==Influence on-campus and in politics==\nFlorida Blue Key's control of politics has been compared to [[The Machine (social group)|The Machine]] at the [[University of Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Not so secret society: Raucous student election spotlights 'elite' Burning Spear group |url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/04/27/not-so-secret-society-raucous-student-election-spotlights-elite-burning-spear-group/543912002/}}</ref> For decades, members of Florida Blue Key have been the gatekeepers of student involvement on campus.\n\n''[[The Independent Florida Alligator]]'' wrote that \"For students aspiring to hold public office one day, the path seems simple,\" adding \"Go to UF.

Murphree, Bert C. Riley, Dean of General Extension, brought together a group of student leaders to form an organization which would recognize leadership and promote service to the University.  Among the duties assigned to Florida Blue Key were playing host to campus visitors and to be at the call of the President of the University for any duty designated by him.\n\nIn this respect, Blue Key was given the task of planning and executing Homecoming activities that year and has continued to lead this activity ever since.  Also included in the 1923 Homecoming was Dad's Day, a time for parents to visit and acquaint themselves with campus life.  Dad's Day and Homecoming were held concurrently until the 1930s.\n\nThe organization quickly became so popular that Blue Key spread to colleges and universities across the country.\n\nInitially, membership in the organization was ''ex officio''; a student automatically belonged to the organization if he held one of the major student organization positions on campus.<ref name=\"auto\">Who's Who in Florida Blue Key; Volume XIII</ref>\n\nIn the 1920s, the University of Florida was the state's only institution of higher learning where a white male could continue his education.<ref>Pursuant to the [[Buckman Act]], adopted by the Florida Legislature in 1905, the [[University of Florida]] was reserved for white male students, [[Florida State University|Florida State College for Women]] was reserved for white female students, and [[Florida A & M University|Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes]] was a coeducational institution for black students.</ref> During the same time, the leadership of the state was male, predominantly those from Florida. If one of those leaders were college educated, it was most likely he went to the University of Florida and, to a large measure, it was consistent that student leaders at the University of Florida would likely remain in Florida and would assume roles of leadership within the professional, political, governmental, business, education cultural, religious, and social life of the state. The networking of those students with each other, and with other alumni of the institution, provided a powerful force and unique opportunity for service to the University of Florida. While Florida Blue Key membership offered many opportunities for service to the University, it also provided opportunities for personal enhancement and advancement. Many doors were opened to young college graduates whose resume included membership in Florida Blue Key.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Separation with national chapters===\n\nThe concept of a group of student leaders pooling their talents and interests to plan and promote a major event for their campus was a popular idea.  Through Dean Riley's travels and professional contacts, similar organizations were developed on other campuses and it wasn't long before it seemed appropriate to organize into a national group.\n\nFor a variety of reasons, the University of Florida chapter decided not to be part of the national organization between 1932 and 1935.  The Florida group thought the proposed Constitution of the national organization took too much control from the hands of the students; and it disagreed with some specific tenets of membership, including the requirement of a 2.5 grade point average.  The Florida group believed the organization was not an academic one but, rather, a leadership and service group; thus, if one was progressing satisfactorily toward a degree (i.e. 2.0), one should be eligible for membership. Since then, Florida Blue Key has changed its stance on the grade point average requirement, now requiring a 2.75 GPA in order to be tapped. The Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country. Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida. \n\nThe Blue Key National Honor Society came into being and is a very respected national organization with chapters on many campuses throughout the country.  Florida Blue Key was also formed as an organization only to be found at the University of Florida.  The dispute was a clear indication that FBK did not intend to serve as a passive honor for University of Florida students, but rather as an active force in shaping the events of the university and state.\n\nThe parting of the ways between the parent chapter and other chapters forming the national organization left deep wounds on many Florida students.  The perceptions of the conflict being a very important part of any subsequent discussions about the organization for years to come; including discussions of orientation of new members.  The active members at that time wanted nothing to do with the national organization once it was founded, and, further, wanted to be sure that their successors would not become involved in it.  Examples of such feelings are expressed in the last sentence of the Oath of Membership in Florida Blue Key and the Constitution.  Through the 1940s, the orientation of new members included hours on the discussion of this topic.\n\nToday, it is still part of the orientation, but only for the purposes of relating its historical significance and for emphasizing that Florida Blue Key is the name of the organization that it has no relationship to, and is not part of, The Blue Key National Honor Society.  A transfer student to the University of Florida often assumes his membership in a Blue Key National Honor Society chapter at another institution provides him with reciprocal membership in Florida Blue Key only to find out that is not the case.   To this day, Florida Blue Key controls the use of all trademark and intellectual property rights related to Blue Key.  Furthermore, Blue Key National Honor Society is prohibited from chartering or forming chapters at any institution within the State of Florida.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n===Grapski lawsuit===\n\nIn 1995, Florida Blue Key was sued by graduate student Charles Grapski, who claimed that some of the organization's members had [[defamation|defamed]] him during his candidacy for student body president. In his complaint, Grapski charged that several members of Florida Blue Key conspired to alter Grapski's criminal record, adding a false charge of child molestation, and circulate it on campus.  <ref>{{cite news|last1=Word|first1=Ron|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=https://apnews.com/5ea6b70315cdd87c4a4845fe7e4893d7|accessdate=3 April 2019|work=Associated Press News|date=April 16, 1998}}</ref> \n\nAccording to a 1997 lawsuit by Charles Grapski, Florida Blue Key maintains tight control over the Student Government and University of Florida. Florida Blue Key was found guilty of [[slander and libel|defamation of character]] and [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy to defame]], and held liable for damages of $250,000. Grapski and FBK eventually settled for $85,000, and Florida Blue Key has since claimed no liability.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Boedy|first1=Matthew|title=Suit over fliers brings $6-million|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/031500/State/Suit_over_fliers_brin.shtml|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=March 15, 2000}}</ref>\n\n===Current responsibilities===\n[[Image:Miss UF.jpg|left|170px|thumb|[[Miss University of Florida]] in 1958]]\nThe organization continues to sponsor and organize the University of Florida's annual [[Homecoming]] celebration and [[Gator Growl]].<ref name=Bell1998>{{cite web|last=Bell|first=Maya|url=https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/os-xpm-1998-04-19-9804190028-story.html|title=Scandal, Revelations Shake UF's Exclusive Leaders Club|work=[[The Orlando Sentinel]]|date=April 19, 1998|accessdate=April 8, 2020}}</ref> These events are widely recognized as the largest Homecoming celebration in the country, which has grown to encompass dozens of events and community activities throughout the fall semester.\n\nGator Growl is billed as the largest student-run [[pep rally]] in the world; an estimated 75,000 people have attended the event in past years. Gator Growl, nicknamed \"Growl\" by some students, usually features comedians such as [[Bill Cosby]], [[Frank Thornton]], and [[Dane Cook]] in addition to the school rallies, but occasionally a top-tier musical act headlines the show. The first Gator Growl occurred in 1932, and has been a tradition at the University of Florida for over 80 years.\n\nThe Blue Key Speech & Debate Tournament, sponsored by FBK since the early 1980s, is one of the largest and most prestigious [[high school]] speech & debate tournaments in the country.\n\nOther responsibilities include organizing UF's Legal Day, sponsoring the [[Miss University of Florida]] pageant, lobbying efforts on behalf of the university, and various community debates regarding issues concerning [[Florida]] and UF.\n\n==Influence on-campus and in politics==\nFlorida Blue Key's control of politics has been compared to [[The Machine (social group)|The Machine]] at the [[University of Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Not so secret society: Raucous student election spotlights 'elite' Burning Spear group |url=https://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/2018/04/27/not-so-secret-society-raucous-student-election-spotlights-elite-burning-spear-group/543912002/}}</ref> For decades, members of Florida Blue Key have been the gatekeepers of student involvement on campus.\n\n''[[The Independent Florida Alligator]]'' wrote that \"For students aspiring to hold public office one day, the path seems simple,\" adding \"Go to UF.
