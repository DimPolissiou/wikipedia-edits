She then studied at Kolkata's [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\nAt fifteen she was photographed by [[Brian Brake]] for the well-known photo from his 1960 \"[[Monsoon (photographs)|Monsoon]]\" series of photographs; the photo appeared on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/files/43221-wmu.jpg  |title= ''Monsoon girl'' |publisher= Te Papa }}</ref>\n\nLater in life she would work with [[Satyajit Ray]] in several of his films, including the short ''[[Pikoo (film)|Pikoo]]'' (1981) where she played the role of an adulterous wife and mother.\n\nIn 1965, Sen resumed her film career in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s ''[[Akash Kusum]]'', which was later remade into a Hindi film ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]'' starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Moushumi Chatterjee]].

Sen was successful in mainstream Bengali films. Her chemistry with [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] in films such as ''[[Basanta Bilap]]'', ''Baksa Badal'' and ''[[Chhutir Phande]]'' was loved as much as her work with [[Uttam Kumar]] in films like ''[[Joy Jayanti]]'', ''Memshaheb'' and ''Alor Thikana''.\n\nIn 1969, Sen appeared in ''[[The Guru (1969 film)|The Guru]]'', an English-language feature by [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].

She then studied at Kolkata's [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\nAt fifteen she was photographed by [[Brian Brake]] for the well-known photo from his 1960 \"[[Monsoon (photographs)|Monsoon]]\" series of photographs; the photo appeared on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/files/43221-wmu.jpg  |title= ''Monsoon girl'' |publisher= Te Papa }}</ref>\n\nLater in life she would work with [[Satyajit Ray]] in several of his films, including the short ''[[Pikoo (film)|Pikoo]]'' (1981) where she played the role of an adulterous wife and mother.\n\nIn 1965, Sen resumed her film career in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s ''[[Akash Kusum]]'', which was later remade into a Hindi film ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]'' starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Moushumi Chatterjee]].

Sen was successful in mainstream Bengali films. Her chemistry with [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] in films such as ''[[Basanta Bilap]]'', ''Baksa Badal'' and ''[[Chhutir Phande]]'' was loved as much as her work with [[Uttam Kumar]] in films like ''[[Joy Jayanti]]'', ''Memshaheb'' and ''Alor Thikana''.\n\nIn 1969, Sen appeared in ''[[The Guru (1969 film)|The Guru]]'', an English-language feature by [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].

She then studied at Kolkata's [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\nAt fifteen she was photographed by [[Brian Brake]] for the well-known photo from his 1960 \"[[Monsoon (photographs)|Monsoon]]\" series of photographs; the photo appeared on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/files/43221-wmu.jpg  |title= ''Monsoon girl'' |publisher= Te Papa }}</ref>\n\nLater in life she would work with [[Satyajit Ray]] in several of his films, including the short ''[[Pikoo (film)|Pikoo]]'' (1981) where she played the role of an adulterous wife and mother.\n\nIn 1965, Sen resumed her film career in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s ''[[Akash Kusum]]'', which was later remade into a Hindi film ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]'' starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Moushumi Chatterjee]].

Sen was successful in mainstream Bengali films. Her chemistry with [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] in films such as ''[[Basanta Bilap]]'', ''Baksa Badal'' and ''[[Chhutir Phande]]'' was loved as much as her work with [[Uttam Kumar]] in films like ''[[Joy Jayanti]]'', ''Memshaheb'' and ''Alor Thikana''.\n\nIn 1969, Sen appeared in ''[[The Guru (1969 film)|The Guru]]'', an English-language feature by [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].

She then studied at Kolkata's [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]].\n\nAt fifteen she was photographed by [[Brian Brake]] for the well-known photo from his 1960 \"[[Monsoon (photographs)|Monsoon]]\" series of photographs; the photo appeared on the cover of [[Life (magazine)|Life]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://teara.govt.nz/files/43221-wmu.jpg  |title= ''Monsoon girl'' |publisher= Te Papa }}</ref>\n\nLater in life she would work with [[Satyajit Ray]] in several of his films, including the short ''[[Pikoo (film)|Pikoo]]'' (1981) where she played the role of an adulterous wife and mother.\n\nIn 1965, Sen resumed her film career in [[Mrinal Sen]]'s ''[[Akash Kusum]]'', which was later remade into a Hindi film ''[[Manzil (1979 film)|Manzil]]'' starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]] and [[Moushumi Chatterjee]].

Sen was successful in mainstream Bengali films. Her chemistry with [[Soumitra Chatterjee]] in films such as ''[[Basanta Bilap]]'', ''Baksa Badal'' and ''[[Chhutir Phande]]'' was loved as much as her work with [[Uttam Kumar]] in films like ''[[Joy Jayanti]]'', ''Memshaheb'' and ''Alor Thikana''.\n\nIn 1969, Sen appeared in ''[[The Guru (1969 film)|The Guru]]'', an English-language feature by [[Merchant Ivory Productions]].
