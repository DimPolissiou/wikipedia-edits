The company also published a 'Pictorial' series of books of collections of short essays and illustrations on many non-fiction topics.

Like the other five firms, Warne turned the proposal down. But the people at the firm changed their minds when they saw the privately published copy in 1901. They said they would publish the book, as long as the illustrations were drawn in colour. The next year, Warne published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'', and by [[Christmas]] it had sold 20,000 copies. This began a forty-year partnership which saw the publication of twenty-two additional little books. Beatrix Potter was engaged to marry Norman Warne, her editor and the youngest of the three Warne brothers. However, he died tragically in 1905, only a few weeks after their engagement. Harold, the eldest brother, took over as Potter's editor. She continued to produce one or two new Little Books each year for the next eight years until her marriage in 1913 to William Heelis. During the next few years Potter turned her attention to her farm work, but when the company fell on hard times and Harold was imprisoned for embezzlement, she came to the rescue with another new title to support \"the old firm.\" Potter, who had no children, left the rights to her works to Warne upon her death. The company continued to publish them; it also brought out several biographical works about its most renowned author. Over the years, Warne also expanded its nonfiction publishing, issuing among others the world-famous Observer books. \n \nIn 1983, Warne was bought by [[Penguin Books]]. It began developing classic book-based children's character brands. The merchandising program was expanded from a base of thirty-five licenses to more than four hundred by the late 1990s. Over the years, Warne acquired a variety of other classic books.\n\nA major motion picture about the life of Beatrix Potter ''[[Miss Potter]]'', starring [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] as Beatrix Potter and [[Ewan McGregor]] as Norman Warne was released in 2006. While the company no longer exists as an independent company, it continues to exist as an imprint of Penguin Group. The company collaborated with [[Sony Pictures Animation]] and [[Animal Logic]] to produce the [[Peter Rabbit (2018 film)|Peter Rabbit film]], which was released in 2018.\n\n== Beatrix Potter books ==\n\nFrom 1902 to 1930 Warne published twenty-three story books written and illustrated for children by Beatrix Potter. Primarily they feature anthropomorphic animals, such as [[Peter Rabbit]] in the first of the series, ''The Tale of Peter Rabbit''. Here they are listed by year of the first edition. \n{{div col |colwidth=25em}}\n*''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'' (1902)\n*''[[The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin]]'' (1903)\n*''[[The Tailor of Gloucester]]'' (1903)\n*''[[The Tale of Benjamin Bunny]]'' (1904)\n*''[[The Tale of Two Bad Mice]]'' (1904)\n*''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle]]'' (1905)\n*''[[The Tale of the Pie and the Patty-Pan]]'' (1905)\n*''[[The Tale of Mr. Jeremy Fisher]]'' (1906)\n*''[[The Story of A Fierce Bad Rabbit]]'' (1906)\n*''[[The Story of Miss Moppet]]'' (1906)\n*''[[The Tale of Tom Kitten]]'' (1907)\n*''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-Duck]]'' (1908)\n*''[[The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or, The Roly-Poly Pudding]]'' (1908)\n*''[[The Tale of the Flopsy Bunnies]]'' (1909)\n*''[[The Tale of Ginger and Pickles]]'' (1909)\n*''[[The Tale of Mrs. Tittlemouse]]'' (1910)\n*''[[The Tale of Timmy Tiptoes]]'' (1911)\n*''[[The Tale of Mr. Tod]]'' (1912)\n*''[[The Tale of Pigling Bland]]'' (1913)\n*''[[Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes]]'' (1917)\n*''[[The Tale of Johnny Town-Mouse]]'' (1918)\n*''[[Cecily Parsley's Nursery Rhymes]]'' (1922)\n*''[[The Tale of Little Pig Robinson]]'' (1930)\n{{div col end}}\nWarne also published the first British edition of one longer children's book written and illustrated by Potter. \n*''[[The Fairy Caravan]]'' (1952); US edition, 1929\n*''[[O?]]'' (1958)\n\n== ''Observer's Books'' ==\n{{main|Observer's Books}}\n\nFrom 1937 to 2003, Warne published small, pocket-sized books, which were available on many subjects. The aim of these books were to interest the observer. They were called the Observer's books. These books were very popular amongst children. Over the past few years they have become very popular collector items. For the dedicated collector this could be a lifetime's work as there are over 800 variations, some of which are now very rare. The values of the books can vary from 50p to hundreds of pounds. They all include a variety of topics, which include hobbies, art, history, wildlife and many more. The earlier books were printed with paper dust covers up until 1969. These were good for printing but where not very practical because they were very delicate and were easy to rip and stain. From 1970, the covers were protected with a glossy coating. This helped the dust covers protection. These types are often referred to as Glossies. From the late 1970s, Warne decided to laminate the covers to the actual books, so the books were highly protected as they didn't really have any covers. The dust covers from 1937 to 1970 had designs that were colourful and attractive as each one had its own unique colouring of squiggly lines at the top. In 1971, Warne decided to refurbish its books with a more formal dust jacket. These were good but it lost the charm that the original covers had had. I have some pictures below of old and new dust jackets in Observer's books. The first Observer guide was published in 1937, and was on the subject of British Birds. This is now very rare, and a mint copy with a dust cover is worth hundreds of pounds. The same year, Warne published a second book, on British Wild Flowers, a mint copy of this book is worth around \u00a3220.\n\nBy 1941, Warne had published the first six Observer's books. In 1942, a special edition book was brought out on Airplanes. This book had no number in the series, as it was bought out to help people spot enemy planes during World War 2. It was printed again in 1943 and in 1945. When Warne was acquired by Penguin books in 1983, Warne bought out new editions of the Observer's books. These were slightly bigger than the Observer's books and were in paperback, not hardback. The same year penguin, with permission of Warne, started printing their own, more up to date Observer's books. These again were slightly larger than the originals but were hardbacks. Like the later original Observer's books, The dust cover was laminated to the actual book. There were two types of the penguin Observer's books, Bloomsbury Observer's, and Claremont Observer's, (of which there were only 12 different editions).\nBelow is a list of all the original Observer's books with the dates of their first editions, and two pictures of Observer's books.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |25em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20100829004502/http://us.penguingroup.com/static/pages/publishers/yr/frederickwarne.html Frederick Warne] at [[Penguin Books]]\n*[http://www.reading.ac.uk/special-collections/collections/sc-warne.aspx Frederick Warne Archive], University of Reading Special Collections\n*[https://www.bris.ac.uk/is/library/collections/specialcollections/archives/penguin/frederickwarne.html Frederick Warne Archive], University of Bristol Library Special Collections\n\n{{Penguin Random House}}\n{{Victorian children's literature}}\n{{Portal bar|Companies|Books}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Frederick Warne and Co}}\n[[Category:Book publishing companies of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Publishing companies established in 1865]]\n[[Category:1983 mergers and acquisitions]] \n[[Category:Book publishing companies]]\n[[Category:Penguin Random House]]\n[[Category:Reference publishers]]\n", "text_old": "{{refimprove|date=December 2016}}\n{{Infobox publisher\n| image        = [[File:Frederick Warne & Co logo.jpg|200px]]\n| parent       = [[Penguin Random House]]\n| status       = \n| founded      = {{start date and age|1865}}\n| founder      = Frederick Warne \n| successor    = \n| country      = [[United Kingdom]]\n| headquarters = [[London]]\n| distribution = \n| keypeople    = \n| publications = \n| topics       = \n| genre        = \n| imprints     = \n| revenue      = \n| numemployees = \n| nasdaq       = \n| url          = {{URL|http://www.penguin.com/meet/publishers/frederickwarne/}}\n}}\n\n'''Frederick Warne & Co''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[publisher]] founded in 1865.

Like the other five firms, Warne turned the proposal down. But the people at the firm changed their minds when they saw the privately published copy in 1901. They said they would publish the book, as long as the illustrations were drawn in colour. The next year, Warne published ''[[The Tale of Peter Rabbit]]'', and by [[Christmas]] it had sold 20,000 copies. This began a forty-year partnership which saw the publication of twenty-two additional little books. Beatrix Potter was engaged to marry Norman Warne, her editor and the youngest of the three Warne brothers. However, he died tragically in 1905, only a few weeks after their engagement.

J. Smith (author)|L. J. Smith]]. The series presents a story in which [[vampire]]s, [[witch]]es, [[Werewolf|werewolves]], and [[shapeshifter]]s live among humans without their knowledge. These supernatural races make up a secret society known as the Night World, which enforces two fundamental laws to prevent discovery: 1) Never allow humans to gain knowledge of the Night World's existence and, 2) Never fall in love with a human.\n\nEach volume of the series follows a different protagonist (always a teenage girl) who must face various challenges involving love, the \"[[soulmate]] principle\" and the Night World's strict code. In the first six novels, the plot focuses on the protagonist discovering her soulmate and the danger which ensues. In the seventh book of the series, the concept of an impending millennial [[apocalypse]] is introduced. Although the theme of the \"[[soulmate]] principle\" continues to be present, the later books' plots focus on the search for four \"Wild Powers\" who, according to an ancient [[prophecy]], will either save the world or aid in its destruction. Books from the series appeared on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]] for children's books in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe concluding book in the series, ''Strange Fate'', has been delayed for over two decades now, and the release date is currently unconfirmed, with various websites stating different release dates going all the way up to 2030.\n\n==Publishing History==\nThe first nine books in the ''Night World'' series were originally published in 1996\u20131998 by [[Simon & Schuster]]. The release of the tenth and final book, ''Strange Fate'', was put on hold when L.J. Smith took a hiatus from writing in 1999. In 2008, the nine ''Night World'' books were reprinted in three omnibus volumes.\n\nFor the 2008 reprint, some edits were made in an attempt at modernisation, such as the replacement of the word \"walkman\" with \"iPod\" in ''Daughters of Darkness''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">L. J. Smith (Reprint) Daughters of Darkness</ref> These edits were not made consistently: there are references to iPods on one page of a novel, followed by references to the previously used \"walkman\" on the next page.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Series Summary==\n==='' Secret Vampire''===\nPoppy North, a normal teenage girl, is diagnosed with terminal [[pancreatic cancer]]. Her best friend James Rasmussen, secretly a vampire and her soulmate, rushes to find a cure, knowing that less than three percent of patients with pancreatic cancer survive. James decides to turn Poppy into a vampire in order to save her life. After Poppy is turned, James's cousin, Ash, abducts Poppy and takes her to Las Vegas where they attend a party held by the Lord of the Night World so that Ash can turn her in (Poppy is an \"illegal\" vampire). James manages to save her, and it is revealed that Poppy has every right to know about the Night World because she is actually a \"lost\" witch, a witch unaware of her magical heritage.James and Poppy set out to find Poppy's father supposing he could help them.\n\n===''Daughters of Darkness''===\nVampire sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern escape from their homeland on an island in the Night World to live with their Aunt Opal on Burdock Farm. Things take a turn for the worse when the girls discover their aunt has been killed and that their ruthless brother Ash has followed them to bring them home or kill them. Meanwhile, the sisters and Ash meet the Carters next door, and Ash, who hates humans, discovers that Mary-Lynette Carter, a human, is his soulmate and falls deeply in love with her. Although he is hesitant at first and they don't get along well, he cannot help his feelings and later proclaims his love for her. Jade is dating Mary-Lynnette's brother, Mark, her soulmate. In the end, Mary-Lynnette's friend, Jeremy, who turns out to be a werewolf, tries to kill Ash, Kestrel, Jade, and Rowan for hunting in his territory, and also tries to turn Mary-Lynette into a werewolf. With fire and a silver dagger/knife, Mary-Lynnette kills Jeremy, and Ash leaves to cover up the events. The sisters plan to stay at Burdock Farm while Mary-Lynnette waits for Ash's return after sending him away for a year so she can have some time to think about their love and whether she wants to turn into a vampire!\n\n===''Spellbinder'' (also published under the title ''Enchantress'')===\nThea and Blaise Harman are witch cousins and are as close as sisters. There's only one slight difference: Thea uses white magic and Blaise uses black magic. Blaise uses her charm and magic to make boys do anything for her, including cutting themselves with razors and burning down schools. When the cousins start attending a new school and Thea heals Eric Ross from a snake bite, Thea and Eric realize they are soulmates. Blaise is jealous that Eric has chosen Thea and is worried that Thea is breaking Night World law to be with Eric. In a desperate attempt to protect Eric from Blaise, Thea accidentally releases an angry spirit that kills one of Blaise's admirers. Thea and Eric try their best to capture the angry spirit by luring it away from the school. But Thea is wanted by the Circle because she is not allowed to use that kind of magic, as are Blaise and Thea's friend Dani. Thea manages to tell them that Eric is in trouble because the angry spirit is with him. She manages to get to Eric before he is killed and puts the spirit back where it came from. The Circle tells her that she cannot love a human so she chooses to drink the Cup of [[Lethe]], a drink that erases a part of your memory, to erase her and Eric's knowledge of the Night World. However, Blaise had switched the drink with iced tea, so neither forgets that the Night World exists.\n\n===''Dark Angel''===\nAfter a near-death experience in a forest, Gillian Lennox is brought back to life by a being who calls himself \"Angel\". He comes back with her and helps her change her life, making her the most popular girl at school and uniting her with her long-time crush. Everything is perfect until Angel starts making strange requests and people start getting hurt, and Gillian learns about her heritage. She is a descendant of one of the lost Harman babies. She learns that Angel is a spirit with unfinished business. She learns that Angel's real name is Gary Fargeon, and he is her cousin, a descendant of another lost Harman baby. His unfinished business is that he accidentally killed a girl when she disturbed a spell he was casting. She helps him cross over, leaving Gillian with her long-time crush and soulmate David Blackburn.\n\n===''The Chosen''===\nAfter witnessing the murder of her mother and her younger brother, Timmy, by a ruthless vampire when she was five years old, Rashel Jordan becomes a vampire hunter known as The Cat, dedicating her life to killing all vampires one by one until she finds the one that killed her mother. One night she meets her soul mate, John Quinn, a cold-hearted vampire who turns out to be her one and only soulmate. After investigating a series of strange abductions in her area, she infiltrates a vampire enclave, rescues the girls, and plans to kill any vampires she can. Quinn saves Rashel from a werewolf and thus declares his love for her and try to attempt turning her into a vampire to marry her.But later they discover that Hunter Redfern is behind the blood feast, whom is also responsible for death of her mother and younger brother when she was five. She finds out that Timmy was not killed but instead he was turned into a vampire at the age of four and raised by Hunter. Rashel's friend Nyala, a vengeful, unbalanced vampire hunter, sets the house on fire but Quinn saves Rashel, Timmy, and Nyala and Rashel's anger and bitterness for all vampires dissolves. Rashel and Quinn decide to stay together and join Circle Daybreak.\n\n===''Soulmate''===\nHannah Snow has been having nightmares and keeps finding notes written in her own handwriting, warning her that she is in danger and will die before her seventeenth birthday. Worried about her sanity, she begins hypnosis with a psychologist, Paul Winfield, going back through time and reliving her past lives, connecting to each of them and discovering that her soulmate is Thierry Descoudres, a vampire and a Lord of the Night World. Thierry and his enemy Maya have found Hannah, and Hannah's life is at stake because Maya wants Thierry for herself. Maya was the person who made Thierry into a vampire. Thierry was the first made vampire, and Maya was a witch but wanted to be immortal, so she turned herself into a vampire by using a spell and drinking the blood of four babies. At first Hannah thinks that Thierry was the one who killed her in her past lives, but it was actually Maya when she was in her shapeshifted form, disguising herself as Thierry. Hannah goes to his house and meets the other members of Circle Daybreak, a group of humans, vampires, wolves, witches, and shapeshifters, all of whom are hoping for peace between Night World and the human race. Hannah is captured by Maya, who attempts to turn Hannah into a vampire so that when she kills Hannah, her cycle of reincarnation will end because she will no longer have a soul. Instead, Hannah manages to kill Maya. Hannah decides to remain human and live her life until death, after which Thierry will wait for her to return again.\n\n===''Huntress''===\nJezabel \"Jez\" Redfern thinks she is a full vampire, but soon finds out she is in fact half-human. She runs away from her gang and Uncle Bracken to live with her human relatives. She only goes back to the vampires when Circle Daybreak asks her to go on a dangerous mission: to fight her worst enemy, best friend, and soulmate, Morgead Blackthorn, for the Wild Power. It turns out that the person thought to be the Wild Power is a fake. When she meets her friend Hugh, an Old Soul, Jez's annoying cousin Claire follows her and overhears everything. They are soon after attacked by two werewolves and a vampire. When she and Claire fall off the station platform onto the train tracks, Jez sees blue fire, the power of a Wild Power, and thinks Claire is the one. When she, Claire, Hugh, and Morgead are captured by Lily Redfern, who is in search of the Wild Power, Jez figures out the meaning of the prophecy: she is one of the Wild Powers, and her blood must be spilled to release the blue fire. Morgead convinces her not to let go and give up when she is staked by Lily and she does not die. Jez admits Morgead is her soul mate and they are made for each other.\n\n===''Black Dawn''===\nWhile trying to rescue her brother from his girlfriend, a witch named Sylvia, Maggie stumbles upon an old Night World colony, where she meets a vampire prince. He is Delos Redfern, who is not only the ruler of the Night World, but is one of the four Wild Powers, with the power of blue fire. Though he is cold towards her, he repeatedly saves her, each time stating that he won't help her again. The two soon learn that they are soulmates, though Delos refuses it and tells her to leave. Maggie does not, and remains in the Night World to find her brother. Delos's great-grandfather, Hunter Redfern, arrives to take over the kingdom with Delos's help. After arriving at the castle, against Delos's orders, Maggie convinces him to take her side. He does, realizing that Hunter is an enemy, though it takes a while for him to care for anyone else. Delos soon discovers that changing sides is useless, as his powers are bound by a spell, and he cannot fight against any of them. Maggie finds out that her brother was turned into a shapeshifting falcon by, Sylvia . Sylvia is killed by Hunter Redfern after she releases the spell binding Delos's powers. Hunter Redfern is presumably killed by Delos's use of blue fire. Maggie is happy to have found her brother and her soulmate. However, no one can rest yet because the witches have seceded from the Night World Council, leading to war between vampires and witches. Two Wild Powers have been found, and both are now on the side of Circle Daybreak. Only two more remain.\n\n===''Witchlight''===\nRaksha Keller and her team race to a mall to save the new Wild Power, Iliana Harman. The new Wild Power is destined to marry Galen Drache, a shapeshifter of the first house, so the shapeshifters will side with the witches and not the vampires. But when Keller learns that the Wild Power's betrothed, Galen Drache, is in fact her soulmate, she realizes that their love could destroy the world. Also, the Night World shapeshifters have been attacking humans often, and they have also killed the Crone of the witches, Grandma Harman. The Night World has a dragon that can turn into anything that it touches. Iliana's deaf friend, Jaime, is hosting a party, to be held on the same night as the ceremony that bonds the witches and shapeshifters. Iliana tries to use her powers to save Jaime when a car is going to hit her, but she can't activate the power. Based on that failure, Iliana assumes that she is not the Wild Power but agrees to pretend that she is the Wild Power and Witch Child so the ceremony will still go ahead. However, she says that she will only help if she can go to Jaime's party. Keller and the people who are protecting Iliana agree and go with her to protect her from the dragon. Before they go, they station guards all around the house. The night before the party, Keller and Galen stay up looking through scrolls that contain writing only shapeshifters can read, trying to find information about the dragon. They find out that dragons have horns and that if you cut them all off, they can no longer shapeshift. They also find out accidentally that they are soulmates, but Keller thinks they have to ignore it because he has to marry Iliana. At the party, Jaime's brother, Brett, tells Keller that Iliana's little brother has run away, and Iliana's mother is on the phone. Keller goes into Jaime's room, picks up the phone, and asks Brett to leave the room. When he does, she finds that there is no one on the other end of the phone. She tries to leave the room but the door is locked and she realises that the dragon was disguised as Brett. She shapeshifts into a panther, jumps out the window, and reenters the party to try to find Iliana. Iliana is nowhere to be found, so Keller asks the real Brett where she is. He tells her that she is in the basement. Keller runs through a tunnel and finds her friends and Iliana badly hurt. She attacks the dragon, who was disguised as Jaime, several times and removes three out of the five horns. Galen who has never acquired a shape yet and wants to be something small and peaceful turns into a leopard and removes another horn to save keller. Keller sees her witch friend whisper something to Iliana, and Iliana stands up. She chants a spell and makes blue fire appear, which destroys the dragon while healing everyone else. Instead of Iliana, Keller gets promised to Galen because the witches and shapeshifters can be on the same side if they do a blood cross between Iliana and Keller.\n\n===''Strange Fate''===\nBook ten (not yet published) reportedly follows a sixteen-year-old girl named Sarah Strange, who has mysterious dreams of Night World inhabitants. It is intended to be the conclusion of the Night World series, leading up to the apocalypse. On January 22, 2012, L.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Smith claimed at her website under the \"Burning Fan Questions\" section \"shows the endgame for nearly all the main characters you have seen in the Night World series as Ash helps them. It tells of Sarah Strange and her two soulmates (one of whom is the last Wild Power, Kierlan Drache).\n\n==The Soulmate Principle==\nIn the series, the soulmate principle is the theory that if two people are connected by a silver cord (which can be seen only by the soulmates), then they are soulmates. Since they are soulmates they can not live without each other. The silver cord can also be used by a person to sense what the soulmate is feeling. In ''Black Dawn'', Maggie senses Delos's feelings by focusing on their silver cord. The strength of the soulmate connection differs.\n\nSoulmates often discover their connection by accident, when the soulmates kiss or touch, or when one of them drinks the other's blood. In ''Secret Vampire'', Poppy and James have been friends for years but realize they are soulmates only when James drinks Poppy's blood. In ''Daughters of Darkness'', Mary-Lynnette and Ash each feel an electric jolt when they first shake hands. In ''The Chosen'', Rashel's bare hand brushes Quinn's, and they both receive a shivering jolt. A soulmate also has the ability to completely enter his/her soulmate's mind. When this occurs, their minds are forcibly opened to each other and each can explore the other's memories, thoughts, and feelings freely. In ''Huntress'', it is revealed that memories can be blocked, but any lapse in concentration or excessive time in a soulmate's mind will remove the blockages.\n\n==Overview of Species==\n===Vampire===\n\nThe vampires of ''Night World'' are different from conventional literature as well as those established in [[The Vampire Diaries (novel series)|''The Vampire Diaries'']] novels. The main difference being the two distinctions of blood drinkers: the ''[[Lamia]]'' - pureblood or \"born vampires\" - and the \"made vampires\" who were turned.<ref>Deborah Wilson Overstreet, ''Not your mother's vampire: vampires in young adult fiction'' (2006), 57.</ref> The lamia behave more human than made vampires. They age and can eat food as well as reproduce, but can suspend their aging process at will and become [[Immortality|immortal]]. However, if they resume aging after a significant number of years, they will immediately age to match their \"true\" age.\n\nMade vampires are those created through a blood exchange between a human and either a lamia or another made vampire. Made vampires are infertile, unaging, and can only drink blood. Because older adults cannot survive the transition, made vampires are quite youthful in appearance. If a made vampire in transition does not receive enough blood from their sire while being turned, they will resurrect as a ravenous [[ghoul]] upon their imminent death. These mindless creatures are driven only by their compulsion to hunt and feed on the flesh and blood of the living.\n\nAll vampires possess supernatural powers of strength and speed as well as potentially developing [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. Sunlight weakens them, but will not kill them. Their bloodlust is rooted not in hunger but in their need to breathe as their own blood cells cannot carry oxygen. Although they do possess great healing abilities as well as being impervious to all diseases and poisons, vampires can be killed by fire or a wooden stake through the heart. They cannot [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into bats or be harmed by crucifixes or garlic and can enter without being invited.\n\nThe original vampire was a powerful witch named Maya. Obsessed with eternal youth, she used her magics to become the first immortal by drinking the blood of infants. Her son, Red Fern, is the ancestor of the lamia. The first made vampire was a boy from Maya's tribe named Thierry. As she is the purest vampire in existence, Maya possesses abilities unknown to her descendants. This includes the ability to shapeshift into a large batlike creature similar to many fictional vampires. She also retains her ability to access magical forces and practice witchcraft.\n\nDespite their genealogical roots in witchcraft, vampire society is patriarchal. Lamia of the Redfern family possess a greater concentration of witch blood and are thus able to tap into the same forces as their foremother to perform a \"kinship ceremony\" for familial strengthening. The symbol for the lamia is not depicted in the books. Lamia such as James Rasmussen are known to carry the image of a black [[Iris (plant)|iris]] - which is the symbol for the Black Iris Club, a popular night club for the denizens of the Night World. The symbol for made vampires is a black [[rose]].\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''''Lamia'' '''\n\n'''Ash Redfern''' - One of the leading characters in the second book of the series, Ash is described as having ash-blonde hair with ever-changing eyes (which he inherits) depending on his mood. He is a very arrogant and lazy \"bad boy\" who prefers to play with humans and is very selfish; though all of that changes when he meets Mary-Lynnette Carter, his soulmate, whom he loves enough to change his entire life. Ash leaves at the end of the book to make up for his past mistakes, planning to return to Mary-Lynnette afterwards.\n\n'''James Rasmussen''' - The second lead character in the first book, James has grey eyes and brown hair and is described as looking like James Dean by his soulmate. He is considered a \"bad boy\" in his school but acts like that to hide his true nature. He has a new girlfriend every few weeks, but uses them as blood donors. When he is near his best friend, and later, soulmate, Poppy North, he is gentle and deeply cares about her, even though she is human. His cousin is Ash Redfern, to whom he is related through his mother.\n\n'''Jezebel \"Jez\" Redfern''' - Jez is the protagonist of the seventh book ''Huntress''. Believing she is a full vampire, she is a leader of a Night World group that hunts humans at the beginning of the book. She later realizes that she is half-human: her mother was a human and her father was a vampire. She has long, curly, flaming red hair and silvery-blue eyes. She is described as being stubborn and hotheaded by her soulmate, Morgead Blackthorn, the second leader of her group. She is a cousin of James and Ash. Jez is the first Wild Power.\n\n'''Morgead Blackthorn''' - Morgead is Jez's soulmate and is seventeen years old. He is conceited, hotheaded, stubborn, and power-hungry. Morgead is the second leader of the group that hunts humans. His mother left when he was young and he tries to hide the loneliness this made him feel. He has gem-green eyes and dark hair. He hates humans, though later joins Circle Daybreak when he realises that his best friend and soulmate is half-human, as well as a Wild Power.\n\n'''Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern''' - Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are the sisters of Ash and the blood sisters of Mary-Lynnette and Mark Carter. They run away from a small island to Briar Creek in order to live as normal people rather than be controlled. In the process they meet Mary-Lynnette Carter, who in fact turns out to be Ash's soulmate, and her brother, Mark, whom Jade claims is her soulmate. Rowan is the oldest of the family and is gentle and caring with chestnut-coloured hair and sweet brown eyes. Kestrel is the opposite, with long, golden hair and golden eyes. She is described by Mary-Lynnette as a real Night World member, as she enjoys hunting and acts carelessly. Jade is the youngest sister and has long, silvery-blonde hair, which she uses to hide her face; people take this as shyness, but it is really an act she uses to hide her inner feelings. She has green eyes and is bubbly.\n\n'''Delos Redfern''' - Delos is the unknown prince of the secret Dark Kingdom and is the great grandson of Hunter Redfern. He is very strong and is the second Wild Power. Unlike the other Wild Powers, he discovered his powers as a child, causing his father to view him as a secret weapon rather than as his son. Delos hates humans and mixing with others, and even though people think of him as a selfish boy, he feels vulnerable on the inside. He has yellow eyes and black hair and is the soulmate of a human girl called Maggie Neely, the protagonist of the eighth book ''Black Dawn''.\n\n'''''Made vampires'''''\n\n'''John Quinn''' - Quinn is the cold-hearted heir of Hunter Redfern. He is unsympathetic to humans, despite the fact that he used to be one, until he meets his soulmate Rashel Jordan, who happens to be the most feared vampire hunter in ''Night World'' history. Quinn was born in Boston in the 1600s and was turned by Hunter Redfern after falling in love with Redfern's daughter, Dove. He was turned without consent, and is scared, confused and angry when he wakes up in Redfern's cabin. He escapes and goes to his father for help, but Quinn's father tries to kill him, accidentally staking Dove instead. After that, Quinn thinks of himself only as a vampire. Quinn has black hair and black eyes.\n\n'''Poppy North''' - Poppy is the protagonist of the first book ''Secret Vampire''. She is James Rasmussen's childhood friend and later his soulmate. They have been best friends since they were four years old. Poppy is stubborn and quite hyper, as well as curious about the world. She always believed she would marry James when they grew up and secretly loves him. She has coppery curly hair with green eyes and is the twin sister of Phillip North. She was turned into a vampire by James after they discovered she was dying of stage three pancreatic cancer. Her twin Phillip was opposed to this plan. However, he allowed it when he realized it was the only way to save his sister. Poppy and her brother are found to be lost witches from their father's side of the family.\n\n'''Thierry Descouedres''' - Thierry holds the title \"Lord of the Night World\" and was the first made vampire. He was the second vampire in existence after Maya. He found his soulmate, an Old Soul named Hannah, soon after he was turned and has spent the thousands of years he has been alive in a continuous cycle of waiting for her to be reincarnated, searching for her, then having her die before her seventeenth birthday. It is a repetition of an ill-fated accident that happened during her first lifetime. She was accidentally killed by Thierry that first time and intentionally murdered by Maya in every lifetime after. It is a cycle he is desperate to break.\n\nThierry has dark eyes and mid-long blond hair which he wears in a ponytail. He is the leader of Circle Daybreak and plans to recruit all the Wild Powers in order to win the final battle. He was changed by Maya in the stone age because she felt she was in love with him, the same reason she repeatedly kills Thierry's soulmate through all of her lifetimes. His original name was Theorn, and he belonged to the witch tribe led by Maya's sister Hellewise.\n\n===Witch===\n\nThe witches of the ''Night World'' novels are largely based on the [[Modern Paganism|neo-pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] as well as the [[Goddess movement|Goddess Movement]]. They are a [[matriarchy]] which traces its lineage to the first tribe of sorceresses ruled by [[Hecate]] Witch-Queen and later her daughter, Hellewise Hearth-Woman. All witches are considered \"daughters of Hellewise\" by virtue of having inherited her teachings. However, the Harman family are direct descents of Hellewise through the women in their line. The first vampire - Maya - was Hellewise's sister and thus all vampires share witch blood.<ref name=\"Spellbinder\">Spellbinder</ref>\n\nWitch society is composed of \"Circles\" to which all witches belong. Those who take to heart Hellewise's bidding to \"harm none\" (the [[Wiccan Rede]]) belong to Circle Twilight, while Circle Midnight is made up of witches who practice darker magic. The final and newest circle, Circle Daybreak, is dedicated to protecting all life. Throughout the entire Night World series you will see new members joining and will briefly encounter characters from the entire series. They are mostly separate from the other two circles and are like the secret group of the supernatural community. Most members have found refuge with their soulmates here. The Inner Circle is a [[coven]] of the nine most magically talented witches, whom Thea Harman calls \"the witch geniuses, the prodigies and the sages, the far-seers, the teachers, the policy-makers\"<ref>Spellbinder p.189</ref> in ''Spellbinder''. The most important of these are the triad of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Maiden, Mother, and Crone]], positions which during the events of the books are held respectively by Aradia, The Maiden; [[Cybele]], The Mother; and Grandma Harman, The Crone. All witches are answerable to the Inner Circle before the Night World council, although an association probably exists between them, but this isn't specified.\n\nA third renegade Circle also exists, known as Circle Daybreak, first mentioned in ''Spellbinder'', which promotes the teaching of magic to humans and peace between the races. This circle used to exist alongside the other two but was banned due to the persecution of witches during the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|Burning Times]]. Circle Daybreak is kept secret from the rest of the Night World, although a few suspect its renewed existence. During the events leading up to the [[apocalypse]], the witches opt to leave the Night World and join Circle Daybreak, as they want to help save the world, whereas the Night World council and most of the vampires want to take over and enslave the other races.<ref name=\"Black Dawn\">Black Dawn</ref>\n\nWitches practice [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] with the aid of [[herbs]], [[gemstones]], [[effigies]], and [[incantations]], all of which may be used in a spell; they worship the Goddess in her many manifestations and celebrate [[Samhain]] and probably other festivals on the [[Wheel of the Year]].<ref name=\"Enchantress\">Enchantress</ref> Their magic is [[innate]] and does not always require external aids, although these can accentuate their power.<ref name=\"Black Dawn\"/> Human [[psychics]] in the series are \"lost witches\" who are unaware of their true descent.<ref>Witchlight</ref>\n\nIdentifying symbols for Night World witches are the black [[dahlia]] and the crescent [[moon]] with three stars.<ref name=\"Enchantress\"/> The symbol for \"lost witches\" is a black [[Viola (plant)|violet]]. Iron is mentioned in Daughters of Darkness as their [[poison]].\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''Thea Harman''' - Thea is a sweet girl compared to her cousin Blaise and is the main protagonist of the third book, ''Spellbinder''. She has long, blonde hair and sweet brown eyes. She wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up, and even though she doesn't tell humans about her nature, she still wants to help them. She has a human soulmate, Eric Ross, and is a cross-cousin of the Redferns. She is the persona of Hellewise, one of the two original daughters of Hecate Witch-Queen.\n\n'''Blaise Harman''' - Blaise is one of the lead characters in the third book. She is a witch royal who is described as being a girl who bewitches boys for sport and hates humans. She is a cross-cousin of the Redferns and the cousin (although they were raised like sisters) of Thea Harman. She has long, dark hair and smoky, grey eyes. She represents the persona of Maya, the original vampire and daughter of Hecate.\n\n'''Sylvia Weald''' - Sylvia is one of the characters in ''Black Dawn''. She is dating Maggie Neely's brother, whom she changes into a shapeshifter. She sides with Hunter Redfern and binds Delos's powers before the maiden of witches, Aradia, changes her mind. She is killed by one of Hunter's guardians seconds after she releases Delos.\n\n'''''Lost witches'''''\n\n'''Gillian Lennox (Harman)''' - Gillian is told of her heritage by her dead cousin who comes back as an \"Angel\". She is a petite girl with short silver-blonde hair and violet eyes. She is a distant cousin of Thea and Blaise as well as the Redferns. She has a human soulmate, David Blackburn, with whom she joins Circle Daybreak. Gillian is descended for the lost Harman twins, Elspeth and Emmeth.\n\n'''Iliana Dominick (Harman)''' - Unbeknownst to Iliana, she is secretly from the Harman line and the third Wild Power. She is also prophesied to be the Witch Child. She spends most of the book denying that she is a witch, but eventually accepts her fate. As the Witch Child, she was supposed to marry the Prince of the Shapeshifters, but she refused.\n\n'''Poppy North''' - Poppy was a lost witch along with her twin brother, Phillip North, and dying of pancreatic cancer before her best friend, James, turns her into a vampire. James figures out that she is a witch when she dreams of Ash before they even meet, develops an extremely strong telepathic ability, and screams to James while inside her dream about Ash. When she screams in her dream, three people hear it: James, Phillip, and her dad. Poppy has curly red hair and emerald green eyes.\n\n'''Phillip North''' - Phillip is the twin brother of Poppy North. He is extremely straitlaced and responsible. He opposes Poppy and James's relationship, because of James's reputation with girls. When he learns about his real heritage, he chooses to live as a human, though he does keep in contact with Poppy and knows about the other ''Night World'' creatures. Phillip is tall, smart, and athletic, with blond hair and green eyes.\n\n'''Gary Fargeon \"Angel\"''' - Not much is known about Gary because he died when he was seventeen in a car accident. He is descended from the lost Harman twins, and he had recently discovered he was a witch before he died. He is frequently described as an impossibly beautiful teenage boy, although his exact description is never given (though he does have the violet eyes that the Harmans are known for as well as sunshine blond hair.) He wants to rejoin the world of the living and develops a dangerous plan. In the end, Gary's soul finally rests in peace with a little help from his cousin Gillian.\n\n===Werewolf===\n\nA werewolf is a type of shapeshifter. As no main characters in any of the novels have been werewolves (Lupe Acevedo in ''Soulmate'' was only half-werewolf and she was a minor character; and there was barely anything known about Jeremy Lovett from ''Daughters of Darkness''), less is known about this species than others. In ''Night World'', werewolves (sometimes called 'wolves or just wolves) can transform from human to [[wolf]] (and vice versa) at will. In ''Daughters of Darkness'', werewolves are described as wolves that take human form, rather than the reverse. This means that they have animal instincts and urges, even in human form. This is all contrary to modern [[werewolf]] lore, in which a werewolf is basically a normal person but undergoes an involuntary transformation. Though it is not stated explicitly, it appears that, like vampires, werewolves can be born as such and can also be made.\n\nUnlike vampires, werewolves must kill every time they feed because they need to consume organs. Thus, Night World law states that werewolves can kill and eat only animals. In the Night World, werewolves are treated as [[second-class citizen]]s and are the victims of prejudice and racism. As in modern werewolf lore, ''Night World'' werewolves are harmed by silver. The symbol for werewolves is a black [[foxglove]]. They are described by other members of the Night World (such as James) as having low intelligence levels.\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''Jeremy Lovett''' - Jeremy is seen in the second book ''Daughter of Darkness'' and is best friends with Mary-Lynette Carter, the protagonist of the book. Mary-Lynette thinks of him as a vulnerable boy since he doesn't have anyone to live with. However, this is not entirely true. He is a territorial werewolf who doesn't obey Night World law and kills his uncle as well as a hiker in the woods. He fell in love with Mary-Lynette and tried to turn her into a werewolf. When Ash Redfern attempted to stop him, Jeremy attacked. Mary-Lynette killed Jeremy to save her soulmate Ash's life. Jeremy's unusual behavior while in werewolf form is why the local creek is named \"Mad Dog Creek\".\n\n'''Lupe Acevedo''' - Lupe is different from any other werewolf described and seen in the series. She is smart and one of Thierry's most trusted agents. She is half-human, half-werewolf. Her birth led to her father killed for breaking the law (human/werewolf offspring are illegal). Thierry saved her. She in turn saves Hannah when she is attacked by other werewolves in the sixth book ''Soulmate''. She has silvery-brown hair with yellow eyes.\n\n===Shapeshifter===\n\nShapeshifters appear later in the series; no main character is a shapeshifter until the ninth book, ''Witchlight''. Before that, only allusions to shapeshifters are made, usually in the context of a Night Person explaining the Night World to a human and listing the Night World species. In ''Witchlight'', the protagonist, Keller, is a shapeshifter. She has the ability to change into the form of a panther at will.\n\nSome history about shapeshifters is given in ''Witchlight''. Shapeshifters had control of the world long before witches and vampires. Their leaders were known as \"Dragons\", beings that could change into the form of any animal as long as they have had physical contact to that animal (normally shapeshifters can change into only one pre-determined animal form). To kill a dragon you must remove its horns. The more horns it has, the more powerful it is. The witches rose to power and put the dragons to sleep, except for the youngest one, the dragon princess, who was only 4 at the time. The witches left her awake and raised her, carefully watching over her. All of the ruling house of shapeshifters are descended from her. The descendants of the ruling house have the ability to choose what animal they will become, but this choice is permanent.\n\nIn the early books of the series, werewolves and shapeshifters are described as separate groups or races of the Night World. For example, in ''Daughters of Darkness'', Night World is described as comprising vampires, \"witches and werewolves and shapeshifters, too\".<ref>Daughters of Darkness, p.125</ref> Though never explicitly stated, the later books tend to treat werewolves as a subset of shapeshifters. In ''Witchlight'', when Keller tells the history of shapeshifters, she lists felines, bears, eagles, and wolves as groups or clans within the shapeshifter race.<ref>Witchlight, p.140</ref> The description of both werewolves and shapeshifters as second-class citizens also supports the notion that werewolves are a subset, or one family, of shapeshifters. However, in ''Witchlight'' there is no real mention of Keller feeding or abiding by the rules for werewolves described in ''Daughters of Darkness''.\n\nThe symbol for shapeshifters is a black lily. The type differs, for example tigers use tiger lilies.\n\n====Main Characters ====\n\n'''Raksha Keller''' - Keller is the protagonist of the ninth book ''Witchlight'' and leads Circle Daybreak's best Ops Team. She prefers being called by her last name as her first name means \"demon\". She is strong and secretive and she never shows her inner feelings to anyone. She is half shapeshifter, half human, and can turn into a panther. She prefers to work hard and repay Circle Daybreak for raising her after she was abandoned. When she was discovered as a baby, she was in human form, but with a panther's ears and tail. Keller has long, black hair with silvery-grey eyes and is the only shapeshifter that has taken a main role in the series. She is the soulmate of the Prince of the Shapeshifters, Galen Drache, and the blood sister of Iliana Dominick-Harman. On the author's website, we learn that she is Rashel Jordan's fraternal twin.\n\n'''Galen Drache''' - Galen is the Prince of the first House of the Shapeshifters and the soulmate of Raksha Keller. He is gentle, loving, and caring, like Iliana, and isn't a fighter, but he does try his best when Keller is about to get killed by a dragon. He was supposed to marry Iliana, but when Iliana realizes that Galen is Keller's soulmate, she tells them that their love is something no one could ever interfere with. He has golden hair with green-golden eyes. As a Prince, he gets to choose his animal shape and becomes a leopard at the end of the book to save Keller.\n\n'''Miles Neely''' - Miles is a made shapeshifter who can turn into a falcon and is the older brother of Maggie Neely. He got turned into a shapeshifter by his girlfriend, Sylvia Weald, a witch. He and Maggie bear a strong resemblance to each other. He has brown eyes and auburn hair.\n\n===Human===\n\nWhile the series is largely supernaturally-centered, humans do play a major role both as supporting characters and occasionally main characters or antagonists. Humans - or ''Homo sapiens'' (Latin: \"''wise men''\") - are the reigning species of the known planet with few magical attributes. Humans have a main role as some of the protagonists in the series. Due in part both to their status as the dominant species as well as their largely adverse affects on the Earth, the Night World has endeavored to keep their existence a secret from humanity. The approach of the Apocalypse is due to the Night World's attempts at enslaving mankind.\n \nWhile humans innately possess little to no paranormal attributes, they still possess undying souls subject to the Soulmate Principle as well as possibly being reincarnated over the span of centuries or more. These reborn humans are referred to as ''Old Souls'' within the Night World. Because of their relative impotence in relation to the predatory prowess of supernatural creatures, humans are a preferred food source for werewolves and vampires. Humans are also able to be converted into made vampires through a blood exchange and conceive children with a witch.\n\n====Main Characters ====\n\n'''Mary-Lynnette Carter''' - Mary-Lynnette is the protagonist in ''Daughter of Darkness''. She is the older sister of Mark Carter, becomes a blood sister with the Redfern girls, and is the soulmate of Ash Redfern. Mary-Lynnette is an astronomy lover who spends her time star-watching at night and is more of a night person than a day person. She is curious about everything and admires [[Nancy Drew]], often wondering what she would do in her situation. She is nicknamed Mare and is very protective of Mark, feeling responsible for him. She often displays an ironic sense of humor, is very strong, and talks to herself a lot. Even though she and Ash are soulmates, she doesn't follow him, but tells him to fix his past mistakes then come back. Mary-Lynnette has long brown hair with blue eyes. When she first meets Ash, she can't stop kicking him in the shins, which is her way of suppressing the urge to kiss him, so everyone thinks she has gone mad.\n\n'''Mark Carter''' - Mark is Jade Redfern's soulmate, the younger brother of Mary-Lynette, and blood brother to the Redfern sisters. He is very shy and doesn't like to mix with others, but when he sees Jade for the first time, he falls in love. With Jade's help, he convinces the other two Redfern sisters not to kill him and Mary-Lynette. He has brown hair with blue eyes.\n\n'''Eric Ross''' - Eric is one of the lead characters in ''Spellbinder'' and is a gentle boy whom everyone likes. He is shy and timid, yet he is one of the most popular boys in his school, with his sandy-colored hair and grey flecked-green eyes. He becomes Blaise's next target when she and Thea Harman move to town because he isn't bewitched by her and he falls in love with Thea. His and Thea's love risks her expulsion from the Night World as she breaks a very strong law that could end not only their lives but everyone else's.\n\n'''David Blackburn''' - David is one of the lead characters in ''Dark Angel''. He is the most popular boy in his school and is the boy Gillian Lennox had a secret crush on since the time she first saw him when she was twelve. David has brown hair with brown eyes and has tan skin. He reveals he loves Gillian when they go to a party after he hears of an affair between his longtime girlfriend, Tanya, and another boy.\n\n'''Rashel Jordan''' - Rashel, also known as \"The Cat\" by vampires, is the most feared vampire hunter in the record of Night World. She uses the phrase \"This Kitten Has Claws\" when killing vampires, in memory of her mother, who used to call her \"kitten,\" and makes a mark on her victim's forehead resembling a cat's claws. She is the protagonist of ''The Chosen''. When she was five, her four-year-old friend, Timmy, was kidnapped and changed into a vampire and her mother was killed by Hunter. This is the main reason she becomes a vampire hunter which leads her to meet her cold-hearted soulmate, Quinn, whom she originally wants to kill. She later hunts only \"bad vampires,\" and she and Quinn are known as the best fighters when they join Circle Daybreak. On the author's website, it is revealed that she is in fact half-shapeshifter and is the twin sister of Raksha Keller. Rashel has long black hair which is tied back, and piercing green eyes.\n\n'''Hannah Snow''' - Hannah is the protagonist of ''Soulmate'' and an Old Soul who has been reincarnated since the Stone Age when she first saw her soulmate Thierry. Thierry was known as Theorn at that time, while she was known as Hana of the Three Rivers. In each of her past lives, Hannah is killed by the first vampire, Maya Redfern, due to her loving Thierry. She has a birth mark on her right cheek (which is a psychic brand from the time Thierry accidentally killed her), long blonde hair, and grey eyes. She is a sweet girl and is known as the Lady of Circle Daybreak. In one of the short stories in the author's website, it is said that she has gone off to fight in the apocalypse.\n\n'''Hugh Davis''' - Hugh is one of the characters in ''Huntress''. He is a wakened Old Soul, which is extremely rare. Unlike most Old Souls, he remembers all of his past lives. According to Jez, he becomes smarter and more clearheaded with each life, and also more gentle. Hugh is a Daybreaker, and is the one to trust Jez enough to let her join Circle Daybreak. He is also the person who talks her into going to get the Wild Power from Morgead. Even though he isn't a fighter, he proves that he is somewhat capable when he fends off a werewolf by himself. Hugh is described as having longish light hair and gray eyes and is muscled but compact. It is hinted that he likes Jez as more than a good friend.\n\n'''Maggie Neely''' - Maggie is the protagonist of the eighth book ''Black Dawn'' and is mentioned in a witches' prophecy as the \"deliverer\". Maggie is described as being careless and loves playing soccer. She is a strong girl who is admired by the witches and the only one who is able to handle Delos Redfern, her soulmate. Maggie has shoulder-length auburn hair with brown eyes. She is seventeen and is a Circle Daybreak member.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602082403/http://bookalicio.us/2009/03/an-interview-with-l-j-smith/ An interview with L.J.

J. Smith (author)|L. J. Smith]]. The series presents a story in which [[vampire]]s, [[witch]]es, [[Werewolf|werewolves]], and [[shapeshifter]]s live among humans without their knowledge. These supernatural races make up a secret society known as the Night World, which enforces two fundamental laws to prevent discovery: 1) Never allow humans to gain knowledge of the Night World's existence and, 2) Never fall in love with a human.\n\nEach volume of the series follows a different protagonist (always a teenage girl) who must face various challenges involving love, the \"[[soulmate]] principle\" and the Night World's strict code. In the first six novels, the plot focuses on the protagonist discovering her soulmate and the danger which ensues. In the seventh book of the series, the concept of an impending millennial [[apocalypse]] is introduced. Although the theme of the \"[[soulmate]] principle\" continues to be present, the later books' plots focus on the search for four \"Wild Powers\" who, according to an ancient [[prophecy]], will either save the world or aid in its destruction. Books from the series appeared on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]] for children's books in 2008 and 2009.\n\nThe concluding book in the series, ''Strange Fate'', has been delayed for over two decades now, and the release date is currently unconfirmed, with various websites stating different release dates going all the way up to 2030.\n\n==Publishing History==\nThe first nine books in the ''Night World'' series were originally published in 1996\u20131998 by [[Simon & Schuster]]. The release of the tenth and final book, ''Strange Fate'', was put on hold when L.J. Smith took a hiatus from writing in 1999. In 2008, the nine ''Night World'' books were reprinted in three omnibus volumes.\n\nFor the 2008 reprint, some edits were made in an attempt at modernisation, such as the replacement of the word \"walkman\" with \"iPod\" in ''Daughters of Darkness''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">L. J. Smith (Reprint) Daughters of Darkness</ref> These edits were not made consistently: there are references to iPods on one page of a novel, followed by references to the previously used \"walkman\" on the next page.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\n==Series Summary==\n==='' Secret Vampire''===\nPoppy North, a normal teenage girl, is diagnosed with terminal [[pancreatic cancer]]. Her best friend James Rasmussen, secretly a vampire and her soulmate, rushes to find a cure, knowing that less than three percent of patients with pancreatic cancer survive. James decides to turn Poppy into a vampire in order to save her life. After Poppy is turned, James's cousin, Ash, abducts Poppy and takes her to Las Vegas where they attend a party held by the Lord of the Night World so that Ash can turn her in (Poppy is an \"illegal\" vampire). James manages to save her, and it is revealed that Poppy has every right to know about the Night World because she is actually a \"lost\" witch, a witch unaware of her magical heritage.James and Poppy set out to find Poppy's father supposing he could help them.\n\n===''Daughters of Darkness''===\nVampire sisters Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern escape from their homeland on an island in the Night World to live with their Aunt Opal on Burdock Farm. Things take a turn for the worse when the girls discover their aunt has been killed and that their ruthless brother Ash has followed them to bring them home or kill them. Meanwhile, the sisters and Ash meet the Carters next door, and Ash, who hates humans, discovers that Mary-Lynette Carter, a human, is his soulmate and falls deeply in love with her. Although he is hesitant at first and they don't get along well, he cannot help his feelings and later proclaims his love for her. Jade is dating Mary-Lynnette's brother, Mark, her soulmate. In the end, Mary-Lynnette's friend, Jeremy, who turns out to be a werewolf, tries to kill Ash, Kestrel, Jade, and Rowan for hunting in his territory, and also tries to turn Mary-Lynette into a werewolf. With fire and a silver dagger/knife, Mary-Lynnette kills Jeremy, and Ash leaves to cover up the events. The sisters plan to stay at Burdock Farm while Mary-Lynnette waits for Ash's return after sending him away for a year so she can have some time to think about their love and whether she wants to turn into a vampire!\n\n===''Spellbinder'' (also published under the title ''Enchantress'')===\nThea and Blaise Harman are witch cousins and are as close as sisters. There's only one slight difference: Thea uses white magic and Blaise uses black magic. Blaise uses her charm and magic to make boys do anything for her, including cutting themselves with razors and burning down schools. When the cousins start attending a new school and Thea heals Eric Ross from a snake bite, Thea and Eric realize they are soulmates. Blaise is jealous that Eric has chosen Thea and is worried that Thea is breaking Night World law to be with Eric. In a desperate attempt to protect Eric from Blaise, Thea accidentally releases an angry spirit that kills one of Blaise's admirers. Thea and Eric try their best to capture the angry spirit by luring it away from the school. But Thea is wanted by the Circle because she is not allowed to use that kind of magic, as are Blaise and Thea's friend Dani. Thea manages to tell them that Eric is in trouble because the angry spirit is with him. She manages to get to Eric before he is killed and puts the spirit back where it came from. The Circle tells her that she cannot love a human so she chooses to drink the Cup of [[Lethe]], a drink that erases a part of your memory, to erase her and Eric's knowledge of the Night World. However, Blaise had switched the drink with iced tea, so neither forgets that the Night World exists.\n\n===''Dark Angel''===\nAfter a near-death experience in a forest, Gillian Lennox is brought back to life by a being who calls himself \"Angel\". He comes back with her and helps her change her life, making her the most popular girl at school and uniting her with her long-time crush. Everything is perfect until Angel starts making strange requests and people start getting hurt, and Gillian learns about her heritage. She is a descendant of one of the lost Harman babies. She learns that Angel is a spirit with unfinished business. She learns that Angel's real name is Gary Fargeon, and he is her cousin, a descendant of another lost Harman baby. His unfinished business is that he accidentally killed a girl when she disturbed a spell he was casting. She helps him cross over, leaving Gillian with her long-time crush and soulmate David Blackburn.\n\n===''The Chosen''===\nAfter witnessing the murder of her mother and her younger brother, Timmy, by a ruthless vampire when she was five years old, Rashel Jordan becomes a vampire hunter known as The Cat, dedicating her life to killing all vampires one by one until she finds the one that killed her mother. One night she meets her soul mate, John Quinn, a cold-hearted vampire who turns out to be her one and only soulmate. After investigating a series of strange abductions in her area, she infiltrates a vampire enclave, rescues the girls, and plans to kill any vampires she can. Quinn saves Rashel from a werewolf and thus declares his love for her and try to attempt turning her into a vampire to get married to her.But later they discover that Hunter Redfern is behind the blood feast, whom is also responsible for death of her mother and younger brother when she was five. She finds out that Timmy was not killed but instead he was turned into a vampire at the age of four and raised by Hunter. Rashel's friend Nyala, a vengeful, unbalanced vampire hunter, sets the house on fire but Quinn saves Rashel, Timmy, and Nyala and Rashel's anger and bitterness for all vampires dissolves. Rashel and Quinn decide to stay together and join Circle Daybreak.\n\n===''Soulmate''===\nHannah Snow has been having nightmares and keeps finding notes written in her own handwriting, warning her that she is in danger and will die before her seventeenth birthday. Worried about her sanity, she begins hypnosis with a psychologist, Paul Winfield, going back through time and reliving her past lives, connecting to each of them and discovering that her soulmate is Thierry Descoudres, a vampire and a Lord of the Night World. Thierry and his enemy Maya have found Hannah, and Hannah's life is at stake because Maya wants Thierry for herself. Maya was the person who made Thierry into a vampire. Thierry was the first made vampire, and Maya was a witch but wanted to be immortal, so she turned herself into a vampire by using a spell and drinking the blood of four babies. At first Hannah thinks that Thierry was the one who killed her in her past lives, but it was actually Maya when she was in her shapeshifted form, disguising herself as Thierry. Hannah goes to his house and meets the other members of Circle Daybreak, a group of humans, vampires, wolves, witches, and shapeshifters, all of whom are hoping for peace between Night World and the human race. Hannah is captured by Maya, who attempts to turn Hannah into a vampire so that when she kills Hannah, her cycle of reincarnation will end because she will no longer have a soul. Instead, Hannah manages to kill Maya. Hannah decides to remain human and live her life until death, after which Thierry will wait for her to return again.\n\n===''Huntress''===\nJezabel \"Jez\" Redfern thinks she is a full vampire, but soon finds out she is in fact half-human. She runs away from her gang and Uncle Bracken to live with her human relatives. She only goes back to the vampires when Circle Daybreak asks her to go on a dangerous mission: to fight her worst enemy, best friend, and soulmate, Morgead Blackthorn, for the Wild Power. It turns out that the person thought to be the Wild Power is a fake. When she meets her friend Hugh, an Old Soul, Jez's annoying cousin Claire follows her and overhears everything. They are soon after attacked by two werewolves and a vampire. When she and Claire fall off the station platform onto the train tracks, Jez sees blue fire, the power of a Wild Power, and thinks Claire is the one. When she, Claire, Hugh, and Morgead are captured by Lily Redfern, who is in search of the Wild Power, Jez figures out the meaning of the prophecy: she is one of the Wild Powers, and her blood must be spilled to release the blue fire. Morgead convinces her not to let go and give up when she is staked by Lily and she does not die. Jez admits Morgead is her soul mate and they are made for each other.\n\n===''Black Dawn''===\nWhile trying to rescue her brother from his girlfriend, a witch named Sylvia, Maggie stumbles upon an old Night World colony, where she meets a vampire prince. He is Delos Redfern, who is not only the ruler of the Night World, but is one of the four Wild Powers, with the power of blue fire. Though he is cold towards her, he repeatedly saves her, each time stating that he won't help her again. The two soon learn that they are soulmates, though Delos refuses it and tells her to leave. Maggie does not, and remains in the Night World to find her brother. Delos's great-grandfather, Hunter Redfern, arrives to take over the kingdom with Delos's help. After arriving at the castle, against Delos's orders, Maggie convinces him to take her side. He does, realizing that Hunter is an enemy, though it takes a while for him to care for anyone else. Delos soon discovers that changing sides is useless, as his powers are bound by a spell, and he cannot fight against any of them. Maggie finds out that her brother was turned into a shapeshifting falcon by, Sylvia . Sylvia is killed by Hunter Redfern after she releases the spell binding Delos's powers. Hunter Redfern is presumably killed by Delos's use of blue fire. Maggie is happy to have found her brother and her soulmate. However, no one can rest yet because the witches have seceded from the Night World Council, leading to war between vampires and witches. Two Wild Powers have been found, and both are now on the side of Circle Daybreak. Only two more remain.\n\n===''Witchlight''===\nRaksha Keller and her team race to a mall to save the new Wild Power, Iliana Harman. The new Wild Power is destined to marry Galen Drache, a shapeshifter of the first house, so the shapeshifters will side with the witches and not the vampires. But when Keller learns that the Wild Power's betrothed, Galen Drache, is in fact her soulmate, she realizes that their love could destroy the world. Also, the Night World shapeshifters have been attacking humans often, and they have also killed the Crone of the witches, Grandma Harman. The Night World has a dragon that can turn into anything that it touches. Iliana's deaf friend, Jaime, is hosting a party, to be held on the same night as the ceremony that bonds the witches and shapeshifters. Iliana tries to use her powers to save Jaime when a car is going to hit her, but she can't activate the power. Based on that failure, Iliana assumes that she is not the Wild Power but agrees to pretend that she is the Wild Power and Witch Child so the ceremony will still go ahead. However, she says that she will only help if she can go to Jaime's party. Keller and the people who are protecting Iliana agree and go with her to protect her from the dragon. Before they go, they station guards all around the house. The night before the party, Keller and Galen stay up looking through scrolls that contain writing only shapeshifters can read, trying to find information about the dragon. They find out that dragons have horns and that if you cut them all off, they can no longer shapeshift. They also find out accidentally that they are soulmates, but Keller thinks they have to ignore it because he has to marry Iliana. At the party, Jaime's brother, Brett, tells Keller that Iliana's little brother has run away, and Iliana's mother is on the phone. Keller goes into Jaime's room, picks up the phone, and asks Brett to leave the room. When he does, she finds that there is no one on the other end of the phone. She tries to leave the room but the door is locked and she realises that the dragon was disguised as Brett. She shapeshifts into a panther, jumps out the window, and reenters the party to try to find Iliana. Iliana is nowhere to be found, so Keller asks the real Brett where she is. He tells her that she is in the basement. Keller runs through a tunnel and finds her friends and Iliana badly hurt. She attacks the dragon, who was disguised as Jaime, several times and removes three out of the five horns. Galen who has never acquired a shape yet and wants to be something small and peaceful turns into a leopard and removes another horn to save keller. Keller sees her witch friend whisper something to Iliana, and Iliana stands up. She chants a spell and makes blue fire appear, which destroys the dragon while healing everyone else. Instead of Iliana, Keller gets promised to Galen because the witches and shapeshifters can be on the same side if they do a blood cross between Iliana and Keller.\n\n===''Strange Fate''===\nBook ten (not yet published) reportedly follows a sixteen-year-old girl named Sarah Strange, who has mysterious dreams of Night World inhabitants. It is intended to be the conclusion of the Night World series, leading up to the apocalypse. On January 22, 2012, L.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Smith claimed at her website under the \"Burning Fan Questions\" section \"shows the endgame for nearly all the main characters you have seen in the Night World series as Ash helps them. It tells of Sarah Strange and her two soulmates (one of whom is the last Wild Power, Kierlan Drache).\n\n==The Soulmate Principle==\nIn the series, the soulmate principle is the theory that if two people are connected by a silver cord (which can be seen only by the soulmates), then they are soulmates. Since they are soulmates they can not live without each other. The silver cord can also be used by a person to sense what the soulmate is feeling. In ''Black Dawn'', Maggie senses Delos's feelings by focusing on their silver cord. The strength of the soulmate connection differs.\n\nSoulmates often discover their connection by accident, when the soulmates kiss or touch, or when one of them drinks the other's blood. In ''Secret Vampire'', Poppy and James have been friends for years but realize they are soulmates only when James drinks Poppy's blood. In ''Daughters of Darkness'', Mary-Lynnette and Ash each feel an electric jolt when they first shake hands. In ''The Chosen'', Rashel's bare hand brushes Quinn's, and they both receive a shivering jolt. A soulmate also has the ability to completely enter his/her soulmate's mind. When this occurs, their minds are forcibly opened to each other and each can explore the other's memories, thoughts, and feelings freely. In ''Huntress'', it is revealed that memories can be blocked, but any lapse in concentration or excessive time in a soulmate's mind will remove the blockages.\n\n==Overview of Species==\n===Vampire===\n\nThe vampires of ''Night World'' are different from conventional literature as well as those established in [[The Vampire Diaries (novel series)|''The Vampire Diaries'']] novels. The main difference being the two distinctions of blood drinkers: the ''[[Lamia]]'' - pureblood or \"born vampires\" - and the \"made vampires\" who were turned.<ref>Deborah Wilson Overstreet, ''Not your mother's vampire: vampires in young adult fiction'' (2006), 57.</ref> The lamia behave more human than made vampires. They age and can eat food as well as reproduce, but can suspend their aging process at will and become [[Immortality|immortal]]. However, if they resume aging after a significant number of years, they will immediately age to match their \"true\" age.\n\nMade vampires are those created through a blood exchange between a human and either a lamia or another made vampire. Made vampires are infertile, unaging, and can only drink blood. Because older adults cannot survive the transition, made vampires are quite youthful in appearance. If a made vampire in transition does not receive enough blood from their sire while being turned, they will resurrect as a ravenous [[ghoul]] upon their imminent death. These mindless creatures are driven only by their compulsion to hunt and feed on the flesh and blood of the living.\n\nAll vampires possess supernatural powers of strength and speed as well as potentially developing [[Telepathy|telepathic]] abilities. Sunlight weakens them, but will not kill them. Their bloodlust is rooted not in hunger but in their need to breathe as their own blood cells cannot carry oxygen. Although they do possess great healing abilities as well as being impervious to all diseases and poisons, vampires can be killed by fire or a wooden stake through the heart. They cannot [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into bats or be harmed by crucifixes or garlic and can enter without being invited.\n\nThe original vampire was a powerful witch named Maya. Obsessed with eternal youth, she used her magics to become the first immortal by drinking the blood of infants. Her son, Red Fern, is the ancestor of the lamia. The first made vampire was a boy from Maya's tribe named Thierry. As she is the purest vampire in existence, Maya possesses abilities unknown to her descendants. This includes the ability to shapeshift into a large batlike creature similar to many fictional vampires. She also retains her ability to access magical forces and practice witchcraft.\n\nDespite their genealogical roots in witchcraft, vampire society is patriarchal. Lamia of the Redfern family possess a greater concentration of witch blood and are thus able to tap into the same forces as their foremother to perform a \"kinship ceremony\" for familial strengthening. The symbol for the lamia is not depicted in the books. Lamia such as James Rasmussen are known to carry the image of a black [[Iris (plant)|iris]] - which is the symbol for the Black Iris Club, a popular night club for the denizens of the Night World. The symbol for made vampires is a black [[rose]].\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''''Lamia'' '''\n\n'''Ash Redfern''' - One of the leading characters in the second book of the series, Ash is described as having ash-blonde hair with ever-changing eyes (which he inherits) depending on his mood. He is a very arrogant and lazy \"bad boy\" who prefers to play with humans and is very selfish; though all of that changes when he meets Mary-Lynnette Carter, his soulmate, whom he loves enough to change his entire life. Ash leaves at the end of the book to make up for his past mistakes, planning to return to Mary-Lynnette afterwards.\n\n'''James Rasmussen''' - The second lead character in the first book, James has grey eyes and brown hair and is described as looking like James Dean by his soulmate. He is considered a \"bad boy\" in his school but acts like that to hide his true nature. He has a new girlfriend every few weeks, but uses them as blood donors. When he is near his best friend, and later, soulmate, Poppy North, he is gentle and deeply cares about her, even though she is human. His cousin is Ash Redfern, to whom he is related through his mother.\n\n'''Jezebel \"Jez\" Redfern''' - Jez is the protagonist of the seventh book ''Huntress''. Believing she is a full vampire, she is a leader of a Night World group that hunts humans at the beginning of the book. She later realizes that she is half-human: her mother was a human and her father was a vampire. She has long, curly, flaming red hair and silvery-blue eyes. She is described as being stubborn and hotheaded by her soulmate, Morgead Blackthorn, the second leader of her group. She is a cousin of James and Ash. Jez is the first Wild Power.\n\n'''Morgead Blackthorn''' - Morgead is Jez's soulmate and is seventeen years old. He is conceited, hotheaded, stubborn, and power-hungry. Morgead is the second leader of the group that hunts humans. His mother left when he was young and he tries to hide the loneliness this made him feel. He has gem-green eyes and dark hair. He hates humans, though later joins Circle Daybreak when he realises that his best friend and soulmate is half-human, as well as a Wild Power.\n\n'''Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade Redfern''' - Rowan, Kestrel, and Jade are the sisters of Ash and the blood sisters of Mary-Lynnette and Mark Carter. They run away from a small island to Briar Creek in order to live as normal people rather than be controlled. In the process they meet Mary-Lynnette Carter, who in fact turns out to be Ash's soulmate, and her brother, Mark, whom Jade claims is her soulmate. Rowan is the oldest of the family and is gentle and caring with chestnut-coloured hair and sweet brown eyes. Kestrel is the opposite, with long, golden hair and golden eyes. She is described by Mary-Lynnette as a real Night World member, as she enjoys hunting and acts carelessly. Jade is the youngest sister and has long, silvery-blonde hair, which she uses to hide her face; people take this as shyness, but it is really an act she uses to hide her inner feelings. She has green eyes and is bubbly.\n\n'''Delos Redfern''' - Delos is the unknown prince of the secret Dark Kingdom and is the great grandson of Hunter Redfern. He is very strong and is the second Wild Power. Unlike the other Wild Powers, he discovered his powers as a child, causing his father to view him as a secret weapon rather than as his son. Delos hates humans and mixing with others, and even though people think of him as a selfish boy, he feels vulnerable on the inside. He has yellow eyes and black hair and is the soulmate of a human girl called Maggie Neely, the protagonist of the eighth book ''Black Dawn''.\n\n'''''Made vampires'''''\n\n'''John Quinn''' - Quinn is the cold-hearted heir of Hunter Redfern. He is unsympathetic to humans, despite the fact that he used to be one, until he meets his soulmate Rashel Jordan, who happens to be the most feared vampire hunter in ''Night World'' history. Quinn was born in Boston in the 1600s and was turned by Hunter Redfern after falling in love with Redfern's daughter, Dove. He was turned without consent, and is scared, confused and angry when he wakes up in Redfern's cabin. He escapes and goes to his father for help, but Quinn's father tries to kill him, accidentally staking Dove instead. After that, Quinn thinks of himself only as a vampire. Quinn has black hair and black eyes.\n\n'''Poppy North''' - Poppy is the protagonist of the first book ''Secret Vampire''. She is James Rasmussen's childhood friend and later his soulmate. They have been best friends since they were four years old. Poppy is stubborn and quite hyper, as well as curious about the world. She always believed she would marry James when they grew up and secretly loves him. She has coppery curly hair with green eyes and is the twin sister of Phillip North. She was turned into a vampire by James after they discovered she was dying of stage three pancreatic cancer. Her twin Phillip was opposed to this plan. However, he allowed it when he realized it was the only way to save his sister. Poppy and her brother are found to be lost witches from their father's side of the family.\n\n'''Thierry Descouedres''' - Thierry holds the title \"Lord of the Night World\" and was the first made vampire. He was the second vampire in existence after Maya. He found his soulmate, an Old Soul named Hannah, soon after he was turned and has spent the thousands of years he has been alive in a continuous cycle of waiting for her to be reincarnated, searching for her, then having her die before her seventeenth birthday. It is a repetition of an ill-fated accident that happened during her first lifetime. She was accidentally killed by Thierry that first time and intentionally murdered by Maya in every lifetime after. It is a cycle he is desperate to break.\n\nThierry has dark eyes and mid-long blond hair which he wears in a ponytail. He is the leader of Circle Daybreak and plans to recruit all the Wild Powers in order to win the final battle. He was changed by Maya in the stone age because she felt she was in love with him, the same reason she repeatedly kills Thierry's soulmate through all of her lifetimes. His original name was Theorn, and he belonged to the witch tribe led by Maya's sister Hellewise.\n\n===Witch===\n\nThe witches of the ''Night World'' novels are largely based on the [[Modern Paganism|neo-pagan]] religion of [[Wicca]] as well as the [[Goddess movement|Goddess Movement]]. They are a [[matriarchy]] which traces its lineage to the first tribe of sorceresses ruled by [[Hecate]] Witch-Queen and later her daughter, Hellewise Hearth-Woman. All witches are considered \"daughters of Hellewise\" by virtue of having inherited her teachings. However, the Harman family are direct descents of Hellewise through the women in their line. The first vampire - Maya - was Hellewise's sister and thus all vampires share witch blood.<ref name=\"Spellbinder\">Spellbinder</ref>\n\nWitch society is composed of \"Circles\" to which all witches belong. Those who take to heart Hellewise's bidding to \"harm none\" (the [[Wiccan Rede]]) belong to Circle Twilight, while Circle Midnight is made up of witches who practice darker magic. The final and newest circle, Circle Daybreak, is dedicated to protecting all life. Throughout the entire Night World series you will see new members joining and will briefly encounter characters from the entire series. They are mostly separate from the other two circles and are like the secret group of the supernatural community. Most members have found refuge with their soulmates here. The Inner Circle is a [[coven]] of the nine most magically talented witches, whom Thea Harman calls \"the witch geniuses, the prodigies and the sages, the far-seers, the teachers, the policy-makers\"<ref>Spellbinder p.189</ref> in ''Spellbinder''. The most important of these are the triad of the [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Maiden, Mother, and Crone]], positions which during the events of the books are held respectively by Aradia, The Maiden; [[Cybele]], The Mother; and Grandma Harman, The Crone. All witches are answerable to the Inner Circle before the Night World council, although an association probably exists between them, but this isn't specified.\n\nA third renegade Circle also exists, known as Circle Daybreak, first mentioned in ''Spellbinder'', which promotes the teaching of magic to humans and peace between the races. This circle used to exist alongside the other two but was banned due to the persecution of witches during the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|Burning Times]]. Circle Daybreak is kept secret from the rest of the Night World, although a few suspect its renewed existence. During the events leading up to the [[apocalypse]], the witches opt to leave the Night World and join Circle Daybreak, as they want to help save the world, whereas the Night World council and most of the vampires want to take over and enslave the other races.<ref name=\"Black Dawn\">Black Dawn</ref>\n\nWitches practice [[Magic (fantasy)|magic]] with the aid of [[herbs]], [[gemstones]], [[effigies]], and [[incantations]], all of which may be used in a spell; they worship the Goddess in her many manifestations and celebrate [[Samhain]] and probably other festivals on the [[Wheel of the Year]].<ref name=\"Enchantress\">Enchantress</ref> Their magic is [[innate]] and does not always require external aids, although these can accentuate their power.<ref name=\"Black Dawn\"/> Human [[psychics]] in the series are \"lost witches\" who are unaware of their true descent.<ref>Witchlight</ref>\n\nIdentifying symbols for Night World witches are the black [[dahlia]] and the crescent [[moon]] with three stars.<ref name=\"Enchantress\"/> The symbol for \"lost witches\" is a black [[Viola (plant)|violet]]. Iron is mentioned in Daughters of Darkness as their [[poison]].\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''Thea Harman''' - Thea is a sweet girl compared to her cousin Blaise and is the main protagonist of the third book, ''Spellbinder''. She has long, blonde hair and sweet brown eyes. She wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up, and even though she doesn't tell humans about her nature, she still wants to help them. She has a human soulmate, Eric Ross, and is a cross-cousin of the Redferns. She is the persona of Hellewise, one of the two original daughters of Hecate Witch-Queen.\n\n'''Blaise Harman''' - Blaise is one of the lead characters in the third book. She is a witch royal who is described as being a girl who bewitches boys for sport and hates humans. She is a cross-cousin of the Redferns and the cousin (although they were raised like sisters) of Thea Harman. She has long, dark hair and smoky, grey eyes. She represents the persona of Maya, the original vampire and daughter of Hecate.\n\n'''Sylvia Weald''' - Sylvia is one of the characters in ''Black Dawn''. She is dating Maggie Neely's brother, whom she changes into a shapeshifter. She sides with Hunter Redfern and binds Delos's powers before the maiden of witches, Aradia, changes her mind. She is killed by one of Hunter's guardians seconds after she releases Delos.\n\n'''''Lost witches'''''\n\n'''Gillian Lennox (Harman)''' - Gillian is told of her heritage by her dead cousin who comes back as an \"Angel\". She is a petite girl with short silver-blonde hair and violet eyes. She is a distant cousin of Thea and Blaise as well as the Redferns. She has a human soulmate, David Blackburn, with whom she joins Circle Daybreak. Gillian is descended for the lost Harman twins, Elspeth and Emmeth.\n\n'''Iliana Dominick (Harman)''' - Unbeknownst to Iliana, she is secretly from the Harman line and the third Wild Power. She is also prophesied to be the Witch Child. She spends most of the book denying that she is a witch, but eventually accepts her fate. As the Witch Child, she was supposed to marry the Prince of the Shapeshifters, but she refused.\n\n'''Poppy North''' - Poppy was a lost witch along with her twin brother, Phillip North, and dying of pancreatic cancer before her best friend, James, turns her into a vampire. James figures out that she is a witch when she dreams of Ash before they even meet, develops an extremely strong telepathic ability, and screams to James while inside her dream about Ash. When she screams in her dream, three people hear it: James, Phillip, and her dad. Poppy has curly red hair and emerald green eyes.\n\n'''Phillip North''' - Phillip is the twin brother of Poppy North. He is extremely straitlaced and responsible. He opposes Poppy and James's relationship, because of James's reputation with girls. When he learns about his real heritage, he chooses to live as a human, though he does keep in contact with Poppy and knows about the other ''Night World'' creatures. Phillip is tall, smart, and athletic, with blond hair and green eyes.\n\n'''Gary Fargeon \"Angel\"''' - Not much is known about Gary because he died when he was seventeen in a car accident. He is descended from the lost Harman twins, and he had recently discovered he was a witch before he died. He is frequently described as an impossibly beautiful teenage boy, although his exact description is never given (though he does have the violet eyes that the Harmans are known for as well as sunshine blond hair.) He wants to rejoin the world of the living and develops a dangerous plan. In the end, Gary's soul finally rests in peace with a little help from his cousin Gillian.\n\n===Werewolf===\n\nA werewolf is a type of shapeshifter. As no main characters in any of the novels have been werewolves (Lupe Acevedo in ''Soulmate'' was only half-werewolf and she was a minor character; and there was barely anything known about Jeremy Lovett from ''Daughters of Darkness''), less is known about this species than others. In ''Night World'', werewolves (sometimes called 'wolves or just wolves) can transform from human to [[wolf]] (and vice versa) at will. In ''Daughters of Darkness'', werewolves are described as wolves that take human form, rather than the reverse. This means that they have animal instincts and urges, even in human form. This is all contrary to modern [[werewolf]] lore, in which a werewolf is basically a normal person but undergoes an involuntary transformation. Though it is not stated explicitly, it appears that, like vampires, werewolves can be born as such and can also be made.\n\nUnlike vampires, werewolves must kill every time they feed because they need to consume organs. Thus, Night World law states that werewolves can kill and eat only animals. In the Night World, werewolves are treated as [[second-class citizen]]s and are the victims of prejudice and racism. As in modern werewolf lore, ''Night World'' werewolves are harmed by silver. The symbol for werewolves is a black [[foxglove]]. They are described by other members of the Night World (such as James) as having low intelligence levels.\n\n==== Main Characters ====\n\n'''Jeremy Lovett''' - Jeremy is seen in the second book ''Daughter of Darkness'' and is best friends with Mary-Lynette Carter, the protagonist of the book. Mary-Lynette thinks of him as a vulnerable boy since he doesn't have anyone to live with. However, this is not entirely true. He is a territorial werewolf who doesn't obey Night World law and kills his uncle as well as a hiker in the woods. He fell in love with Mary-Lynette and tried to turn her into a werewolf. When Ash Redfern attempted to stop him, Jeremy attacked. Mary-Lynette killed Jeremy to save her soulmate Ash's life. Jeremy's unusual behavior while in werewolf form is why the local creek is named \"Mad Dog Creek\".\n\n'''Lupe Acevedo''' - Lupe is different from any other werewolf described and seen in the series. She is smart and one of Thierry's most trusted agents. She is half-human, half-werewolf. Her birth led to her father killed for breaking the law (human/werewolf offspring are illegal). Thierry saved her. She in turn saves Hannah when she is attacked by other werewolves in the sixth book ''Soulmate''. She has silvery-brown hair with yellow eyes.\n\n===Shapeshifter===\n\nShapeshifters appear later in the series; no main character is a shapeshifter until the ninth book, ''Witchlight''. Before that, only allusions to shapeshifters are made, usually in the context of a Night Person explaining the Night World to a human and listing the Night World species. In ''Witchlight'', the protagonist, Keller, is a shapeshifter. She has the ability to change into the form of a panther at will.\n\nSome history about shapeshifters is given in ''Witchlight''. Shapeshifters had control of the world long before witches and vampires. Their leaders were known as \"Dragons\", beings that could change into the form of any animal as long as they have had physical contact to that animal (normally shapeshifters can change into only one pre-determined animal form). To kill a dragon you must remove its horns. The more horns it has, the more powerful it is. The witches rose to power and put the dragons to sleep, except for the youngest one, the dragon princess, who was only 4 at the time. The witches left her awake and raised her, carefully watching over her. All of the ruling house of shapeshifters are descended from her. The descendants of the ruling house have the ability to choose what animal they will become, but this choice is permanent.\n\nIn the early books of the series, werewolves and shapeshifters are described as separate groups or races of the Night World. For example, in ''Daughters of Darkness'', Night World is described as comprising vampires, \"witches and werewolves and shapeshifters, too\".<ref>Daughters of Darkness, p.125</ref> Though never explicitly stated, the later books tend to treat werewolves as a subset of shapeshifters. In ''Witchlight'', when Keller tells the history of shapeshifters, she lists felines, bears, eagles, and wolves as groups or clans within the shapeshifter race.<ref>Witchlight, p.140</ref> The description of both werewolves and shapeshifters as second-class citizens also supports the notion that werewolves are a subset, or one family, of shapeshifters. However, in ''Witchlight'' there is no real mention of Keller feeding or abiding by the rules for werewolves described in ''Daughters of Darkness''.\n\nThe symbol for shapeshifters is a black lily. The type differs, for example tigers use tiger lilies.\n\n====Main Characters ====\n\n'''Raksha Keller''' - Keller is the protagonist of the ninth book ''Witchlight'' and leads Circle Daybreak's best Ops Team. She prefers being called by her last name as her first name means \"demon\". She is strong and secretive and she never shows her inner feelings to anyone. She is half shapeshifter, half human, and can turn into a panther. She prefers to work hard and repay Circle Daybreak for raising her after she was abandoned. When she was discovered as a baby, she was in human form, but with a panther's ears and tail. Keller has long, black hair with silvery-grey eyes and is the only shapeshifter that has taken a main role in the series. She is the soulmate of the Prince of the Shapeshifters, Galen Drache, and the blood sister of Iliana Dominick-Harman. On the author's website, we learn that she is Rashel Jordan's fraternal twin.\n\n'''Galen Drache''' - Galen is the Prince of the first House of the Shapeshifters and the soulmate of Raksha Keller. He is gentle, loving, and caring, like Iliana, and isn't a fighter, but he does try his best when Keller is about to get killed by a dragon. He was supposed to marry Iliana, but when Iliana realizes that Galen is Keller's soulmate, she tells them that their love is something no one could ever interfere with. He has golden hair with green-golden eyes. As a Prince, he gets to choose his animal shape and becomes a leopard at the end of the book to save Keller.\n\n'''Miles Neely''' - Miles is a made shapeshifter who can turn into a falcon and is the older brother of Maggie Neely. He got turned into a shapeshifter by his girlfriend, Sylvia Weald, a witch. He and Maggie bear a strong resemblance to each other. He has brown eyes and auburn hair.\n\n===Human===\n\nWhile the series is largely supernaturally-centered, humans do play a major role both as supporting characters and occasionally main characters or antagonists. Humans - or ''Homo sapiens'' (Latin: \"''wise men''\") - are the reigning species of the known planet with few magical attributes. Humans have a main role as some of the protagonists in the series. Due in part both to their status as the dominant species as well as their largely adverse affects on the Earth, the Night World has endeavored to keep their existence a secret from humanity. The approach of the Apocalypse is due to the Night World's attempts at enslaving mankind.\n \nWhile humans innately possess little to no paranormal attributes, they still possess undying souls subject to the Soulmate Principle as well as possibly being reincarnated over the span of centuries or more. These reborn humans are referred to as ''Old Souls'' within the Night World. Because of their relative impotence in relation to the predatory prowess of supernatural creatures, humans are a preferred food source for werewolves and vampires. Humans are also able to be converted into made vampires through a blood exchange and conceive children with a witch.\n\n====Main Characters ====\n\n'''Mary-Lynnette Carter''' - Mary-Lynnette is the protagonist in ''Daughter of Darkness''. She is the older sister of Mark Carter, becomes a blood sister with the Redfern girls, and is the soulmate of Ash Redfern. Mary-Lynnette is an astronomy lover who spends her time star-watching at night and is more of a night person than a day person. She is curious about everything and admires [[Nancy Drew]], often wondering what she would do in her situation. She is nicknamed Mare and is very protective of Mark, feeling responsible for him. She often displays an ironic sense of humor, is very strong, and talks to herself a lot. Even though she and Ash are soulmates, she doesn't follow him, but tells him to fix his past mistakes then come back. Mary-Lynnette has long brown hair with blue eyes. When she first meets Ash, she can't stop kicking him in the shins, which is her way of suppressing the urge to kiss him, so everyone thinks she has gone mad.\n\n'''Mark Carter''' - Mark is Jade Redfern's soulmate, the younger brother of Mary-Lynette, and blood brother to the Redfern sisters. He is very shy and doesn't like to mix with others, but when he sees Jade for the first time, he falls in love. With Jade's help, he convinces the other two Redfern sisters not to kill him and Mary-Lynette. He has brown hair with blue eyes.\n\n'''Eric Ross''' - Eric is one of the lead characters in ''Spellbinder'' and is a gentle boy whom everyone likes. He is shy and timid, yet he is one of the most popular boys in his school, with his sandy-colored hair and grey flecked-green eyes. He becomes Blaise's next target when she and Thea Harman move to town because he isn't bewitched by her and he falls in love with Thea. His and Thea's love risks her expulsion from the Night World as she breaks a very strong law that could end not only their lives but everyone else's.\n\n'''David Blackburn''' - David is one of the lead characters in ''Dark Angel''. He is the most popular boy in his school and is the boy Gillian Lennox had a secret crush on since the time she first saw him when she was twelve. David has brown hair with brown eyes and has tan skin. He reveals he loves Gillian when they go to a party after he hears of an affair between his longtime girlfriend, Tanya, and another boy.\n\n'''Rashel Jordan''' - Rashel, also known as \"The Cat\" by vampires, is the most feared vampire hunter in the record of Night World. She uses the phrase \"This Kitten Has Claws\" when killing vampires, in memory of her mother, who used to call her \"kitten,\" and makes a mark on her victim's forehead resembling a cat's claws. She is the protagonist of ''The Chosen''. When she was five, her four-year-old friend, Timmy, was kidnapped and changed into a vampire and her mother was killed by Hunter. This is the main reason she becomes a vampire hunter which leads her to meet her cold-hearted soulmate, Quinn, whom she originally wants to kill. She later hunts only \"bad vampires,\" and she and Quinn are known as the best fighters when they join Circle Daybreak. On the author's website, it is revealed that she is in fact half-shapeshifter and is the twin sister of Raksha Keller. Rashel has long black hair which is tied back, and piercing green eyes.\n\n'''Hannah Snow''' - Hannah is the protagonist of ''Soulmate'' and an Old Soul who has been reincarnated since the Stone Age when she first saw her soulmate Thierry. Thierry was known as Theorn at that time, while she was known as Hana of the Three Rivers. In each of her past lives, Hannah is killed by the first vampire, Maya Redfern, due to her loving Thierry. She has a birth mark on her right cheek (which is a psychic brand from the time Thierry accidentally killed her), long blonde hair, and grey eyes. She is a sweet girl and is known as the Lady of Circle Daybreak. In one of the short stories in the author's website, it is said that she has gone off to fight in the apocalypse.\n\n'''Hugh Davis''' - Hugh is one of the characters in ''Huntress''. He is a wakened Old Soul, which is extremely rare. Unlike most Old Souls, he remembers all of his past lives. According to Jez, he becomes smarter and more clearheaded with each life, and also more gentle. Hugh is a Daybreaker, and is the one to trust Jez enough to let her join Circle Daybreak. He is also the person who talks her into going to get the Wild Power from Morgead. Even though he isn't a fighter, he proves that he is somewhat capable when he fends off a werewolf by himself. Hugh is described as having longish light hair and gray eyes and is muscled but compact. It is hinted that he likes Jez as more than a good friend.\n\n'''Maggie Neely''' - Maggie is the protagonist of the eighth book ''Black Dawn'' and is mentioned in a witches' prophecy as the \"deliverer\". Maggie is described as being careless and loves playing soccer. She is a strong girl who is admired by the witches and the only one who is able to handle Delos Redfern, her soulmate. Maggie has shoulder-length auburn hair with brown eyes. She is seventeen and is a Circle Daybreak member.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090602082403/http://bookalicio.us/2009/03/an-interview-with-l-j-smith/ An interview with L.J.

High concentrations are used rarely in [[medicine]] but frequently in [[molecular biology]].\n\n===Normal===\n\nNormal saline (''NSS,'' ''NS'' or ''N/S'') is the commonly used phrase for a solution of 0.90% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] of [[sodium chloride|NaCl]], 308 [[Osmolarity|mOsm]]/L or 9.0&nbsp;g per liter.  Less commonly, this solution is referred to as ''physiological saline'' or ''isotonic saline'' (because it closely approximates [[tonicity#Isotonicity|isotonic]], that is, physiologically normal, solution); although neither of those names is technically accurate (because normal saline is not exactly like [[serum (blood)|blood serum]]), they convey the practical effect usually seen: good [[fluid balance]] with minimal hypotonicity or hypertonicity. NS is used frequently in [[intravenous drip]]s (IVs) for people who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing [[dehydration]] or [[hypovolemia]]. NS is also used for aseptic purpose. NS is typically the first fluid used when hypovolemia is severe enough to threaten the adequacy of blood circulation, and has long been believed to be the safest fluid to give quickly in large volumes. However, it is now known that rapid infusion of NS can cause [[metabolic acidosis]].<ref>{{cite journal |last= Prough |first= DS |author2=Bidani, A  |year=1999 |title=Hyperchloremic metabolic acidosis is a predictable consequence of intraoperative infusion of 0.9% saline |journal=Anesthesiology |volume=90 |issue=5 |pages=1247\u20131249 | location =  |pmid = 10319767 |doi =10.1097/00000542-199905000-00003}}</ref>\n\nThe solution is 9 grams of sodium chloride (NaCl) dissolved in water, to a total volume of 1000&nbsp;ml (weight per unit volume(w/v)).

Since normal saline contains 9 grams of NaCl, the concentration is 9 grams per litre divided by 58.5 grams per mole, or 0.154 mole per litre.\nSince NaCl dissociates into two ions&nbsp;\u2013 sodium and chloride&nbsp;\u2013 1 molar NaCl is 2 osmolar.\nThus, NS contains 154 [[Equivalent (chemistry)|mEq]]/L of Na<sup>+</sup> and the same amount of Cl<sup>\u2212</sup>.

Normal saline will not burn or sting when applied.\n\nSaline is also used in I.V. therapy, intravenously supplying extra water to rehydrate people or supplying the daily water and salt needs (\"maintenance\" needs) of a person who is unable to take them by mouth. Because infusing a solution of low [[osmolality]] can cause problems such as [[Hemolysis#Distilled water|hemolysis]]<!-- Any other problems? -->, intravenous solutions with reduced saline concentrations (less than 0.9%) typically have [[dextrose]] ([[glucose]]) added to maintain a safe osmolality while providing less sodium chloride.\n\nThe amount of normal saline infused depends largely on the needs of the person (e.g. ongoing [[diarrhea]] or [[heart failure]]).\n\nSaline is also often used for nasal washes to relieve some of the symptoms of the [[common cold]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.demazin.com.au/demazin/saline-drops|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116043939/http://www.demazin.com.au/demazin/saline-drops|url-status=dead|title=Cure a cold: Saline Nasal drops|archivedate=16 January 2013}}</ref> The solution exerts a softening and loosening influence on the mucus to make it easier to wash out and clear the nasal passages for both babies<ref>[http://www.patient.info/health/Blocked-Nose-in-Babies-%28%27Snuffles%27%29.htm Blocked Nose in Babies ('Snuffles')] at [[Patient UK]]</ref> and adults.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.disboards.com/threads/what-does-saline-nasal-spray-do.787412/|title=What does saline nasal spray do?|website=The DIS Disney Discussion Forums - DISboards.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/medicines/ear-nose-and-throat/news/a8767/tixylix-saline-nasal-drops/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101064205/http://www.netdoctor.co.uk/childrens-health/medicines/tixylix-saline-nasal-drops.html|url-status=dead|title=Tixylix saline nasal drops|date=30 March 2011|archivedate=1 November 2012|website=Netdoctor}}</ref> In this case \"home-made\" saline may be used: this is made by dissolving approximately half a teaspoon of [[table salt]] into 240ml (approx. 8 ounces) of clean [[tap water]].<ref>[http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-saline-nose-drops-109902 Homemade Saline Nose Drops] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127115037/http://www.food.com/recipe/homemade-saline-nose-drops-109902 |date=2012-11-27 }} at [[Food.com]]</ref> In very rare instances, amoeba ''[[Naegleria fowleri]]'' infection can occur if amoeba enters the body through the nose, therefore water used for nasal irrigation should be sterile.<ref name=\"urlCDC - Naegleria - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\">{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html |title=CDC - Naegleria - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) |website= |access-date=9 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320191236/http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/faqs.html |archive-date=2012-03-20 |df= }}</ref> Note that clean tap water is not necessarily a sterile liquid.\n\n====Eyes====\n[[Eye drops]] are saline-containing [[Drop (liquid)|drop]]s used on the [[eye]].

Water privation combined with diuretic block does not produce as much risk of CPM as saline administration does; however, it does not correct hyponatremia as rapidly as administration of hypertonic saline does.  Due to hypertonicity, administration may result in [[phlebitis]] and tissue [[necrosis]].  As such, concentrations greater than 3% NaCl should normally be administered via a [[central venous catheter]], also known as a 'central line'.

In the following decades, variations and alternatives to Latta's solution were tested and used in treating people with cholera. These solutions contained a range of concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide.  The breakthrough in achieving physiological concentrations was accomplished by [[Sydney Ringer]] in the early 1880s,<ref>Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. (2007).

Normal saline is considered a descendant of the pre-Ringer solutions, as Ringer's findings were not adopted and widely used until decades later. The term \"normal saline\" itself appears to have little historical basis, except for studies done in 1882\u201383 by Dutch physiologist [[Hartog Jacob Hamburger]]; these in vitro studies of red cell lysis suggested incorrectly that 0.9% was the concentration of salt in human blood (rather than 0.6%, the true concentration).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Awad|first=Sherif|author2=Allison Simon P |author3=Lobo Dileep N |year=2008|title=The history of 0.9% saline|journal=Clinical Nutrition|volume=27|issue=2|pages=179\u201388| pmid = 18313809|doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2008.01.008 }}</ref>\n\nNormal saline has become widely used in modern medicine, but due to the mismatch with real blood, other solutions have proved better.

NS is used frequently in [[intravenous drip]]s (IVs) for people who cannot take fluids orally and have developed or are in danger of developing [[dehydration]] or [[hypovolemia]].

Water privation combined with diuretic block does not produce as much risk of CPM as saline administration does; however, it does not correct hyponatremia as rapidly as administration of hypertonic saline does.  Due to hypertonicity, administration may result in [[phlebitis]] and tissue [[necrosis]].  As such, concentrations greater than 3% NaCl should normally be administered via a [[central venous catheter]], also known as a 'central line'. Such hypertonic saline is normally available in two strengths, the former of which is more commonly administered:\n** 3% NaCl has 513 mEq/L of Na and Cl.\n** 5% NaCl has 856 mEq/L of Na and Cl.\n* NaCl solutions that are less commonly used are 7% (1200 mEq/L) and 23.4% (approx 4000 mEq/L), both of which are used (also via central line), often in conjunction with supplementary diuretics, in the treatment of [[traumatic brain injury]].<ref>[http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/548015 Access] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119080639/http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/548015 |date=2010-11-19 }}.

[[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], a recent graduate of [[Edinburgh Medical School]], proposed in an article to medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' to inject people with cholera with highly oxygenated salts to treat the \"universal stagnation of the venous system and rapid cessation of arterialisation of the blood\" seen in people with severely dehydrated cholera.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Proposal for a new method of treating the blue epidemic cholera by the injection of highly-oxygenated salts into the venous system|journal=Lancet|year=1831|first=WB|last=O'Shaugnessy|volume=17|issue=432|pages=366\u201371|id= |url=https://zenodo.org/record/1742998|format=|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(02)94163-2 }}</ref> He found his treatment harmless in dogs, and his proposal was soon adopted by the physician Thomas Latta in treating people with cholera to beneficial effect. In the following decades, variations and alternatives to Latta's solution were tested and used in treating people with cholera. These solutions contained a range of concentrations of sodium, chloride, potassium, carbonate, phosphate, and hydroxide.  The breakthrough in achieving physiological concentrations was accomplished by [[Sydney Ringer]] in the early 1880s,<ref>Kenneth M Sutin; Marino, Paul L. (2007).

Normal saline is considered a descendant of the pre-Ringer solutions, as Ringer's findings were not adopted and widely used until decades later. The term \"normal saline\" itself appears to have little historical basis, except for studies done in 1882\u201383 by Dutch physiologist [[Hartog Jacob Hamburger]]; these in vitro studies of red cell lysis suggested incorrectly that 0.9% was the concentration of salt in human blood (rather than 0.6%, the true concentration).<ref>{{cite journal|last=Awad|first=Sherif|author2=Allison Simon P |author3=Lobo Dileep N |year=2008|title=The history of 0.9% saline|journal=Clinical Nutrition|volume=27|issue=2|pages=179\u201388| pmid = 18313809|doi = 10.1016/j.clnu.2008.01.008 }}</ref>\n\nNormal saline has become widely used in modern medicine, but due to the mismatch with real blood, other solutions have proved better.

The player controls a human, Kris, in a world inhabited by monsters. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall into an unknown place called the \"Dark World\" where they meet Ralsei, who informs them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The duo meets various beings who call themselves \"Darkners\" during a prophesied quest to seal the duplicate Dark Fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player navigates through different kinds of [[Shoot 'em up|bullet hell]] attacks by enemies, which can be resolved peacefully or through violence. \n\nDevelopment of ''Deltarune'' began in 2012. The battle system was overhauled from Fox's previous game ''[[Undertale]]'', resembling the one used in ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games. The first chapter of the game was released for free on October 31, 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]; the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] editions were released on February 28, 2019. A full release is planned, but no release date has been announced yet.<ref name=\"tf twitlonger 2018-11-02\">{{cite web|url=http://www.twitlonger.com/show/n_1sqn3p9|title=Here are my thoughts on Chapter 1 of Deltarune.

Toriel drops Kris off at school, where Kris attends a class taught by Alphys. Kris and Susie, a delinquent monster classmate, are sent to get chalk for the blackboard. Upon entering the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the \"Dark World\". There, they meet Ralsei, a prince of the dark, who tells them that the three of them are heroes destined to close the Dark Fountain (a geyser of dark energy) to restore balance to that world. However, the King has seized control of the Dark World and is determined to spread darkness.\n\nSusie chooses not to help, only wanting to return to her own world. Before she can leave, the three encounter the King's son Lancer, who tries to stop them from proceeding with various poorly thought out plans. Susie eventually decides to join Lancer, leaving Kris and Ralsei on their own. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to the King's castle, Susie befriends Lancer, and the four ultimately become a team. Upon realizing that they will have to confront the King, Lancer runs off to the castle and arranges for the King's henchmen to throw Kris, Ralsei, and Susie into the dungeon.\n\nSusie escapes the dungeon and confronts Lancer, who explains he wanted to keep Susie and the King from hurting each other. Susie promises Lancer she won't hurt the King. Kris, Susie and Ralsei go to the top of the castle and confront the King in battle. Eventually, the King falls to the ground in exhaustion and Ralsei takes pity on him, healing the King. However, this is revealed to be a ruse as the King quickly incapacitates the three heroes, threatening to kill them all. If the player has resolved enemy encounters without violence throughout the game, Lancer turns the King's men against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place. Otherwise, Susie subdues the King using Ralsei's Pacify spell.\n\nKris closes the Dark Fountain so that they can return to their own world. There, Susie says goodbye, expressing interest in returning to the Dark World. The player can explore the town before having Kris go home to bed. That night, Kris shakes in bed, then falls on the floor and limps to the center of the room.

Development of the game started in 2012, although it was abandoned before Fox created the first room. Some music from the original project was recycled for ''Undertale'', most notably the main battle theme (which became Papyrus' battle theme), and a song called ''Joker Battle'' (which was reused for the [[Toriel]] fight).

The player controls a human, Kris, in a world inhabited by monsters. Kris and a classmate named Susie fall into an unknown place called the \"Dark World\" where they meet Ralsei, who informs them that they are heroes destined to restore balance to the world. The duo meets various beings who call themselves \"Darkners\" during a prophesied quest to seal the duplicate Dark Fountain. Mainly through the combat system, the player navigates through different kinds of [[Shoot 'em up|bullet hell]] attacks by enemies, which can be resolved peacefully or through violence. \n\nDevelopment of ''Deltarune'' began in 2012. The battle system was overhauled from Fox's previous game ''[[Undertale]]'', resembling the one used in ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games. The first chapter of the game was released for free on October 31, 2018 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[macOS]]; the [[Nintendo Switch]] and [[PlayStation 4]] editions were released on February 28, 2019.

However, upon completion, the game deletes the avatar and informs the player that \"No one can choose who they are in this world.\"\n\nThe player begins the story as Kris, a human child living in a village mostly made up of monster residents, with their adoptive mother [[Toriel]], who is also a monster. Toriel drops Kris off at school, where Kris attends a class taught by Alphys. Kris and Susie, a delinquent monster classmate, are sent to get chalk for the blackboard. Upon entering the supply closet, both of them are pulled into the \"Dark World\". There, they meet Ralsei, a prince of the dark, who tells them that the three of them are heroes destined to close the Dark Fountain (a geyser of dark energy) to restore balance to that world. However, the King has seized control of the Dark World and is determined to spread darkness.\n\nSusie chooses not to help, only wanting to return to her own world. Before she can leave, the three encounter the King's son Lancer, who tries to stop them from proceeding with various poorly thought out plans. Susie eventually decides to join Lancer, leaving Kris and Ralsei on their own. As Kris and Ralsei make their way to the King's castle, Susie befriends Lancer, and the four ultimately become a team. Upon realizing that they will have to confront the King, Lancer runs off to the castle and arranges for the King's henchmen to throw Kris, Ralsei, and Susie into the dungeon.\n\nSusie escapes the dungeon and confronts Lancer, who explains he wanted to keep Susie and the King from hurting each other. Susie promises Lancer she won't hurt the King. Kris, Susie and Ralsei go to the top of the castle and confront the King in battle. Eventually, the King falls to the ground in exhaustion and Ralsei takes pity on him, healing the King. However, this is revealed to be a ruse as the King quickly incapacitates the three heroes, threatening to kill them all. If the player has resolved enemy encounters without violence throughout the game, Lancer turns the King's men against him and imprisons him, taking his father's place. Otherwise, Susie subdues the King using Ralsei's Pacify spell.\n\nKris closes the Dark Fountain so that they can return to their own world. There, Susie says goodbye, expressing interest in returning to the Dark World. The player can explore the town before having Kris go home to bed. That night, Kris shakes in bed, then falls on the floor and limps to the center of the room. Kris tears into their chest and rips out their heart-shaped SOUL, throwing it into a birdcage in the corner of the room. The player can move the SOUL around the birdcage, but cannot do anything else. Kris draws a knife and turns toward the viewer. They smile, with their right eye flashing red.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:DeltaruneCombatScreenshot.png|thumb|270x270px|In contrast to ''[[Undertale]]'', ''Deltarune'' includes a multiple party member system, a \"TP\" (Tension Points) bar, the ability to defend, use magic, as well as a complete graphical overhaul.|alt=|left]]\nLike ''Undertale'', ''Deltarune'' is a [[Role-playing video game|role-playing game]] with a [[top-down perspective]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.shacknews.com/article/109921/deltarune-chapter-1-comes-to-switch-for-free-later-this-month|title=Deltarune: Chapter 1 comes to Switch for free later this month|last=Vincent|first=Brittany|date=13 February 2019|website=Shacknews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190214074852/https://www.shacknews.com/article/109921/deltarune-chapter-1-comes-to-switch-for-free-later-this-month|archive-date=14 February 2019|url-status=}}</ref> The player directly controls a human named Kris,<ref name=\":0\" /> but they may also select actions for other characters in the game.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.gamecrate.com/hands-undertale-creator-releases-surprise-sequel-deltarune/21245|title=Hands-on: Undertale creator releases surprise sequel, Deltarune|work=Gamecrate|accessdate=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115195119/https://www.gamecrate.com/hands-undertale-creator-releases-surprise-sequel-deltarune/21245|archive-date=November 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Similarly to ''Undertale'', ''Deltarune'' includes puzzles and [[bullet hell]] sections in which the player must move a heart around a boxed area while avoiding attacks.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_1|title=DELTARUNE Chapter 1 Review|last=Vogel|first=Mitch|date=12 March 2019|website=Nintendolife|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502213125/http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_1|archive-date=2 May 2019|url-status=}}</ref> ''Undertale''<nowiki/>'s [[random encounter]] system has been removed; players can now see the enemies directly on the field, allowing for the possibility of avoiding them.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-is-a-beautiful-extension-of-a-deeper-und/1100-6463044|title=Deltarune Is A Beautiful Extension Of A Deeper Undertale Universe|last=Higham|first=Michael|date=12 November 2018|website=Gamespot|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530060229/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/deltarune-is-a-beautiful-extension-of-a-deeper-und/1100-6463044/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=}}</ref> \n\nCombat is turn-based.

Sans is initially introduced as a [[comic relief]] character but is eventually revealed to be one of the most knowledgeable characters in the game. He is depicted as a short, paunchy skeleton who wears a blue jacket, black basketball shorts with a white lining, pink slippers and a white t-shirt. He is also seen with pink slippers in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' in his Mii costume. His name is based on the [[Comic Sans]] font, which is used for most of his in-game dialogue. The character was praised by critics for his dialogue and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]. His popularity with fans inspired several user-created [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] and other types of projects.

As the story proceeds, Sans continues to be a regular source of comic relief, performing such antics as attempting to sell the player fried snow. Later in the game, Sans invites the player to go eat at a restaurant with him. As he talks, he explains how he befriended a woman (who is actually [[Toriel]]) behind the large door in Snowdin who shared an equal love for puns as he did.

After the player defeats Asgore (and Flowey, who attacks the player after Asgore's defeat) and leaves the Underground, Sans calls them to inform them of what occurred after their departure, having different dialogue depending on the player's actions in game.\n\nIf the player finishes the game without killing any monsters and befriending them, Sans appears after Asgore's defeat along with the other main characters, only to be captured by [[Flowey]] and have his soul absorbed along with most of the game's other monsters. However, he is restored after the reborn Asriel Dreemurr is defeated, being set free with everyone else and being able to leave the Underground.\n\nHowever, Sans' behavior changes completely if the player opts to kill every monster they encounter. He threatens the player with a \"bad time\" if they proceed with their actions before the Papyrus boss fight. If the player ignores Sans' warning and continues slaughtering every monster they encounter, he eventually confronts the player in the Judgement Hall to prevent them from destroying the world, acting as the route's [[Boss (video gaming)|final boss]]. Sans puts up a fierce fight but is eventually slain by the player, allowing them to finish the route.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-the-kotaku-review-1739735669|title=Undertale: The Kotaku Review|website=Kotaku}}</ref>\n\n===In ''Deltarune''===\nIn chapter one of ''[[Deltarune]]'', Sans is found standing outside his shop.

Sans is initially introduced as a [[comic relief]] character but is eventually revealed to be one of the most knowledgeable characters in the game. He is depicted as a short, paunchy skeleton who wears a blue jacket, black basketball shorts with a white lining, pink slippers and a white t-shirt. He is also seen with pink slippers in ''Super Smash Bros. Ultimate'' in his Mii costume. His name is based on the [[Comic Sans]] font, which is used for most of his in-game dialogue. The character was praised by critics for his dialogue and [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]]. His popularity with fans inspired several user-created [[Mod (video gaming)|mods]] and other types of projects. He likes to crack jokes and tell puns throughout ''Undertale'', unless the player does the no mercy route, where the player fights Sans in his boss fight. \n\nA version of the character also appears as brief cameo in the related game ''[[Deltarune]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/undertale-fans-already-have-theories-about-whats-going-1830165547|title=Undertale Fans Already Have Theories About What's Going On In Deltarune|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=November 1, 2018|website=Kotaku|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Sans' likeness also appears as a customizable skin for the Mii Gunner character in ''[[Super Smash Bros.

He was the elder brother of [[Jim Younger|Jim]], [[John Younger|John]] and [[Bob Younger]], who were also members of the gang.\n\n==Early life==\nYounger was born on January 15, 1844 on the Younger family farm in [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], [[Missouri]]. He was a son of [[Henry Washington Younger]], a prosperous farmer from [[Greenwood, Missouri]] and [[Bersheba Leighton Fristoe]], daughter of a prominent Jackson County farmer. Cole was the seventh of fourteen children.\n\n==Civil War==\n\nDuring the [[American Civil War]], savage [[guerrilla]] warfare wracked the state of [[Missouri in the American Civil War|Missouri]]. Younger's father was a Union supporter, but he was shot dead by a Union soldier from [[Kansas in the American Civil War|Kansas]]. After that, Cole Younger sought revenge as a pro-Confederate guerrilla or \"[[bushwhacker]]\" under [[William Clarke Quantrill]]. By 1862, the [[Confederate States Army|Confederate Army]] had been forced to withdraw from the state, and most of the fighting involved pro-Union and pro-Confederate partisans rather than regular armies. However, the bushwhackers held a special hatred for the \"red leg\" Union troops from Kansas who frequently entered Missouri and earned a reputation for ruthlessness. Younger rode with Quantrill in [[Lawrence Massacre|a retaliatory raid]] on [[Lawrence, Kansas]] on August 21, 1863, during which about 200 citizens were killed and the town looted and burned.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cole Younger|url=http://www.spartacus-educational.com/WWyoungerC.htm |publisher=Spartacus Educational|author=John Simkin|date=September 1997|accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nYounger later claimed to have eventually left the bushwhackers and enlisted in the Confederate Army. He claimed he was sent to [[California in the American Civil War|California]] on a recruiting mission, and returned after the war's end to find Missouri ruled by a militant faction of Unionist Radicals. In the last days of the war, the Radicals had pushed through a new state constitution that barred all Confederate sympathizers from voting, serving on juries, holding public office, preaching the gospel, or carrying out other public roles. The constitution freed all slaves in Missouri in advance of the ratification of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|13th Amendment]] to the U.S. Constitution. It enacted a number of reforms, but the restrictions on former Confederates created disunity.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Outlaw career==\nMost of the former bushwhackers returned to peaceful lives. Many left Missouri for friendlier places, particularly Kentucky, where they had relatives. Most of their former leaders, including Quantrill and [[William T. Anderson|William \"Bloody Bill\" Anderson]], had been killed during the war. But a small core of Anderson's men, led by the ruthless [[Archie Clement]], remained together. State authorities believed that Clement planned and led the first daylight peacetime armed [[bank robbery]] in U.S. history when he held up the [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay County]] Savings Association on February 13, 1866. The bank was run by the leading citizens of Clay County, who had just held a public meeting for their association. The governor posted a reward for Clement, but he and his band of outlaws conducted further robberies that year. On election day of 1866, Clement led his men to polling places in [[Lexington, Missouri]], where they intimidated citizens  and secured the election of a slate of candidates. A state militia unit entered the town shortly thereafter and killed Clement when he resisted arrest.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nIt is uncertain when Cole Younger and his brothers joined Clement's gang. The first mention of his involvement came in 1868, when authorities identified him as a member of a gang who robbed Nimrod Long & Co., a bank in [[Russellville, Kentucky]]. Former guerrillas John Jarrett (Younger's brother-in-law), Arthur McCoy, and George and Oliver Shepard were also implicated. Oliver Shepard was killed resisting arrest and George was imprisoned. Once the more senior members of the gang had been killed, captured, or quit, its core thereafter consisted of the Younger brothers and [[Frank James|Frank]] and [[Jesse James]].<ref name=trout>{{cite web|title=Thomas Coleman \"Cole\" Younger|url=http://shs.umsystem.edu/historicmissourians/name/y/younger/ |publisher=The State Historical History of Missouri|author=Carlyn Trout|accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nWitnesses repeatedly gave identifications that matched Cole Younger in robberies carried out over the next few years, as the outlaws robbed banks and stagecoaches in Missouri and Kentucky. On July 21, 1873, they turned to [[train robbery]], derailing a locomotive and looting the express car on the [[Rock Island Railroad]] in [[Adair, Iowa]]. Younger and his brothers were also suspects in robberies in Missouri, Kentucky, Kansas, and West Virginia.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nFollowing the robbery of the [[St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway|Iron Mountain Railroad]] at [[Gad's Hill, Missouri]] in 1874, the [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency]] began to pursue the so-called James\u2013Younger Gang. Two agents (Louis J. Lull and John Boyle) engaged John and Jim Younger in a gunfight on a Missouri road on March 17, 1874; Boyle and Jim Younger fled the scene, and both Lull and John Younger were killed. Simultaneously, another Pinkerton agent, W.J. Whicher,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=IgFoB3sjQ2cC&pg=PT86 The story of Cole Younger by himself: being an autobiography of the Missouri ...By Cole Younger]</ref> who pursued the James brothers was abducted and later found dead alongside a rural road in Jackson County, Missouri.\n\nSome Younger families changed their last names to Jungers to avoid a family association with the gangsters.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The James and Younger brothers survived capture longer than most Western outlaws because of their strong support among former Confederates. Jesse James became the public face of the James\u2013Younger Gang, appealing to the public in letters to the press.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Downfall of the gang==\nOn September 7, 1876, the James\u2013Younger Gang attempted to rob a bank in [[Northfield, Minnesota]]. Cole Younger and his brother Bob both later said that they selected the bank because of its connection to two former Union generals and Radical Republican politicians, [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] and [[Adelbert Ames]]. Three of the outlaws entered the bank, as the remaining five, led by Cole Younger, remained on the street to provide cover. The crime soon went awry, however, when the townspeople sent up the alarm and ran for their guns. Younger and his brothers began to fire in the air to clear the streets, but the townspeople (shooting from behind cover, through windows and around the corners of buildings) opened a deadly fusillade, killing gang members [[Clell Miller]] and William Chadwell and badly wounding Bob Younger through the elbow. Herb Potter rode off in a hail of bullets.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe outlaws killed two townspeople, including the acting cashier of the bank, and fled empty-handed. As hundreds of Minnesotans formed posses to pursue the fleeing gang, the outlaws separated. The James brothers made it back to Missouri, but the three Youngers (Cole, Bob, and Jim) did not. They and another gang member, Charlie Pitts, waged a gun battle with a local posse in a wooded ravine along the [[Watonwan River]] west of [[Madelia, Minnesota]]. Pitts was killed, and Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger were badly wounded and captured. Cole, asked about the robbery, responded, \"We tried a desperate game and lost. But we are rough men used to rough ways, and we will abide by the consequences.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Image:ColeYoungerGrave060706a.jpg|thumb|Cole Younger gravesite in [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]]]]\nCole, Jim and Bob pleaded guilty to their crimes to avoid being [[hanging|hanged]]. They were sentenced to life in prison at the [[Minnesota Territorial Prison]] at [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] on November 18, 1876. Frank and Jesse James fled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they lived peacefully for the next three years. In 1879, Jesse returned to a life of crime, which ended with his murder on April 3, 1882, in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]]. Frank James surrendered to Missouri Governor [[Thomas Theodore Crittenden|Thomas T. Crittenden]] on October 4, 1882. Eventually Frank James was acquitted, and lived quietly and peacefully thereafter.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Later years==\nBob Younger died in Stillwater prison on September 16, 1889, of [[tuberculosis]]. Cole and Jim were [[parole]]d on July 10, 1901, with the help of the prison warden. Jim committed suicide in a hotel room in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], on October 19, 1902. Cole wrote a memoir that portrayed himself as a Confederate avenger more than an outlaw, admitting to only one crime, that at Northfield. He lectured and toured the south with Frank James in a wild west show, [[The Cole Younger and Frank James Wild West Company]], in 1903. On August 21, 1912, Cole declared that he had become a Christian and repented of his criminal past.\n\nFrank James died February 18, 1915. A year later, Cole Younger died, on March 21, 1916, in his hometown of [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]], and is buried in the [[Lee's Summit Historical Cemetery]].<ref name=\"trout\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Film===\n* ''[[Jesse James as the Outlaw]]'' (1921), played by [[Harry Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Jesse James and the Movies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TLXYhM3cTkC&pg=PA33 |first=Johnny D. |last=Boggs |publisher=[[McFarland Publishing]] |date=10 June 2011 |page=33 |isbn=9780786484966}}</ref>\n*''[[Bad Men of Missouri]]'' (1941) featured Younger, played by [[Dennis Morgan]], and his two outlaw brothers fighting the bank.\n*''[[The Younger Brothers]]'' (1949) had [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]] play Cole in a fictional story of the Youngers receiving their pardon.\n*''[[Kansas Raiders]]'' (1950) featured [[James Best]] playing Younger in a depiction of his time spent with [[Quantrill's Raiders]].\n*''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'' (1957), directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], featured [[Alan Hale, Jr.]] as Younger.\n*''[[Cole Younger, Gunfighter]]'' (1958) featured Cole played by [[Frank Lovejoy]].\n*''[[The Intruders (1970 film)|The Intruders]]'' (1970) featured Cole played by [[Gene Evans]].\n*''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]]'' (1972) depicts the failed Northfield bank robbery, with [[Cliff Robertson]] as Cole Younger.\n*''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980) depicts the era of the James\u2013Younger Gang's exploits, with [[David Carradine]] playing Cole.\n*''[[Frank and Jesse]]'' (1994) depicts the James\u2013Younger Gang's outlaw days, with [[Randy Travis]] playing Cole.\n*''[[American Outlaws]]'' (2001) depicts the early years of the James\u2013Younger Gang, with [[Scott Caan]] playing Cole.\n*''[[True Grit (2010 film)|True Grit]]'' (2010) briefly depicts Younger operating his Wild West show in the early 1900s, with [[Don Pirl]] playing Cole.\n<!--NOTE: Wikipedia is not just a collection of random information [[WP:IINFO]].

Jesse James became the public face of the James\u2013Younger Gang, appealing to the public in letters to the press.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Downfall of the gang==\nOn September 7, 1876, the James\u2013Younger Gang attempted to rob a bank in [[Northfield, Minnesota]]. Cole Younger and his brother Bob both later said that they selected the bank because of its connection to two former Union generals and Radical Republican politicians, [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin Butler]] and [[Adelbert Ames]]. Three of the outlaws entered the bank, as the remaining five, led by Cole Younger, remained on the street to provide cover. The crime soon went awry, however, when the townspeople sent up the alarm and ran for their guns. Younger and his brothers began to fire in the air to clear the streets, but the townspeople (shooting from behind cover, through windows and around the corners of buildings) opened a deadly fusillade, killing gang members [[Clell Miller]] and William Chadwell and badly wounding Bob Younger through the elbow. Herb Potter rode off in a hail of bullets.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe outlaws killed two townspeople, including the acting cashier of the bank, and fled empty-handed. As hundreds of Minnesotans formed posses to pursue the fleeing gang, the outlaws separated. The James brothers made it back to Missouri, but the three Youngers (Cole, Bob, and Jim) did not. They and another gang member, Charlie Pitts, waged a gun battle with a local posse in a wooded ravine along the [[Watonwan River]] west of [[Madelia, Minnesota]]. Pitts was killed, and Cole, Jim, and Bob Younger were badly wounded and captured. Cole, asked about the robbery, responded, \"We tried a desperate game and lost. But we are rough men used to rough ways, and we will abide by the consequences.\"{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n[[Image:ColeYoungerGrave060706a.jpg|thumb|Cole Younger gravesite in [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]]]]\nCole, Jim and Bob pleaded guilty to their crimes to avoid being [[hanging|hanged]]. They were sentenced to life in prison at the [[Minnesota Territorial Prison]] at [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]] on November 18, 1876. Frank and Jesse James fled to [[Nashville, Tennessee]], where they lived peacefully for the next three years. In 1879, Jesse returned to a life of crime, which ended with his murder on April 3, 1882, in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]]. Frank James surrendered to Missouri Governor [[Thomas Theodore Crittenden|Thomas T. Crittenden]] on October 4, 1882. Eventually Frank James was acquitted, and lived quietly and peacefully thereafter.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n==Later years==\nBob Younger died in Stillwater prison on September 16, 1889, of [[tuberculosis]]. Cole and Jim were [[parole]]d on July 10, 1901, with the help of the prison warden. Jim committed suicide in a hotel room in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], on October 19, 1902. Cole wrote a memoir that portrayed himself as a Confederate avenger more than an outlaw, admitting to only one crime, that at Northfield. He lectured and toured the south with Frank James in a wild west show, [[The Cole Younger and Frank James Wild West Company]], in 1903. On August 21, 1912, Cole declared that he had become a Christian and repented of his criminal past.\n\nFrank James died February 18, 1915. A year later, Cole Younger died, on March 21, 1916, in his hometown of [[Lee's Summit, Missouri]], and is buried in the [[Lee's Summit Historical Cemetery]].<ref name=\"trout\"/>\n\n==In popular culture==\n===Film===\n* ''[[Jesse James as the Outlaw]]'' (1921), played by [[Harry Hoffman]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Jesse James and the Movies |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-TLXYhM3cTkC&pg=PA33 |first=Johnny D. |last=Boggs |publisher=[[McFarland Publishing]] |date=10 June 2011 |page=33 |isbn=9780786484966}}</ref>\n*''[[Bad Men of Missouri]]'' (1941) featured Younger, played by [[Dennis Morgan]], and his two outlaw brothers fighting the bank.\n*''[[The Younger Brothers]]'' (1949) had [[Wayne Morris (American actor)|Wayne Morris]] play Cole in a fictional story of the Youngers receiving their pardon.\n*''[[Kansas Raiders]]'' (1950) featured [[James Best]] playing Younger in a depiction of his time spent with [[Quantrill's Raiders]].\n*''[[The True Story of Jesse James]]'' (1957), directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], featured [[Alan Hale, Jr.]] as Younger.\n*''[[Cole Younger, Gunfighter]]'' (1958) featured Cole played by [[Frank Lovejoy]].\n*''[[The Intruders (1970 film)|The Intruders]]'' (1970) featured Cole played by [[Gene Evans]].\n*''[[The Great Northfield Minnesota Raid]]'' (1972) depicts the failed Northfield bank robbery, with [[Cliff Robertson]] as Cole Younger.\n*''[[The Long Riders]]'' (1980) depicts the era of the James\u2013Younger Gang's exploits, with [[David Carradine]] playing Cole.\n*''[[Frank and Jesse]]'' (1994) depicts the James\u2013Younger Gang's outlaw days, with [[Randy Travis]] playing Cole.\n*''[[American Outlaws]]'' (2001) depicts the early years of the James\u2013Younger Gang, with [[Scott Caan]] playing Cole.\n*''[[True Grit (2010 film)|True Grit]]'' (2010) briefly depicts Younger operating his Wild West show in the early 1900s, with [[Don Pirl]] playing Cole.\n<!--NOTE: Wikipedia is not just a collection of random information [[WP:IINFO]].
