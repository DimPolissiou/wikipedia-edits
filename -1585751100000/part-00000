Examples include [[house|housing]], [[travel]], and [[food]] vouchers. The term voucher is also a synonym for [[receipt]] and is often used to refer to receipts used as [[evidence (law)|evidence]] of, for example, the declaration that a service has been performed or that an expenditure has been made. Voucher is a tourist guide for using services with a guarantee of payment by the agency.\n\nThe term is also commonly used for [[school vouchers]], which are somewhat different.\n\n==In tourism==\nVouchers are used in the [[tourism]] sector primarily as proof of a named customer's right to take a service at a specific time and place. Service providers collect them to return to the tour operator or [[travel agent]] that has sent that customer, to prove they have given the service. So, the life of a voucher is as below:\n\n# Customer receives vouchers from tour operator or travel agent for the services purchased\n# Customer goes to vacation site and forwards the voucher to related provider and asks for the service to be provided\n# Provider sends collected vouchers to the agent or operator that sends customers from time to time, and asks for payment for those services\n# Uncollected vouchers do not deserve payment\n\nThis approach is most suitable for free individual tourist activities where pre-allocation for services are not necessary, feasible or applicable. It was customary before the information era when communication was limited and expensive, but now has been given quite a different role by [[B2C]] applications. When a reservation is made through the internet, customers are often provided a voucher through email or a web site that can be printed. Providers customarily require this voucher be presented prior to providing the service.\n\n==Account voucher==\nA voucher is an accounting document representing an ''internal intent'' to make a payment to an ''external entity'', such as a vendor or service provider. A voucher is produced usually after receiving a vendor [[invoice]], after the invoice is successfully matched to a [[purchase order]]. A voucher will contain detailed information regarding the payee, the monetary amount of the payment, a description of the transaction, and more. In [[accounts payable]] systems, a process called a \"payment run\" is executed to generate payments corresponding to the unpaid vouchers. These payments can then be released or held at the discretion of an accounts payable supervisor or the company [[comptroller|controller]].\n\nThe term can also be used with reference to [[accounts receivable]], where it is also a document representing intent to make an adjustment to an account, and for the [[general ledger]] where there is need to adjust the accounts within that ledger; in that case it is referred to as a journal voucher.\n\nAny documentary evidence supporting the entries recorded in the books of accounts, establishing the arithmetic accuracy of the transaction, may also be referred to as a voucher&mdash;for example, a bill, invoice, [[receipt]], salary and wages sheet, [[memorandum of association]], [[counterfoil]] of [[Deposit slip|paying-in slip]], counterfoil of [[cheque book]], or [[trust deed (real estate)|trust deed]].\n\n==Mobile phones==\nA voucher is a recharge number sold to a customer to recharge their [[SIM card]] with money and to extend the card's availability period. Vouchers are typically sold at retail outlets, such as phone stores run by the mobile operator or by distributors, grocery stores, and gas stations.\n\nVouchers are the prevalent form of recharge for prepaid mobile phones in many countries such as Italy and Spain where well over 90% of consumers use vouchers, and the UK where over 60% buy vouchers at retail.<ref name=\"Northstream\">Time to Top-Up the Prepaid User Experience: How an effective top-up strategy can improve operator performance metrics and accelerate mobile payments.

This comes from the fact that many fossilized ''Gigantopithecus'' teeth contain eroded enamel, most likely the result of a diet that contained high amounts of acidic fruit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014-01-18|title=Real King Kong may have been brought down by fruit|url= |journal=New Scientist|language=en|volume=221|issue=2952|pages=14|doi=10.1016/S0262-4079(14)60117-2|issn=0262-4079}}</ref>\n\n==Extinction==\n''Gigantopithecus'' may have become extinct approximately 300,000&nbsp;years ago, suggestions have been made that the climate change during the Pleistocene era changed the plants from forest to [[savanna]], and their food supply of fruits decreased.

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''Station to Station'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

It was released in January 1976 as the title track and opener of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'', as well as on a promotional [[Gramophone record|7-inch single]] in France the same month. Co-produced by Bowie and [[Harry Maslin]], it was written and recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975. At over 10&nbsp;minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording. Opening with a train-like noise, the song's first half is a slow march, built around an atonal guitar riff, while the second half takes the form of a [[Progressive rock|prog]]-[[disco]] suite that's in a different key and tempo than the first. The song dabbles in [[art rock]] and is influenced by the German electronic bands [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Tangerine Dream]].\n\nLyrically, the song introduces Bowie's sinister persona [[the Thin White Duke]], who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, throughout 1976, often the embodiment of Bowie himself. During the recording, Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs such as [[cocaine]], which is referenced directly throughout the song. \"Station to Station\" also makes references to the [[Kabbalah]], [[occultism]], [[gnosticism]], [[paranoia]] and other fixations that affected Bowie's mind at the time. The opening sound effect is a [[red herring]] meant to represent the [[Stations of the Cross]], along with a juncture connecting two different stages of his career; it combined the [[funk]] and [[Soul music|soul]] of his previous album ''[[Young Americans]]'' with the experimental sound he would take on his [[Berlin Trilogy]].\n\n\"Station to Station\" has received acclaim from music critics, who have praised the performance of the band and Bowie himself. Retrospectively, it has been named one of Bowie's greatest songs and, like its parent album, is seen as the indicator of where Bowie's career was heading at the time. He performed the track throughout the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]], often in character as the Thin White Duke, and continued to perform it on different tours throughout his career. It was remastered, along with its parent album, as part of the box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' in 2016.\n\n==Composition==\n\"Station to Station\" was recorded at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles between September and November 1975.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} During the song's recording, Bowie starved himself of all nutrients except [[milk]], red peppers, and [[cocaine]].<ref name=\"NME\">{{cite web |last1=Barker |first1=Emily |title=David Bowie's 40 greatest songs \u2013 as decided by ''NME'' and friends |url=https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |website=[[NME]] |accessdate=16 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20191103063248/https://www.nme.com/photos/david-bowie-s-40-greatest-songs-as-decided-by-nme-and-friends-1418012 |archivedate=3 November 2019 |date=8 January 2018}}</ref> Bowie would recall later that he could not remember recording the album at all, other than a memory of standing with lead guitarist [[Earl Slick]] in the studio and asking him to play a [[Chuck Berry]]-style riff in the same key throughout the opening of \"Station to Station\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=234}} At over 10 minutes in length, it is Bowie's longest studio recording.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} Structurally, the song builds from a droning, guitar-driven introductory portion that mimics a train building up speed.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Following the train noise, the band begins to awaken, with percussion and keyboards playing chords in and out of key before the entire band erupts.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} What follows is a \"slow, hypnotic instrumental march\", led by an atonal guitar riff played by Bowie and Slick with syncopated accents across three bars in {{music|time|4|4}} and one in {{music|time|2|4}}.<ref name=\"Light RS\" />{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The march lasts for more than three minutes before Bowie begins his vocals.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> After several verses, at the five-minute mark, a thud of drums signals a change of tempo and key and the band erupts into a prog-disco \"celebratory groove\" which lasts for the rest of the track.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /><ref name=\"Needham Guardian\">{{cite web |last1=Needham |first1=Alex |title=My favorite album: ''Station to Station'' by David Bowie |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |website=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=14 March 2020 |date=16 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190406095256/https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/sep/16/station-station-david-bowie |archive-date=6 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Doggett likens the section to a [[progressive rock]] suite by the 1970s bands [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} Like the album, the entire song dabbles in [[art rock]].<ref name=\"AllMusic album\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=1 August 2019|quote=At its heart, ''Station to Station'' is an avant-garde art-rock album, most explicitly on 'TVC 15' and the epic sprawl of the title track|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe train sound effect was created by Slick using [[Flanging|flangers]] and delay effects.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} The noise pans from right to left across the stereo channels before \"disappearing into a tunnel\" using [[feedback]].{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=287}} According to biographer [[Nicholas Pegg]], the effect \"acknowledges\" the influence of the 1974 album ''[[Autobahn (album)|Autobahn]]'' by the German [[Electronic music|electronic]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which begins with a car starting up and driving across the stereo speakers.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Pegg believes another influence is from [[Edgar Froese]] of the German electronic band [[Tangerine Dream]], whom Bowie befriended during his \"Berlin\" years; Froese's 1975 album ''[[Epsilon in Malaysian Pale]]'' also begins with a train sound effect.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} However, he notes that the train is a [[red herring]] in that it expresses what Bowie later called \"the album's 'wayward spiritual search'.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} More specifically, it reinstates the \"travelling metaphor\" of earlier compositions: \"the stations recall the 'new surroundings' of \"[[Rock 'n' Roll with Me]]\" [from ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''], and the \"mountains on mountains\" reprise the questing motifs of \"[[Wild Eyed Boy from Freecloud]]\" [from ''[[David Bowie (1969 album)|David Bowie]]'' (1969)] and ''[[The Man Who Sold the World]]''.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Bowie would later state, \"the 'Station to Station' track itself is very much concerned with the [[Stations of the Cross]]\",<ref name=Q97X /> the sequence of 14 landmarks on [[Jesus|Christ]]'s path to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]], each a symbolic stopping-point for prayer.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=468}} Stuart Berman of ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]'' supports this, saying: \"the title track's momentous prog-disco suite&nbsp;[...] charts a course from spiritual void toward ecstatic religious reawakening.\"<ref name=\"Berman Pitchfork\">{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Stuart|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|title=David Bowie: ''Station to Station'' (Deluxe Edition)|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=22 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021073153/http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/14687-station-to-station-deluxe-edition/|archive-date=21 October 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> Another possible influence is guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] of the English rock band [[Led Zeppelin]]. Page was a session musician on Bowie's earliest recordings and had been an occasional acquaintance ever since.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} During the same time Bowie became dependant on cocaine, Page had become dependant on [[heroin]] which, according to Pegg, was \"even more fearful\" than Bowie's addiction.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Led Zeppelin's ''[[Physical Graffiti]]'' was released in March 1975,<ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Physical Graffiti|others=[[Led Zeppelin]]|year=1975|publisher=[[Swan Song Records]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=SSK 894007}}</ref> months ahead of the ''Station to Station'' sessions.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Pegg writes: \"It's possible to discern in [\"Station to Station\"] a distinct flavour of the groove, tempo and sense of building tension created by the famous rising riff of ''Physical Graffiti''<nowiki/>'s standout track '[[Kashmir (song)|Kashmir]]'\", an epic track that evokes a \"troubled spiritual journey\" through its music and lyrics.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n[[File:The Thin White Duke 76.jpg|thumb|160px|left|alt=David Bowie performing in 1976 and in character as the Thin White Duke|Bowie in character as the Thin White Duke performing on the [[Isolar \u2013 1976 Tour|1976 Isolar Tour]].]]\n\"Station to Station\" introduces Bowie's persona [[the Thin White Duke]], a sinister figure who became the mouthpiece for ''Station to Station'' and, often throughout 1976, for Bowie himself.<ref>{{cite web |last=Light |first=Alan |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |title=How David Bowie Brought Thin White Duke to Life on 'Station to Station' |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040904/https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/how-david-bowie-brought-thin-white-duke-to-life-on-station-to-station-125797/ |archive-date=27 December 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=467}} The persona was noticeably darker than Bowie's previous characters, being described as \"a mad aristocrat\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} an \"amoral zombie\",{{sfn|Buckley|2000|p=258}} and \"an emotionless ''[[Aryan race|Aryan]]'' superman\".{{sfn|Pegg|2004|pp=297\u2013300}} For Bowie himself, the Duke was \"a nasty character indeed\".{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=24}} The lyrics themselves contain very cryptic messages. Author [[Peter Doggett]] believes the main themes of the track are magic, the arts of legendary musicians, both real and fictitious, the [[Kabbalah]]'s mythical account of progress from Kether to Malkuth, love and cocaine.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett further argues: \"just as [the ''[[Hunky Dory]]'' track] \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" offered a catalogue of avenues open to the inquisitive imagination of David Bowie circa 1971, so \"Station to Station\" present a more confused medley of the themes that were haunting his nightmares in the final weeks of 1975.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\nThe Duke introduces himself by saying \"the return of the Thin White Duke/throwing darts in lovers' eyes.\"<ref name=\"Needham Guardian\" /> Darts, or arrows, are interpreted to be a symbol of direction revealing the dynamic of the True Will.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Doggett argues that other than the Thin White Duke, another duke was at the heart of the action: [[Prospero]], the Duke of [[Milan]] and protagonist of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=285}} He writes that Prospero, like the Thin White Duke, is a \"master of magic\", who can control elements while \"lost in my [magic] circle\", as well as cast spells over \"lovers' eyes\" (mirroring throwing darts), as Prospero does with his daughter [[Miranda (The Tempest)|Miranda]] and her lover [[Ferdinand (The Tempest)|Ferdinand]] over the course of the play.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=285\u2013286}} Fixation with the English [[occultist]] [[Aleister Crowley]] is evident in such phrases as \"[[White Stains|white stains]]\", the name of a book of poetry by Crowley,{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=7}} who was previously mentioned by Bowie on \"Quicksand\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=469}} Other references include the 13th century Jewish mystical system known as the Kabbalah and [[gnosticism]].<ref name=Q97X>{{cite book| last=Cavanagh | first=David | title=ChangesFiftyBowie | journal=[[Q (magazine)|Q magazine]] |date=February 1997 | pages=52\u201359}}</ref> Bowie would later claim in 1997: \"All the references within [\"Station to Station\"] have to do with the Kabbalah.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}} Once the song changes into the prog-disco section, the lyrics become brighter. Punctuated by the refrain \"It's too late\",{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} Bowie enters a landscape of \"mountains and sunbirds\".{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Themes in this section include drug use, as presented in the lyrics \"It's not the side effects of the cocaine/I'm thinking that it must be love\",{{sfn|Wilcken|2005|p=9}} which he sings in a joyous tone.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Other themes present on the track are [[paranoia]] and odd fixations that were present in Bowie's mind at the time are also recurring themes.<ref name=\"Light RS\" /> At different points Bowie declares \"the European canon (or cannon) is here\", which Doggett believes is a \"pretentious way\" of summarising Bowie's interest in Kraftwerk and [[Brechtian]] theatre.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=286}}\n\n==Release and reception==\n\"Station to Station\" was released as the opening title track to Bowie's tenth studio album [[Station to Station|of the same name]] on 23&nbsp;January 1976.<ref name=\"AllMusic album\" /><ref>{{cite AV media notes|title=Station to Station|others=[[David Bowie]]|year=1976|publisher=[[RCA Records|RCA Victor]]|location=UK|type=liner notes|id=APL1 1327}}</ref> The song was also released as a [[promotional single]] (as 42549 A) in January 1976 in France by [[RCA Records]], with a shortened duration of&nbsp;3:40 and \"[[TVC 15]]\" as the B-side.<ref name=\"single liner notes\" /> The single version begins at the central section of the song with the drums just prior to the \"once there were mountains...\" lyric.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=470}} The single edit appears on the 2010 Deluxe Edition of ''Station to Station'' and on ''Re:Call&nbsp;2'', as part of the 2016 box set ''[[Who Can I Be Now?

He rode from 1952 to 1968, winning 105 races as a professional. He won the national road championship four times - 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was also world road champion in 1962, and won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 1958.\n\n==Biography==\nJean Stablinski was the son of Polish immigrants in the mining area of the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] department of France. His father died in a work accident in 1946 and Jean, at 14, started working in the mine to provide income for his family. It was at this time that he won a bicycle in an accordion competition. Legend says that his mother was so displeased by her son's new hobby that she damaged his bike.\n\nJean, still known as Stablewski, became naturalised as French at 16 and rode his first races. It was while riding the [[Peace Race]] that a journalist's error in writing his name 'Stablinski' created the surname by which he became known.\n\n==Professional career==\nStablinski turned professional at 21. From 1958 until 1967 he rode in the same teams as [[Jacques Anquetil]], always as a support rider, or domestique. Stablinski won the national road championship four times and came second twice, all within six years, an achievement no rider has matched.\n\nStablinski stayed with Anquetil until his team-mate wrote a series of newspaper articles, one of which Stablinski believed criticised him even though he had devoted his career to Anquetil. The two rarely spoke after that and Stablinski joined the team headed by Anquetil's biggest rival, [[Raymond Poulidor]].\n\nStablinski was recognised as a rider who made up for physical limitations by his tactical sense and his chance to profit from the moment. His knack, riders recognised, was to recognise which breakaway attempt would count and not to waste effort on the others.\n\nStablinski was twice suspended for doping.\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:Jean STABLINSKI.jpg|thumb|Stablinski in 1997]]\nStablinski retired from racing and was for six years manager of the Sonolor-Lejeune, signing [[Lucien Van Impe]] and [[Bernard Hinault]] as young unknowns. His son, Jacques Stablinski, born 1956, also became a professional cyclist and rode for [[Gitane-Campagnolo]]. He became known as \"Petit Stab\" but never had his father's talent.\n\nJean Stablinski never stopped riding a bike until the illness that led to his death. He said he never put a drinks bottle on his bike when he rode for pleasure. He had spent too many years racing as a professional with no chance to stop and look around or to meet people, he told the historian Jean-Paul Ollivier on French television. If he had no water on his bike but a few euros in his pocket, he could stop and buy a drink at any bar he fancied and get into conversation with whomever he met.\n\nHe became a member of [[Paris\u2013Roubaix#Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix|Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix]], enthusiasts and workers for the spring classic. It was Stablinski who suggested the cobbled path through the Arenberg forest.

22 July 2007), known as '''Jean Stablinski''', was a French professional cyclist from a family of Polish immigrants. He rode from 1952 to 1968, winning 105 races as a professional. He won the national road championship four times - 1960, 1962, 1963 and 1964. He was also world road champion in 1962, and won the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 1958.\n\n==Biography==\nJean Stablinski was the son of Polish immigrants in the mining area of the [[Nord (French department)|Nord]] department of France. His father died in a work accident in 1946 and Jean, at 14, started working in the mine to provide income for his family. It was at this time that he won a bicycle in an accordion competition. Legend says that his mother was so displeased by her son's new hobby that she damaged his bike.\n\nJean, still known as Stablewski, became naturalised as French at 16 and rode his first races. It was while riding the [[Peace Race]] that a journalist's error in writing his name 'Stablinski' created the surname by which he became known.\n\n==Professional career==\nStablinski turned professional at 21. From 1958 until 1967 he rode in the same teams as [[Jacques Anquetil]], always as a support rider, or domestique. Stablinski won the national road championship four times and came second twice, all within six years, an achievement no rider has matched.\n\nStablinski stayed with Anquetil until his team-mate wrote a series of newspaper articles, one of which Stablinski believed criticised him even though he had devoted his career to Anquetil. The two rarely spoke after that and Stablinski joined the team headed by Anquetil's biggest rival, [[Raymond Poulidor]].\n\nStablinski was recognised as a rider who made up for physical limitations by his tactical sense and his chance to profit from the moment. His knack, riders recognised, was to recognise which breakaway attempt would count and not to waste effort on the others.\n\nStablinski was twice suspended for doping.\n\n==Retirement==\n[[File:Jean STABLINSKI.jpg|thumb|Stablinski in 1997]]\nStablinski retired from racing and was for six years manager of the Sonolor-Lejeune, signing [[Lucien Van Impe]] and [[Bernard Hinault]] as young unknowns. His son, Jacques Stablinski, born 1956, also became a professional cyclist and rode for [[Gitane-Campagnolo]]. He became known as \"Petit Stab\" but never had his father's talent.\n\nJean Stablinski never stopped riding a bike until the illness that led to his death. He said he never put a drinks bottle on his bike when he rode for pleasure. He had spent too many years racing as a professional with no chance to stop and look around or to meet people, he told the historian Jean-Paul Ollivier on French television. If he had no water on his bike but a few euros in his pocket, he could stop and buy a drink at any bar he fancied and get into conversation with whomever he met.\n\nHe became a member of [[Paris\u2013Roubaix#Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix|Les Amis de Paris\u2013Roubaix]], enthusiasts and workers for the spring classic. It was Stablinski who suggested the cobbled path through the Arenberg forest. His qualifications were impeccable: as a miner he had worked beneath the road and as a cyclist he had ridden along it.\n\nHe died after a long illness. On 7 April 2008 he was remembered by a memorial beside the [[Paris\u2013Roubaix#18 - Trou\u00e9e d'Arenberg|Wallers-Arenberg]] road he had introduced to [[Paris\u2013Roubaix]]. The memorial was made in blue limestone from [[Soignies]] by the sculptor Michel Karpovitch.\n\n==Major results==\n{{div col}}\n; 1954\n: 1st [[Paris\u2013Bourges]]\n;1957\n: 1st Stage 12 [[1957 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1958\n: 1st [[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]] Overall [[1958 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n::1st Stages 5a ([[Team time trial|TTT]]) & 8\n;1960\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 13 [[1960 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]\n;1961\n: 1st Stage 7 [[1961 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1962\n: 1st [[File:Jersey rainbow.svg|20px]] [[1962 UCI Road World Championships \u2013 Men's road race|Road race]], [[1962 UCI Road World Championships|UCI Road World Championships]]\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 14 [[1962 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n: 1st Stage 11 [[1962 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n;1963\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st [[Paris\u2013Brussels]]\n: 1st Stage 10 [[1963 Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a|Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a]]\n: 1st Stage 4 [[1963 Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9|Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 Lib\u00e9r\u00e9]]\n;1964\n: 1st [[File:MaillotFra.PNG|20px]] [[French National Road Race Championships|Road race]], National Road Championships\n: 1st Stage 21 [[1964 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n;1965\n: 1st [[File:Jersey yellow.svg|20px]] Overall [[Tour of Belgium]]\n: 1st [[Rund um den Henninger-Turm]]\n: 1st [[Trofeo Baracchi]] (with [[Jacques Anquetil]])\n: 1st Stage 4 [[Grand Prix du Midi Libre]]\n;1966\n: 1st [[1966 Amstel Gold Race|Amstel Gold Race]]\n;1967\n: 1st Stage 19 [[1967 Tour de France|Tour de France]]\n: 1st Stage 8 [[1967 Giro d'Italia|Giro d'Italia]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal| last = Judycki| first = Zbigniew| authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Jean Stabli\u0144ski (1932-2007)| journal = Forum Polonijne | volume = 3 | issue = 2007 | pages = 30 | publisher = | date = | url = | doi = | issn = 1234-2807 | accessdate =  }}\n\n==External links==\n*{{Cycling Archives|6716}}\n*[http://histo.letour.fr/HISTO/us/TDF/coureur/3340.html Official Tour de France results for Jean Stablinski]\n\n{{UCI Road World Champions \u2013 Men's road race}}\n{{Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a winners}}\n{{French National Road Race Championships (men) |state=collapsed}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stablinski, Jean}}\n[[Category:1932 births]]\n[[Category:2007 deaths]]\n[[Category:French male cyclists]]\n[[Category:French Tour de France stage winners]]\n[[Category:French people of Polish descent]]\n[[Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a winners]]\n[[Category:French Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a stage winners]]\n[[Category:French Giro d'Italia stage winners]]\n[[Category:UCI Road World Champions (elite men)]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Valenciennes]]\n[[Category:Knights of the National Order of Merit (France)]]\n[[Category:Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a cyclists]]\n[[Category:Tour de France cyclists]]\n[[Category:Giro d'Italia cyclists]]\n", "name_user": "Lepricavark", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added short description", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Stablinski"}

most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Conceived by writer/illustrator [[Rob Liefeld]], the team first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#New Mutants Vol. 1|New Mutants]]'' #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called ''X-Force''. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the [[New Mutants]].\n\nX-Force's first leader was the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. An offshoot of the [[X-Men]], X-Force takes a more [[Militant (word)|militant]] and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men.\n\nAn alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' as part of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. A planned X-Force film adaption by [[20th Century Fox]] was in production as of 2018; however, as of now production was stopped after [[Disney]] bought 20th Century Fox.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Publication===\nThe ''X-Force'' series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success. Low sales on the ''X-Force'' series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. ''X-Force'' was canceled with #129 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]],'' which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After ''X-Statix'' was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] plotted and drawn by Liefeld.\n\nIn 2007\u20132008, during the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]], a new version of the X-Force team was formed with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] leading a more militaristic [[black ops]] branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]], plus [[Clayton Crain]] as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]] storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' with [[Rick Remender]] and [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] as the creative team and Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], [[Deadpool]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Fantomex]], and [[Fantomex|E.V.A.]] as the initial roster.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a243865/marvel-reveals-uncanny-x-force-team.html |title=Comics \u2013 News \u2013 Marvel reveals 'Uncanny X-Force' team |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Uncanny X-Force'' series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as ''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 as part of [[Marvel NOW!]], with a new team led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled \"Vendetta\". A new ''X-Force'' (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], written by ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' writer [[Simon Spurrier]].<ref name=\"ComicBookResources\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48983 |title=Spurrier, Kim's Adjectiveless \"X-Force\" Launches in February |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 1: 1991\u20132001===\n\n====Liefeld period====\nX-Force was created by illustrator Rob Liefeld after he started penciling ''[[The New Mutants]]'' comic book in 1989 with #86. The popularity of Liefeld's art led to him taking over the plotting duties on the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With help from writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], who provided the dialogue for Liefeld's plots, Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X-Force in ''New Mutants'' #100, the book's final issue. Liefeld and Nicieza launched ''X-Force'' in August 1991. Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release. With the aid of a multiple-variant poly-bagged card, the book sold a record 5 million copies{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, and remains the second highest selling American comic book of all time, surpassed only by Jim Lee's X-Men book that same summer with 8 million copies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The original line-up of the team included [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Shatterstar]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]; [[Siryn]] was added to the team in the third issue.\n\nThe main opponents of X-Force during its first year were the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant Liberation Front]], led by [[Stryfe]], a masked mutant with a mysterious link to Cable. Early issues also featured the wise-cracking mercenary [[Deadpool]], the immortal [[Externals]], and a new version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n\nPropelled by Liefeld's art, ''X-Force'' became one of Marvel's bestselling comic books immediately after its debut. The series rivaled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'' in popularity, particularly with the adolescent demographic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Toy Biz]] responded to X-Force's popularity by introducing an X-Force action figure line alongside its X-Men action figure line. Liefeld illustrated the series up to #9 and stopped plotting it after #11, as he had become increasingly frustrated with not owning characters he created and that his art was being used on a variety of [[Product (business)|merchandise]] while he allegedly received little [[royalties]]. Along with six other popular Marvel artists, Liefeld left Marvel Comics in 1992 to form [[Image Comics]].\n\n====Nicieza period====\n''X-Force'' continued with Nicieza taking over creative control of the series. Nicieza soon had the team break away from Cable and moved them to a new base in the ruins of Warpath's childhood home at the Camp Verde reservation; he also had former New Mutants [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Rictor]] join the team. The series crossed over with most other X-Men related books in the fall of 1992 with the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' storyline, co-plotted by Nicieza (who was also writing ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men vol. 2]]''). In that story, Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X-Men's founder [[Professor X]], leading to a clash between the X-Men and X-Force. The crossover boosted Cable's popularity, despite the character's apparent death in ''X-Force'' #18, leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993.\n\nAfter ''X-Cutioner's Song'', ''X-Force'' continued under Nicieza with new artist [[Greg Capullo]]. With Cannonball taking over as leader, X-Force develop an identity of their own as an independent team. Cable would return in the ''Fatal Attractions'' crossover, with a less hardline leadership stance. Capullo departed from the series at this point, first succeeded by Matt Broome and then [[Tony Daniel]]. The team grew into a dysfunctional family, and the title regularly combined soap opera plot threads, such as romance and Siryn's alcoholism, with violent action. Nicieza fleshed out previously unknown elements of each character's history, including Siryn's family in Ireland,<ref>''X-Force'' #31 (February 1994)</ref> Rictor's in Mexico,<ref>''X-Force'' #34 (May 1994)</ref> Cannonball's in Kentucky,<ref>''X-Force'' #37 (August 1994)</ref> and Shatterstar's in Mojoworld.<ref>''X-Force'' #29\u201330 (December 1993 \u2013 January 1994)</ref> This period also saw reappearances of characters from the group's New Mutants days, such as [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]],<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> [[Danielle Moonstar]],<ref>''X-Force'' #27 & 43 and ''X-Force 1994 Annual''<!--dates needed--></ref> and [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].<ref>''X-Force'' #38 (September 1994)</ref> In issue #40 the team moved to a new underground base beneath Manhattan, formerly belonging to the supervillain Arcade. A long-simmering sub-plot about [[Reignfire]] and the disappearance of Sunspot came to a climax just as the book went on hiatus for the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' crossover event in 1995, ending on a cliffhanger.\n\n====Loeb period====\n''X-Force'' was radically overhauled in the wake of ''Age of Apocalypse'' from issue #44, with a new creative team of writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and illustrator [[Adam Pollina]]. The in-progress Reignfire story was apparently resolved off-panel between issues, and the team's Manhattan base was abruptly blown up in the ''X-Men Prime'' one-shot special. As part of a general editorial push to more closely integrate the various X-Men books, Loeb had the team move in with the X-Men at the [[X-Mansion]] and effectively become the X-Men's junior team, complete with introducing new uniforms modelled on the X-Men. Loeb's first issue also saw Cannonball and Rictor written out of the series, with Cannonball \u201cgraduating\u201d to the X-Men and Rictor quitting; [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a super-strong [[albinism|albino]] mutant who possessed the mind of a child, joined the team. Stories in this period generally toned down the series' levels of action and violence. The character Boomer (formerly Boom-Boom) also changed her codename to Meltdown and adopted a new aggressive attitude. Loeb's final story, the three-part ''Shatterstar Saga'', brought Rictor back to the team; it also ambiguously retconned Shatterstar's origins in a manner that was generally regarded as unnecessarily confusing.\n\n====Moore period====\nIn 1997, writer [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] took over the series and began revisiting plot developments that had been left ignored throughout Loeb's run, including Dani Moonstar infiltrating the MLF and the true perpetrator of the Camp Verde massacre. Following the ''Operation Zero Tolerance'' storyline, the team effectively disbanded in issue #70, and Cable, Caliban, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar were written out of the series. The next year's worth of issues followed the remaining cast members Meltdown, Siryn, Sunspot, Warpath and Danielle Moonstar on a road trip across America. During this time James Proudstar was able to get closure on the massacre of his tribe, and subsequently stopped using the codename Warpath. The Reignfire story was also followed up on, with a new and more complete explanation for what had actually happened during Sunspot's disappearance. Former team members Cable, Cannonball, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar all made one-off reappearances, as did New Mutants characters Karma and Skids.\n\nIn 1998, Moore and new artist [[Jim Cheung]] had X-Force move into new headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], returned Cannonball and later Domino to the team, and added [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], a mutant who could disrupt electronic equipment; they also gained a new ally in sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]]. A new major antagonist came to prominence in the Damocles Foundation, an organisation founded by rogue Deviants, Eternals and humans. Former New Mutant Magma also reappeared as an antagonist. Dani Moonstar acquired new superpowers, being able to manipulate quantum energies. Towards the end of the run, Siryn and Sunspot left the team and continued as recurring guests. The 1999 annual centred around Rictor and Shatterstar, showing what they had been doing since leaving the team together.\n\nSales steadily declined throughout this period, falling from selling over 100,000 copies per issue<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1996/1996-12.html</ref> to between forty and fifty thousand by the end of Moore's run with issue #100.<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2000/2000-01.html</ref> A similar sales decline was observed in other ancillary X-Men titles including ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man''.\n\n====Counter-X====\nWriter [[Warren Ellis]], known for his dark, cynical style, was put in charge of revamping ''X-Force'' along with ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man'' under the branding '''Counter-X''', as part of the '''[[Revolution (Marvel Comics)|Revolution]]''' revamp of the various X-Men titles in 2000. Ellis' stint on ''X-Force'' over issues #102\u2013115, co-written by [[Ian Edginton]] and illustrated by [[Whilce Portacio]], saw Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown, and Warpath become a [[Covert operation|covert ops]] superhero team under the leadership of [[Pete Wisdom]], a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning blades of energy from his fingers. Despite the changes in creators, sales continued to decline at the same rate.<ref>[http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 CBGXtra.com \u2013 Comics Sales Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110315/http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref> The run concluded with Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown and Warpath all appearing to die in an explosion, although all were revealed to be alive soon after.\n\nIn early 2001, the ''X-Force'' title was completely reimagined by writer [[Peter Milligan]] and artist [[Mike Allred]], who replaced the existing incarnation of the team with an entirely different group of mutants using the X-Force name. Issue #116 saw the introduction of a new, sardonically toned X-Force consisting of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be media superstars. ''X-Force'' was canceled with issue #129 in late 2002 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]]'' in late 2002.\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 2: 2004-2005===\nIn 2004, Marvel released a new six-issue ''X-Force''. Some controversy arose from Liefeld's insertion of over ten pages from previous unpublished comic books (''Weapon X'' and ''Cable: First Contact'') with word balloons edited to make them fit the ''X-Force'' storyline.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It was subsequently followed with a four-issue prequel ''X-Force: Shatterstar'' [[miniseries]].\n\n[[Image:X-Force-1-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''X-Force'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2008); art by [[Clayton Crain]]]]\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 3: 2008\u20132010===\nA new ''X-Force'' ongoing series was launched in February 2008, written by [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] and drawn by [[Clayton Crain]].\n\n[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] forms a black ops incarnation of X-Force that uses lethal force to permanently deal with threats against mutants.

The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by [[Matthew Risman]] and the mysterious [[Eli Bard]]. They attach Bastion's head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their \"holy war\" against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch [[Magus (Marvel Comics)|Magus]] from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Graydon Creed]], by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: [[Donald Pierce]] and the [[Leper Queen]].\n\nDuring X-Force's raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir's and Angel's blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers' custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel's wings to the Purifiers.\n\nElixir heals both his and Angel's wounds, then discovers that Angel's wings aren't organic and can't be regrown. Angel transforms into [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers' base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel's stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed \"The Choir\". X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers' base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine \"unacceptable\" and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force's targets should be next.<ref>X-Force #1\u20136</ref>\n\n====Old Ghosts====\nOnce X-Force regroups at Angel's Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] to erase Elixir's memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target.\n\nIt is revealed that [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of [[Mister Sinister]]'s that held an altered version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by [[The Right (comics)|The Right]]'s shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.<ref>X-Force #7\u201310</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe's reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother's grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the [[Demon Bear]]. Just as he's about to be killed, Warpath is saved by [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath's tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>X-Force #11</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he's in the process of tracking down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] determines Cable's exact location in the timestream. [[Morlocks (comics)|Fever Pitch]] loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen's base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine's protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.<ref>X-Force #12\u201313</ref>\n\n====Messiah War====\n{{See also|Messiah War}}\nX-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] has been defeated, and [[Stryfe]] controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe.\n\n====Not Forgotten====\n''Not Forgotten'' takes place directly after X-Force's return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] from being killed by the [[Leper Queen]]. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by [[Kimura (character)|Kimura]], wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While inside the room, X-23 cuts the claws out of her severed arm and gives them to Morales for safekeeping. She lights a Molotov cocktail of sorts which sets the sprinkler system off. The Facility soldiers finish cutting through to Laura just as Kimura realizes the sprinklers are spraying the Trigger Scent everywhere. X-23 goes feral and kills all the soldiers in her way. She gets to the Facility head's office just as the sprinklers start spraying water, washing away the scent. Kimura manages to club Laura from behind and then kills the Facility head, planning on framing Laura for it. Agent Morales arrives and sets Kimura on fire to distract her while she and Laura make her escape. Morales reveals she rigged the place to explode and they get out in time. The rest of X-Force arrives and takes Laura and her severed claws home, leading into the events of Necrosha.\n\n====Necrosha====\n{{main|Necrosha}}\nX-Force is involved in the battle against Selene's resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene.\n\nThey arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath's tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead.\n\n====X-Men: Second Coming====\n{{main|X-Men: Second Coming}}\nX-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time-traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope's mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn't regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she's out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Volume 4===\n====Dirty/Tricks====\nThe new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga's headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga's base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga's henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn't really there\u2014Dr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him everyday and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga's base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super-charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga's spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won't tell Cable.\n\n====Hide/Fear====\nCable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by [[Pete Wisdom]], [[Meggan]], and [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]] from [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]].<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 8</ref> Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga's tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there's a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants,<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 9</ref> who also kidnapped Domino.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 7</ref> This series also [[retcon]]s multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existence\u2014even setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or [[deus ex machina]].<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #300</ref> Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a viscous cycle, almost like a [[time loop]], until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot's body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 10</ref>\n\n====Ends/Means====\nThe team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex's consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII).<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11</ref> Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\"/> It turns out Yellow Eye is actually [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don't have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn't have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga's super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12</ref> However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13</ref> Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme's powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\"/> After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope's body, then Hopes copies Marrow's healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn't look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14</ref> The team doesn't think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\"/> Hope, using Dr. Nemesis's super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn't believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they \"fired\" Cable from the team.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15</ref>\n\n==''X-Force'' roster==\n\n===Volume 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   \n|- \n!Issues !!

[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997.\n\n==The original X-Force==\nBefore the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #9\u201310 (1990).\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the alternate reality of the \"Days of Future Now\" storyline, the X-Force consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] and [[Omega Red]].\n\nIn X-Men '92, X-Force members are: Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel and Bishop.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Animation===\nX-Force is mentioned for the first time outside of the comics in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In the second episode, [[Professor X]] briefly mentions that X-Force has encountered the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]]. No other information is given about the team, other than that they gave the X-Men all their intel about the villains.\n\nIn an early episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' the duo vandalize their neighbor's house by painting \"X-FORCE RULES\" on it.\n\n===Film===\n{{main|X-Men (film series)#Abandoned films}}\n[[20th Century Fox]] are developing a film version of ''X-Force''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/xforce-movie-in-the-works/|title='X-Force' movie in the works at Fox.|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.com/whois/x-forcemovie.com|title=Whois x-forcemovie.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/12/fox-to-use-comic-con-as-launching-pad-for-wider-x-men-universe-x-force-film-included/|title=Fox To Use Comic-Con As Launching Pad For Wider X-Men Movie Universe, X-Force Film Included|date=12 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> On July 11, 2013, it was reported that [[Jeff Wadlow]] has been hired to write and direct the adaptation.

All team members except Deadpool and Domino are killed off one by one, in humorously grisly fashion, briefly after the start of their very first mission, when they parachute into such obstacles as a bus (Bedlam), helicopter blades (Shatterstar), a wood-chipper (Zeitgeist), electric cables (the Vanisher) and being vomited on by Zeitgeist's mutant acid vomit (Peter). In the [[post-credits scene]], however, Deadpool uses Cable's time-travel device to travel back in time and successfully prevents Peter, who he has come to like, from meeting his gruesome end.\n\nFollowing the release of ''Deadpool 2'' in May 2018, co-writer [[Rhett Reese]] confirmed the ''X-Force'' movie will be an R-rated take on [[X-Men]] and will have \"all the sex, violence, and silliness one would expect from the Deadpool-skewed militarized mutant force\". Reese said \"they can get their hands dirty a little bit. There's more gray area. It'll be raunchier, it'll be rated R, I'm sure.

They are shown celebrating Deadpool's victory over [[Galactus]] alongside Cable, [[Bob, Agent of HYDRA]] and several Capcom characters.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\nIn April 2010, the popular Web comic [[Homestar Runner]] featured a parody titled ''Xeriouxly Forxe'', in which all of the site's main characters except Homsar were re-designed to look like X-Men.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.com/comics/X-Men X-Men comics on Marvel.com]\n*[http://www.milehighcomics.com/firstlook/marvel/xforce1/ ''X-Force,'' vol. 2

[[superhero]]es appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], most commonly in association with the [[X-Men]]. Conceived by writer/illustrator [[Rob Liefeld]], the team first appeared in ''[[New Mutants#New Mutants Vol. 1|New Mutants]]'' #100 (April 1991) and soon afterwards was featured in its own series called ''X-Force''. The group was originally a revamped version of the 1980s team, the [[New Mutants]].\n\nX-Force's first leader was the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]. An offshoot of the [[X-Men]], X-Force takes a more [[Militant (word)|militant]] and aggressive approach towards its enemies compared to the X-Men.\n\nAn alternate incarnation of X-Force appears in the 2018 film ''[[Deadpool 2]]'' as part of the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]]. A planned X-Force film adaption by [[20th Century Fox]] was in production as of 2018; however, as of now production was stopped after [[Disney]] bought 20th Century Fox.\n\n==Publication history==\n===Publication===\nThe ''X-Force'' series was successful in the early 1990s, but its popularity waned after Liefeld left, which caused Marvel to implement several reforms to the title from 1995 until 2001 with varying degrees of success. Low sales on the ''X-Force'' series eventually prompted Marvel to revamp the title in 2001 with a new cast in the form of a group of self-interested young mutants who were gathered together by a corporation to become media stars and used the name X-Force. ''X-Force'' was canceled with #129 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]],'' which coincided with a similar rebranding of the team in the story. After ''X-Statix'' was canceled with #26, Marvel reunited the original X-Force team for a six-issue 2004 [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] plotted and drawn by Liefeld.\n\nIn 2007\u20132008, during the ''[[X-Men: Messiah Complex|Messiah Complex]]'' [[Crossover (fiction)|crossover]], a new version of the X-Force team was formed with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] leading a more militaristic [[black ops]] branch of the X-Men. This squad would form the basis for a new X-Force series starting February 2008 by writers [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]], plus [[Clayton Crain]] as the artist. The series came to a conclusion in September 2010 as part of the [[X-Men: Second Coming|Second Coming]] storyline that ran through various X-titles. The title was then relaunched in October 2010 as ''[[Uncanny X-Force]]'' with [[Rick Remender]] and [[Jerome Ope\u00f1a]] as the creative team and Wolverine, [[Psylocke]], [[Deadpool]], [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], [[Fantomex]], and [[Fantomex|E.V.A.]] as the initial roster.<ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/comics/news/a243865/marvel-reveals-uncanny-x-force-team.html |title=Comics \u2013 News \u2013 Marvel reveals 'Uncanny X-Force' team |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-11}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Uncanny X-Force'' series ended at issue #35 in 2012 and was once again relaunched as ''Uncanny X-Force'' vol. 2 as part of [[Marvel NOW!]], with a new team led by [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]] and Psylocke, written by Sam Humphries. A concurrent X-Force book written by Dennis Hopeless, ''[[Cable and X-Force]]'', was released at the same time, bringing Cable back into the X-Force fold. The two series ended in 2014 after a crossover between the two titled \"Vendetta\". A new ''X-Force'' (vol. 4), was launched featuring a black ops squad composed of Cable, Psylocke, Fantomex and [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], written by ''[[X-Men: Legacy]]'' writer [[Simon Spurrier]].<ref name=\"ComicBookResources\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=48983 |title=Spurrier, Kim's Adjectiveless \"X-Force\" Launches in February |publisher=ComicBookResources |date=2013-11-07 |accessdate=2013-11-12}}</ref>\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 1: 1991\u20132001===\n\n====Liefeld period====\nX-Force was created by illustrator Rob Liefeld after he started penciling ''[[The New Mutants]]'' comic book in 1989 with #86. The popularity of Liefeld's art led to him taking over the plotting duties on the book.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} With help from writer [[Fabian Nicieza]], who provided the dialogue for Liefeld's plots, Liefeld transformed the New Mutants into X-Force in ''New Mutants'' #100, the book's final issue. Liefeld and Nicieza launched ''X-Force'' in August 1991. Rob Liefeld obtained the name for the series from an unknown artist at a convention a few months prior to its release. With the aid of a multiple-variant poly-bagged card, the book sold a record 5 million copies{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}, and remains the second highest selling American comic book of all time, surpassed only by Jim Lee's X-Men book that same summer with 8 million copies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The original line-up of the team included [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], [[Shatterstar]] and [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]]; [[Siryn]] was added to the team in the third issue.\n\nThe main opponents of X-Force during its first year were the [[terrorism|terrorist]] [[Mutant Liberation Front]], led by [[Stryfe]], a masked mutant with a mysterious link to Cable. Early issues also featured the wise-cracking mercenary [[Deadpool]], the immortal [[Externals]], and a new version of the [[Brotherhood of Mutants]].\n\nPropelled by Liefeld's art, ''X-Force'' became one of Marvel's bestselling comic books immediately after its debut. The series rivaled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''Uncanny X-Men'' in popularity, particularly with the adolescent demographic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} [[Toy Biz]] responded to X-Force's popularity by introducing an X-Force action figure line alongside its X-Men action figure line. Liefeld illustrated the series up to #9 and stopped plotting it after #11, as he had become increasingly frustrated with not owning characters he created and that his art was being used on a variety of [[Product (business)|merchandise]] while he allegedly received little [[royalties]]. Along with six other popular Marvel artists, Liefeld left Marvel Comics in 1992 to form [[Image Comics]].\n\n====Nicieza period====\n''X-Force'' continued with Nicieza taking over creative control of the series. Nicieza soon had the team break away from Cable and moved them to a new base in the ruins of Warpath's childhood home at the Camp Verde reservation; he also had former New Mutants [[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]] and [[Rictor]] join the team. The series crossed over with most other X-Men related books in the fall of 1992 with the ''[[X-Cutioner's Song]]'' storyline, co-plotted by Nicieza (who was also writing ''[[X-Men: Legacy|X-Men vol. 2]]''). In that story, Stryfe frames Cable for an assassination attempt on the X-Men's founder [[Professor X]], leading to a clash between the X-Men and X-Force. The crossover boosted Cable's popularity, despite the character's apparent death in ''X-Force'' #18, leading to his own solo series being launched in 1993.\n\nAfter ''X-Cutioner's Song'', ''X-Force'' continued under Nicieza with new artist [[Greg Capullo]]. With Cannonball taking over as leader, X-Force develop an identity of their own as an independent team. Cable would return in the ''Fatal Attractions'' crossover, with a less hardline leadership stance. Capullo departed from the series at this point, first succeeded by Matt Broome and then [[Tony Daniel]]. The team grew into a dysfunctional family, and the title regularly combined soap opera plot threads, such as romance and Siryn's alcoholism, with violent action. Nicieza fleshed out previously unknown elements of each character's history, including Siryn's family in Ireland,<ref>''X-Force'' #31 (February 1994)</ref> Rictor's in Mexico,<ref>''X-Force'' #34 (May 1994)</ref> Cannonball's in Kentucky,<ref>''X-Force'' #37 (August 1994)</ref> and Shatterstar's in Mojoworld.<ref>''X-Force'' #29\u201330 (December 1993 \u2013 January 1994)</ref> This period also saw reappearances of characters from the group's New Mutants days, such as [[Rusty Collins|Rusty]] and [[Skids (comics)|Skids]],<ref>''X-Force'' #24 (July 1993)</ref> [[Danielle Moonstar]],<ref>''X-Force'' #27 & 43 and ''X-Force 1994 Annual''<!--dates needed--></ref> and [[Cypher (comics)|Cypher]] and [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]].<ref>''X-Force'' #38 (September 1994)</ref> In issue #40 the team moved to a new underground base beneath Manhattan, formerly belonging to the supervillain Arcade. A long-simmering sub-plot about [[Reignfire]] and the disappearance of Sunspot came to a climax just as the book went on hiatus for the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' crossover event in 1995, ending on a cliffhanger.\n\n====Loeb period====\n''X-Force'' was radically overhauled in the wake of ''Age of Apocalypse'' from issue #44, with a new creative team of writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and illustrator [[Adam Pollina]]. The in-progress Reignfire story was apparently resolved off-panel between issues, and the team's Manhattan base was abruptly blown up in the ''X-Men Prime'' one-shot special. As part of a general editorial push to more closely integrate the various X-Men books, Loeb had the team move in with the X-Men at the [[X-Mansion]] and effectively become the X-Men's junior team, complete with introducing new uniforms modelled on the X-Men. Loeb's first issue also saw Cannonball and Rictor written out of the series, with Cannonball \u201cgraduating\u201d to the X-Men and Rictor quitting; [[Caliban (comics)|Caliban]], a super-strong [[albinism|albino]] mutant who possessed the mind of a child, joined the team. Stories in this period generally toned down the series' levels of action and violence. The character Boomer (formerly Boom-Boom) also changed her codename to Meltdown and adopted a new aggressive attitude. Loeb's final story, the three-part ''Shatterstar Saga'', brought Rictor back to the team; it also ambiguously retconned Shatterstar's origins in a manner that was generally regarded as unnecessarily confusing.\n\n====Moore period====\nIn 1997, writer [[John Francis Moore (comics)|John Francis Moore]] took over the series and began revisiting plot developments that had been left ignored throughout Loeb's run, including Dani Moonstar infiltrating the MLF and the true perpetrator of the Camp Verde massacre. Following the ''Operation Zero Tolerance'' storyline, the team effectively disbanded in issue #70, and Cable, Caliban, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar were written out of the series. The next year's worth of issues followed the remaining cast members Meltdown, Siryn, Sunspot, Warpath and Danielle Moonstar on a road trip across America. During this time James Proudstar was able to get closure on the massacre of his tribe, and subsequently stopped using the codename Warpath. The Reignfire story was also followed up on, with a new and more complete explanation for what had actually happened during Sunspot's disappearance. Former team members Cable, Cannonball, Domino, Rictor and Shatterstar all made one-off reappearances, as did New Mutants characters Karma and Skids.\n\nIn 1998, Moore and new artist [[Jim Cheung]] had X-Force move into new headquarters in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], returned Cannonball and later Domino to the team, and added [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]], a mutant who could disrupt electronic equipment; they also gained a new ally in sorceress [[Jennifer Kale]]. A new major antagonist came to prominence in the Damocles Foundation, an organisation founded by rogue Deviants, Eternals and humans. Former New Mutant Magma also reappeared as an antagonist. Dani Moonstar acquired new superpowers, being able to manipulate quantum energies. Towards the end of the run, Siryn and Sunspot left the team and continued as recurring guests. The 1999 annual centred around Rictor and Shatterstar, showing what they had been doing since leaving the team together.\n\nSales steadily declined throughout this period, falling from selling over 100,000 copies per issue<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/1996/1996-12.html</ref> to between forty and fifty thousand by the end of Moore's run with issue #100.<ref>https://comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2000/2000-01.html</ref> A similar sales decline was observed in other ancillary X-Men titles including ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man''.\n\n====Counter-X====\nWriter [[Warren Ellis]], known for his dark, cynical style, was put in charge of revamping ''X-Force'' along with ''Generation X'' and ''X-Man'' under the branding '''Counter-X''', as part of the '''[[Revolution (Marvel Comics)|Revolution]]''' revamp of the various X-Men titles in 2000. Ellis' stint on ''X-Force'' over issues #102\u2013115, co-written by [[Ian Edginton]] and illustrated by [[Whilce Portacio]], saw Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown, and Warpath become a [[Covert operation|covert ops]] superhero team under the leadership of [[Pete Wisdom]], a British mutant and former intelligence agent who could shoot burning blades of energy from his fingers. Despite the changes in creators, sales continued to decline at the same rate.<ref>[http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 CBGXtra.com \u2013 Comics Sales Charts] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027110315/http://www.cbgxtra.com/Default.aspx?tabid=695 |date=October 27, 2007 }}</ref> The run concluded with Bedlam, Cannonball, Meltdown and Warpath all appearing to die in an explosion, although all were revealed to be alive soon after.\n\nIn early 2001, the ''X-Force'' title was completely reimagined by writer [[Peter Milligan]] and artist [[Mike Allred]], who replaced the existing incarnation of the team with an entirely different group of mutants using the X-Force name. Issue #116 saw the introduction of a new, sardonically toned X-Force consisting of colorfully dressed and emotionally immature young mutants put together and marketed to be media superstars. ''X-Force'' was canceled with issue #129 in late 2002 and relaunched as ''[[X-Statix]]'' in late 2002.\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 2: 2004-2005===\nIn 2004, Marvel released a new six-issue ''X-Force''. Some controversy arose from Liefeld's insertion of over ten pages from previous unpublished comic books (''Weapon X'' and ''Cable: First Contact'') with word balloons edited to make them fit the ''X-Force'' storyline.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} It was subsequently followed with a four-issue prequel ''X-Force: Shatterstar'' [[miniseries]].\n\n[[Image:X-Force-1-cover.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover of ''X-Force'' vol. 3, #1 (April 2008); art by [[Clayton Crain]]]]\n\n===''X-Force'' Volume 3: 2008\u20132010===\nA new ''X-Force'' ongoing series was launched in February 2008, written by [[Craig Kyle]] and [[Christopher Yost]] and drawn by [[Clayton Crain]].\n\n[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] forms a black ops incarnation of X-Force that uses lethal force to permanently deal with threats against mutants. [[Warpath (comics)|Warpath]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] and [[X-23]] form the starting lineup, with [[Warren Worthington III|Angel]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]] and [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] joining soon after. Yost had at one point stated that Deadpool would join the cast to bring more diversity to the team, but this did not happen until after his run and the launch of Uncanny X-Force.

The trail leads back to the Purifiers, led by [[Matthew Risman]] and the mysterious [[Eli Bard]]. They attach Bastion's head to the body of a Nimrod unit, to use the revived Bastion in their \"holy war\" against mutantkind. Bastion retrieves an offspring of the technarch [[Magus (Marvel Comics)|Magus]] from the ocean floor and revives several deceased X-Men villains, including [[Cameron Hodge]], [[Bolivar Trask]] and [[Graydon Creed]], by infecting their corpses with the Technarch Transmode Virus. The virus allows Bastion a degree of mental control over the revived corpses. He also infects two living subjects with the virus: [[Donald Pierce]] and the [[Leper Queen]].\n\nDuring X-Force's raid on a Purifer base, Risman holds Wolfsbane hostage. While Wolverine calls for the team to stand down, X-23 decides Risman is bluffing and activates a concealed detonator that sets off a series of powerful explosives. The explosion brings most of the base down around them, but Risman is able to escape with Wolfsbane during the chaos. Wolverine later admonishes Laura for being so reckless with the lives of her teammates and for allowing Rahne to be kidnapped. After interrogating and killing numerous Purifiers, X-Force finds Rahne held in a warehouse, barely alive. Angel retrieves Elixir to heal Rahne, who wakes up soon after. Laura then catches the scent of Elixir's and Angel's blood, and runs off to help them. She reaches the room just in time to see Wolfsbane standing above Angel with his severed wings in her jaws. While in the Purifiers' custody, Rahne had been brainwashed by her deranged father, Reverend Craig, causing her to go berserk at the sight of an angelic figure. Wolfsbane savagely attacks Laura before handing over Angel's wings to the Purifiers.\n\nElixir heals both his and Angel's wounds, then discovers that Angel's wings aren't organic and can't be regrown. Angel transforms into [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], complete with metallic wings. Archangel wounds Wolverine and X-23 before taking off toward the Purifiers' base, sensing his old wings. Meanwhile, the Purifiers use samples of Angel's stolen wings to develop techno-organic wings for their soldiers, giving them similar abilities to Archangel. The group of Purifiers given wings is dubbed \"The Choir\". X-Force pursues Archangel to the Purifiers' base and slaughters most of The Choir, while Risman discovers Eli Bard absorbing the Technarch offspring into his hand. X-23 kills Risman with a headshot, and briefly fights Eli. Eli overpowers her, but is prevented from killing her when Warpath stabs him, causing him to flee. Wolverine takes on Bastion, who deems the threat posed by Wolverine \"unacceptable\" and retreats. Afterwards, X-Force finds Archangel unconscious and in human form, complete with feathered wings. Wolverine informs Cyclops of the turn of events, and Cyclops asks which of X-Force's targets should be next.<ref>X-Force #1\u20136</ref>\n\n====Old Ghosts====\nOnce X-Force regroups at Angel's Aerie, they test the reactions of Rahne and Angel to one another. Rahne reverts to full feral form upon seeing Angel, who responds by transforming into Archangel. Wolverine and Elixir restrain Wolfsbane while Cyclops talks down Archangel, who has trouble controlling his Apocalypse-like mentality while in his transformed state. Laura calls in the [[Stepford Cuckoos]] to erase Elixir's memories of X-Force, to help them remain covert. Before they do so, Angel informs them of a live telecast featuring Graydon Creed, who claims an L.M.D. was assassinated in his place and publicly denounces mutants once more. Cyclops assembles X-Force, including Elixir, and unexpectedly declares the Vanisher as their next target.\n\nIt is revealed that [[Scalphunter (Marvel Comics)|Scalphunter]], a former Marauder, contacted Cyclops about a break-in at an old lab of [[Mister Sinister]]'s that held an altered version of the [[Legacy Virus]]. While in pursuit of the Vanisher, the team runs into Domino, who joins forces with them to recover the Legacy Virus. After cornering Vanisher and inducing an inoperable brain tumor (courtesy of Elixir) to ensure his cooperation, Vanisher reveals he lost the virus while escaping from a horde of Marauder clones that were awakened after the death of Sinister. X-Force returns to the lab and kill the cloned Marauders inside. Domino retrieves the virus, only to be confronted by [[The Right (comics)|The Right]]'s shocktroopers, who have come to take the virus for themselves. X-23 is injected with the virus while doing battle, and runs toward a nearby molten vat to destroy herself (thus destroying the virus). Elixir catches Laura as she jumps, and uses his healing powers to purge her of the virus, declaring that his purpose in X-Force is to ensure no more of his friends will die. With Vanisher in tow, X-Force returns home.<ref>X-Force #7\u201310</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Warpath returns to his tribe's reservation at Camp Verde to visit his brother's grave, but discovers the empty graves of his entire tribe before being violently attacked by the [[Demon Bear]]. Just as he's about to be killed, Warpath is saved by [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]], who offers to teach him how to kill a demon. After engaging the Demon Bear in battle once more, Ghost Rider realizes the demon is reacting to pain caused by a dagger embedded in its body. Once Warpath removes the dagger, the demon is revealed to be the spirit guides of Warpath's tribe, corrupted by the black magic of the dagger. These spirits grant Warpath a vision that reveals the history of the man responsible for digging up the graves of his tribe: Eli Bard. Warpath returns home and tells X-Force what the spirits showed him, which ends with the revelation that Eli is using the Technarch Transmode Virus to revive dead mutants as an offering to his queen, [[Selene (comics)|Selene]].<ref>X-Force #11</ref>\n\nSoon after, [[Beautiful Dreamer (Marvel Comics)|Beautiful Dreamer]] mysteriously dies after losing control of her powers and killing hundreds of civilians. Cyclops realizes this was likely caused by the mutated Legacy Virus, and assembles X-Force to deal with the situation. Cyclops also reveals he's in the process of tracking down [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], and gives each of them a time-travel device that will be remotely activated when [[Beast (comics)|Beast]] determines Cable's exact location in the timestream. [[Morlocks (comics)|Fever Pitch]] loses control of his powers soon after, resulting in a similar massacre. While escaping the explosion, Archangel spots the Leper Queen and informs Cyclops. Once [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]], [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] and [[Surge (comics)|Surge]] are kidnapped, the Stepford Cuckoos use [[Cerebro|Cerebra]] to track them down. Hellion and Surge are injected with the altered Legacy Virus and teleported out just as X-Force storm the Leper Queen's base. As Wolverine questions the Leper Queen, Cyclops informs him that Cable has been found and X-Force is being sent after him. Despite Wolverine's protests, Cyclops activates the time-travel devices, sending X-Force forward in time before they can kill the Leper Queen.<ref>X-Force #12\u201313</ref>\n\n====Messiah War====\n{{See also|Messiah War}}\nX-Force is involuntarily sent to the future to retrieve [[Cable (comics)|Cable]] and Hope. The landscape is a barren, ravaged area, and the team quickly encounters danger. [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] has been defeated, and [[Stryfe]] controls this future. X-Force and Cable struggle to save Hope from Bishop and Stryfe.\n\n====Not Forgotten====\n''Not Forgotten'' takes place directly after X-Force's return to the present. X-23 emerges from the timestream just in time to save [[Tabitha Smith|Boom-Boom]] from being killed by the [[Leper Queen]]. Seconds after she kills the Leper Queen, both she and Boom-Boom are taken into custody by agents of H.A.M.M.E.R. At the United Nations, Hellion and Surge are rescued from the Sapien League by Wolverine, Archangel and Elixir. Boom-Boom is freed from H.A.M.M.E.R. custody by Warpath, while X-23 is returned to The Facility. She wakes up to find her left arm severed by [[Kimura (character)|Kimura]], wielding a chain saw. Before she can cut off the right arm, Kimura is shot by Agent Morales. Agent Young is revealed to be a member of The Facility that infiltrated H.A.M.M.E.R. to acquire the intel that Morales had on X-23. When Young tries to recruit Morales into The Facility, she rejects his offer by beating him unconscious. In the present, X-23 and Morales make their way to a Facility lab that holds mass amounts of the chemical trigger that forces X-23 to kill. While inside the room, X-23 cuts the claws out of her severed arm and gives them to Morales for safekeeping. She lights a Molotov cocktail of sorts which sets the sprinkler system off. The Facility soldiers finish cutting through to Laura just as Kimura realizes the sprinklers are spraying the Trigger Scent everywhere. X-23 goes feral and kills all the soldiers in her way. She gets to the Facility head's office just as the sprinklers start spraying water, washing away the scent. Kimura manages to club Laura from behind and then kills the Facility head, planning on framing Laura for it. Agent Morales arrives and sets Kimura on fire to distract her while she and Laura make her escape. Morales reveals she rigged the place to explode and they get out in time. The rest of X-Force arrives and takes Laura and her severed claws home, leading into the events of Necrosha.\n\n====Necrosha====\n{{main|Necrosha}}\nX-Force is involved in the battle against Selene's resurrected mutant forces on Utopia, until Cyclops sends them to Genosha to kill Selene.\n\nThey arrive at Necrosha and manage to rescue Warpath, who then leads them in battle against a god-like Selene, and manage to kill her using an old ritual of Warpath's tribe. Wolverine tells Cyclops that Warpath, X-23, Wolfsbane and Elixir are out of the team, but Cyclops insists that X-Force will be needed more than ever in the time ahead.\n\n====X-Men: Second Coming====\n{{main|X-Men: Second Coming}}\nX-Force is joined by Cable and Cypher on a time-traveling mission to stop an invasion of Nimrods sent from a possible dystopian future. As Cable only has one use remaining on his time-traveling device, it is believed to be a one-way suicide mission. After they complete their mission and Cable sacrifices himself to return X-Force to the present, Hope's mutant powers emerge and she destroys Bastion. After the battle, Logan is confronted by Storm about X-Force. She tells Logan that he never should have involved James, Rahne and Laura, and Logan tells her that he never wanted them involved, but doesn't regret what they did. Logan tells Laura that she's out and to figure out what she wants from life. Afterward, Logan discusses the future of X-Force with Cyclops, who decides to disband the team. Logan meets with his new team a short time later, consisting of himself, Archangel, Fantomex, Psylocke and Deadpool, deciding to run a new X-Force team without the knowledge of Cyclops or the other X-Men.{{Issue|date=March 2012}}\n\n===Volume 4===\n====Dirty/Tricks====\nThe new X-force consists of Cable, Marrow (who despite losing her powers during M-Day is repowered using a psychic headband), Psylocke, Fantomex, and Dr. Nemesis. They are investigating an explosion in Alexandria that put Hope Summers into a coma and find a new mutant nicknamed Meme, since she can only communicate through computers, as her body is comatose. They discover Russian billionaire Yevgeny-Malevitch Volga is behind Alexandria explosion and the kidnapping. He has been kidnapping mutants and supercharging them with kinetic energy and making them into human bombs. While in Paris, they pretend to kill a mutant that can read the minds of cats, so the French secret mutant forces, Le Bureaus Discret, will come to investigate, then they kidnap Le Necrogateur, a mutant that can read the minds of the deceased. Using his powers they find Volga's headquarters and that Volga found a mutant that can teleport between dimensions. Threatening the death of his family, they force the teleporting mutant to bring back a powerful weapon from Earth 1287, that creates super soldiers but greatly decreases their lifespan. During the attack on Volga's base Marrow discovers that she was pregnant during M-Day and volunteered to get her powers back, but at the cost of her pregnancy. She has a mental breakdown and X-Force is captured. It seems all is lost when Cable is super-charged and blown up by Volga. It turns out that Cable was present at Alexandria and it was him and Hope that caused the explosion when he was supercharged by Volga's henchman. Hope mimicked his powers and the chemicals caused her to fall into a coma. Cable survived the explosions since he wasn't really there\u2014Dr. Nemesis keeps Cable locked in stasis and creates a clone of him everyday and uploads his memories. The Cable and Dr. Nemesis attack Volga's base again and teleports his supercharged henchmen into outer space and then Volga seems to commit suicide by super-charging himself and killing the Cable clone again, but Marrow creates a bone shield to protect the team. Volga's spirit survives the explosion and another Cable clone emerges from the X-Force base to mourn over Hope, who was able to manifest herself in a digital avatar by copying the powers of a brain-dead mutant, Meme. Psylocke is able to discover the switch with her psychic powers, but promises Hope that she won't tell Cable.\n\n====Hide/Fear====\nCable and the X-Force who have barely survived their ordeal with Volga, track a team of British special forces into the desert. The team is tracking terrorists known as the Quaddees. It turns out Volga sold his tech to both the British and the Quaddees. X-Force begins abducting the team, but are attacked by [[Pete Wisdom]], [[Meggan]], and [[Faiza Hussain|Excalibur]] from [[MI-13 (comics)|MI-13]].<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 8</ref> Soon the Quaddees kidnap one member of the team, so the three groups decide to work together. Psylocke is able to find out that the super-powered British Special forces team will all die soon from Volga's tech, so the team sacrifices themselves so MI-13 and X-Force can escape. They also learn that there's a secret organization called the Yellow Eye spying on all mutants,<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 9</ref> who also kidnapped Domino.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 7</ref> This series also [[retcon]]s multiple X-Men backstories with the introduction of ForgetMeNot. His power is to immediately be forgotten by anybody who speaks with him and to be completely unnoticed by people around him unless he acknowledges them. Only Xavier knows of his existence\u2014even setting a psychic alarm clock to check in with ForgetMeNot every hour to remind him somebody remembers him. He hangs around the X-Mansion repelling attackers and saving the X-Men multiple times, without them realizing it and blaming it on dumb luck or [[deus ex machina]].<ref>X-Men Legacy Issue #300</ref> Dr. Nemesis, using an algorithm based on blurs in camera footage and missing toilet paper at the X-Mansion creates a teleporter to bring ForgetMeNot to the X-Force base on an abandoned S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier. The team has great difficulty catching ForgetMeNot, since whenever he hides they forgot about him then take a coffee break, where a prerecorded video by Dr. Nemesis plays reminding them to find ForgetMeNot. This turns into a viscous cycle, almost like a [[time loop]], until ForgetMeNot realizes that he was brought here to trick the Yellow Eye spybots (which look like tiny gnats) into allowing himself to be tracked, place a reverse tracking beacon on one and then the drone will forget him immediately and not self-destruct. This plan works; however, Fantomex then kills ForgetMeNot. Stating that he knew about him all the time since he has three brains and nanobots in his brain. Fantomex says he does it because he is evil and bored. The ships cleaning bots sweep away ForgetMeNot's body and Dr. Nemesis forgets speaking with him and assumes he figured out how to track the spybots on his own.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 # 10</ref>\n\n====Ends/Means====\nThe team attacks the Yellow Eye base, but during the battle Meme/Hope Summers hacks into Fantomex's consciousness, thanks to his nanobot brain, in order to learn why he broke up with her. He then reveals that he knew Hope Summers was posing as Meme. He then betrays the team and plans to use the Yellow Eye tracking technology to find his missing clones (Cluster and Weapon XIII).<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11</ref> Luckily, it turns out Domino was brainwashed by the Yellow Eye, but Meme was able to hack into her and free her. She then shoots Fantomex in the head.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #11\"/> It turns out Yellow Eye is actually [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], who reveals that Meme is actually Hope Summers to the rest of the team. Cable debates using the Yellow Eye Technology, but Psylocke wants the facility destroyed. They don't have time to debate since the second clone of Cable was already at the facility with Dr. Nemesis tracking Volga during the prior fight. The team doesn't have time to debate the morality since Fantomex was able to recode Volga's super virus code when he died and E.V.A. reloaded the virus to give her unlimited superpowers.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #12</ref> However, since his mind is still mechanical Meme hacked into him making him think he killed the team, while they actually escaped.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13</ref> Back at the base Cable tricks Fantomex into fighting him, but is actually getting Fantomex to destroy various spy agencies and evil organizations. ForgetMeNot also reveals himself to Hope Summers and explains that the original Meme is still alive and saved him by transferring his consciousness and then repaired his body with the ships clean up bots. He reveals that Meme is actually dying, and once she dies Hope will not be able to copy Meme's powers and communicate with the team using her hacking powers.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #13\"/> After Meme dies, ForgetMeNot reveals himself to the team and asks Marrow to touch Hope's body, then Hopes copies Marrow's healing factor and is able to temporarily heal herself enough to play a video showing how Cable has been manipulating the team. ForgetMeNot then pushes Psylocke into Hope, who then copies her psychic powers and reveals to the team her troubles childhood and how despite Cable saving her life by traveling between dimensions, she has outgrown him morally and doesn't look up to him. Marrow then kills the Cable clone. Hope also revealed their location to Fantomex, who is on his way to kill them.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\">X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14</ref> The team doesn't think they have a chance at stopping him, but Hope has a plan that will only work if they act as a team. Domino and Psylocke distract Fantomex while ForgetMeNot sneaks up to him and teleports him to Hope, who copies his super-powers, as well as the entire teams. She releases all the Cable clones against Fantomex.<ref name=\"X-Force Vol 4 Issue #14\"/> Hope, using Dr. Nemesis's super intellect, then figures out that Fantomex doesn't believe he is imperfect, but reveals to him that perfect requires cracks and inadequacies and perfection is really being a team. Fantomex cannot comprehend this and has a mental breakdown. Psylocke then uses her psi-blade to scramble his mind. The team later reveals they \"fired\" Cable from the team.<ref>X-Force Vol 4 Issue #15</ref>\n\n==''X-Force'' roster==\n\n===Volume 1===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"   \n|- \n!Issues !!

[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] Fan Award for Favorite Comic-Book Story for 1997.\n\n==The original X-Force==\nBefore the team best known as X-Force debuted, Marvel introduced an unrelated, little-known group also called X-Force. It was a short-lived group that was designed to replace [[Freedom Force (comics)|Freedom Force]]. The members were not mutants, but received their powers artificially and were named after the X-Men. This group was organized by a government agency known as M Branch and only appeared in the pages of ''[[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]]'' #9\u201310 (1990).\n\n==Other versions==\nIn the alternate reality of the \"Days of Future Now\" storyline, the X-Force consists of [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]], [[Black Tom Cassidy]], [[Cannonball (comics)|Cannonball]], [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], [[Tabitha Smith|Meltdown]] and [[Omega Red]].\n\nIn X-Men '92, X-Force members are: Cable, Domino, Deadpool, Psylocke, Archangel and Bishop.\n\n==In other media==\n\n===Animation===\nX-Force is mentioned for the first time outside of the comics in the [[anime]] series ''[[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: X-Men]]''. In the second episode, [[Professor X]] briefly mentions that X-Force has encountered the [[U-Men (comics)|U-Men]]. No other information is given about the team, other than that they gave the X-Men all their intel about the villains.\n\nIn an early episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-Head]]'' the duo vandalize their neighbor's house by painting \"X-FORCE RULES\" on it.\n\n===Film===\n{{main|X-Men (film series)#Abandoned films}}\n[[20th Century Fox]] are developing a film version of ''X-Force''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://x-menfilms.com/xforce-movie-in-the-works/|title='X-Force' movie in the works at Fox.|date=11 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whois.com/whois/x-forcemovie.com|title=Whois x-forcemovie.com|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/07/12/fox-to-use-comic-con-as-launching-pad-for-wider-x-men-universe-x-force-film-included/|title=Fox To Use Comic-Con As Launching Pad For Wider X-Men Movie Universe, X-Force Film Included|date=12 July 2013|publisher=|accessdate=5 July 2016}}</ref> On July 11, 2013, it was reported that [[Jeff Wadlow]] has been hired to write and direct the adaptation.

A film, book, musical artist, television series or video game, among other things, is said to have a cult following when it has a small but very passionate fanbase. A common component of cult followings is the emotional attachment the fans have to the object of the cult following, often identifying themselves and other fans as members of a [[community]]. Cult followings are also commonly associated with niche markets. Cult media are often associated with [[Subculture|underground culture]], and are considered too [[:wikt:eccentric|eccentric]] or [[anti-establishment|subversive]] to be appreciated by the [[general public]] or to be commercially successful.\n\nMany cult fans express their devotion with a level of irony when describing entertainment that falls under this realm, in that something is so bad, it's good. Sometimes, these cult followings cross the border to [[camp (style)|camp]] followings. Fans may become involved in a [[subculture]] of [[fandom]], either via [[Fan convention|conventions]], [[online communities]] or through activities such as writing [[Fan fiction|series-related fiction]], costume creation, replica prop and model building, or creating their own audio or video productions from the formats and characters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cult.tv |title=The Official Cult TV Magazine}}</ref>\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Film===\n{{main|Cult film}}\nThere is not always a clear difference between cult and [[mainstream]] media. Series such as ''[[Star Trek (film series)|Star Trek]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Harry Potter (film series)|Harry Potter]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show|Rocky Horror]]'', ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'', ''[[Ethel & Ernest (film)|Ethel & Ernest]]'', ''[[Batman in film#The Dark Knight Trilogy (2005\u20132012)|The Dark Knight]]'', and ''[[Mean Girls]]'' attract mass audiences but also have core groups of fanatical followers. Professors Xavier Mendik and Ernest Mathijs, authors of ''[[100 Cult Films]]'', argue that the devoted following among these films make them cult classics. In many cases, films that have cult followings may have been financial flops during their theatrical box office run, and even received mixed or mostly negative reviews by mainstream media, but still be considered a major success by small core groups or communities of fans devoted to such films.\n\nSome cults are only popular within a certain [[subculture]]. The film ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'' (1969) is especially loved within the [[hippie]] subculture, while ''[[Hocus Pocus (1993 film)|Hocus Pocus]]'' (1993) holds cult status among American women born in the 1980s. Certain [[mainstream]] icons can become cult icons in a different context for certain people. ''[[Reefer Madness]]'' (1936) was originally intended to warn youth against the use of [[marijuana]], but because of its ridiculous plot, overwhelming amount of factual errors and cheap look, it is now often watched by audiences of [[cannabis smoking|marijuana-smokers]] and has gained a cult following.<ref name=\"Peary\">{{cite book |last=Peary |first=Danny |authorlink= |title=Cult Movies |year=1981 |publisher=Delacorte Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-440-01626-7 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/cultmoviesclassi0000pear/page/203 203\u2013205]|title-link=Cult Movies (book) }}</ref>\n\n[[Quentin Tarantino]]'s films borrow stylistically from classic cult films, but are appreciated by a large audience, and therefore lie somewhere between cult and mainstream.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} Certain cult phenomena can grow to such proportions that they become [[mainstream]].\n\n===Television===\nMany cancelled television series (especially ones that had a short run life) see new life in a fan following. One example is ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', which was cancelled after three seasons and, because of the large fanbase, returned for a 15-episode season which was released on Netflix on May 26, 2013. ''[[Futurama]]'' is another series that was originally put on permanent hiatus after its initial 72-episode run. Strong DVD sales and consistent ratings on [[Cartoon Network]]'s [[Adult Swim]] block led to four direct-to-DVD films that, in turn, led to the revival of the series in 2010 on [[Comedy Central]] following Adult Swim's expiration of the broadcast rights. ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' had a cult following throughout its eleven-season run on television, and helped pave the way for later shows of similar style, which also had cult followings, specifically ''[[Aqua Teen Hunger Force]]''. ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' was cancelled after three seasons, but in [[broadcast syndication]] it gained a more substantial following, ultimately spawning a successful [[Star Trek|media franchise]].\n\nAnother cancelled series that has attained cult status is the NBC teen dramedy ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', which had an 18-episode run. Another series that was cancelled but gained a second life with cult status is the FOX teen medical dramedy ''[[Red Band Society]]'', which had a 13-episode run. Other examples include ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', ''[[Gypsy (TV series)|Gypsy]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]'', which had short lives, yet achieved large fanbases.\n\nIn a [[BBC]] review of ''[[Farscape]]'' episode \"Throne for a Loss\", Richard Manning said \"''Farscape'' is now officially a cult series because it's being shown out of sequence\". The episode in question was actually shown as the second episode, after the premiere, despite originally being intended as the fifth episode to be shown.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/farscape/story/ep_2_review.shtml |publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |title=Throne to a loss |first=Richard |last=Manning |date=September 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeries often considered cult classics include the long-running BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963\u2013present),<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|title=Fantastic Voyage|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/04/fantastic-voyage|date=June 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> the ITC sci-fi thriller series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967\u20131968),<ref name=\"Prisoner\">{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|title=The Prisoner: Cult classic TV series to be revived for new audio drama|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a619443/the-prisoner-cult-classic-tv-series-to-be-revived-for-new-audio-drama/|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> and the Australian soap opera ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'' (1979\u20131986).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/425875/Wentworth-Prison-Prisoners-return-to-cell-block-H| title=Wentworth Prison: Prisoners return to cell block H| publisher=[[Daily Express]]| date=31 August 2013| accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{See also|List of cult video games}}\nSome video games, often those with unique concepts that fail to gain traction with the mainstream audience, attract cult followings and can influence the design of later video games. An example of a cult video game is ''[[Ico]]'' (2001), an initial commercial flop that gained a large following for its unique [[gameplay]] and [[Minimalism|minimalist]] aesthetics, and was noted as influencing the design of ''[[Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rime (video game)|Rime]]'' (2017), among other games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ico/|title=The Obscure Cult Game That's Secretly Inspiring Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}</ref> Other games that have cult followings include ''[[EarthBound]]'' (1994), another unsuccessful game that later resulted in the creation of a \"cottage industry\" selling memorabilia to the [[EarthBound fandom|''EarthBound'' fandom]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/giving-thanks-two-new-books-on-a-cult-classic-embody-gamings-rich-culture|title=Giving Thanks: Two New Books on a Cult Classic Embody Gaming's Rich Culture|website=USgamer.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11|date=2016-11-23}}</ref> and ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' (2004), a surreal free-to-play Japanese [[horror game]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873602/yume-nikki-steam-download-new-project-dream-diary-sequel|title=A disturbing cult classic finally hits Steam, with a follow-up on the way|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-01-10|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref> Another example includes ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'' (2012), a critically acclaimed [[third-person shooter]], developed by [[Yager Development|Yager Development GmbH]], which took inspiration from ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review-apocalypse-now-481099/|title=Spec Ops: The Line review \u2013 apocalypse now|date=2012-06-26|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> and sought to portray the \"[[War crime|Horrors of war]]\" and the deep [[Combat stress reaction|psychological impact of armed conflict on soldiers]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Spec Ops The Line... 5 Years Later|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dzstxE_5Rc|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> The game received mixed praises as critics denoted the flaws with general combat mechanics such as the cover system and overall generic and stale gameplay, but commended and lauded the well-developed characters and narrative, with the goal of breaking conventions and telling a gritter tale in stark contrast to most other [[Shooter game|shooter]]-esque games of the time.<ref>{{Citation|title=Spec Ops: The Line Review - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sleeper hit]]\n* [[Underground music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last2=Lathrop |first2=Tad |first1=Wayne |last1=Jancik |title=Cult Rockers: 150 of the most controversial, distinctive and intriguing, outrageous and championed rock musicians of all time |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1996}}\n\n{{Fandom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cult Following}}\n[[Category:Cult following]]\n[[Category:Popular culture]]\n[[Category:Underground culture]]\n[[Category:Fandom]]\n", "text_old": "{{redirect|Cult classic|the album by Blue \u00d6yster Cult|Cult Classic{{!}}''Cult Classic''}}\n{{short description|Group of fans who are highly dedicated to a specific area of culture}}\n{{expert needed|Popular Culture|reason=the article's subject is vague, ill-defined, and appears to rely entirely on hearsay|date=February 2016}}\nA '''cult following''' comprises a group of [[Fan (person)|fans]] who are highly dedicated to a piece of [[artwork]] in various [[List of art media|mediums]], often referred to as a '''cult classic'''.

''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' was cancelled after three seasons, but in [[broadcast syndication]] it gained a more substantial following, ultimately spawning a successful [[Star Trek|media franchise]].\n\nAnother cancelled series that has attained cult status is the NBC teen dramedy ''[[Freaks and Geeks]]'', which had an 18-episode run. Another series that was cancelled but gained a second life with cult status is the FOX teen medical dramedy ''[[Red Band Society]]'', which had a 13-episode run. Other examples include ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Roswell (TV series)|Roswell]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Twin Peaks]]'', ''[[Veronica Mars]]'', ''[[Invasion (U.S. TV series)|Invasion]]'', ''[[Pushing Daisies]]'', ''[[Gargoyles (TV series)|Gargoyles]]'', ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'', ''[[Gypsy (TV series)|Gypsy]]'', and ''[[The Adventures of Pete & Pete]]'', which had short lives, yet achieved large fanbases.\n\nIn a [[BBC]] review of ''[[Farscape]]'' episode \"Throne for a Loss\", Richard Manning said \"''Farscape'' is now officially a cult series because it's being shown out of sequence\". The episode in question was actually shown as the second episode, after the premiere, despite originally being intended as the fifth episode to be shown.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/farscape/story/ep_2_review.shtml |publisher=[[BBC.co.uk]] |title=Throne to a loss |first=Richard |last=Manning |date=September 2005 |accessdate=18 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nSeries often considered cult classics include the long-running BBC series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' (1963\u2013present),<ref name=\"DW\">{{cite news|last=Nussbaum|first=Emily|title=Fantastic Voyage|work=The New Yorker|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2012/06/04/fantastic-voyage|date=June 2012|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> the ITC sci-fi thriller series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' (1967\u20131968),<ref name=\"Prisoner\">{{cite news|last=Jeffery|first=Morgan|title=The Prisoner: Cult classic TV series to be revived for new audio drama|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/news/a619443/the-prisoner-cult-classic-tv-series-to-be-revived-for-new-audio-drama/|date=January 5, 2015|accessdate=January 7, 2017}}</ref> and the Australian soap opera ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner: Cell Block H]]'' (1979\u20131986).<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.express.co.uk/showbiz/tv-radio/425875/Wentworth-Prison-Prisoners-return-to-cell-block-H| title=Wentworth Prison: Prisoners return to cell block H| publisher=[[Daily Express]]| date=31 August 2013| accessdate=8 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Video games ===\n{{See also|List of cult video games}}\nSome video games, often those with unique concepts that fail to gain traction with the mainstream audience, attract cult followings, and can influence the design of later video games. An example of a cult video game is ''[[Ico]]'' (2001), an initial commercial flop which gained a large following for its unique [[gameplay]] and [[Minimalism|minimalist]] aesthetics, and was noted as influencing the design of ''[[Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons]]'' (2013) and ''[[Rime (video game)|Rime]]'' (2017), among other games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/09/ico/|title=The Obscure Cult Game That's Secretly Inspiring Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-US}}</ref> Other games which have cult followings include ''[[EarthBound]]'' (1994), another unsuccessful game that later resulted in the creation of a \"cottage industry\" selling memorabilia to the [[EarthBound fandom|''EarthBound'' fandom]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgamer.net/articles/giving-thanks-two-new-books-on-a-cult-classic-embody-gamings-rich-culture|title=Giving Thanks: Two New Books on a Cult Classic Embody Gaming's Rich Culture|website=USgamer.net|language=en|access-date=2018-03-11|date=2016-11-23}}</ref> and ''[[Yume Nikki]]'' (2004), a surreal free-to-play Japanese [[horror game]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873602/yume-nikki-steam-download-new-project-dream-diary-sequel|title=A disturbing cult classic finally hits Steam, with a follow-up on the way|last=Frank|first=Allegra|date=2018-01-10|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-03-11}}</ref> Another example includes ''[[Spec Ops: The Line]]'' (2012), a critically acclaimed [[third-person shooter]], developed by [[Yager Development|Yager Development GmbH]]; which took inspiration from ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' and ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://metro.co.uk/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review-apocalypse-now-481099/|title=Spec Ops: The Line review \u2013 apocalypse now|date=2012-06-26|website=Metro|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>, and sought to portray the \"[[War crime|Horrors of war]]\" and the deep [[Combat stress reaction|psychological impact of armed conflict on soldiers]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Spec Ops The Line... 5 Years Later|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dzstxE_5Rc|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref> The game received mixed praises as critics denoted the flaws with general combat mechanics such as the cover system and overall generic and stale gameplay, but commended and lauded the well developed characters and narrative, with the goal of breaking conventions and telling a gritter tale in stark contrast to most other [[Shooter game|shooter]]-esque games of the time.<ref>{{Citation|title=Spec Ops: The Line Review - IGN|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/26/spec-ops-the-line-review|language=en|access-date=2019-12-12}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sleeper hit]]\n* [[Underground music]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|last2=Lathrop |first2=Tad |first1=Wayne |last1=Jancik |title=Cult Rockers: 150 of the most controversial, distinctive and intriguing, outrageous and championed rock musicians of all time |publisher=Pocket Books |year=1996}}\n\n{{Fandom}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Cult Following}}\n[[Category:Cult following]]\n[[Category:Popular culture]]\n[[Category:Underground culture]]\n[[Category:Fandom]]\n", "name_user": "Alcazar84", "label": "safe", "comment": "grammar edits", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cult_following"}
