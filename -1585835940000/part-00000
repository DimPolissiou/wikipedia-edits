{"title_page": "Harry Clifton", "text_new": "{{short description|Irish poet|bot=PearBOT 5}}\n{{other people}}\n[[File:Harry Clifton.jpg|thumb|Harry Clifton, 2017]]\n'''Harry Clifton''' (born 1952) is an [[Irish poetry|Irish poet]]. \n\n==Biography==\n'''Clifton''' was born in [[Dublin]], where he was educated at [[Blackrock College]] and [[University College, Dublin]]. He has 3 younger brothers and 2 sisters. \n\nAfter graduating, Clifton began an extended period of travel outside of Ireland. Many of his experiences from this time had major influence on his poetry because he believes the true home of the poet is 'not in a place, but in the language itself'.<ref>https://wfupress.wfu.edu/authors/harry-clifton/</ref> \n\nHe has lived in places throughout Europe, Africa and Asia. He lectured at a teacher training college in Nigeria in the early 1970s. He worked as an aid administrator in Thailand for Indo-Chinese refugees in the 1980s. He lived in Italy's Abruzzi Mountains, Switzerland, England and Germany before settling in Paris for ten years.\n\nHe was poet-in-residence at the Frost Place in [[New Hampshire]], an International Fellow at the [[University of Iowa]], and a representative for Ireland at the International Writing Program in Iowa. He has held many teaching positions at universities, including [[Bremen]] and [[Bordeaux]] in France, and [[Trinity College Dublin]] and [[University College Dublin]], in Ireland. \n\nHe now lives in Dublin with his wife, Irish novelist [[Deirdre Madden]], and teaches at [[University College Dublin]].\n\n==Work==\nHe has published ten books of poetry, with work from his first four collections included in ''The Desert Route: Selected Poems 1973-88'', published in 1992 by the Gallery Press in Ireland and Bloodaxe Books in Britain, with a foreword by [[Derek Mahon]]. His latest titles are ''The Winter Sleep of Captain Lemass'' (2012), ''The Holding Centre: Selected Poems 1974-2004'' (2014), and ''Portobello Sonnets'' (2017), all published by Bloodaxe Books in Britain and Ireland, and by Wake Forest University Press in the United States. A new collection, ''Herod's Dispensations'', is scheduled to be published by both publishers in 2019.<ref>http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/ecs/product/herod-s-dispensations-1205</ref>\n\nHe wrote ''On the Spine of Italy: A Year in the Abruzzi'' (Macmillan, 1999), a prose work based on the year he spent in Italy. He recorded his life in Paris in ''Secular Eden: Paris Notebooks 1994\u20132004'' (Wake Forest University Press, 2007). \n\nHis poems have been translated into several European languages, with a French translation of selected poems, ''Le Canto d'Ulysse'', published in 1996. He also published a book of stories, ''Berkeley's Telephone & Other Fictions'' (Lilliput Press, 2000). \n\n==Critical reception==\nIn his Foreword to Harry Clifton's first volume of selected poems, ''The Desert Route'' (1992), [[Derek Mahon]] wrote: 'The poet has taken the world as his province... Quietly, without self-assertion, he [Clifton] has set himself to work in the highest registers. There must be three things in combination, I would suggest, before the poetry can happen: soul, song and formal necessity. Clifton has all three; he has chosen well from his four volumes; and this Selected Poems will place him among the poets who matter'.\n\nReviewing ''Secular Eden'' (2007) in ''The Irish Times'', Fintan O'Toole wrote of Clifton's work: 'His is a universe of aftermaths, hauntings and returns, in which even God...dreams of becoming flesh again', asserting that his book 'captures an Irish voice that is utterly contemporary in its restless movement through time and space'.<ref>https://wfupress.wfu.edu/books/secular-eden/</ref>\n\n[[Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn]], also writing in ''The Irish Times'', wrote of ''The Winter Sleep of Captain Lemass'' (2012): 'There are moments when you hold your breath... and you sit up in pure delight... there are a number of poems in this book that will be read as long as any poems are read anywhere... The last poem, \"Oweniny, Upper Reaches\", filled with soft, haunting cadences and strange, ambiguous musings on solitude, memory and the meaning of things, is a masterpiece.'<ref>https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/books/a-hushed-and-controlled-beauty-1.539360</ref>\n\nCommenting on Clifton's work as a whole, [[C.K. Williams]] wrote: 'There is so much history in Harry Clifton's poems, so much geography, landscape, cityscape, repeopled precincts of the imagination, so much human drama and comedy; so many people, mythic, unlikely and hauntingly real. And all of it is limned with a masterful formal dexterity and an apparently limitless cultural curiosity.'<ref>https://wfupress.wfu.edu/books/secular-eden/</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n* 1981 : [[Patrick Kavanagh Poetry Award]]\n* 2008 : [[Poetry Now Award|Irish Times Poetry Now Award]] for ''Secular Eden''\n* 2012 : shortlisted for [[Poetry Now Award|Irish Times Poetry Now Award]] for ''The Winter Sleep of Captain Lemass''\n* 2010-2013: Fifth [[Ireland Professor of Poetry]]<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/breaking/2010/0630/breaking53.html Ireland Professor of Poetry named] (The Irish Times)</ref>\n* member of [[Aosd\u00e1na]].\n\n==Publications==\n\n===Poetry===\n*''The Walls of Carthage'', Dublin: The Gallery Press, 1977\n*''The Office of the Salt Merchant'', Dublin: The Gallery Press, 1979\n*''Comparative Lives'', Dublin: The Gallery Press, 1982 {{ISBN|090401133X}}\n*''The Liberal Cage'', Oldcastle, Co.

Stop codons signal the termination of this process by binding [[release factor]]s, which cause the ribosomal subunits to disassociate, releasing the amino acid chain. While [[start codon]]s need nearby sequences or initiation factors to start translation, a stop codon alone is sufficient to initiate termination.\n\n==Introduction==\nIn the standard genetic code, there are three different termination codons: \n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border: none; background: none; text-align: center;\"\n|+\n|-\n!

Through a series of mutation experiments comparing these mutants with each other and other known amino acid codons, [[Sydney Brenner]] concluded that the amber and ochre mutations corresponded to the nucleotide triplets \"UAG\" and \"UAA\".<ref name=brenner_1965>{{cite journal |pages=994\u20138 |doi=10.1038/206994a0 |pmid=5320272 |title=Genetic Code: The 'Nonsense' Triplets for Chain Termination and their Suppression |year=1965 |last1=Brenner |first1=S. |last2=Stretton |first2=A.

These prematurely terminate translation if the corresponding frame-shift (such as due to a ribosomal RNA slip) occurs before the hidden stop. It is hypothesised that this decreases resource waste on nonfunctional proteins and the production of potential [[Cytotoxicity|cytotoxins]]. Researchers at [[Louisiana State University]]  propose the ''[[ambush hypothesis]]'', that hidden stops are selected for. Codons that can form hidden stops are used in genomes more frequently compared to synonymous codons that would otherwise code for the same amino acid. Unstable [[Ribosomal RNA|rRNA]] in an organism correlates with a higher frequency of hidden stops.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=701\u20135 |doi=10.1089/1044549042476910 |title=The Ambush Hypothesis: Hidden Stop Codons Prevent Off-Frame Gene Reading |year=2004 |last1=Seligmann |first1=Herv\u00e9 |last2=Pollock |first2=David D. |journal=DNA and Cell Biology |volume=23 |issue=10 |pmid=15585128}}</ref>\nThis hypothesis however could not be validated with a larger data set.<ref>{{cite journal |pages=1\u20138 |doi=10.1186/1471-2164-14-418 |title=Ambushing the ambush hypothesis: predicting and evaluating off-frame codon frequencies in Prokaryotic Genomes |year=2013 |last1=Cavalcanti|first1=Andre|last2=Chang |first2=Charlotte H.|last3=Morgens|first3=David W.|journal=BMC Genomics|volume=14 |issue=418 |pmid=23799949 |pmc=3700767}}</ref>\n\nStop-codons and hidden stops together are collectively referred as stop-signals.

It was released in 1997 by [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Republic Pictures]] in R-Rated and Unrated versions. It stars [[Amelia Kinkade]], [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]], [[Gregory Calpakis]], [[Tara Slone]], [[Christian Tessier]], [[Joel Gordon]], [[Larry Day]], [[Kristen Holden-Reid]], [[Stephanie Bauder]], and Patricia Rodriguez.\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral years have passed after the massacre at St. Rita's Academy and on [[Halloween]] night, [[police officer|Officer]] Larry ([[Larry Day]]) is on night watch at Hull House, where he is confronted and murdered by Angela ([[Amelia Kinkade]]) with his own police [[badge]].\n\nBad boy Vince ([[Kristen Holden-Ried]]), his promiscuous girlfriend Lois ([[Tara Slone]]), and their friends Nick ([[Gregory Calpakis]]) and Reggie ([[Joel Gordon]]) are cruising through town in Vince's sidekick Orson's ([[Christian Tessier]]) [[van]]. They stop to pick up head [[cheerleader]] Holly (Stephanie Bauder) and her shy friend Abbie (Patricia Rodriguez), who broke down on their way to the school dance, on the side of the road. Holly remembers Nick from [[algebra]] class on the first day of school, and Nick speculates Holly likes him.\n\nWhile stopped at a [[convenience store]], Reggie tries to buy beer with his brother's fake ID, but the unfriendly clerk pulls out a [[shotgun]]. Tempers escalate, and Vince steals the gun just as two police officers enter the store. One of the officers is accidentally shot when the clerk grabs Vince, and the other shoots Reggie in the stomach twice. A fight between the officer and Vince breaks out, destroying the store. The teenagers and a wounded Reggie pile into the van, Vince brings the shotgun, and Orson steals the police officer's gun, and they drive away. Fortunately, the officer they shot is wearing a [[bulletproof vest]] and is not harmed. Lieutenant Dewhurst ([[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]]), who is due to retire at midnight that night, watches the [[security camera]] playback of what happened, and deduces that the clerk's story of a robbery is a cover for stealing the money from the [[cash register]], and that the kids are frightened teens, rather than vicious cop killers.\n\nIn the van, Vince notices that the gas tank is almost empty, and they decide to hide out at Hull House. Abbie tells Vince that the place is possessed and not to cross over the underground stream, since demons cannot cross over running water, but Vince forces them all to enter at gunpoint. Vince, trying to prove demons do not exist, taunts them and shoots a hole in the wall, causing the evil spirit that possesses the house to rush upstairs from the basement [[crematorium]] in the guise of Angela. Orson decides to stand up for himself and reveal that he has the police officer's pistol, and tells Vince that he will watch the others and Angela while Nick, Lois, and Vince make sure no one else is in the house.\n\nAngela puts on some music and does an [[erotic]] dance to distract Orson, and Abbie and Holly see this as an opportunity to escape with Reggie. Holly tries [[Hotwiring|hot wiring]] the van, but remembers that Nick is still inside. Angela begins to [[seduce]] Orson, simulating [[fellatio]] by sucking the bullets out of the gun through the barrel. Then she kisses Orson and her long, demon tongue shoots through the back of his head, killing him. Meanwhile, upstairs, Nick sneaks up on Vince and Lois who are making out, but fails to take the shotgun, and Vince fires the gun at Nick but misses. Outside, Holly hears the shot, and then overhears a voice over Larry's police radio and finds his car. Abbie leaves Reggie in the van to look for Holly, but Angela takes Abbie to a small chapel and plays on her insecurities and says she can make her an irresistible woman, and the demonic Angela kisses her and possesses her as well.\n\nThe badly wounded Reggie hears his name called, and leaves the van, only to be run over by the now possessed Orson. Abbie, who has been turned into a demonic version of her cat costume, seduces Vince until he hears the van crash. Lois, who is angry at Abbie because she thinks that she is now the perfect woman to fall in love with Vince, is scratched by Abbie after slapping her, then is pursued by Angela, who causes her hand to transform into a [[snake]] head which bites her. Holly smashes the police car window to call the police, but is attacked by Officer Larry. He chases Holly across the courtyard when she steps over the underground stream; Larry tries to step over it and is disintegrated. Nick finds Holly going back into the house to get everyone out. After encountering Orson, they hide in the attic and share a kiss. Orson appears, and Holly throws a can of [[lye]] in his face. They rush down to the hall when Dewhurst appears and he explains that he wants to help, then handcuffs them and takes them outside. Vince runs outside using Angela as a hostage. Dewhurst tells Vince that the officer he shot did not die, but Angela convinces Vince that Dewhurst is lying. Vince opens fire, but is shot through the eye and killed, and Angela returns to her demon form. The other demons appear, and Angela offers to let Dewhurst and Nick go free if Holly will willingly give up her pure and powerful soul. Holly agrees, and Angela turns Vince into a demon. The other demons make their way inside to [[Hell]].\n\nDewhurst creates a diversion, and stabs Angela with Nick's switchblade. Nick gets in the police car and rams Angela against a tree. As dawn breaks, Angela disappears inside the house. As the three make their way to the gate, Dewhurst tells Nick and Holly that they were not on the security camera at the store and no one will ever know they were there. Angela reappears just as they're about to escape and pulls Dewhurst's [[heart]] from his chest. She chases Holly and Nick and just before they cross the underground stream, Angela grabs Holly's arm. Nick ends up pulling Holly and Angela both over the stream and Angela dissolves. Holly leaves a cross made of sticks at the gate and promises she'll be back every Halloween to make sure no one ever goes inside again.  Holly and Nick then walk home and the last screen shot of the house shows the lights turning on and Angela laughing and saying \"Happy Halloween\".\n\n==Cast==\n* Larry Day as Officer Larry\n* [[Amelia Kinkade]] as [[Angela Franklin]]\n* [[Kristen Holden-Ried]] as Vince\n* Gregory Calpakis as Nick\n* [[Tara Slone]] as Lois\n* [[Christian Tessier]] as Orson\n* [[Joel Gordon]] as Reggie\n* Patricia Rodriguez as Abbie\n* Stephanie Bauder as Holly\n* Ian McDonald as Mr. Morris (Quicky Mart Clerk)\n* Richard Jutras as Officer Tony (Rookie Cop)\n* Minor Mustain as Veteran Cop\n* [[Vlasta Vr\u00e1na]] as Lieutenant Dewhurst\n* Richard Zeman as Macho Cop\n\n==Reception==\nCritical reception for the film was mostly negative, with [[JoBlo.com]] stating the film was \"too routine, uninspired, badly shot and cheap to deliver as a satisfying Night of the Demons sequel\".<ref>[http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/reviews/night-of-the-demons-3 Night of the Demons 3] JoBlo.com</ref> [[Deseret News]] panned the film, writing it was \"another sequel to a horror movie no one liked the first time around\".<ref>Deseret News.
