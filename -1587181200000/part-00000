It was formerly the Engineering School of the University of Panama, which in 1975 became Polytechnic Institute and, due to the need of a new model of university, it became the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Panam\u00e1, by means of Law 18 of August 13, 1981.\n\nOn October 9, 1984 the Universidad Tecnol\u00f3gica de Panam\u00e1 was definitively organized by means of Law 17. Law 57 of July 26, 1996 modifies and adds to Law 17 of 1984.\n\nSince class of 1981, the nation has received uninterruptedly the delivery of more than 43,000 professionals from the UTP; their knowledge, skills and vision contribute to the development of the Republic of Panama. UTP started with six bachelor's degrees and 15 technical careers. Currently it offers 43 advanced careers, 28 bachelor's degrees and 21 technical careers.\n\nThe synergy created with the Panamanian Government, private sector and society allows the UTP to maintain a state of the art academic offer and to contribute efficiently with the technological and social development of the country.  Valuable links developed with prestigious academic institutions, research centers, organizations and corporations of other countries, ensure a successful participation in the global village.\n\nIts current academic offer is the best evidence of institutional growth. There are 131 careers at different levels, as follows: 2 Doctorate studies, 40 master's degrees, 26 postgraduate courses, 1 Professor Career, 4 Specializations, 8 Diplomas, 14 Bachelor's degrees in Engineering, 14 Bachelor's degrees, 8 Bachelor's degrees in Technology and 14 Technical careers. Regarding demand, it has increased from 5,735 students on 1981 to 18,000 on 2011.\n\nIt has a Faculty of 1,234 professors, 30% of them teaching full-time and an administrative crew of 1,200 people.

They are usually the outgrowth of a single individual.\n\nA micronation expresses a formal and persistent if unrecognized claim of sovereignty over some physical territory. Micronations are distinct from true [[secession]]ist movements; micronations' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim. Several micronations have issued coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals and other state-related items, often as a source of revenue. \n\nSome of what might now be considered micronations began in the 20th century. The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations, whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means, often calling their nations \"nomadic countries\".

They may have a structure similar to established sovereign states, including territorial claims, government institutions, official symbols and citizens, albeit on a much smaller scale. Micronations are often quite small, in both their claimed territory and claimed populations\u2014although there are some exceptions to this rule, with different micronations having different methods of citizenship. Micronations may also issue formal instruments such as postage stamps, coins, banknotes and passports, and bestow honours and titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Montevideo Convention]] was one attempt to create a legal definition distinguishing between states and non-states. Some micronations meet this definition, while some do not, and others reject the convention. Some micronations like [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] or [[Principality of Hutt River|Hutt River]] reject the term micronation and consider themselves as sovereign states; other micronations like [[Flandrensis]] or [[Republic of Molossia|Molossia]] have no intention to be recognized as real states.<ref name=\"brusselstimes.com\"/>\n\n==List of micronations==\n{{Main|List of micronations}}\n<!-- Please do not insert your own micronation here or one that is not noteworthy. -->\nThere are many different types of micronations that have been claimed over the years.

In 2014, the Imperial Throne proclaimed that [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen]], one of several [[pretender|claimants]] to the [[House of Romanov|royal Romanov line]], was now ''Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia''. The Imperial Throne claims to be in contact with the governments of [[Montenegro]] and [[North Macedonia]] about a grant of territory and state recognition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and evolution===\n[[Martin Coles Harman]], owner of the [[United Kingdom|British]] island of [[Lundy]] in the early decades of the 20th century, declared himself King and issued private coinage and postage stamps for local use. Although the island was ruled as a virtual fiefdom, its owner never claimed to be independent of the [[United Kingdom]], so Lundy can at best be described as a precursor to later territorial micronations. Another example is the [[Principality of Outer Baldonia]], a {{convert|16|acre|m2|adj=on}} rocky island off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]], founded by Russell Arundel, chairman of the Pepsi Cola Company (later: [[PepsiCo]]), in 1945 and comprising a population of 69 fishermen.\n\n[[File:Sealand-sky.jpg|thumb|left|The {{convert|550|m2|abbr=on}} [[Principality of Sealand]]]]\n\n===History during 1960 to 1980===\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed the foundation of a number of territorial micronations. The first of these, [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], was established in 1967 on an abandoned [[World War II]] gun platform in the [[North Sea]] just off the [[East Anglian]] coast of England, and still survives. Others were founded on [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] principles and involved schemes to construct [[artificial island]]s, but only three are known to have had even limited success in realizing that goal.\n\nThe [[Republic of Rose Island]] was a {{convert|400|m2|abbr=on}} platform built in 1968 in Italian national waters in the [[Adriatic Sea]],{{convert|7|mi}} off the [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Rimini]]. It is known to have issued stamps, and to have declared [[Esperanto]] to be its official language. Shortly after completion, however, it was seized and destroyed by the [[Italian Navy]] for failing to pay state taxes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the late 1960s, [[Leicester Hemingway]], brother of author [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest]], was involved in another such project\u2014a small timber platform in international waters off the west coast of [[Jamaica]]. This territory, consisting of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} barge, he called \"New Atlantis\". Hemingway was an honorary citizen and President; however, the structure was damaged by storms and finally pillaged by Mexican fishermen. In 1973, Hemingway was reported to have moved on from New Atlantis to promoting a {{convert|1000|sqyd|abbr=on}} platform near the Bahamas. The new country was called \"Tierra del Mar\" (''Land of the Sea''). (Ernest Hemingway's adopted hometown of [[Key West]] was later itself part of another micronation; see [[Conch Republic]].)\n\nThe [[Republic of Minerva]] was set up in 1972 as a libertarian new-country project by [[Nevada]] businessman [[Michael Oliver (real estate)|Michael Oliver]]. Oliver's group conducted dredging operations at the [[Minerva Reefs]], a shoal located in the [[Pacific Ocean]] south of [[Fiji]]. They succeeded in creating a small artificial island, but their efforts at securing international recognition met with little success, and near-neighbour [[Tonga]] sent a military force to the area and annexed it.\n\nOn April 1, 1977, [[Bibliophily|bibliophile]] [[Richard Booth]] declared the [[Wales|Welsh]] town of [[Hay-on-Wye]] an independent kingdom with himself as its monarch. The town subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests, and \"King Richard\" (whose sceptre was a recycled toilet plunger) awarded Hay-on-Wye peerages and honours to anyone prepared to pay for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/halloffame/arts/richard_booth.shtml |title=Mid Wales Arts\u2014Richard Booth |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-09-24}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese micronations in the 1980s===\nIn 1981, drawing on a news report about Leicester Hemingway's \"New Atlantis\", novelist [[Hisashi Inoue]] wrote a 700-page work of [[magic realism]], ''[[Kirikirijin]]'', about a village that secedes from Japan and proclaims its bumpkinish, marginalized [[dialect]] its national language, and its subsequent [[war of independence]]. This single-handedly inspired a large number of Japanese villages, mostly in the northern regions, to \"declare independence\", generally as a move to raise awareness of their unique culture and crafts for urban Japanese who saw village life as backwards and uncultured. These micronations even held \"international summits\" from 1983 to 1985, and some of them formed confederations. Throughout the 1980s there was a \"micronation boom\" in Japan that brought many urban tourists to these wayward villages. But the harsh economic impact of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] in 1991 ended the boom. Many of the villages were forced to merge with larger cities, and the micronations and confederations were generally dissolved.<ref>Shigeru Inoue, ''Nippon Matchidukuri Jiten'', pp. 407\u2013409, 2010, {{ISBN|4-621-08194-2}}</ref>\n\n===Australian and New Zealand developments===\nMicronational developments that occurred in New Zealand and Australia in the final three decades of the 20th century included:\n*The [[Principality of Hutt River]] was founded in 1970, when Leonard Casley declared his property independent after a dispute over wheat quotas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Kober|first2=Ralph|date=2018-04-18|title=The Principality Of Hutt River: A Territory Marooned in the Western Australian Outback|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|volume=12|issue=1|doi=10.21463/shima.12.1.13|issn=1834-6057|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|22\u201327}}\n*In 1976 the [[Province of Bumbunga]] was created on a rural property near [[Snowtown, South Australia]], by an eccentric British monarchist.<ref name=\"Cook2018\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bumbunga-governor-alec-brackstones-relentless-will-to-secede/news-story/d743e96aaf5cb71cfc28b26bf7a30a6d |title=Bumbunga Governor Alec Brackstone\u2019s relentless will to secede |date=30 June 2018 |publisher=[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]] |first=Craig | last=Cook}}</ref>\n*The [[Sovereign State of Aeterna Lucina]] was created in a hamlet on the [[New South Wales]] north coast in 1978.<ref name=telboy>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/isnt-it-every-little-boys-dream-to-control-everybody/news-story/2cd2c567df9146fde9083af460bc202b |title=\u2019Isn\u2019t it every little boy\u2019s dream, to control everybody?\u2019 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 April 2017}}</ref> \n*In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], a long-running dispute over flood damage to farm properties led to the creation of the [[Independent State of Rainbow Creek]] in 1979.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|145}}\n*An anti-taxation campaigner founded the [[Grand Duchy of Avram]] in western [[Tasmania]] in the 1980s;  \"His Grace the Duke of Avram\" was later elected to the Tasmanian Parliament.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|144}}\n*The [[Independent State of Aramoana]] was established in New Zealand in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |title=New New Zealand Island: The Kiwi pastime of micronations |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=12152617 |website=New Zealand Herald |publisher=NZME Publishing |accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n*The [[Empire of Atlantium]] was established in [[Sydney]], in 1981 as a non-territorial global government.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|74\u201377}}\n*The Republic of [[Whangamomona]] was established in 1989.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|34\u201337}}\n*A mortgage foreclosure dispute led George and Stephanie Muirhead of [[Rockhampton]], Queensland, to briefly and abortively secede as the [[Principality of Marlborough]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/outback-duke-takes-on-the-bank-a-queensland-man-has-defied-australia-by-creating-a-principality-to-1490896.html|title=Outback 'duke' takes on the bank: A Queensland man has defied Australia by creating a principality to escape his debts|last=Milliken|first=Robert|date=10 June 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=20 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620084627/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/outback-duke-takes-on-the-bank-a-queensland-man-has-defied-australia-by-creating-a-principality-to-1490896.html|archive-date=20 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of the Internet===\nMicronationalism shed much of its traditionally eccentric anti-establishment mantle and took on a distinctly hobbyist perspective in the mid-1990s, when the emerging popularity of the Internet made it possible to create and promote statelike entities in an entirely electronic medium with relative ease. An early example is the [[Talossa|Kingdom of Talossa]], a micronation created in 1979 by then-14-year-old [[Robert Ben Madison]], which went online in November 1995, and was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other print media in 2000.<ref name=nytimes2000>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Mimh |title=Utopian Rulers, and Spoofs, Stake Out Territory Online |work=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2000}}\n</ref> As a result, the number of exclusively online, fantasy or simulation-based micronations expanded dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The micronation [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]] coexists as both a physical territory and as a large and active online community that resembles a [[third place]], distinguishing itself from other micronations, which are either active online communities or claim small physical territories, whereas the micronation Syleria exists solely as a large internet community, yet still has its own flag, coat of arms, and anthem, as if it held claim to land.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Kober|first2=Ralph|date=2019-04-15|title=The Royal Republic of Ladonia: A Micronation built of Driftwood, Concrete and Bytes|url=https://shimajournal.org/issues/v13n1/10.-Bicudo-de-Castro-and-Kober-Shima-v13n1.pdf|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|doi=10.21463/shima.13.1.10}}</ref>\n\nThe activities of these types of micronations are almost exclusively limited to simulations of diplomatic activity (including the signing of \"treaties\" and participation in \"supra-micronational\" forums such as the League of Micronations) and contribution to [[wiki]]s.

Micronations are distinct from true [[secession]]ist movements; micronations' activities are almost always trivial enough to be ignored rather than challenged by the established nations whose territory they claim. Several micronations have issued coins, flags, postage stamps, passports, medals and other state-related items, often as a source of revenue. \n\nSome of what might now be considered micronations began in the 20th century. The advent of the Internet provided the means for people to create many new micronations, whose members are scattered all over the world and interact mostly by electronic means, often calling their nations \"nomadic countries\".  The differences between such \"Internet micronations\", other kinds of [[social networking]] groups and [[role-playing game]]s are often difficult to define.<ref>Mateusz Kud\u0142a,{{cite web |url = http://technowinki.onet.pl/komputery/jak-zostac-premierem-nie-odchodzac-od-komputera,1,4909220,artykul.html |title = Jak zosta\u0107 premierem nie odchodz\u0105c od komputera |publisher = onet.pl |language = Polish |accessdate = 2013-04-27 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20111121043644/http://technowinki.onet.pl/komputery/jak-zostac-premierem-nie-odchodzac-od-komputera,1,4909220,artykul.html |archive-date = 2011-11-21 |url-status = dead }}</ref>\n\nThe term \"micronation\" to describe those entities dates at least to the 1970s.<ref>''The People's Almanac #2'', page 330.</ref> The term ''micropatriology'' is sometimes used to describe the study of both micronations and [[microstate]]s by micronationalists, some of whom refer to [[sovereignty|sovereign]] [[nation-state]]s as \"macronations\".\n\nMicronations contrast with [[microstates]], which are small but recognized sovereign states such as [[Andorra]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Monaco]], [[San Marino]] and [[Vatican City]].<ref>{{cite book\n|title=Report from practically nowhere\n|url=https://archive.org/details/reportfrompracti00sack\n|url-access=registration\n|first1=John\n|last1=Sack\n|first2=Shel\n|last2=Silverstein\n|publisher=Harper\n|year=1959}}</ref> They are also distinct from [[imaginary country|imaginary countries]] and from other kinds of social groups (such as [[eco-village]]s, [[campus]]es, [[tribe]]s, [[clan]]s, [[sect]]s and [[residential community association]]s).\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Conch Republic FH020010.jpg|thumb|\"Welcome to the [[Conch Republic]]\"\u2014a sign at [[Key West International Airport]].]]\nMicronations generally have a number of common features, although these may vary widely. They may have a structure similar to established sovereign states, including territorial claims, government institutions, official symbols and citizens, albeit on a much smaller scale. Micronations are often quite small, in both their claimed territory and claimed populations\u2014although there are some exceptions to this rule, with different micronations having different methods of citizenship. Micronations may also issue formal instruments such as postage stamps, coins, banknotes and passports, and bestow honours and titles of nobility.\n\nThe [[Montevideo Convention]] was one attempt to create a legal definition distinguishing between states and non-states. Some micronations meet this definition, while some do not, and others reject the convention. Some micronations like [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] or [[Principality of Hutt River|Hutt River]] reject the term micronation and consider themselves as sovereign states; other micronations like [[Flandrensis]] or [[Republic of Molossia|Molossia]] have no intention to be recognized as real states.<ref name=\"brusselstimes.com\"/>\n\n==List of micronations==\n{{Main|List of micronations}}\n<!-- Please do not insert your own micronation here or one that is not noteworthy. -->\nThere are many different types of micronations that have been claimed over the years.

Hill claims that the dowry was never paid and therefore it is not part of the UK and should be a [[crown dependency]] like the [[Isle of Man]].

In 2014, the Imperial Throne proclaimed that [[Prince Karl Emich of Leiningen]], one of several [[pretender|claimants]] to the [[House of Romanov|royal Romanov line]], was now ''Nicholas III, Emperor of All Russia''. The Imperial Throne claims to be in contact with the governments of [[Montenegro]] and [[North Macedonia]] about a grant of territory and state recognition.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history and evolution===\n[[Martin Coles Harman]], owner of the [[United Kingdom|British]] island of [[Lundy]] in the early decades of the 20th century, declared himself King and issued private coinage and postage stamps for local use. Although the island was ruled as a virtual fiefdom, its owner never claimed to be independent of the [[United Kingdom]], so Lundy can at best be described as a precursor to later territorial micronations. Another example is the [[Principality of Outer Baldonia]], a {{convert|16|acre|m2|adj=on}} rocky island off the coast of [[Nova Scotia]], founded by Russell Arundel, chairman of the Pepsi Cola Company (later: [[PepsiCo]]), in 1945 and comprising a population of 69 fishermen.\n\n[[File:Sealand-sky.jpg|thumb|left|The {{convert|550|m2|abbr=on}} [[Principality of Sealand]]]]\n\n===History during 1960 to 1980===\nThe 1960s and 1970s witnessed the foundation of a number of territorial micronations. The first of these, [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]], was established in 1967 on an abandoned [[World War II]] gun platform in the [[North Sea]] just off the [[East Anglian]] coast of England, and still survives. Others were founded on [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] principles and involved schemes to construct [[artificial island]]s, but only three are known to have had even limited success in realizing that goal.\n\nThe [[Republic of Rose Island]] was a {{convert|400|m2|abbr=on}} platform built in 1968 in Italian national waters in the [[Adriatic Sea]],{{convert|7|mi}} off the [[Italy|Italian]] town of [[Rimini]]. It is known to have issued stamps, and to have declared [[Esperanto]] to be its official language. Shortly after completion, however, it was seized and destroyed by the [[Italian Navy]] for failing to pay state taxes.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn the late 1960s, [[Leicester Hemingway]], brother of author [[Ernest Hemingway|Ernest]], was involved in another such project\u2014a small timber platform in international waters off the west coast of [[Jamaica]]. This territory, consisting of an {{convert|8|ft|m|adj=on}} by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} barge, he called \"New Atlantis\". Hemingway was an honorary citizen and President; however, the structure was damaged by storms and finally pillaged by Mexican fishermen. In 1973, Hemingway was reported to have moved on from New Atlantis to promoting a {{convert|1000|sqyd|abbr=on}} platform near the Bahamas. The new country was called \"Tierra del Mar\" (''Land of the Sea''). (Ernest Hemingway's adopted hometown of [[Key West]] was later itself part of another micronation; see [[Conch Republic]].)\n\nThe [[Republic of Minerva]] was set up in 1972 as a libertarian new-country project by [[Nevada]] businessman [[Michael Oliver (real estate)|Michael Oliver]]. Oliver's group conducted dredging operations at the [[Minerva Reefs]], a shoal located in the [[Pacific Ocean]] south of [[Fiji]]. They succeeded in creating a small artificial island, but their efforts at securing international recognition met with little success, and near-neighbour [[Tonga]] sent a military force to the area and annexed it.\n\nOn April 1, 1977, [[Bibliophily|bibliophile]] [[Richard Booth]] declared the [[Wales|Welsh]] town of [[Hay-on-Wye]] an independent kingdom with himself as its monarch. The town subsequently developed a healthy tourism industry based on literary interests, and \"King Richard\" (whose sceptre was a recycled toilet plunger) awarded Hay-on-Wye peerages and honours to anyone prepared to pay for them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/mid/halloffame/arts/richard_booth.shtml |title=Mid Wales Arts\u2014Richard Booth |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-09-24}}</ref>\n\n===Japanese micronations in the 1980s===\nIn 1981, drawing on a news report about Leicester Hemingway's \"New Atlantis\", novelist [[Hisashi Inoue]] wrote a 700-page work of [[magic realism]], ''[[Kirikirijin]]'', about a village that secedes from Japan and proclaims its bumpkinish, marginalized [[dialect]] its national language, and its subsequent [[war of independence]]. This single-handedly inspired a large number of Japanese villages, mostly in the northern regions, to \"declare independence\", generally as a move to raise awareness of their unique culture and crafts for urban Japanese who saw village life as backwards and uncultured. These micronations even held \"international summits\" from 1983 to 1985, and some of them formed confederations. Throughout the 1980s there was a \"micronation boom\" in Japan that brought many urban tourists to these wayward villages. But the harsh economic impact of the [[Japanese asset price bubble]] in 1991 ended the boom. Many of the villages were forced to merge with larger cities, and the micronations and confederations were generally dissolved.<ref>Shigeru Inoue, ''Nippon Matchidukuri Jiten'', pp. 407\u2013409, 2010, {{ISBN|4-621-08194-2}}</ref>\n\n===Australian and New Zealand developments===\nMicronational developments that occurred in New Zealand and Australia in the final three decades of the 20th century included:\n*The [[Principality of Hutt River]] was founded in 1970, when Leonard Casley declared his property independent after a dispute over wheat quotas.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Kober|first2=Ralph|date=2018-04-18|title=The Principality Of Hutt River: A Territory Marooned in the Western Australian Outback|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|volume=12|issue=1|doi=10.21463/shima.12.1.13|issn=1834-6057|doi-access=free}}</ref><ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|22\u201327}}\n*In 1976 the [[Province of Bumbunga]] was created on a rural property near [[Snowtown, South Australia]], by an eccentric British monarchist.<ref name=\"Cook2018\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/south-australia/bumbunga-governor-alec-brackstones-relentless-will-to-secede/news-story/d743e96aaf5cb71cfc28b26bf7a30a6d |title=Bumbunga Governor Alec Brackstone\u2019s relentless will to secede |date=30 June 2018 |publisher=[[Sunday Mail (Adelaide)|Sunday Mail]] |first=Craig | last=Cook}}</ref>\n*The [[Sovereign State of Aeterna Lucina]] was created in a hamlet on the [[New South Wales]] north coast in 1978.<ref name=telboy>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/isnt-it-every-little-boys-dream-to-control-everybody/news-story/2cd2c567df9146fde9083af460bc202b |title=\u2019Isn\u2019t it every little boy\u2019s dream, to control everybody?\u2019 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]] |date=14 April 2017}}</ref> \n*In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], a long-running dispute over flood damage to farm properties led to the creation of the [[Independent State of Rainbow Creek]] in 1979.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|145}}\n*An anti-taxation campaigner founded the [[Grand Duchy of Avram]] in western [[Tasmania]] in the 1980s;  \"His Grace the Duke of Avram\" was later elected to the Tasmanian Parliament.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|144}}\n*The [[Independent State of Aramoana]] was established in New Zealand in 1980.<ref>{{cite web |title=New New Zealand Island: The Kiwi pastime of micronations |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/travel/news/article.cfm?c_id=7&objectid=12152617 |website=New Zealand Herald |publisher=NZME Publishing |accessdate=3 February 2020}}</ref>\n*The [[Empire of Atlantium]] was established in [[Sydney]], in 1981 as a non-territorial global government.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|74\u201377}}\n*The Republic of [[Whangamomona]] was established in 1989.<ref name=\"Lonely Planet\"/>{{Rp|34\u201337}}\n*A mortgage foreclosure dispute led George and Stephanie Muirhead of [[Rockhampton]], Queensland, to briefly and abortively secede as the [[Principality of Marlborough]] in 1993.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/outback-duke-takes-on-the-bank-a-queensland-man-has-defied-australia-by-creating-a-principality-to-1490896.html|title=Outback 'duke' takes on the bank: A Queensland man has defied Australia by creating a principality to escape his debts|last=Milliken|first=Robert|date=10 June 1993|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=20 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620084627/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/outback-duke-takes-on-the-bank-a-queensland-man-has-defied-australia-by-creating-a-principality-to-1490896.html|archive-date=20 June 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Effects of the Internet===\nMicronationalism shed much of its traditionally eccentric anti-establishment mantle and took on a distinctly hobbyist perspective in the mid-1990s, when the emerging popularity of the Internet made it possible to create and promote statelike entities in an entirely electronic medium with relative ease. An early example is the [[Talossa|Kingdom of Talossa]], a micronation created in 1979 by then-14-year-old [[Robert Ben Madison]], which went online in November 1995, and was reported in ''[[The New York Times]]'' and other print media in 2000.<ref name=nytimes2000>{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Mimh |title=Utopian Rulers, and Spoofs, Stake Out Territory Online |work=The New York Times |date=May 25, 2000}}\n</ref> As a result, the number of exclusively online, fantasy or simulation-based micronations expanded dramatically.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} The micronation [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]] coexists as both a physical territory and as a large and active online community that resembles a [[third place]], distinguishing itself from other micronations, which are either active online communities or claim small physical territories.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Bicudo de Castro|first=Vicente|last2=Kober|first2=Ralph|date=2019-04-15|title=The Royal Republic of Ladonia: A Micronation built of Driftwood, Concrete and Bytes|url=https://shimajournal.org/issues/v13n1/10.-Bicudo-de-Castro-and-Kober-Shima-v13n1.pdf|journal=Shima: The International Journal of Research into Island Cultures|doi=10.21463/shima.13.1.10}}</ref>\n\nThe activities of these types of micronations are almost exclusively limited to simulations of diplomatic activity (including the signing of \"treaties\" and participation in \"supra-micronational\" forums such as the League of Micronations) and contribution to [[wiki]]s. With the introduction of the Internet, many articles on how to create micronations were made available on such wikis, which serve as a hub of online activity for micronations.

No such occupation or acquisition will be recognized as legal.}}\n\nIn effect, this states that ''other'' states (i.e., third parties), may not encourage secession in a state. This does not make any statement as regards persons within a state electing to secede of their own accord.\n\n==Academic, literary, and media attention==\nThere has been a small but growing amount of attention paid to the micronation phenomenon in recent years. Most interest in academic circles has been concerned with studying the apparently anomalous legal situations affecting such entities as [[Principality of Sealand|Sealand]] and the [[Hutt River Province Principality|Hutt River Province]], in exploring how some micronations represent grassroots political ideas, and in the creation of role-playing entities for instructional purposes.\n\nIn 2000, Professor Fabrice O'Driscoll, of the [[Aix-Marseille University]], published a book about micronations: ''Ils ne si\u00e8gent pas \u00e0 l'ONU'' (''They are not in the United Nations''), with more than 300 pages dedicated to the subject.<ref name=\"webcitation.org\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20011118220308/http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/5829/Livre.html '&#39;Ils ne si\u00e8gent pas \u00e0 l'ONU'&#39;].
