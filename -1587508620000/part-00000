It was named after a brand of [[synthesizer]], the [[Korg Polysix]]. The band started in 1997, but got their big break in 1998 at a concert in [[Tokyo]]. They create high energy music, fusing conventional [[guitar]] music with synthesized and computer generated sound to create a unique mixture of [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[synthpop]] heavily inspired by the American bands [[Devo]] and [[The Tubes]], as well as Japanese bands such as [[P-Model]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Their song lyrics often consist of [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]], [[English (language)|English]], or just downright [[gibberish]]. The band has been noted for their extremely energetic live performances and their wild gimmicky outfits, notably their [[straight-bar sunglasses]] and trademark orange [[boiler suit]]s stamped with a simple \"P\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:POLYSICS Hiroyuki Hayashi-9-30-03.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroyuki Hayashi (singer)|Hiroyuki Hayashi]] plays guitar at a POLYSICS live show in 2003, supporting the US release of the album '''Neu''']]\nPolysics was formed in 1997 by Japanese high-school student Hiroyuki Hayashi.

He was joined by drummer Junichi Sugai and Sako (aka Poly 2). Another member named Kaneko joined within the early years of the band, but he left and was soon replaced by Kayo.  Kayo's mechanical stage presence provided an asymmetrical dynamic to the frenetic antics of the other three members. The name of the band derives from the first [[synthesizer]] owned by Hayashi, the [[Korg Polysix]]. This synth appears in two of their early [[music video]]s.\n\nIn 1999, Polysics released their first albums ''[[1st P]]'' and ''[[A.D.S.R.M!]]'' on the independent label DECKREC Records. Just after the release of ''1st P'' their bassist, known only as \"POLY-2\", left. The band dropped the \"POLY-''X''\" names, and reduced to a trio, with new member Fumi on Bass Support on some of the tracks from ''[[Neu (album)|Neu]]''. In 1999, [[Asian Man Records]] released their US debut album, ''[[Hey! Bob! My Friend!]]'' to rave reviews, but weak sales. The album was a compilation of tracks from their first two Japanese releases. In 2000, Polysics signed to [[Ki/oon Records]] (a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Japan]] Inc.) and released their first major album ''Neu''. The album carried with it the same manic energy as their independent releases but more refined. On the 2001 album ''[[Eno (album)|Eno]]'', Synthesizers became more prevalent in the mix, but the songs still had an intense [[Punk rock|punk]]-like energy. For this album, Fumi applied as a full member, returning Polysics to a [[quartet]]. 2002 saw the release of the album ''[[For Young Electric Pop]]'', Polysics' attempt at a [[pop music|pop]] album. The manic punk energy was minimized, but the band showed it had an amazing sense of harmony and style.\n\nIn 2003, ''Neu'' was released in the United States on Asian Man Records to rave reviews and great sales. However, shortly after recording the ''[[Kaja Kaja Goo EP]]'' drummer Junichi Sugai left the band. Ishimaru (drummer for the punk group [[Snail Ramp]]) temporarily joined as a replacement. For the 2003 album ''[[National P]]'', Polysics went to the US to tour, which was then captured on the ''[[PippikkippippiP In USA]]'' [[DVD]].\n\nAlso during 2003, Polysics appeared on UK television for the programme [[Adam & Joe Go Tokyo]] performing \"Kaja Kaja Goo\".\n\nIn 2004, Polysics released a greatest hits compilation titled ''[[Polysics or Die!!!!]]'' in [[Europe]] and the United States. Yano had also replaced Sugai as the new drummer for the band in this year. Polysics toured Europe and the US for the 2005 US Release of ''Polysics or Die!!!!''. With the early 2006 release of ''[[Now Is the Time!]]'', they toured the US and the UK, supporting high-profile UK artists such as [[Graham Coxon]] and [[Kaiser Chiefs]].\n\nOn February 28, 2007 Polysics released their album ''[[Karate House]]'' in Japan.\n\nFollowing this Polysics signed for [[MySpace Records]] making plans to re-release Polysics or Die!!!! in the US, with the inclusion of the latest singles from Karate House and a bonus DVD of videos and live cuts. [[Polysics or Die!!!! Vista]] was released on October 9, 2007 for Myspace Records exclusively for the United States, to mark the band's ten-year anniversary. Hayashi did a remix of the \"[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans Theme]]\" by JPop group [[Puffy AmiYumi]]. The song \"Teen Titans Theme ~POLYSICS' CR-06 MIX~\" appears on their US album ''[[Splurge (Puffy album)|Splurge]]''.\n\nOn April 23, 2008, ''[[We Ate the Machine]]'' was released in Japan. It was released on September 30, 2008 in North America.\n\nIn their newsletter it was announced that Kayo's last day with Polysics would be March 14, 2010, the day of their huge [[Nippon Budokan]] concert. She says that she has spent happy and quality time with the band, but she wants to live on as a woman and not a musician.<ref>[http://www.polysics.com/kayo/kayo_leave.html Kayo's departure announcement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227004753/http://www.polysics.com/kayo/kayo_leave.html |date=2009-12-27 }} '''(Japanese)'''</ref>\n\nTheir Budokan concert, ''[[BUDOKAN OR DIE!!!! 2010.3.14]]'', was released on July 7, 2010 on both DVD and Blu-ray.\n\nOn August 8, 2010 they came back from their hiatus during the [[Rock in Japan Festival]] as a trio in brand new outfits and visors.\n\nThey covered [[Buck-Tick]]'s \"Sid Vicious on the Beach\" for ''[[Parade II -Respective Tracks of Buck-Tick-]]'', released on July 4, 2012.<ref name=\"Parade 2\">{{cite web| title = New BUCK-TICK Tribute Album to be Released in July!| work = musicjapanplus.jp| url = http://www.musicjapanplus.jp/news/1/15126/new-buck-tick-tribute-album-to-be-released-in-july/| accessdate = 2014-05-08}}</ref> \n\nIn 2018, Polysics started a side project called The Vocoders, with a presentation modeled off [[Kraftwerk]].\n\nAs of the 30th of August, 2019, the [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgeTmrrtk9xUr_ijiTDJiYA official Polysics YouTube channel] is stated as 'not available', however their music videos are still available to watch as recommended videos, or if you have the link.\n\n==Influences==\nIn Hiroyuki's words, Polysics is inspired by \"the spirit of [[Devo]].\" Obvious references to Devo have been made in Polysics videos, and songs. The band has also covered \"Jerking Back And Forth\", \"Social Fools\", \"[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]\" and on their 15th anniversary album, [[15th P]], Devo front man, [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] joined the band to perform a new version of \"Mecha-Mania Boy\". Polysics have also creatively repurposed Devo and other new wave/punk material in their own original songs; for instance, in the song \"Each Life Each End\" from the album \"Neu\" they borrow the opening riff from the Devo song \"Girl U Want\" (along with a sample from \"Love Missile F1-11\" by [[Sigue Sigue Sputnik]]), and the lyrics are playfully paraphrased from Devo's \"The Day My Baby Gave Me A Surprize\" and \"Red Eye Express.\" The tributes even extend to the album art; in a [[poster|miniposter]] included with the album \"National P\", the members of Polysics are shown seated around a picnic blanket, about to eat cakes shaped like Devo's famous red [[Energy Dome]] headgear. In addition, the giant robot mascot from the cover of their \"Lo-Bits\" EP sports a battle helmet that resembles the same iconic dome.\n\nWhile Polysics claim Devo as their most prevalent influence, other bands and artists that have influenced their music, are occasionally referenced in their album or song titles, and whose music has sometime been repurposed in similar ways include [[Neu!]], [[Brian Eno]], [[XTC]], [[P-Model]] (who they have opened for), [[Talking Heads]], [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], [[The B-52's]], [[King Crimson]], [[Kraftwerk]], [[Denki Groove]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Man or Astroman]], [[Spoozys]], and [[David Bowie]], [[Hikashu]] and [[Plastics (band)|Plastics]].

It was named after a brand of [[synthesizer]], the [[Korg Polysix]]. The band started in 1997, but got their big break in 1998 at a concert in [[Tokyo]]. They create high energy music, fusing conventional [[guitar]] music with synthesized and computer generated sound to create a unique mixture of [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[synthpop]] heavily inspired by the American bands [[Devo]] and [[The Tubes]], as well as Japanese bands such as [[P-Model]] and [[Yellow Magic Orchestra]]. Their song lyrics often consist of [[Japanese (language)|Japanese]], [[English (language)|English]], or just downright [[gibberish]]. The band has been noted for their extremely energetic live performances and their wild gimmicky outfits, notably their [[straight-bar sunglasses]] and trademark orange [[boiler suit]]s stamped with a simple \"P\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:POLYSICS Hiroyuki Hayashi-9-30-03.jpg|thumb|[[Hiroyuki Hayashi (singer)|Hiroyuki Hayashi]] plays guitar at a POLYSICS live show in 2003, supporting the US release of the album '''Neu''']]\nPolysics was formed in 1997 by Japanese high-school student Hiroyuki Hayashi.

The leaves are greyish green, narrow egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base, {{cvt|15-30|mm}} long and {{cvt|5-10|mm}} wide on a short petiole. The flowers are borne on short side shoots, usually in pairs of different ages, and are usually {{cvt|15-20|mm}} wide. There are many reddish brown [[bract]]s around the flower buds but most fall off as the flower opens. The [[Hypanthium|floral cup]] is mostly [[wikt:glabrous|glabrous]], {{cvt|3-4|mm}} long with the upper part expanded. The [[sepal]]s are triangular, about {{cvt|2|mm}} long, the [[petal]]s white, {{cvt|5-8|mm}} long and the [[stamen]]s {{cvt|1.5-2.5|mm}} long. Flowering mainly occurs from August to October and the fruit is a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] {{cvt|7-8|mm}} wide with the remains of the sepals initially attached.
