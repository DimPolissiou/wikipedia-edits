Unlicensed accountants may be [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs) and [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs). The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification. Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant. As noted above, the majority of accountants work in the private sector or may offer their services without the need for certification.\n\nThe training time required for accountancy certification in the US requires specific guidelines:\n* Certificate: Several months to a year\n* Associate degree: 1\u20132 years\n* Bachelor's degree: 3\u20134 years\n* CPA: 5 years of education (150 semester college credits) plus 1\u20132 years of work experience (length of work experience requirement depends on which state is granting the license)\n* Master's degree: 1\u20132 years\n* Doctoral degree: 3\u20135 years\n\nA CPA is licensed by a state to provide auditing services to the public. Many CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services. The requirements for receiving the CPA license vary from state to state, although the passage of the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]] is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA).\n\nA PA (sometimes referred to as LPA\u2014Licensed Public Accountant) is licensed by the state to practice accountancy to the same extent as are CPAs, although in some states PAs are not permitted to perform audits or reviews (notably Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, & South Carolina). A PA's ability to practice out of state is very limited due to most states having phased out the PA designation. While most states no longer accept new PA license applicants, four states still accept PA applicants for practice privileges within the state. As with the CPA, the requirements for receiving the PA license vary from state to state. Most states require a passage of either two or three (out of four) sections of the CPA exam or passage of the Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which is administered and graded by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT).\n\nA certified internal auditor (CIA) is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate has passed a four-part examination. One of the four parts is waived if the candidate has already passed the CPA Exam. A CIA typically provides services directly to an employer rather than to the public.\n\nA person holding the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) is granted the certificate by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate has passed an examination of two parts and has met the practical experience requirement of the IMA. A CMA provides services directly to employers rather than to the public. A CMA can also provide services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.\n\nAn [[Enrolled agent|Enrolled Agent]] (EA) is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS, unlimited rights of representation.<ref>Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].</ref> The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. Candidates must pass a three-part exam (called the [[Special Enrollment Examination]]) covering the subjects of individual tax, business tax, and client representation, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in these areas.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm|title=Accountants and Auditors|author=|date=|website=www.BLS.gov|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.\n\n[[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax laws]] grant CPAs and EAs a form of [[accountant\u2013client privilege]].\n\n===Non-certified accountants===\n{{Main|List of accounting roles}}\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, there are three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies which all enjoy the same recognition and can be considered as \"qualified accountant\": the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (IPA), [[CPA Australia]] (CPA) and the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] (CAANZ). Other international bodies such as [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW) enjoy recognition for the purposes of supporting their members in their careers. For instance, ACCA has achieved recognition by the Tax Practitioner Board, as Tax and BAS agents, in 2010.\n\n==Canada==\nIn Canada, a '''[[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA)''' must be a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (designatory letters CPA).\n\nUp to 2013, there were three nationally recognized accounting designations in Canada: Chartered Accountant (CA), [[Certified General Accountant]] (CGA), and Certified Management Accountants (CMA). The national CA and CGA bodies were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively, The national CMA organization was established under the Canada Corporations Act in 1920.\n\nIn January 2012, following eight months of member and stakeholder consultation, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) issued ''A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession'' under a new Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada ([[CPA Canada]]) was established by CICA and CMA Canada on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, to support Canadian provincial accounting bodies that were unifying under the CPA banner. CGA-Canada integrated with CPA Canada on October 1, 2014, completing the unification of Canada's accounting profession at the national level.\n\nAll recognized national and provincial accounting bodies in Canada have now unified under the CPA banner. The Canadian CPA designation is held by more than 200,000 members in Canada and around the world.\n==Japan==\nIn Japan, a certified public accountant must be a member of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA).

A member of one of them may also become a ''Statutory Auditor'' in accordance with the Companies Act, providing they are a member of one of the five Recognised Supervisory Bodies '''RSB''' mentioned above.\n\nAll six RQBs are listed under EU mutual recognition directives to practise in 27 EU member states and individually entered into agreement with the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA).\n\nFurther restrictions apply to accountants who carry out insolvency work.\n\nIn addition to the bodies above, technical qualifications are offered by the [[Association of Accounting Technicians]], ACCA and AIA, which are respectively called AAT Technician, CAT ([[Certified Accounting Technician]]) and IAT (International Accounting Technician).\n==United States==\n{{Further|Legal liability of certified public accountants}}\nIn the United States, licensed accountants are [[Certified Public Accountant]]s (CPAs), and in certain states, Public Accountants (PAs). Unlicensed accountants may be [[Certified Internal Auditor]]s (CIAs) and [[Certified Management Accountant]]s (CMAs). The difference between these certifications is primarily the legal status and the types of services provided, although individuals may earn more than one certification. Additionally, much accounting work is performed by uncertified individuals, who may be working under the supervision of a certified accountant. As noted above, the majority of accountants work in the private sector or may offer their services without the need for certification.\n\nThe training time required for accountancy certification in the US requires specific guidelines:\n* Certificate: Several months to a year\n* Associate degree: 1\u20132 years\n* Bachelor's degree: 3\u20134 years\n* CPA: 5 years of education (150 semester college credits) plus 1\u20132 years of work experience (length of work experience requirement depends on which state is granting the license)\n* Master's degree: 1\u20132 years\n* Doctoral degree: 3\u20135 years\n\nA CPA is licensed by a state to provide auditing services to the public. Many CPA firms also offer accounting, tax, litigation support, and other financial advisory services. The requirements for receiving the CPA license vary from state to state, although the passage of the [[Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination]] is required by all states. This examination is designed and graded by the [[American Institute of Certified Public Accountants]] (AICPA).\n\nA PA (sometimes referred to as LPA\u2014Licensed Public Accountant) is licensed by the state to practice accountancy to the same extent as are CPAs, although in some states PAs are not permitted to perform audits or reviews (notably Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, & South Carolina). A PA's ability to practice out of state is very limited due to most states having phased out the PA designation. While most states no longer accept new PA license applicants, four states still accept PA applicants for practice privileges within the state. As with the CPA, the requirements for receiving the PA license vary from state to state. Most states require a passage of either two or three (out of four) sections of the CPA exam or passage of the Comprehensive Examination for Accreditation in Accounting which is administered and graded by the Accreditation Council for Accountancy and Taxation (ACAT).\n\nA certified internal auditor (CIA) is granted a certificate from the Institute of Internal Auditors (IIA), provided that the candidate has passed a four-part examination. One of the four parts is waived if the candidate has already passed the CPA Exam. A CIA typically provides services directly to an employer rather than to the public.\n\nA person holding the Certificate in Management Accounting (CMA) is granted the certificate by the Institute of Management Accountants (IMA), provided that the candidate has passed an examination of two parts and has met the practical experience requirement of the IMA. A CMA provides services directly to employers rather than to the public. A CMA can also provide services to the public, but to an extent much lesser than that of a CPA.\n\nAn [[Enrolled agent|Enrolled Agent]] (EA) is a federally authorized tax practitioner empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS). Enrolled agent status is the highest credential awarded by the IRS, unlimited rights of representation.<ref>Enrolled Agent Information, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury, at [https://www.irs.gov/Tax-Professionals/Enrolled-Agents/Enrolled-Agent-Information].</ref> The EA credential is recognized across all 50 [[U.S. states]]. Candidates must pass a three-part exam (called the [[Special Enrollment Examination]]) covering the subjects of individual tax, business tax, and client representation, or must have worked at the IRS for five consecutive years in a position which regularly engaged in these areas.\n\nThe [[United States Department of Labor]]'s [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] estimates that there are about one million persons<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes132011.htm|title=Accountants and Auditors|author=|date=|website=www.BLS.gov|access-date=2 August 2017}}</ref> employed as accountants and auditors in the U.S.\n\n[[Taxation in the United States|U.S. tax laws]] grant CPAs and EAs a form of [[accountant\u2013client privilege]].\n\n===Non-certified accountants===\n{{Main|List of accounting roles}}\n\n==Australia==\nIn Australia, there are three legally recognised local professional accounting bodies which all enjoy the same recognition and can be considered as \"qualified accountant\": the [[Institute of Public Accountants]] (IPA), [[CPA Australia]] (CPA) and the [[Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand]] (CAANZ). Other international bodies such as [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|ACCA]] (The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants) and [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] (ICAEW) enjoy recognition for the purposes of supporting their members in their careers. For instance, ACCA has achieved recognition by the Tax Practitioner Board, as Tax and BAS agents, in 2010.\n\n==Canada==\nIn Canada, a '''[[Chartered Professional Accountant]] (CPA)''' must be a member of the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (designatory letters CPA).\n\nUp to 2013, there were three nationally recognized accounting designations in Canada: Chartered Accountant (CA), [[Certified General Accountant]] (CGA), and Certified Management Accountants (CMA). The national CA and CGA bodies were created by Acts of Parliament in 1902 and 1913 respectively, The national CMA organization was established under the Canada Corporations Act in 1920.\n\nIn January 2012, following eight months of member and stakeholder consultation, the Canadian Institute of Chartered Accountants (CICA), the Society of Management Accountants of Canada (CMA Canada) and Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) issued ''A Framework for Uniting the Canadian Accounting Profession'' under a new Canadian Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation. Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada ([[CPA Canada]]) was established by CICA and CMA Canada on January 1, 2013, under the Canada Not-for-profit Corporations Act, to support Canadian provincial accounting bodies that were unifying under the CPA banner. CGA-Canada integrated with CPA Canada on October 1, 2014, completing the unification of Canada's accounting profession at the national level.\n\nAll recognized national and provincial accounting bodies in Canada have now unified under the CPA banner. The Canadian CPA designation is held by more than 200,000 members in Canada and around the world.\n==Japan==\nIn Japan, a certified public accountant must be a member of the Japanese Institute of Certified Public Accountants (JICPA). It is the sole professional accountancy organization in Japan.\n\n==India==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}Chartered accountancy is offered in India by the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants of India]] (ICAI), the second largest accounting body in the world. This Institute was established in 1949 under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 for the regulation of the profession of chartered accountants in India.\n\nThe ICAI set up the Accountancy Museum of India in 2009, the third museum of accounting in the world. It is located at ICAI's office in [[Noida]].\n\nIn addition to the financial accountants, there are Cost Accountants who are solely responsible for the profession of  Cost and Management Accountancy in India. A Cost and Management Accountant is registered as a  member under [[ Institute of Cost Accountants of India |the Institute of Cost Accountants of India(ICMAI)]] previously known as (ICWAI) which is a statutory body constituted under the Cost and Works Accountants Act 1959 enacted by the Parliament of India, it is also the second largest Management Accountancy body in the world.

{"title_page": "Polish grammar", "text_new": "The [[grammar]] of the [[Polish language]] is characterized by a high degree of [[inflected language|inflection]], and has relatively free [[word order]], although the dominant arrangement is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object]] (SVO). There are no [[article (grammar)|articles]], and there is frequent [[Pro-drop language|dropping of subject pronouns]]. Distinctive features include the different treatment of [[masculine personal]] nouns in the plural, and the complex grammar of [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]].\n\n==Regular morphological alternation==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Regular alternation}}\nCertain regular or common [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]s apply across the Polish inflectional system, affecting the morphology of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other parts of speech. Some of these result from the [[Polish phonology#Vowel distribution|restricted distribution]] of the vowels ''i'' and ''y'', and from the [[Polish phonology#Voicing and devoicing|voicing rules]] for consonants in clusters and at the end of words. Otherwise, the main changes are the following:\n*vowel alternations, arising from the [[Polish phonology#Historical development|historical development]] of certain vowels, which cause vowel changes in some words depending on whether the syllable is closed or open, or whether the following consonant is soft or hard;\n*consonant changes caused by certain endings (such as the ''-ie'' of the [[locative]] case, and the ''-i'' of the masculine personal plural), which historically entailed [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding consonant, and now produce a number of different changes depending on which consonant is involved.\n\n==Nouns==\n<span id=\"Nouns and adjectives\"></span><!-- This section is linked from [[Grammatical gender]] -->\n{{main|Polish morphology#Nouns}}\nPolish retains the Old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] system of [[grammatical case|case]]s for [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, and [[adjective]]s. There are seven cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] {{lang|pl|(mianownik)}}, [[Genitive case|genitive]] {{lang|pl|(dope\u0142niacz)}}, [[Dative case|dative]] {{lang|pl|(celownik)}}, [[Accusative case|accusative]] {{lang|pl|(biernik)}}, [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] {{lang|pl|(narz\u0119dnik)}}, [[Locative case|locative]] {{lang|pl|(miejscownik)}}, and [[Vocative case|vocative]] {{lang|pl|(wo\u0142acz)}}.\n\n=== Number ===\nPolish has two [[Grammatical number|number classes]]: singular and plural.\n\nIt used to also have the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] number, but it vanished around the 15th century. It survived only in a few [[relicts]]:\n\n* body parts that naturally come in pairs have synchronically irregular plural and other forms\n** ''oko'' (\"eye\") - pl. ''oczy'', genitive plural ''oczu'', instrumental plural regular ''oczami'' or irregular ''oczyma''; but not in the sense of \"drop of fat on a liquid\", which is declined regularly\n** ''r\u0119ka'' (\"hand, arm\") - pl.

''uszy,'' genitive plural ''uszu'', instrumental plural regular ''uszami'' or irregular ''uszyma''; but not in the sense of \"a handle (of a jug or a kettle, etc.)\", which is declined regularly\n* certain proverbs, e.g. ''M\u0105drej g\u0142owie do\u015b\u0107 dwie s\u0142owie'' (lit. \"two words are enough for a wise head\"), with dual ''dwie s\u0142owie'' (modern ''dwa s\u0142owa'')\n\n=== Gender ===\nThere are three main [[Grammatical gender|gender]]s (''rodzaje''): masculine (''m\u0119ski''), feminine (''\u017ce\u0144ski'') and neuter (''nijaki''). Masculine nouns are further divided into personal (''m\u0119skoosobowy''), animate (''m\u0119sko\u017cywotny''), and inanimate (''m\u0119skorzeczowy'') categories. Personal and animate nouns are distinguished from inanimate nouns in the accusative singular; for the latter the accusative is identical to the nominative. In the plural, the masculine personal nouns are distinguished from all others, which collapse into one non-masculine personal gender (''niem\u0119skoosobowy'').\n\nThe table below presents examples of how a determiner ''ten/ta/to'' (\"that\") agrees with nouns of different genders in the nominative and the accusative, both singular and plural.

also ''pani'' (\"Mrs\")\n**feminine last names ending in a consonant are invariable\n*neuter:\n**neuter nouns typically end in ''-o''\n**verbal nouns, which are always neuter, end in ''-e'', e.g. ''jedzenie, \u015bpiewanie,'' etc.\n**diminutives ending in ''-\u0119'' are always neuter, e.g. ''\u017arebi\u0119'' (\"foal\"), ''dzieci\u0119'' (\"child\")\n**loanwords ending in ''-i'' are neuter and invariable, e.g. ''kiwi, Brunei, Burundi''\n**acronyms ending in a vowel (in pronunciation), e.g. ''BMW'' {{IPAc-pl|b\u025b \u025bm \u02c8vu}}; if an acronym is native, its gender may also be equal to the gender of the noun in the full version of the acronym\n\nThe distinction between personal, animate and inanimate nouns is largely semantic, although not always. Example of grammatically animate nouns are:\n\n* names of consumer goods and brands, e.g. ''mercedes'' (\"Mercedes\"), ''Nikon'' (as in ''Mam Nikona'' - \"I have a Nikon\"), ''papieros'' (\"cigarette\")\n*names of currency, e.g. ''dolar'' (\"dollar\"), ''funt'' (\"pound\")\n*names of dances, e.g. ''polonez'' (\"[[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]\")\n*names of fruit, e.g. ''ananas'' (\"pineapple\"), ''banan'' (\"banana\")\n*names of viruses, bacteria, fungi, e.g. ''borowik'' (\"[[Boletus edulis|cep]]\"), ''grzyb'' (\"mushroom\"), ''wirus'' (\"virus\")\n*loanwords relating to information technologies, e.g. ''blog, komputer'' (\"computer\")\n*nouns relating to human or human-like referents which are not necessarily semantically animate, e.g. ''nieboszczyk, trup'' (both of which mean \"corpse\"), ''robot, wisielec'' (\"the body of a hanged person\")\n\nIt's common for personal masculine nouns to change gender to inanimate to create semantic neologisms, for example ''edytor'' (\"editor\", pl. ''ci edytorzy'') and ''edytor (tekstu)'' (\"word processor software\", pl. ''te edytory'').\n\nThere are few nouns that change meaning by changing gender outside of the masculine. They are:\n\n* ''biel'': masculine - \"[[Sapwood (wood)|sapwood]]\", feminine - \"the colour white, whiteness\"\n* ''Niemcy:'' plural masculine personal - \"Germans\", plural non-masculine personal - \"Germany\"\n* ''twardziel'': masculine - \"tough guy\", feminine - \"[[Hardwood|heartwood]]\"\n* ''w\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119ga'': masculine - \"wanderer\", feminine - \"roaming\"\n* ''\u017co\u0142\u0105d\u017a'': masculine - \"acorn\", feminine - \"glans penis\"\n\n=== Declension ===\nTypical declension patterns are as follows:\n\n* {{lang|pl|klub}} (\"club\"; an inanimate masculine noun) \u2013 N/A {{lang|pl|klub}}, G {{lang|pl|klubu}}, D {{lang|pl|klubowi}}, I {{lang|pl|klubem}}, L/V {{lang|pl|klubie}}.

This includes all personal and animate masculines (ending in a consonant). Also masculine animate nouns have accusative singular equal to the genitive singular (in ''-a''). Masculine personal nouns also have accusative plural equal to genitive plural, and often have nominative plural in ''-i''.\n\n==Adjectives==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Adjectives}}\nAdjectives agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender, number and case. They are declined according to the following pattern (''dumny'' means \"proud\"):\n*masculine singular: N/V {{lang|pl|dumny}}, G {{lang|pl|dumnego}}, D {{lang|pl|dumnemu}}, A {{lang|pl|dumny}} (for inanimate nouns)/''dumnego'' (animate), I/L {{lang|pl|dumnym}}\n*feminine singular: N/V {{lang|pl|dumna}}, G/D/L {{lang|pl|dumnej}}, A/I {{lang|pl|dumn\u0105}}\n*neuter singular: N/V/A {{lang|pl|dumne}}, G/D/I/L as masculine\n*plural: N/V/A {{lang|pl|dumne}} (but for masculine personal nouns N/V {{lang|pl|dumni}} A {{lang|pl|dumnych}}), G/L {{lang|pl|dumnych}}, D {{lang|pl|dumnym}}, I {{lang|pl|dumnymi}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Case\n! colspan=\"4\" |Singular number\n! colspan=\"2\" |Plural number\n|-\n!Masculine animate<br> {{lang|pl|m\u0119ski o\u017cywiony}}\n!Masculine inanimate<br> {{lang|pl|m\u0119ski nieo\u017cywiony}}\n!Neuter<br> {{lang|pl|nijaki}}\n!Feminine<br> {{lang|pl|\u017ce\u0144ski}}\n!Masculine personal<br> {{lang|pl|m\u0119skoosobowy}}\n!Not masculine personal <br> {{lang|pl|niem\u0119skoosobowy}},<br> i.e. masculine impersonal, <br> feminine, and neutral\n|-\n!Nominative (''mianownik'')\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |dumny\n| rowspan=\"3\" |dumne\n| rowspan=\"2\" |dumna\n| rowspan=\"2\" |dumni\n| rowspan=\"3\" |dumne\n|-\n!Vocative (''wo\u0142acz'')\n|-\n!Accusative (''biernik'')\n|dumnego\n|dumny\n| rowspan=\"2\" |dumn\u0105\n|dumnych\n|-\n!Instrumental (''narz\u0119dnik'')\n| colspan=\"3\" rowspan=\"2\" |dumnym\n| colspan=\"2\" |dumnymi\n|-\n!Locative (''miejscownik'')\n| rowspan=\"3\" |dumnej\n| colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |dumnych\n|-\n!Genitive (''dope\u0142niacz'')\n| colspan=\"3\" |dumnego\n|-\n!Dative (''celownik'')\n| colspan=\"3\" |dumnemu\n| colspan=\"2\" |dumnym\n|}\n\nFor a table showing the declension of Polish adjectival surnames, ending in ''-ski/-ska'' or ''-cki/-cka'', see [[Polish name#Declension of adjectival surnames|Declension of adjectival surnames]].\n\nMost short adjectives have a comparative form in ''-szy'' or ''-iejszy'', and a superlative obtained by prefixing ''naj-'' to the comparative.\nFor adjectives that do not have these forms, the words {{lang|pl|bardziej}} (\"more\") and {{lang|pl|najbardziej}} (\"most\") are used before the adjective to make comparative and superlative phrases.\n\nAdverbs are formed from adjectives with the ending ''ie'', or in some cases ''-o''. Comparatives of adverbs are formed (where they exist) with the ending ''-iej''. Superlatives have the prefix ''naj-'' as for adjectives.\n\n==Pronouns==\nThe [[personal pronoun]]s of Polish (nominative forms) are ''ja'' (\"I\"), ''ty'' (\"you\", singular, [[T\u2013V distinction|familiar]]), {{lang|pl|on}} (\"he\", or \"it\" corresponding to masculine nouns), {{lang|pl|ona}} (\"she\", or \"it\" corresponding to feminine nouns), {{lang|pl|ono}} (\"it\" corresponding to neuter nouns), {{lang|pl|my}} (\"we\"), {{lang|pl|wy}} (\"you\", plural, familiar), {{lang|pl|oni}} (\"they\", corresponding to a masculine personal group \u2013 see [[#Noun syntax|Noun syntax]] above), {{lang|pl|one}} (\"they\" in other cases; group where are only girls/women).\n\nThe [[T\u2013V distinction|polite second-person]] pronouns are the same as the nouns {{lang|pl|pan}} (\"gentleman, Mr\"), {{lang|pl|pani}} (\"lady, Mrs\") and their plurals {{lang|pl|panowie, panie}}. The mixed-sex plural is {{lang|pl|pa\u0144stwo}}.  All second-person pronouns are often capitalized for politeness, in letters etc.\n\nFor the full declension of these pronouns, see [[Polish morphology#Pronouns|''Pronouns'']] in the article on Polish morphology. Subject pronouns can be [[pro-drop|dropped]] if the meaning is clear and they are not emphasized. Sometimes there are alternative forms available for a given personal pronoun in a given case:\n*there may be a form beginning with ''n-'', used after prepositions (for example, the accusative of {{lang|pl|ona}} is {{lang|pl|ni\u0105}} after a preposition rather than {{lang|pl|j\u0105}});  \n*there may be a [[clitic]] form, used when unstressed, but not after prepositions (such as {{lang|pl|mi}} as the dative of {{lang|pl|ja}}, an alternative to {{lang|pl|mnie}}).\n\nThe [[reflexive pronoun]] for all persons and numbers is {{lang|pl|si\u0119}}.\n\nThe [[possessive adjective]]s (also used as possessive pronouns) derived from the personal pronouns are {{lang|pl|m\u00f3j}}, {{lang|pl|tw\u00f3j}}, {{lang|pl|jego}} (m., n.)/''jej'' (f.); {{lang|pl|nasz}}, {{lang|pl|wasz}}, {{lang|pl|ich}}. There is also a reflexive possessive {{lang|pl|sw\u00f3j}}. The polite second-person pronouns have possessives identical to the genitives of the corresponding nouns, although there is a possessive adjective {{lang|pl|pa\u0144ski}} corresponding to {{lang|pl|pan}}.\n\nThe [[demonstrative pronoun]], also used as a demonstrative adjective, is {{lang|pl|ten}} (feminine {{lang|pl|ta}}, neuter {{lang|pl|to}}, masculine personal plural  {{lang|pl|ci}}, other plural {{lang|pl|te}}). The prefix ''tam-'' can be added to emphasize a more distant referent (\"that\" as opposed to \"this\").\n\n[[Interrogative word|Interrogative]] pronouns are {{lang|pl|kto}} (\"who\") and {{lang|pl|co}} (\"what\"); these also provide the pronouns {{lang|pl|kto\u015b/co\u015b}} (\"someone/something\"), {{lang|pl|ktokolwiek/cokolwiek}} (\"anyone/anything\"), {{lang|pl|nikt/nic}} (\"no one/nothing\").\n\nThe usual [[relative pronoun]] is {{lang|pl|kt\u00f3ry}} (declined like an adjective). However, when the antecedent is also a pronoun, the relative pronoun used is {{lang|pl|kto}} or {{lang|pl|co}} (as in {{lang|pl|ten kto}} \"he who\" and {{lang|pl|to co}} \"that which\"). The word {{lang|pl|kt\u00f3ry}} also means \"which\" as an interrogative pronoun and adjective.\n\nThe pronoun and adjective {{lang|pl|wszystek}} means \"all\". It is used most commonly in the plural (''wszyscy'' means \"everyone\"), and in the neuter singular {{lang|pl|(wszystko)}} to mean \"everything\". The pronoun and adjective {{lang|pl|ka\u017cdy}} means \"each, every\", while {{lang|pl|\u017caden}} means \"no, none\".\n\nFor full information on the declension of the above pronouns, see [[Polish morphology#Pronouns|''Pronouns'']] in the article on Polish morphology.\n\nWhen the referent of a pronoun is a person of unspecified sex, the masculine form of the pronoun is generally used. When the referent is a thing or idea that does not correspond to any specific noun, it is treated as neuter.\n\n==Numbers and quantifiers==\nPolish has a complex system of [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and related [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], with special rules for their inflection, for the case of the governed noun, and for verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the resulting noun phrase.\n\nThe basic numerals are 0 {{lang|pl|zero}}, 1 {{lang|pl|jeden}}, 2 {{lang|pl|dwa}}, 3 {{lang|pl|trzy}}, 4 {{lang|pl|cztery}}, 5 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107}}, 6 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107}}, 7 {{lang|pl|siedem}}, 8 {{lang|pl|osiem}}, 9 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107}}, 10 {{lang|pl|dziesi\u0119\u0107}}, 11 {{lang|pl|jedena\u015bcie}}, 12 {{lang|pl|dwana\u015bcie}}, 13 {{lang|pl|trzyna\u015bcie}}, 14 {{lang|pl|czterna\u015bcie}}, 15 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119tna\u015bcie}}, 16 {{lang|pl|szesna\u015bcie}}, 17 {{lang|pl|siedemna\u015bcie}}, 18 {{lang|pl|osiemna\u015bcie}}, 19 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119tna\u015bcie}}, 20 {{lang|pl|dwadzie\u015bcia}}, 30 {{lang|pl|trzydzie\u015bci}}, 40 {{lang|pl|czterdzie\u015bci}}, 50 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 60 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 70 {{lang|pl|siedemdziesi\u0105t}}, 80 {{lang|pl|osiemdziesi\u0105t}}, 90 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 100 {{lang|pl|sto}}, 200 {{lang|pl|dwie\u015bcie}}, 300 {{lang|pl|trzysta}}, 400 {{lang|pl|czterysta}}, 500 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107set}}, 600 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107set}}, 700 {{lang|pl|siedemset}}, 800 {{lang|pl|osiemset}}, 900 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107set}}.\n\nThese numerals are inflected for case, and also to some extent for gender. For details of their inflection, see [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|''Numbers and quantifiers'']] in the article on Polish morphology.\n\nThousand is {{lang|pl|tysi\u0105c}}, treated as a noun (so 2000 is {{lang|pl|dwa tysi\u0105ce}}, etc.). Million is {{lang|pl|milion}}, billion (meaning a thousand million) is {{lang|pl|miliard}}, a million million is {{lang|pl|bilion}}, a thousand million million is {{lang|pl|biliard}}, and so on (''i.e.'', the [[long scale]] is used).\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly as in English (for example, 91,234 is {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t jeden tysi\u0119cy dwie\u015bcie trzydzie\u015bci cztery}}).\n\nWhen a numeral modifies a noun, the numeral takes the expected case, but the noun may not; also the gender and number of the resulting [[noun phrase]] may not correspond to that of the noun. The following rules apply:\n*The numeral {{lang|pl|jeden}} (1) behaves as an ordinary adjective, and no special rules apply. It can even be used in the plural, for example to mean \"some\" (and not others), or to mean \"one\" with [[pluralia tantum]], e.g. {{lang|pl|jedne drzwi}} \"one door\" (''drzwi'' has no singular).\n*After the numerals {{lang|pl|dwa}}, {{lang|pl|trzy}}, {{lang|pl|cztery}} (2, 3, 4), and compound numbers ending with them (22, 23, 24, etc. but not 12, 13, or 14, which take ''-na\u015bcie'' as a suffix and are thus not compound numbers at all), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, and the resulting noun phrase is plural (e.g. {{lang|pl|4 koty sta\u0142y}}, \"4 cats stood\").\n*With other numbers (5, 6, etc., 20, 21, 25, etc.), if the numeral is nominative or accusative, the noun takes the genitive plural form, and the resulting noun phrase is neuter singular (e.g. {{lang|pl|5 kot\u00f3w sta\u0142o}}, \"5 cats stood\").\n*With the masculine personal plural forms of numbers (as given in the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section), the rule given above \u2013 that if the numeral is nominative or accusative the noun is genitive plural, and the resulting phrase is neuter singular \u2013 applies to ''all'' numbers other than 1 (as in {{lang|pl|trzech m\u0119\u017cczyzn przysz\u0142o}}, \"three men came\"), unless the alternative nominative forms {{lang|pl|dwaj}}, {{lang|pl|trzej}}, {{lang|pl|czterej}} (for 2, 3, 4) are used (these take nominative nouns and form a masculine plural phrase).\n*If the numeral is in the genitive, dative, instrumental or locative, the noun takes the same case as the numeral (except sometimes in the case of numbers that end with the nouns for 1000 and higher quantities, which often take a genitive noun regardless).\n\nPolish also has a series of numerals called '''collective numerals''' {{lang|pl|(liczebniki zbiorowe)}}, namely {{lang|pl|dwoje}} (for 2), {{lang|pl|troje}} (for 3), {{lang|pl|czworo}} (for 4), {{lang|pl|pi\u0119cioro}} (for 5), and so on. These are used with the following types of nouns:\n*Personal and animate neuter nouns (e.g. {{lang|pl|dziecko}} (\"child\"), {{lang|pl|koci\u0119}} (\"kitten\"))\n*Non-masculine personal [[plurale tantum|pluralia tantum]], i.e. nouns that do not exist in the grammatical singular (such as {{lang|pl|drzwi}} (\"door(s)\"), {{lang|pl|urodziny}} (\"birthday(s)\"))\n*Plural nouns referring to a group containing both sexes (for example, {{lang|pl|czworo student\u00f3w}} refers to a group of four students of mixed sex) \nFor the declension of collective numerals by case, see the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section. They all follow the rule that when the numeral is nominative or accusative, the noun becomes genitive plural, and the resulting noun phrase is neuter singular. In this case the genitive noun is also used after the instrumental of the numeral.\n\nCertain [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] behave similarly to numerals. These include {{lang|pl|kilka}} (\"several\"), {{lang|pl|par\u0119}} (\"a few\") and {{lang|pl|wiele}} (\"much, many\"), which behave like numbers above 5 in terms of the noun cases and verb forms taken. There are also indefinite numerals {{lang|pl|kilkana\u015bcie, kilkadziesi\u0105t, kilkaset}} (and similar forms with ''par\u0119-''), meaning \"several-teen\", several tens and several hundred.\n\nQuantifiers that always take the genitive of nouns include {{lang|pl|du\u017co}} (\"much, many\"), {{lang|pl|ma\u0142o}} (\"few, little\"), {{lang|pl|wi\u0119cej}} (\"more\"), {{lang|pl|mniej}} (\"less\") (also {{lang|pl|najwi\u0119cej/najmniej}} \"most/least\"), {{lang|pl|troch\u0119}} (\"a bit\"), {{lang|pl|pe\u0142no}} (\"plenty, a lot\").\n\nThe words {{lang|pl|oba}} and {{lang|pl|obydwa}} (meaning \"both\"), and their derived forms behave like {{lang|pl|dwa}}. However the collective forms {{lang|pl|oboje, obydwoje}} (in the nominative/vocative), when referring to a married couple or similar, take the nominative form of the noun rather than the genitive, and form a masculine plural noun phrase (''oboje rodzice byli'', \"both parents were\", cf. {{lang|pl|dwoje rodzic\u00f3w by\u0142o}}).\n\nFor the declension of all the above quantifiers, see the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section.\n\n==Verbs ==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Verbs}}\n\nPolish [[verb]]s have the grammatical category of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Each verb is either ''imperfective'', meaning that it denotes continuous or habitual events, or ''perfective'', meaning that it denotes single completed events (in particular, perfective verbs have no present tense). Verbs often occur in imperfective and perfective pairs \u2013 for example, {{lang|pl|je\u015b\u0107}} and {{lang|pl|zje\u015b\u0107}} both mean \"to eat\", but the first has imperfective aspect, the second perfective.\n\nImperfective verbs have three [[verb tense|tenses]]: [[present tense|present]], [[past tense|past]] and [[future tense|future]], the last being a compound tense (except in the case of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} \"to be\"). Perfective verbs have a past tense and a simple future tense, the latter formed on the same pattern as the present tense of imperfective verbs. Both types also have [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]] forms. The dictionary form of a verb is the [[infinitive]], which usually ends with ''-\u0107'' (occasionally with ''-c''). The present-day past tense derives from the old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] \"perfect\" tense; several other old tenses (the [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[past perfect]]) have been dropped.\n\nThe present tense of imperfective verbs (and future tense of perfective verbs) has six forms, for the three [[grammatical person|persons]] and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]. For example, the present tense of {{lang|pl|je\u015b\u0107}} is {{lang|pl|jem}}, {{lang|pl|jesz}}, {{lang|pl|je}}; {{lang|pl|jemy}}, {{lang|pl|jecie}}, {{lang|pl|jedz\u0105}} (meaning \"(I) eat\" etc. \u2013 subject pronouns may be dropped), while the future tense of the corresponding perfective verb {{lang|pl|zje\u015b\u0107}} is {{lang|pl|zjem}}, {{lang|pl|zjesz}} etc. (meaning \"(I) shall eat\" etc.)\n\nThe verb {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} has the irregular present tense {{lang|pl|jestem, jeste\u015b, jest, jeste\u015bmy, jeste\u015bcie, s\u0105}}. It also has a simple future tense (see below).\n\nThe past tense agrees with the subject in gender as well as person and number. The basic past stem is in ''-\u0142''; to this are added endings for gender and number, and then personal endings are further added for the first and second person forms. Thus, on the example of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, the past tense forms are {{lang|pl|by\u0142em/by\u0142am}} (\"I was\", masc/fem.), {{lang|pl|by\u0142e\u015b/by\u0142a\u015b}}, {{lang|pl|by\u0142/by\u0142a/by\u0142o}}; {{lang|pl|byli\u015bmy/by\u0142y\u015bmy}} (\"we were\" all gender mixes (except:)/a group of all fem.), {{lang|pl|byli\u015bcie/by\u0142y\u015bcie}}, {{lang|pl|byli/by\u0142y}}.\n\nThe [[conditional tense|conditional]] is formed from the past tense plus {{lang|pl|by}}, the personal endings (if any) coming after the {{lang|pl|by}}. For example: {{lang|pl|by\u0142bym/by\u0142abym}} (\"I would be\", masc/fem.), {{lang|pl|by\u0142by\u015b/by\u0142aby\u015b}}, {{lang|pl|by\u0142by/by\u0142aby/by\u0142oby}}; {{lang|pl|byliby\u015bmy/by\u0142yby\u015bmy}}, {{lang|pl|byliby\u015bcie/by\u0142yby\u015bcie}}, {{lang|pl|byliby/by\u0142yby}}.\n\nThe personal past tense suffixes, which are reduced forms of the present tense of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, are [[clitic]]s and can be detached from the verb to attach to another accented word earlier in the sentence, such as a question word (as in {{lang|pl|kogo\u015bcie zobaczyli}} as an alternative to {{lang|pl|kogo zobaczyli\u015bcie}} \"whom did you see\"), or (mostly in informal speech) an emphatic particle {{lang|pl|\u017ce}} (''co \u017ce\u015bcie zrobili?'' \"what did you do\"). The same applies to the conditional endings (''kiedy by\u015bcie przyszli'' as an alternative to {{lang|pl|kiedy przyszliby\u015bcie}} \"when would you come\").\n\nIf {{lang|pl|by}} introduces the clause, either alone or forming one of the conjunctions {{lang|pl|\u017ceby}}, {{lang|pl|i\u017cby}}, {{lang|pl|a\u017ceby}}, {{lang|pl|aby}}, {{lang|pl|coby}}, it forms the [[Subjunctive mood#Polish|subjunctive mood]]<ref name = \"migdalski\">Migdalski K. ''The Syntax of Compound Tenses in Slavic'', Utrecht 2006</ref>\nand is not to be confused with the conditional clitic {{lang|pl|by}}.<ref name=\"tomaszewicz\">Anastasia Smirnova, Vedrana Mihali\u010dek, Lauren Ressue, ''Formal Studies in Slavic Linguistics'', Cambridge Scholar Publishing, Newcastle upon Type, Wielka Brytania, 2010: Barbara Tomaszewicz, Subjunctive Mood in Polish and the Clause Typing Hypothesis</ref> For example, \"He wants me to sing\" might be {{lang|pl|chce, aby(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}}, {{lang|pl|chce, \u017ceby(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}} or {{lang|pl|chce, by(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}}. Such clauses may express \"in order that\", or be used with verbs meaning \"want\", \"expect\", etc.\n\nThe future tense of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"be\") follows the pattern of a typical present tense: {{lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119, b\u0119dziesz, b\u0119dzie, b\u0119dziemy, b\u0119dziecie, b\u0119d\u0105}}.\nThe future tense of other imperfective verbs is formed using the future of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} together with the infinitive, or the past form (inflected for gender and number, but without any personal suffixes), of the verb in question. For example, the future of {{lang|pl|robi\u0107}} (\"do, make\") has such forms as {{lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119 robi\u0107/robi\u0142/robi\u0142a}}, {{lang|pl|b\u0119dziecie robi\u0107/robili/robi\u0142y}}. The choice between infinitive and past form is usually a free one, but with modals governing another infinitive, the past form is used: {{lang|pl|b\u0119dzie musia\u0142 odej\u015b\u0107}} (not {{lang|pl|b\u0119dzie musie\u0107...}}) \"he will have to leave\".\n\nThe second personal singular [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed from the present tense by dropping the ending (e.g. {{lang|pl|bra\u0107}}: 2/3S present {{lang|pl|bierze(sz)}}, imperative {{lang|pl|bierz}}), sometimes adding ''-ij'' or ''-aj''. Add ''-my'' and ''-cie'' for the 1P and 2P forms. To make third-person imperative sentences (including with the polite second-person pronouns {{lang|pl|pan}} etc.) the particle {{lang|pl|niech}} is used at the start of the sentence (or at least before the verb), with the verb in the future tense (if {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} or perfective) or present tense (otherwise). There is a tendency to prefer imperfective verbs in imperative sentences for politeness; negative imperatives quite rarely use perfectives.\n\nOther forms of the verb are:\n*present [[adverbial participle]] (imperfective verbs only), also called [[gerund]], as {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewaj\u0105c}} (meaning \"(when) singing\", \"by singing\", etc.)\n*present [[adjectival participle]] (imperfective verbs only), formed from the gerund by adding adjectival endings, as {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewaj\u0105cy}} etc., meaning \"singing\" (as an [[attributive adjective]]), although such participles can be used to form extended adjectival phrases, which (usually unlike in English) can precede the noun. \n*[[passive participle]] (all transitive verbs), in ''-ny'' or ''-ty'' (conjugated as an adjective). This often corresponds to the English [[past participle]], both in fully adjectival use and in [[passive voice]].\n*subjectless past tense, formed as the past participle but with the ending ''-o'' (e.g. {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewano}} \"there was sung\").\n*past [[active participle]] (perfective verbs only), like {{lang|pl|zabiwszy}} \"having killed\" (from {{lang|pl|zabi\u0107}} \"kill\"); this form is invariant.\n*[[verbal noun]], formed from the past participle with the ending ''-ie'', e.g. {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewanie}}. This is a neuter noun.\n\n==Prepositions==\nPolish uses [[preposition]]s, which form phrases by preceding a noun or noun phrase. Different prepositions take different cases (all cases are possible except nominative and vocative); some prepositions can take different cases depending on meaning.\n\nThe prepositions ''z'' and ''w'' are pronounced together with the following word, obeying the usual rules for consonant cluster voicing (so {{lang|pl|z tob\u0105}} \"with you\" is pronounced {{lang|pl|stob\u0105}}). Before some consonant clusters, particularly clusters beginning with a sibilant (in the case of ''z'') or with ''f/w'' (in the case of ''w''), the prepositions take the form {{lang|pl|ze}} and {{lang|pl|we}} (e.g. {{lang|pl|we Wroc\u0142awiu}} \"in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]\"). These forms are also used before the first-person singular pronouns in ''mn-''; several other prepositions also have longer forms before these pronouns (''przeze mnie, pode mn\u0105'' etc.), and these phrases are pronounced as single words, with the stress on the penultimate syllable (the ''-e'').\n\nCommon prepositions include:\n*''na'', with the locative with basic meaning \"on\", and with the accusative with basic meaning \"onto\" (also metaphorical meanings)\n*''w'', with the locative with basic meaning \"in\", and with the accusative with basic meaning \"into\" (also metaphorical meanings)\n*''z'', with the instrumental [[Comitative case|comitative]] meaning \"with\" (''in accompaniment of''); with the genitive meaning \"from, out of\"\n*''do/od'', with genitive, meaning \"to, into/from\"\n*''dla'', with genitive, meaning \"for\"\n*''o'', with locative meaning \"about\", also with the accusative in some constructions\n*''przed/za/nad/pod'' with instrumental meaning \"before, in front of/behind/over/under\", also with the accusative in some meanings (and genitive in the case of {{lang|pl|za}}); there are also compound prepositions {{lang|pl|sprzed/zza/znad/spod}} (\"from in front of\" etc.) taking the genitive\n*''przez'' with the accusative, meaning \"through\" etc.\n*''przeciw(ko)'' with dative, meaning \"against\" (but {{lang|pl|naprzeciw(ko)}} \"opposite\" takes genitive)\n*''po'', with locative meaning \"after\", also with the accusative in some meanings\n*''przy'', with locative, meaning \"next to\" etc.\n*''bez'', with genitive, meaning \"without\"\n\n==Conjunctions==\nCommon Polish [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s include {{lang|pl|i}} (and less commonly {{lang|pl|oraz}}) meaning \"and\", {{lang|pl|lub}} and {{lang|pl|albo}} meaning \"or\", {{lang|pl|ale}} meaning \"but\", {{lang|pl|lecz}} meaning \"but\" chiefly in phrases of the type \"not ''x'' but ''y''\", {{lang|pl|\u017ce}} (or more formally sometimes {{lang|pl|i\u017c}}) meaning \"that\", {{lang|pl|je\u015bli}} meaning \"if\" (also {{lang|pl|gdyby}}, where {{lang|pl|by}} is the conditional particle), {{lang|pl|czy}} meaning \"whether\" (also an interrogative particle), {{lang|pl|kiedy}} or {{lang|pl|gdy}} meaning \"when\", {{lang|pl|wi\u0119c}}, {{lang|pl|dlatego}} and {{lang|pl|zatem}} meaning \"so, therefore\", {{lang|pl|poniewa\u017c}} meaning \"because\", {{lang|pl|cho\u0107/chocia\u017c}} meaning \"although\", and {{lang|pl|aby/\u017ceby}} meaning \"in order to/that\" (can be followed by an infinitive phrase, or by a sentence in the past tense; in the latter case the {{lang|pl|by}} of the conjunction is in fact the conditional particle and takes personal endings as appropriate).\n\nIn written Polish, [[subordinate clause]]s are normally set off with commas. Commas are not normally used before conjunctions meaning \"and\" or \"or\".\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Word order===\nBasic word order in Polish is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]; however, as it is a [[synthetic language]], it is possible to move words around in the sentence. For example, {{lang|pl|Alicja ma kota}} (\"Alice has a cat\") is the standard order, but it is also possible to use other orders to give a different emphasis (for example, {{lang|pl|Alicja kota '''ma'''}}, with emphasis on {{lang|pl|ma}} (\"has\"), used as a response to an assertion of the opposite); general word order controls [[topic and comment|theme and rheme]] [[information structure]] with theme coming first.\n\nCertain words, however, behave as [[clitic]]s: they rarely or never begin a clause, but are used after another stressed word, and tend to appear early in the clause. Examples of these are the weak pronouns {{lang|pl|mi}}, {{lang|pl|go}} etc., the reflexive pronoun {{lang|pl|si\u0119}}, and the personal past tense endings and conditional endings described under [[#Verbs|Verbs]] above.\n  \nPolish is a [[pro-drop language]]; subject pronouns are frequently dropped. For example: {{lang|pl|ma kota}} (literally \"has a cat\") may mean \"he/she/it has a cat\". It is also possible to drop the object or even sometimes verb, if they are obvious from context. For example, {{lang|pl|ma}} (\"has\") or {{lang|pl|nie ma}} (\"has not\") may be used as an affirmative or negative answer to a question \"does... have...?\".\n\nNote the interrogative particle {{lang|pl|czy}}, which is used to start a [[yes-no question|yes/no question]], much like the French \"est-ce que\". The particle is not obligatory, and sometimes rising intonation is the only signal of the interrogative character of the sentence.\n\nNegation is achieved by placing {{lang|pl|nie}} directly before the verb, or other word or phrase being negated (in some cases ''nie-'' is prefixed to the negated word, equivalent to English ''un-'' or ''non-''). If a sentence contains a negative element such as {{lang|pl|nigdy}} (\"never\"), {{lang|pl|nikt}} (\"no-one\"), etc., the verb is negated with {{lang|pl|nie}} as well (and several such negative elements can be combined, as in {{lang|pl|nikt nigdy nie robi nic}}, \"no-one ever does anything\", literally \"no-one never doesn't do nothing\").  \n \nThe equivalent of the English \"there is\" etc. is the appropriate part of the verb {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"to be\"), e.g. {{lang|pl|jest...}} (\"there is...\"), {{lang|pl|s\u0105...}} (\"there are...\"), {{lang|pl|by\u0142(a/o)...}} (\"there was...\"), etc., with a noun phrase in the nominative. The negative form is always singular (and neuter where applicable), takes the noun phrase in the genitive, and uses {{lang|pl|ma}} rather than {{lang|pl|jest}} in the present tense: {{lang|pl|nie ma kota}} (\"there isn't a cat\", also \"the cat isn't there\"), {{lang|pl|nie by\u0142o kota}} etc. (as usual, the word order is not fixed).\n\nWhere two concepts are equated, the particle {{lang|pl|to}} is often used instead of a part of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, with the nouns expressing the concepts in the nominative case (although verb infinitives can also be used here: {{lang|pl|istnie\u0107 to cierpie\u0107}} \"to exist is to suffer\"). There are also sentences where {{lang|pl|to}} appears to be the subject of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, but the complement is in the nominative and the verb agrees with the complement: {{lang|pl|to jest...}} (\"this/it is...\"), {{lang|pl|to s\u0105...}}, {{lang|pl|to by\u0142(a/o)...}}, etc.\n\n===Subjectless sentences===\nThere are various types of sentence in Polish that do not have subjects:\n*Sentences where the subject pronoun is dropped (see above), but is still understood.\n*Sentences formed from certain verbs that can appear (in third-person singular neuter form) without a subject, corresponding to an English impersonal \"it\", as in {{lang|pl|pada\u0142o}} (\"it was raining/snowing\").\n*Sentences with verbs in second-person singular masculine (or sometimes third-person masculine personal plural) form, but no subject, corresponding to English \"you\" with general meaning, as in {{lang|pl|robisz to}} (\"you do this\", ''i.e.'', \"one does this\").\n*Sentences with the reflexive particle {{lang|pl|si\u0119}} but no subject, the verb being third-person singular, as in {{lang|pl|tutaj pije si\u0119 w\u00f3dk\u0119}} (\"here one drinks vodka/vodka is drunk\") \u2013 note that the logical direct object is in the accusative, not the nominative as in analogous constructions in other languages such as Russian.\n*Sentences with the subjectless past tense form of the verb (see [[#Verbs|Verbs]] above).\n*Sentences with impersonal particles such as {{lang|pl|mo\u017cna}} (\"it is possible\"), {{lang|pl|wolno}} (\"it is permitted\").\n\n===Noun syntax===\nThe use of the cases of nouns is as follows:\n# The nominative (the [[dictionary form]] of a noun) is used for sentence [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and for certain complements (as in sentences of the form ''X to Y'' \"X is Y\", ''to jest Y'' \"this is Y\").\n# The genitive is used for possessor and similar (equivalent to English \"of X\" or \"X's\"), for the [[direct object]] of [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] verbs, as the object of some verbs and prepositions, as an object with [[partitive]] meaning and in some fixed expressions, and for nouns governed by certain numbers and expressions of quantity (see [[#Numbers and quantifiers|Numbers and quantifiers]] above).\n# The dative is used for [[indirect object]]s, to denote the party for whom something is done or the \"party concerned\" in certain expressions (such as {{lang|pl|wolno mu}}, \"he is allowed\", lit. \"it is allowed to him\"), and as the object of some verbs and prepositions.\n# The accusative is used for the direct object of verbs that are not negated, as the object of some prepositions, and in some time expressions.\n# The instrumental is used for the means (instrument) by which something is done, for example {{lang|pl|poci\u0105giem}} (instrumental of {{lang|pl|poci\u0105g}} \"train\") means \"by train\". It is also used for a noun complement of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"to be\"), and for the complements and objects of some other verbs and some prepositions.  \n# The locative is used only as the object of certain prepositions (particularly {{lang|pl|w}} \"in\" and {{lang|pl|na}} \"on\", when they have static meaning).\n# The vocative is used to indicate who or what is being addressed. However, with personal names, in colloquial speech, the nominative is usually used instead.\n\nLike most [[Slavic languages]], with the exception of [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], Polish uses no definite or indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]]s. A noun such as {{lang|pl|kot}} may mean either \"the cat\" or \"a cat\".\n\nPolish does not regularly place nouns together to form [[compound noun]] expressions. Equivalents to such expressions are formed using noun-derived adjectives (as in {{lang|pl|sok pomara\u0144czowy}}, \"orange juice\", where {{lang|pl|pomara\u0144czowy}} is an adjective derived from {{lang|pl|pomara\u0144cza}} \"orange\"), or using prepositional phrases or (equivalently) a noun in the genitive or other case.\n\nA group of nouns connected by a word for \"and\" is treated as plural. It is masculine personal plural if it contains any male person (in fact, if it contains any person and any masculine noun).\n\n===Adjective syntax===\nAdjectives generally precede the noun they modify, although in some fixed expressions and official names and phrases they can follow the noun (as in {{lang|pl|j\u0119zyk polski}} \"Polish language\"; also {{lang|pl|dzie\u0144 dobry}} \"good day, hello\").\n\n[[Attributive adjective]]s agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. [[Predicate adjective]]s agree with the relevant noun in gender and number, and are in the nominative case, unless the subject is unspecified (as in some infinitive phrases), in which case the adjective takes the (masculine/neuter) instrumental form (for example, {{lang|pl|by\u0107 m\u0105drym}}, \"to be wise\", although the nominative is used if the logical subject is specified){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. The instrumental is also used for adjectival complements of some other verbs, as in {{lang|pl|czyni\u0107 go m\u0105drym}} (\"make him wise\").\n\nWith pronouns such as {{lang|pl|co\u015b}} (\"something\") (but not {{lang|pl|kto\u015b}} \"someone\"), if the pronoun is nominative or accusative, the adjective takes the genitive form (''co\u015b dobrego'' \"something good\").\n\nAdjectives are sometimes used as nouns; for example, {{lang|pl|zielony}} (\"green\") may mean \"the/a green one\" etc.\n\nCompound adjectives can be formed by replacing the ending of the first adjective with ''-o'', as in {{lang|pl|formalno-prawny}} (\"formal (and) legal\").\n\n{{InterWiki|code=pl}}\n{{Wikibooks|Polish}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|code=pl}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|last=Soerensen|first=Asmus|title=Polnische Grammatik mit grammatisch-alphabetischem Verbalverzeichnis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59BtQwAACAAJ|year=1900|publisher=E.

There are no [[article (grammar)|articles]], and there is frequent [[Pro-drop language|dropping of subject pronouns]]. Distinctive features include the different treatment of [[masculine personal]] nouns in the plural, and the complex grammar of [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]].\n\n==Regular morphological alternation==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Regular alternation}}\nCertain regular or common [[alternation (linguistics)|alternation]]s apply across the Polish inflectional system, affecting the morphology of nouns, adjectives, verbs, and other parts of speech. Some of these result from the [[Polish phonology#Vowel distribution|restricted distribution]] of the vowels ''i'' and ''y'', and from the [[Polish phonology#Voicing and devoicing|voicing rules]] for consonants in clusters and at the end of words. Otherwise, the main changes are the following:\n*vowel alternations, arising from the [[Polish phonology#Historical development|historical development]] of certain vowels, which cause vowel changes in some words depending on whether the syllable is closed or open, or whether the following consonant is soft or hard;\n*consonant changes caused by certain endings (such as the ''-ie'' of the [[locative]] case, and the ''-i'' of the masculine personal plural), which historically entailed [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]] of the preceding consonant, and now produce a number of different changes depending on which consonant is involved.\n\n==Nouns==\n<span id=\"Nouns and adjectives\"></span><!-- This section is linked from [[Grammatical gender]] -->\n{{main|Polish morphology#Nouns}}\nPolish retains the Old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] system of [[grammatical case|case]]s for [[noun]]s, [[pronoun]]s, and [[adjective]]s. There are seven cases: [[Nominative case|nominative]] {{lang|pl|(mianownik)}}, [[Genitive case|genitive]] {{lang|pl|(dope\u0142niacz)}}, [[Dative case|dative]] {{lang|pl|(celownik)}}, [[Accusative case|accusative]] {{lang|pl|(biernik)}}, [[Instrumental case|instrumental]] {{lang|pl|(narz\u0119dnik)}}, [[Locative case|locative]] {{lang|pl|(miejscownik)}}, and [[Vocative case|vocative]] {{lang|pl|(wo\u0142acz)}}.\n\n=== Number ===\nPolish has two [[Grammatical number|number classes]]: singular and plural.\n\nIt used to also have the [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]] number, but it vanished around the 15th century. It survived only in a few [[relicts]]:\n\n* body parts that naturally come in pairs have synchronically irregular plural and other forms\n** ''oko'' (\"eye\") - pl. ''oczy'', genitive plural ''oczu'', instrumental plural regular ''oczami'' or irregular ''oczyma''; but not in the sense of \"drop of fat on a liquid\", which is declined regularly\n** ''r\u0119ka'' (\"hand, arm\") - pl. ''r\u0119ce'', locative singular regular ''r\u0119ce'' or irregular ''r\u0119ku'', instrumental plural regular ''r\u0119kami'' or irregular ''r\u0119koma''\n** ''ucho'' (\"ear\") - pl. ''uszy,'' genitive plural ''uszu'', instrumental plural regular ''uszami'' or irregular ''uszyma''; but not in the sense of \"a handle (of a jug or a kettle, etc.)\", which is declined regularly\n* certain proverbs, e.g. ''M\u0105drej g\u0142owie do\u015b\u0107 dwie s\u0142owie'' (lit. \"two words are enough for a wise head\"), with dual ''dwie s\u0142owie'' (modern ''dwa s\u0142owa'')\n\n=== Gender ===\nThere are three main [[Grammatical gender|gender]]s (''rodzaje''): masculine (''m\u0119ski''), feminine (''\u017ce\u0144ski'') and neuter (''nijaki''). Masculine nouns are further divided into personal (''m\u0119skoosobowy''), animate (''m\u0119sko\u017cywotny''), and inanimate (''m\u0119skorzeczowy'') categories. Personal and animate nouns are distinguished from inanimate nouns in the accusative singular; for the latter the accusative is identical to the nominative. In the plural, the masculine personal nouns are distinguished from all others, which collapse into one non-masculine personal gender (''niem\u0119skoosobowy'').\n\nThe table below presents examples of how a determiner ''ten/ta/to'' (\"that\") agrees with nouns of different genders in the nominative and the accusative, both singular and plural.

if an acronym is native, its gender may also be equal to the gender of the noun in the full version of the acronym\n\nThe distinction between personal, animate and inanimate nouns is largely semantic, although not always. Example of grammatically animate nouns are:\n\n* names of consumer goods and brands, e.g. ''mercedes'' (\"Mercedes\"), ''Nikon'' (as in ''Mam Nikona'' - \"I have a Nikon\"), ''papieros'' (\"cigarette\")\n*names of currency, e.g. ''dolar'' (\"dollar\"), ''funt'' (\"pound\")\n*names of dances, e.g. ''polonez'' (\"[[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]\")\n*names of fruit, e.g. ''ananas'' (\"pineapple\"), ''banan'' (\"banana\")\n*names of viruses, bacteria, fungi, e.g. ''borowik'' (\"[[Boletus edulis|cep]]\"), ''grzyb'' (\"mushroom\"), ''wirus'' (\"virus\")\n*loanwords relating to information technologies, e.g. ''blog, komputer'' (\"computer\")\n*nouns relating to human or human-like referents which are not necessarily semantically animate, e.g. ''nieboszczyk, trup'' (both of which mean \"corpse\"), ''robot, wisielec'' (\"the body of a hanged person\")\n\nIt's common for personal masculine nouns to change gender to inanimate to create semantic neologisms, for example ''edytor'' (\"editor\", pl. ''ci edytorzy'') and ''edytor (tekstu)'' (\"word processor software\", pl. ''te edytory'').\n\nThere are few nouns that change meaning by changing gender outside of the masculine. They are:\n\n* ''biel'': masculine - \"[[Sapwood (wood)|sapwood]]\", feminine - \"the colour white, whiteness\"\n* ''Niemcy:'' plural masculine personal - \"Germans\", plural non-masculine personal - \"Germany\"\n* ''twardziel'': masculine - \"tough guy\", feminine - \"[[Hardwood|heartwood]]\"\n* ''w\u0142\u00f3cz\u0119ga'': masculine - \"tramp\", feminine - \"roaming\"\n* ''\u017co\u0142\u0105d\u017a'': masculine - \"acorn\", feminine - \"glans penis\"\n\n=== Declension ===\nTypical declension patterns are as follows:\n\n* {{lang|pl|klub}} (\"club\"; an inanimate masculine noun) \u2013 N/A {{lang|pl|klub}}, G {{lang|pl|klubu}}, D {{lang|pl|klubowi}}, I {{lang|pl|klubem}}, L/V {{lang|pl|klubie}}.

This includes all personal and animate masculines (ending in a consonant). Also masculine animate nouns have accusative singular equal to the genitive singular (in ''-a''). Masculine personal nouns also have accusative plural equal to genitive plural, and often have nominative plural in ''-i''.\n\n==Adjectives==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Adjectives}}\nAdjectives agree with the noun they modify in terms of gender, number and case.

Comparatives of adverbs are formed (where they exist) with the ending ''-iej''. Superlatives have the prefix ''naj-'' as for adjectives.\n\n==Pronouns==\nThe [[personal pronoun]]s of Polish (nominative forms) are ''ja'' (\"I\"), ''ty'' (\"you\", singular, [[T\u2013V distinction|familiar]]), {{lang|pl|on}} (\"he\", or \"it\" corresponding to masculine nouns), {{lang|pl|ona}} (\"she\", or \"it\" corresponding to feminine nouns), {{lang|pl|ono}} (\"it\" corresponding to neuter nouns), {{lang|pl|my}} (\"we\"), {{lang|pl|wy}} (\"you\", plural, familiar), {{lang|pl|oni}} (\"they\", corresponding to a masculine personal group \u2013 see [[#Noun syntax|Noun syntax]] above), {{lang|pl|one}} (\"they\" in other cases; group where are only girls/women).\n\nThe [[T\u2013V distinction|polite second-person]] pronouns are the same as the nouns {{lang|pl|pan}} (\"gentleman, Mr\"), {{lang|pl|pani}} (\"lady, Mrs\") and their plurals {{lang|pl|panowie, panie}}. The mixed-sex plural is {{lang|pl|pa\u0144stwo}}.  All second-person pronouns are often capitalized for politeness, in letters etc.\n\nFor the full declension of these pronouns, see [[Polish morphology#Pronouns|''Pronouns'']] in the article on Polish morphology. Subject pronouns can be [[pro-drop|dropped]] if the meaning is clear and they are not emphasized. Sometimes there are alternative forms available for a given personal pronoun in a given case:\n*there may be a form beginning with ''n-'', used after prepositions (for example, the accusative of {{lang|pl|ona}} is {{lang|pl|ni\u0105}} after a preposition rather than {{lang|pl|j\u0105}});  \n*there may be a [[clitic]] form, used when unstressed, but not after prepositions (such as {{lang|pl|mi}} as the dative of {{lang|pl|ja}}, an alternative to {{lang|pl|mnie}}).\n\nThe [[reflexive pronoun]] for all persons and numbers is {{lang|pl|si\u0119}}.\n\nThe [[possessive adjective]]s (also used as possessive pronouns) derived from the personal pronouns are {{lang|pl|m\u00f3j}}, {{lang|pl|tw\u00f3j}}, {{lang|pl|jego}} (m., n.)/''jej'' (f.); {{lang|pl|nasz}}, {{lang|pl|wasz}}, {{lang|pl|ich}}. There is also a reflexive possessive {{lang|pl|sw\u00f3j}}. The polite second-person pronouns have possessives identical to the genitives of the corresponding nouns, although there is a possessive adjective {{lang|pl|pa\u0144ski}} corresponding to {{lang|pl|pan}}.\n\nThe [[demonstrative pronoun]], also used as a demonstrative adjective, is {{lang|pl|ten}} (feminine {{lang|pl|ta}}, neuter {{lang|pl|to}}, masculine personal plural  {{lang|pl|ci}}, other plural {{lang|pl|te}}). The prefix ''tam-'' can be added to emphasize a more distant referent (\"that\" as opposed to \"this\").\n\n[[Interrogative word|Interrogative]] pronouns are {{lang|pl|kto}} (\"who\") and {{lang|pl|co}} (\"what\"); these also provide the pronouns {{lang|pl|kto\u015b/co\u015b}} (\"someone/something\"), {{lang|pl|ktokolwiek/cokolwiek}} (\"anyone/anything\"), {{lang|pl|nikt/nic}} (\"no one/nothing\").\n\nThe usual [[relative pronoun]] is {{lang|pl|kt\u00f3ry}} (declined like an adjective). However, when the antecedent is also a pronoun, the relative pronoun used is {{lang|pl|kto}} or {{lang|pl|co}} (as in {{lang|pl|ten kto}} \"he who\" and {{lang|pl|to co}} \"that which\"). The word {{lang|pl|kt\u00f3ry}} also means \"which\" as an interrogative pronoun and adjective.\n\nThe pronoun and adjective {{lang|pl|wszystek}} means \"all\". It is used most commonly in the plural (''wszyscy'' means \"everyone\"), and in the neuter singular {{lang|pl|(wszystko)}} to mean \"everything\". The pronoun and adjective {{lang|pl|ka\u017cdy}} means \"each, every\", while {{lang|pl|\u017caden}} means \"no, none\".\n\nFor full information on the declension of the above pronouns, see [[Polish morphology#Pronouns|''Pronouns'']] in the article on Polish morphology.\n\nWhen the referent of a pronoun is a person of unspecified sex, the masculine form of the pronoun is generally used. When the referent is a thing or idea that does not correspond to any specific noun, it is treated as neuter.\n\n==Numbers and quantifiers==\nPolish has a complex system of [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s and related [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]], with special rules for their inflection, for the case of the governed noun, and for verb [[agreement (linguistics)|agreement]] with the resulting noun phrase.\n\nThe basic numerals are 0 {{lang|pl|zero}}, 1 {{lang|pl|jeden}}, 2 {{lang|pl|dwa}}, 3 {{lang|pl|trzy}}, 4 {{lang|pl|cztery}}, 5 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107}}, 6 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107}}, 7 {{lang|pl|siedem}}, 8 {{lang|pl|osiem}}, 9 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107}}, 10 {{lang|pl|dziesi\u0119\u0107}}, 11 {{lang|pl|jedena\u015bcie}}, 12 {{lang|pl|dwana\u015bcie}}, 13 {{lang|pl|trzyna\u015bcie}}, 14 {{lang|pl|czterna\u015bcie}}, 15 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119tna\u015bcie}}, 16 {{lang|pl|szesna\u015bcie}}, 17 {{lang|pl|siedemna\u015bcie}}, 18 {{lang|pl|osiemna\u015bcie}}, 19 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119tna\u015bcie}}, 20 {{lang|pl|dwadzie\u015bcia}}, 30 {{lang|pl|trzydzie\u015bci}}, 40 {{lang|pl|czterdzie\u015bci}}, 50 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 60 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 70 {{lang|pl|siedemdziesi\u0105t}}, 80 {{lang|pl|osiemdziesi\u0105t}}, 90 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t}}, 100 {{lang|pl|sto}}, 200 {{lang|pl|dwie\u015bcie}}, 300 {{lang|pl|trzysta}}, 400 {{lang|pl|czterysta}}, 500 {{lang|pl|pi\u0119\u0107set}}, 600 {{lang|pl|sze\u015b\u0107set}}, 700 {{lang|pl|siedemset}}, 800 {{lang|pl|osiemset}}, 900 {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107set}}.\n\nThese numerals are inflected for case, and also to some extent for gender. For details of their inflection, see [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|''Numbers and quantifiers'']] in the article on Polish morphology.\n\nThousand is {{lang|pl|tysi\u0105c}}, treated as a noun (so 2000 is {{lang|pl|dwa tysi\u0105ce}}, etc.). Million is {{lang|pl|milion}}, billion (meaning a thousand million) is {{lang|pl|miliard}}, a million million is {{lang|pl|bilion}}, a thousand million million is {{lang|pl|biliard}}, and so on (''i.e.'', the [[long scale]] is used).\n\nCompound numbers are constructed similarly as in English (for example, 91,234 is {{lang|pl|dziewi\u0119\u0107dziesi\u0105t jeden tysi\u0119cy dwie\u015bcie trzydzie\u015bci cztery}}).\n\nWhen a numeral modifies a noun, the numeral takes the expected case, but the noun may not; also the gender and number of the resulting [[noun phrase]] may not correspond to that of the noun. The following rules apply:\n*The numeral {{lang|pl|jeden}} (1) behaves as an ordinary adjective, and no special rules apply. It can even be used in the plural, for example to mean \"some\" (and not others), or to mean \"one\" with [[pluralia tantum]], e.g. {{lang|pl|jedne drzwi}} \"one door\" (''drzwi'' has no singular).\n*After the numerals {{lang|pl|dwa}}, {{lang|pl|trzy}}, {{lang|pl|cztery}} (2, 3, 4), and compound numbers ending with them (22, 23, 24, etc. but not 12, 13, or 14, which take ''-na\u015bcie'' as a suffix and are thus not compound numbers at all), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, and the resulting noun phrase is plural (e.g. {{lang|pl|4 koty sta\u0142y}}, \"4 cats stood\").\n*With other numbers (5, 6, etc., 20, 21, 25, etc.), if the numeral is nominative or accusative, the noun takes the genitive plural form, and the resulting noun phrase is neuter singular (e.g. {{lang|pl|5 kot\u00f3w sta\u0142o}}, \"5 cats stood\").\n*With the masculine personal plural forms of numbers (as given in the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section), the rule given above \u2013 that if the numeral is nominative or accusative the noun is genitive plural, and the resulting phrase is neuter singular \u2013 applies to ''all'' numbers other than 1 (as in {{lang|pl|trzech m\u0119\u017cczyzn przysz\u0142o}}, \"three men came\"), unless the alternative nominative forms {{lang|pl|dwaj}}, {{lang|pl|trzej}}, {{lang|pl|czterej}} (for 2, 3, 4) are used (these take nominative nouns and form a masculine plural phrase).\n*If the numeral is in the genitive, dative, instrumental or locative, the noun takes the same case as the numeral (except sometimes in the case of numbers that end with the nouns for 1000 and higher quantities, which often take a genitive noun regardless).\n\nPolish also has a series of numerals called '''collective numerals''' {{lang|pl|(liczebniki zbiorowe)}}, namely {{lang|pl|dwoje}} (for 2), {{lang|pl|troje}} (for 3), {{lang|pl|czworo}} (for 4), {{lang|pl|pi\u0119cioro}} (for 5), and so on. These are used with the following types of nouns:\n*Personal and animate neuter nouns (e.g. {{lang|pl|dziecko}} (\"child\"), {{lang|pl|koci\u0119}} (\"kitten\"))\n*Non-masculine personal [[plurale tantum|pluralia tantum]], i.e. nouns that do not exist in the grammatical singular (such as {{lang|pl|drzwi}} (\"door(s)\"), {{lang|pl|urodziny}} (\"birthday(s)\"))\n*Plural nouns referring to a group containing both sexes (for example, {{lang|pl|czworo student\u00f3w}} refers to a group of four students of mixed sex) \nFor the declension of collective numerals by case, see the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section. They all follow the rule that when the numeral is nominative or accusative, the noun becomes genitive plural, and the resulting noun phrase is neuter singular. In this case the genitive noun is also used after the instrumental of the numeral.\n\nCertain [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifiers]] behave similarly to numerals. These include {{lang|pl|kilka}} (\"several\"), {{lang|pl|par\u0119}} (\"a few\") and {{lang|pl|wiele}} (\"much, many\"), which behave like numbers above 5 in terms of the noun cases and verb forms taken. There are also indefinite numerals {{lang|pl|kilkana\u015bcie, kilkadziesi\u0105t, kilkaset}} (and similar forms with ''par\u0119-''), meaning \"several-teen\", several tens and several hundred.\n\nQuantifiers that always take the genitive of nouns include {{lang|pl|du\u017co}} (\"much, many\"), {{lang|pl|ma\u0142o}} (\"few, little\"), {{lang|pl|wi\u0119cej}} (\"more\"), {{lang|pl|mniej}} (\"less\") (also {{lang|pl|najwi\u0119cej/najmniej}} \"most/least\"), {{lang|pl|troch\u0119}} (\"a bit\"), {{lang|pl|pe\u0142no}} (\"plenty, a lot\").\n\nThe words {{lang|pl|oba}} and {{lang|pl|obydwa}} (meaning \"both\"), and their derived forms behave like {{lang|pl|dwa}}. However the collective forms {{lang|pl|oboje, obydwoje}} (in the nominative/vocative), when referring to a married couple or similar, take the nominative form of the noun rather than the genitive, and form a masculine plural noun phrase (''oboje rodzice byli'', \"both parents were\", cf. {{lang|pl|dwoje rodzic\u00f3w by\u0142o}}).\n\nFor the declension of all the above quantifiers, see the [[Polish morphology#Numbers and quantifiers|morphology]] article section.\n\n==Verbs ==\n{{main|Polish morphology#Verbs}}\n\nPolish [[verb]]s have the grammatical category of [[Grammatical aspect|aspect]]. Each verb is either ''imperfective'', meaning that it denotes continuous or habitual events, or ''perfective'', meaning that it denotes single completed events (in particular, perfective verbs have no present tense). Verbs often occur in imperfective and perfective pairs \u2013 for example, {{lang|pl|je\u015b\u0107}} and {{lang|pl|zje\u015b\u0107}} both mean \"to eat\", but the first has imperfective aspect, the second perfective.\n\nImperfective verbs have three [[verb tense|tenses]]: [[present tense|present]], [[past tense|past]] and [[future tense|future]], the last being a compound tense (except in the case of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} \"to be\"). Perfective verbs have a past tense and a simple future tense, the latter formed on the same pattern as the present tense of imperfective verbs. Both types also have [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[conditional mood|conditional]] forms. The dictionary form of a verb is the [[infinitive]], which usually ends with ''-\u0107'' (occasionally with ''-c''). The present-day past tense derives from the old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] \"perfect\" tense; several other old tenses (the [[aorist]], [[imperfect]], and [[past perfect]]) have been dropped.\n\nThe present tense of imperfective verbs (and future tense of perfective verbs) has six forms, for the three [[grammatical person|persons]] and two [[grammatical number|numbers]]. For example, the present tense of {{lang|pl|je\u015b\u0107}} is {{lang|pl|jem}}, {{lang|pl|jesz}}, {{lang|pl|je}}; {{lang|pl|jemy}}, {{lang|pl|jecie}}, {{lang|pl|jedz\u0105}} (meaning \"(I) eat\" etc. \u2013 subject pronouns may be dropped), while the future tense of the corresponding perfective verb {{lang|pl|zje\u015b\u0107}} is {{lang|pl|zjem}}, {{lang|pl|zjesz}} etc. (meaning \"(I) shall eat\" etc.)\n\nThe verb {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} has the irregular present tense {{lang|pl|jestem, jeste\u015b, jest, jeste\u015bmy, jeste\u015bcie, s\u0105}}. It also has a simple future tense (see below).\n\nThe past tense agrees with the subject in gender as well as person and number. The basic past stem is in ''-\u0142''; to this are added endings for gender and number, and then personal endings are further added for the first and second person forms. Thus, on the example of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, the past tense forms are {{lang|pl|by\u0142em/by\u0142am}} (\"I was\", masc/fem.), {{lang|pl|by\u0142e\u015b/by\u0142a\u015b}}, {{lang|pl|by\u0142/by\u0142a/by\u0142o}}; {{lang|pl|byli\u015bmy/by\u0142y\u015bmy}} (\"we were\" all gender mixes (except:)/a group of all fem.), {{lang|pl|byli\u015bcie/by\u0142y\u015bcie}}, {{lang|pl|byli/by\u0142y}}.\n\nThe [[conditional tense|conditional]] is formed from the past tense plus {{lang|pl|by}}, the personal endings (if any) coming after the {{lang|pl|by}}. For example: {{lang|pl|by\u0142bym/by\u0142abym}} (\"I would be\", masc/fem.), {{lang|pl|by\u0142by\u015b/by\u0142aby\u015b}}, {{lang|pl|by\u0142by/by\u0142aby/by\u0142oby}}; {{lang|pl|byliby\u015bmy/by\u0142yby\u015bmy}}, {{lang|pl|byliby\u015bcie/by\u0142yby\u015bcie}}, {{lang|pl|byliby/by\u0142yby}}.\n\nThe personal past tense suffixes, which are reduced forms of the present tense of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, are [[clitic]]s and can be detached from the verb to attach to another accented word earlier in the sentence, such as a question word (as in {{lang|pl|kogo\u015bcie zobaczyli}} as an alternative to {{lang|pl|kogo zobaczyli\u015bcie}} \"whom did you see\"), or (mostly in informal speech) an emphatic particle {{lang|pl|\u017ce}} (''co \u017ce\u015bcie zrobili?'' \"what did you do\"). The same applies to the conditional endings (''kiedy by\u015bcie przyszli'' as an alternative to {{lang|pl|kiedy przyszliby\u015bcie}} \"when would you come\").\n\nIf {{lang|pl|by}} introduces the clause, either alone or forming one of the conjunctions {{lang|pl|\u017ceby}}, {{lang|pl|i\u017cby}}, {{lang|pl|a\u017ceby}}, {{lang|pl|aby}}, {{lang|pl|coby}}, it forms the [[Subjunctive mood#Polish|subjunctive mood]]<ref name = \"migdalski\">Migdalski K. ''The Syntax of Compound Tenses in Slavic'', Utrecht 2006</ref>\nand is not to be confused with the conditional clitic {{lang|pl|by}}.<ref name=\"tomaszewicz\">Anastasia Smirnova, Vedrana Mihali\u010dek, Lauren Ressue, ''Formal Studies in Slavic Linguistics'', Cambridge Scholar Publishing, Newcastle upon Type, Wielka Brytania, 2010: Barbara Tomaszewicz, Subjunctive Mood in Polish and the Clause Typing Hypothesis</ref> For example, \"He wants me to sing\" might be {{lang|pl|chce, aby(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}}, {{lang|pl|chce, \u017ceby(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}} or {{lang|pl|chce, by(m) \u015bpiewa\u0142}}. Such clauses may express \"in order that\", or be used with verbs meaning \"want\", \"expect\", etc.\n\nThe future tense of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"be\") follows the pattern of a typical present tense: {{lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119, b\u0119dziesz, b\u0119dzie, b\u0119dziemy, b\u0119dziecie, b\u0119d\u0105}}.\nThe future tense of other imperfective verbs is formed using the future of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} together with the infinitive, or the past form (inflected for gender and number, but without any personal suffixes), of the verb in question. For example, the future of {{lang|pl|robi\u0107}} (\"do, make\") has such forms as {{lang|pl|b\u0119d\u0119 robi\u0107/robi\u0142/robi\u0142a}}, {{lang|pl|b\u0119dziecie robi\u0107/robili/robi\u0142y}}. The choice between infinitive and past form is usually a free one, but with modals governing another infinitive, the past form is used: {{lang|pl|b\u0119dzie musia\u0142 odej\u015b\u0107}} (not {{lang|pl|b\u0119dzie musie\u0107...}}) \"he will have to leave\".\n\nThe second personal singular [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed from the present tense by dropping the ending (e.g. {{lang|pl|bra\u0107}}: 2/3S present {{lang|pl|bierze(sz)}}, imperative {{lang|pl|bierz}}), sometimes adding ''-ij'' or ''-aj''. Add ''-my'' and ''-cie'' for the 1P and 2P forms. To make third-person imperative sentences (including with the polite second-person pronouns {{lang|pl|pan}} etc.) the particle {{lang|pl|niech}} is used at the start of the sentence (or at least before the verb), with the verb in the future tense (if {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} or perfective) or present tense (otherwise). There is a tendency to prefer imperfective verbs in imperative sentences for politeness; negative imperatives quite rarely use perfectives.\n\nOther forms of the verb are:\n*present [[adverbial participle]] (imperfective verbs only), also called [[gerund]], as {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewaj\u0105c}} (meaning \"(when) singing\", \"by singing\", etc.)\n*present [[adjectival participle]] (imperfective verbs only), formed from the gerund by adding adjectival endings, as {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewaj\u0105cy}} etc., meaning \"singing\" (as an [[attributive adjective]]), although such participles can be used to form extended adjectival phrases, which (usually unlike in English) can precede the noun. \n*[[passive participle]] (all transitive verbs), in ''-ny'' or ''-ty'' (conjugated as an adjective). This often corresponds to the English [[past participle]], both in fully adjectival use and in [[passive voice]].\n*subjectless past tense, formed as the past participle but with the ending ''-o'' (e.g. {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewano}} \"there was sung\").\n*past [[active participle]] (perfective verbs only), like {{lang|pl|zabiwszy}} \"having killed\" (from {{lang|pl|zabi\u0107}} \"kill\"); this form is invariant.\n*[[verbal noun]], formed from the past participle with the ending ''-ie'', e.g. {{lang|pl|\u015bpiewanie}}. This is a neuter noun.\n\n==Prepositions==\nPolish uses [[preposition]]s, which form phrases by preceding a noun or noun phrase. Different prepositions take different cases (all cases are possible except nominative and vocative); some prepositions can take different cases depending on meaning.\n\nThe prepositions ''z'' and ''w'' are pronounced together with the following word, obeying the usual rules for consonant cluster voicing (so {{lang|pl|z tob\u0105}} \"with you\" is pronounced {{lang|pl|stob\u0105}}). Before some consonant clusters, particularly clusters beginning with a sibilant (in the case of ''z'') or with ''f/w'' (in the case of ''w''), the prepositions take the form {{lang|pl|ze}} and {{lang|pl|we}} (e.g. {{lang|pl|we Wroc\u0142awiu}} \"in [[Wroc\u0142aw]]\"). These forms are also used before the first-person singular pronouns in ''mn-''; several other prepositions also have longer forms before these pronouns (''przeze mnie, pode mn\u0105'' etc.), and these phrases are pronounced as single words, with the stress on the penultimate syllable (the ''-e'').\n\nCommon prepositions include:\n*''na'', with the locative with basic meaning \"on\", and with the accusative with basic meaning \"onto\" (also metaphorical meanings)\n*''w'', with the locative with basic meaning \"in\", and with the accusative with basic meaning \"into\" (also metaphorical meanings)\n*''z'', with the instrumental [[Comitative case|comitative]] meaning \"with\" (''in accompaniment of''); with the genitive meaning \"from, out of\"\n*''do/od'', with genitive, meaning \"to, into/from\"\n*''dla'', with genitive, meaning \"for\"\n*''o'', with locative meaning \"about\", also with the accusative in some constructions\n*''przed/za/nad/pod'' with instrumental meaning \"before, in front of/behind/over/under\", also with the accusative in some meanings (and genitive in the case of {{lang|pl|za}}); there are also compound prepositions {{lang|pl|sprzed/zza/znad/spod}} (\"from in front of\" etc.) taking the genitive\n*''przez'' with the accusative, meaning \"through\" etc.\n*''przeciw(ko)'' with dative, meaning \"against\" (but {{lang|pl|naprzeciw(ko)}} \"opposite\" takes genitive)\n*''po'', with locative meaning \"after\", also with the accusative in some meanings\n*''przy'', with locative, meaning \"next to\" etc.\n*''bez'', with genitive, meaning \"without\"\n\n==Conjunctions==\nCommon Polish [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]s include {{lang|pl|i}} (and less commonly {{lang|pl|oraz}}) meaning \"and\", {{lang|pl|lub}} and {{lang|pl|albo}} meaning \"or\", {{lang|pl|ale}} meaning \"but\", {{lang|pl|lecz}} meaning \"but\" chiefly in phrases of the type \"not ''x'' but ''y''\", {{lang|pl|\u017ce}} (or more formally sometimes {{lang|pl|i\u017c}}) meaning \"that\", {{lang|pl|je\u015bli}} meaning \"if\" (also {{lang|pl|gdyby}}, where {{lang|pl|by}} is the conditional particle), {{lang|pl|czy}} meaning \"whether\" (also an interrogative particle), {{lang|pl|kiedy}} or {{lang|pl|gdy}} meaning \"when\", {{lang|pl|wi\u0119c}}, {{lang|pl|dlatego}} and {{lang|pl|zatem}} meaning \"so, therefore\", {{lang|pl|poniewa\u017c}} meaning \"because\", {{lang|pl|cho\u0107/chocia\u017c}} meaning \"although\", and {{lang|pl|aby/\u017ceby}} meaning \"in order to/that\" (can be followed by an infinitive phrase, or by a sentence in the past tense; in the latter case the {{lang|pl|by}} of the conjunction is in fact the conditional particle and takes personal endings as appropriate).\n\nIn written Polish, [[subordinate clause]]s are normally set off with commas. Commas are not normally used before conjunctions meaning \"and\" or \"or\".\n\n==Syntax==\n\n===Word order===\nBasic word order in Polish is [[subject\u2013verb\u2013object|SVO]]; however, as it is a [[synthetic language]], it is possible to move words around in the sentence. For example, {{lang|pl|Alicja ma kota}} (\"Alice has a cat\") is the standard order, but it is also possible to use other orders to give a different emphasis (for example, {{lang|pl|Alicja kota '''ma'''}}, with emphasis on {{lang|pl|ma}} (\"has\"), used as a response to an assertion of the opposite); general word order controls [[topic and comment|theme and rheme]] [[information structure]] with theme coming first.\n\nCertain words, however, behave as [[clitic]]s: they rarely or never begin a clause, but are used after another stressed word, and tend to appear early in the clause. Examples of these are the weak pronouns {{lang|pl|mi}}, {{lang|pl|go}} etc., the reflexive pronoun {{lang|pl|si\u0119}}, and the personal past tense endings and conditional endings described under [[#Verbs|Verbs]] above.\n  \nPolish is a [[pro-drop language]]; subject pronouns are frequently dropped. For example: {{lang|pl|ma kota}} (literally \"has a cat\") may mean \"he/she/it has a cat\". It is also possible to drop the object or even sometimes verb, if they are obvious from context. For example, {{lang|pl|ma}} (\"has\") or {{lang|pl|nie ma}} (\"has not\") may be used as an affirmative or negative answer to a question \"does... have...?\".\n\nNote the interrogative particle {{lang|pl|czy}}, which is used to start a [[yes-no question|yes/no question]], much like the French \"est-ce que\". The particle is not obligatory, and sometimes rising intonation is the only signal of the interrogative character of the sentence.\n\nNegation is achieved by placing {{lang|pl|nie}} directly before the verb, or other word or phrase being negated (in some cases ''nie-'' is prefixed to the negated word, equivalent to English ''un-'' or ''non-''). If a sentence contains a negative element such as {{lang|pl|nigdy}} (\"never\"), {{lang|pl|nikt}} (\"no-one\"), etc., the verb is negated with {{lang|pl|nie}} as well (and several such negative elements can be combined, as in {{lang|pl|nikt nigdy nie robi nic}}, \"no-one ever does anything\", literally \"no-one never doesn't do nothing\").  \n \nThe equivalent of the English \"there is\" etc. is the appropriate part of the verb {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"to be\"), e.g. {{lang|pl|jest...}} (\"there is...\"), {{lang|pl|s\u0105...}} (\"there are...\"), {{lang|pl|by\u0142(a/o)...}} (\"there was...\"), etc., with a noun phrase in the nominative. The negative form is always singular (and neuter where applicable), takes the noun phrase in the genitive, and uses {{lang|pl|ma}} rather than {{lang|pl|jest}} in the present tense: {{lang|pl|nie ma kota}} (\"there isn't a cat\", also \"the cat isn't there\"), {{lang|pl|nie by\u0142o kota}} etc. (as usual, the word order is not fixed).\n\nWhere two concepts are equated, the particle {{lang|pl|to}} is often used instead of a part of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, with the nouns expressing the concepts in the nominative case (although verb infinitives can also be used here: {{lang|pl|istnie\u0107 to cierpie\u0107}} \"to exist is to suffer\"). There are also sentences where {{lang|pl|to}} appears to be the subject of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}}, but the complement is in the nominative and the verb agrees with the complement: {{lang|pl|to jest...}} (\"this/it is...\"), {{lang|pl|to s\u0105...}}, {{lang|pl|to by\u0142(a/o)...}}, etc.\n\n===Subjectless sentences===\nThere are various types of sentence in Polish that do not have subjects:\n*Sentences where the subject pronoun is dropped (see above), but is still understood.\n*Sentences formed from certain verbs that can appear (in third-person singular neuter form) without a subject, corresponding to an English impersonal \"it\", as in {{lang|pl|pada\u0142o}} (\"it was raining/snowing\").\n*Sentences with verbs in second-person singular masculine (or sometimes third-person masculine personal plural) form, but no subject, corresponding to English \"you\" with general meaning, as in {{lang|pl|robisz to}} (\"you do this\", ''i.e.'', \"one does this\").\n*Sentences with the reflexive particle {{lang|pl|si\u0119}} but no subject, the verb being third-person singular, as in {{lang|pl|tutaj pije si\u0119 w\u00f3dk\u0119}} (\"here one drinks vodka/vodka is drunk\") \u2013 note that the logical direct object is in the accusative, not the nominative as in analogous constructions in other languages such as Russian.\n*Sentences with the subjectless past tense form of the verb (see [[#Verbs|Verbs]] above).\n*Sentences with impersonal particles such as {{lang|pl|mo\u017cna}} (\"it is possible\"), {{lang|pl|wolno}} (\"it is permitted\").\n\n===Noun syntax===\nThe use of the cases of nouns is as follows:\n# The nominative (the [[dictionary form]] of a noun) is used for sentence [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and for certain complements (as in sentences of the form ''X to Y'' \"X is Y\", ''to jest Y'' \"this is Y\").\n# The genitive is used for possessor and similar (equivalent to English \"of X\" or \"X's\"), for the [[direct object]] of [[negation (linguistics)|negated]] verbs, as the object of some verbs and prepositions, as an object with [[partitive]] meaning and in some fixed expressions, and for nouns governed by certain numbers and expressions of quantity (see [[#Numbers and quantifiers|Numbers and quantifiers]] above).\n# The dative is used for [[indirect object]]s, to denote the party for whom something is done or the \"party concerned\" in certain expressions (such as {{lang|pl|wolno mu}}, \"he is allowed\", lit. \"it is allowed to him\"), and as the object of some verbs and prepositions.\n# The accusative is used for the direct object of verbs that are not negated, as the object of some prepositions, and in some time expressions.\n# The instrumental is used for the means (instrument) by which something is done, for example {{lang|pl|poci\u0105giem}} (instrumental of {{lang|pl|poci\u0105g}} \"train\") means \"by train\". It is also used for a noun complement of {{lang|pl|by\u0107}} (\"to be\"), and for the complements and objects of some other verbs and some prepositions.  \n# The locative is used only as the object of certain prepositions (particularly {{lang|pl|w}} \"in\" and {{lang|pl|na}} \"on\", when they have static meaning).\n# The vocative is used to indicate who or what is being addressed. However, with personal names, in colloquial speech, the nominative is usually used instead.\n\nLike most [[Slavic languages]], with the exception of [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], Polish uses no definite or indefinite [[article (grammar)|article]]s. A noun such as {{lang|pl|kot}} may mean either \"the cat\" or \"a cat\".\n\nPolish does not regularly place nouns together to form [[compound noun]] expressions. Equivalents to such expressions are formed using noun-derived adjectives (as in {{lang|pl|sok pomara\u0144czowy}}, \"orange juice\", where {{lang|pl|pomara\u0144czowy}} is an adjective derived from {{lang|pl|pomara\u0144cza}} \"orange\"), or using prepositional phrases or (equivalently) a noun in the genitive or other case.\n\nA group of nouns connected by a word for \"and\" is treated as plural. It is masculine personal plural if it contains any male person (in fact, if it contains any person and any masculine noun).\n\n===Adjective syntax===\nAdjectives generally precede the noun they modify, although in some fixed expressions and official names and phrases they can follow the noun (as in {{lang|pl|j\u0119zyk polski}} \"Polish language\"; also {{lang|pl|dzie\u0144 dobry}} \"good day, hello\").\n\n[[Attributive adjective]]s agree in gender, number and case with the noun they modify. [[Predicate adjective]]s agree with the relevant noun in gender and number, and are in the nominative case, unless the subject is unspecified (as in some infinitive phrases), in which case the adjective takes the (masculine/neuter) instrumental form (for example, {{lang|pl|by\u0107 m\u0105drym}}, \"to be wise\", although the nominative is used if the logical subject is specified){{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}. The instrumental is also used for adjectival complements of some other verbs, as in {{lang|pl|czyni\u0107 go m\u0105drym}} (\"make him wise\").\n\nWith pronouns such as {{lang|pl|co\u015b}} (\"something\") (but not {{lang|pl|kto\u015b}} \"someone\"), if the pronoun is nominative or accusative, the adjective takes the genitive form (''co\u015b dobrego'' \"something good\").\n\nAdjectives are sometimes used as nouns; for example, {{lang|pl|zielony}} (\"green\") may mean \"the/a green one\" etc.\n\nCompound adjectives can be formed by replacing the ending of the first adjective with ''-o'', as in {{lang|pl|formalno-prawny}} (\"formal (and) legal\").\n\n{{InterWiki|code=pl}}\n{{Wikibooks|Polish}}\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{WikisourceWiki|code=pl}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|last=Soerensen|first=Asmus|title=Polnische Grammatik mit grammatisch-alphabetischem Verbalverzeichnis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=59BtQwAACAAJ|year=1900|publisher=E.

Yogi Bhajan founded the \"[[3HO|Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization]]\" (3HO) as a teaching organization. Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of 'Kundalini' yoga. \"When placed alongside the teachings of Swami [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras (''Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru'') and chanting from the latter\", Deslippe writes.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6r63q6qn |title=From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini Yoga |first=Philip Roland |last=Deslippe |date=14 March 2013 |publisher= |volume=8 |issue= 3|via=escholarship.org}}</ref> But Virsa Singh rejected Bhajan\u2019s Kundalini yoga.

The yogis of \"Gorakhmatta,\" meaning \"Wisdom of Gorakhnatha,\" the founder of Hatha yoga, converted to the path of Guru Nanak, and also changed the name of their ancient center to [[Nanakmatta]] meaning \"Wisdom of Guru Nanak,\" known today as Gurdwara Sri Nanakmatta Sahib. Guru Nanak never practiced yoga, and neither did any of the following Gurus, their Sikhs or the Khalsa. Yoga is unmistakably refuted in the Guru Granth Sahib.<ref name=\"sikhfreepress.org\"/>\n\nDisciples of Yogi Bhajan claim that while Yoga practice and philosophy are generally considered a part of Hindu culture, Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is founded on the principles of [[Sikh Dharma]]. Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan adheres to the three pillars of [[Patanjali]]'s kriya yoga system \u2013 discipline (''tapa\u1e25''), spiritual study (''sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya''), and devotion to God (''i\u015bvarapra\u1e47id\u0101na'') (PYS, II:1) \u2013 but it does not condone extremes of [[asceticism]] or [[renunciation]].

Yogi Bhajan founded the \"[[3HO|Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization]]\" (3HO) as a teaching organization. Yogi Bhajan took yogic postures and techniques, attached them to Tantric theories and Sikh mantras, synthesizing a new form of 'Kundalini' yoga. \"When placed alongside the teachings of Swami [[Dhirendra Brahmachari]] and Maharaj Virsa Singh, it becomes strikingly apparent that at least in its earliest years, Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini yoga was not a distinct practice, but essentially a combination of yogic mechanics learned from the former and the Sikh-derived mantras (''Ik Ongkaar, Sat Naam, Sri Waheguru'') and chanting from the latter\", Deslippe writes.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6r63q6qn |title=From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan's Kundalini Yoga |first=Philip Roland |last=Deslippe |date=14 March 2013 |publisher= |volume=8 |issue= 3|via=escholarship.org}}</ref> But Virsa Singh rejected Bhajan\u2019s Kundalini yoga.

The yogis of \"Gorakhmatta,\" meaning \"Wisdom of Gorakhnatha,\" the founder of Hatha yoga, converted to the path of Guru Nanak, and also changed the name of their ancient center to [[Nanakmatta]] meaning \"Wisdom of Guru Nanak,\" known today as Gurdwara Sri Nanakmatta Sahib. Guru Nanak never practiced yoga, and neither did any of the following Gurus, their Sikhs or the Khalsa. Yoga is unmistakably refuted in the Guru Granth Sahib.<ref name=\"sikhfreepress.org\"/>\n\nDisciples of Yogi Bhajan claim that while Yoga practice and philosophy are generally considered a part of Hindu culture, Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan is founded on the principles of [[Sikh Dharma]]. Kundalini Yoga as taught by Yogi Bhajan adheres to the three pillars of [[Patanjali]]'s kriya yoga system \u2013 discipline (''tapa\u1e25''), spiritual study (''sv\u0101dhy\u0101ya''), and devotion to God (''i\u015bvarapra\u1e47id\u0101na'') (PYS, II:1) \u2013 but it does not condone extremes of [[asceticism]] or [[renunciation]].

{"title_page": "Business valuation", "text_new": "'''Business valuation''' is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the [[valuation (finance)|economic value]] of an owner's interest in a business.  [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is used by financial market participants \nto determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business.  In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Benny K.

These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value.<ref>{{cite book | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F. Reilly |author3=Robert P. Schweihs   | title = Valuing a Business | publisher = McGraw Hill | series = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2000  | doi =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO6wd8O8dsUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=shannon+pratt&ei=fcfUR6q-F4TCyQSrxfWABA&sig=Fpqt8pGRjbLPZJ9e_QEQGFzQ7y0#PPA913,M1  | isbn = 0-07-135615-0 }} hmegrii\n</ref>\n\nThe standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued.  The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).\n\n== Standards of value ==\n\n* Fair market value \u2013 a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.\n* Investment value \u2013 a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.\n* Intrinsic value \u2013 the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.\n\n==Premises of value==\n\n* Going Concern \u2013 Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.\n* Assemblage of assets \u2013 value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.\n* Orderly disposition \u2013 value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. \n* Liquidation \u2013 value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.\n\nPremise of value for fair value Calculation\n\n* In use \u2013 If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.\n* In Exchange \u2013 If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. \nBusiness valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.\n\nNote, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.\n\nThese assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.\n\n== Elements ==\n\n=== Economic conditions ===\n\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2011}}\n\nA business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.\nA common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.\n\n=== Financial analysis ===\nThe [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.\n\nIt is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.\nCash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.\n\n=== Normalization of financial statements ===\nThe key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:\n* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].\n* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.\n* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.\n* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.\n\n=== Income, asset and market approaches ===\nThree different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.<ref>[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]</ref> Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.\n\nIn certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].\n\nIn determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.\n\n== Income approach ==\nThe income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows (\"[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]\"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233904/http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.\n\nHowever, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.\n\n=== Discount or capitalization rates ===\nA [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment. See [[Required rate of return]].\n\n* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected cash flows. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.\n* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate cash flows, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.\n\nThere are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.\n\nCapitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.\n\n==== Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) ====\nThe [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with \"beta\", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.\n\nOne of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.\n\n===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====\nWith regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:\n\n* Models of the Q theory<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]]\n* [[Carhart four-factor model]]\n* Fama-French five-factor model\n\nNevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glei\u00dfner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.\n\n====Modified capital asset pricing model====\nThe cost of equity (Ke) is computed by using the modified capital asset pricing model (Mod. CAPM)\n\n<math>k_e  = R_f + \\beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  </math>\n\nWhere:\n\n<math>R_f</math>   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)\n\n<math>\\beta</math>   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)\n\n<math>k_e</math>   =   Cost of Equity\n\n<math>R_m</math>   =    Market Rate of Return\n\nSCRP = Small Company Risk Premium\n\nCSRP= Company specific Risk premium\n\n==== Weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") ====\nThe [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net cash flow to total invested capital.\n\nOne of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.\n\nIndeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.\n\nOnce the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax cash flow, aftertax cash flow, pretax [[net income]], after tax net income, excess earnings, projected cash flow, etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.\n\nCareful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.\n\n==== Build-Up Method ====\nThe Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a \"build-up\" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. \n#The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the [[risk-free rate]], which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. \n#Investors who buy [[Large-cap stocks|large-cap equity stocks]], which are inherently more risky than long-term [[government bonds]], require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the [[equity risk premium]] yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.  \n#Similarly, investors who invest in [[Small-cap stocks|small cap stocks]], which are riskier than [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip stocks]], require a greater return, called the \"[[size premium]].\" Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] & Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills & Inflation and [[Duff & Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.\n\nBy adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the \"[[systematic risk]]s.\" \nThis type of investment risk cannot be avoided through [[portfolio diversification]]. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.\n\nIn addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include \"[[unsystematic risk]]\" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns. Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. \n#One of those categories is the \"industry risk premium\". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.\n#The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as \"company specific risk.\" \n\nHistorically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:\n:Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta * equity risk premium\n:: = risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium\nThe only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.  While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the first equation.\n\nIt is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by [[Aswath Damodaran]]) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ valuation Consultancy]  community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.\n\nIt is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.\n\n[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)\n\n== Asset-based approaches ==\nIn asset-based analysis the value of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ '''business valuation''']. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.\nThe value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.\nIn considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.\n\nAdjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a \"sanity check\" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...\n\n== Market approaches ==\n{{main|Valuation using multiples}}\n\nThe market approach to [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ business valuation] is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the \"comparable sales\" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.\n\nThe difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.\n\nWhen there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.\n\n=== Guideline Public Company method ===\nGuideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a \"multiple.\" If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.\n\nHowever, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.\n\n==Option pricing approaches==\n[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.<ref name=\"Damodaran\">[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].</ref> \nFor general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|\u00a7 \"Valuing flexibility\"]] under [[corporate finance]], {{slink|Valuation (finance)|Specialised cases}}, and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; \nfor detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|\u00a7 \"Limitations\"]] under [[real options valuation]].\n\nIn general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,<ref name =\"Black-Scholes\">{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637\u2013654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]</ref> and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.<ref name=\"Damodaran2\">Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].</ref>  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.<ref name =\"Black-Scholes\"/> Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt\u2014and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. See also [[Merton model]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principal\u2013agent problem]]s;<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> see [[Principal\u2013agent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principal\u2013agent problem]].)\n\nCertain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|\"Applications\"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.<ref>Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's \"Real Options\"?]</ref> Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise.

Where positive (\"[[in the money]]\") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].

Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].\n\nProduct [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents\u2014typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors\u2014can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.<ref>P.

See {{slink|Patent valuation|Option-based method}}. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.\n\n== Cultural valuation method ==\nBesides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.\n\n== Discounts and premiums ==\nThe valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.\nDiscussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the \"levels of value\". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.\nThe intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies \u2013 small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.\nControlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.\nNon-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less \"liquid\" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.\nDespite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.\nValuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.\n\n=== Discount for lack of control ===\nThe first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:\nMID = 1 \u2013 [1 / (1 + CP)]\nThe most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the \"control premium\" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&A transaction.\nWhile it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.\n\n=== Discount for lack of marketability ===\nA \"discount for lack of marketability\" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.<ref name=\"IRSpub\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf|title=Discount for Lack of Marketability|last=|first=|date=September 25, 2009|website=irs.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref name=\"WillDLOM\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf-----|title=The Discount for Lack of Marketability: Update on Current Studies and Analysis of Current Controversies, ''Tax Lawyer'', Vol 61, No 1|last=Robert Reilly|first=and Aaron Rotkowski|date=2007|website=willamette.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> \n\nAnother factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.<ref>Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}</ref> \"The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers\" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: \"Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid.\"{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nSeveral empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. <ref>Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}</ref> The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Restricted stock studies ====\nRestricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.\nThe underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.\n\n==== Option pricing ====\n<!-- IS THIS ONLY VALID FOR USA?  IF NOT, THEN PLEASE GENERALISE IT! -->\nIn addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.\nStudies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.\n\n==== Pre-IPO studies ====\nAnother approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Applying the studies ===\nThe studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.\nThe referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).\n\n== Estimates of business value ==\nThe evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are \"publicly traded,\" meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated \"market capitalization\" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded \"over the counter\" or in \"pink sheets\"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.\n\nA number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.<ref>Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, & Moore, \"Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009</ref> The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.<ref>Anderson, Patrick L., \"Value of Private Businesses in the United States,\" Business Economics (2009) 44, 87\u2013108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}</ref> He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Consolidation (business)]]\n*[[Divestment]]\n*[[Economic value added]]\n*[[EV/EBITDA]]\n*[[Goodwill (accounting)]]\n*[[Intangible asset]]\n*[[Market value added]]\n*[[Mergers and acquisitions]]\n*[[Patent valuation]]\n*[[P/E ratio]]\n*[[Price/sales ratio]]\n*[[Residual income valuation]]\n*[[Tax amortization benefit]]\n*[[Valuation using discounted cash flows]]\n*[[Valuation using multiples]]\n*[[Valuation using the Market Penetration Model]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Anderson, Patrick L., Business Economics and Finance, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2005. {{ISBN|1-58488-348-0}}.\n*Anderson, Patrick L., \"New Developments in Business Valuation.\" Developments in Litigation Economics.

The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).\n\n== Standards of value ==\n\n* Fair market value \u2013 a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.\n* Investment value \u2013 a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.\n* Intrinsic value \u2013 the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.\n\n==Premises of value==\n\n* Going Concern \u2013 Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.\n* Assemblage of assets \u2013 value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.\n* Orderly disposition \u2013 value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. \n* Liquidation \u2013 value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.\n\nPremise of value for fair value Calculation\n\n* In use \u2013 If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.\n* In Exchange \u2013 If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. \nBusiness valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.\n\nNote, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.\n\nThese assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.\n\n== Elements ==\n\n=== Economic conditions ===\n\n{{Globalize|article|USA|2name=the United States|date=March 2011}}\n\nA business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.\nA common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.\n\n=== Financial analysis ===\nThe [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.\n\nIt is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.\nCash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.\n\n=== Normalization of financial statements ===\nThe key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:\n* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].\n* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.\n* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.\n* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.\n\n=== Income, asset and market approaches ===\nThree different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.<ref>[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]</ref> Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.\n\nIn certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].\n\nIn determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.\n\n== Income approach ==\nThe income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows (\"[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]\"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [https://web.archive.org/web/20120425233904/http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.\n\nHowever, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.\n\n=== Discount or capitalization rates ===\nA [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment. See [[Required rate of return]].\n\n* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected cash flows. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.\n* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate cash flows, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.\n\nThere are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.\n\nCapitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.\n\n==== Capital asset pricing model (CAPM) ====\nThe [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with \"beta\", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.\n\nOne of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.\n\n===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====\nWith regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:\n\n* Models of the Q theory<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}</ref>\n* [[Fama\u2013French three-factor model]]\n* [[Carhart four-factor model]]\n* Fama-French five-factor model\n\nNevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Glei\u00dfner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.\n\n====Modified capital asset pricing model====\nThe cost of equity (Ke) is computed by using the modified capital asset pricing model (Mod. CAPM)\n\n<math>k_e  = R_f + \\beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  </math>\n\nWhere:\n\n<math>R_f</math>   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)\n\n<math>\\beta</math>   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)\n\n<math>k_e</math>   =   Cost of Equity\n\n<math>R_m</math>   =    Market Rate of Return\n\nSCRP = Small Company Risk Premium\n\nCSRP= Company specific Risk premium\n\n==== Weighted average cost of capital (\"WACC\") ====\nThe [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net cash flow to total invested capital.\n\nOne of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.\n\nIndeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.\n\nOnce the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax cash flow, aftertax cash flow, pretax [[net income]], after tax net income, excess earnings, projected cash flow, etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.\n\nCareful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net cash flow is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.\n\n==== Build-Up Method ====\nThe Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a \"build-up\" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. \n#The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the [[risk-free rate]], which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. \n#Investors who buy [[Large-cap stocks|large-cap equity stocks]], which are inherently more risky than long-term [[government bonds]], require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the [[equity risk premium]] yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.  \n#Similarly, investors who invest in [[Small-cap stocks|small cap stocks]], which are riskier than [[Blue chip (stock market)|blue-chip stocks]], require a greater return, called the \"[[size premium]].\" Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] & Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills & Inflation and [[Duff & Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.\n\nBy adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the \"[[systematic risk]]s.\" \nThis type of investment risk cannot be avoided through [[portfolio diversification]]. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.\n\nIn addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include \"[[unsystematic risk]]\" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns. Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. \n#One of those categories is the \"industry risk premium\". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.\n#The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as \"company specific risk.\" \n\nHistorically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:\n:Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta * equity risk premium\n:: = risk-free rate + beta * equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium\nThe only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.  While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the first equation.\n\nIt is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by [[Aswath Damodaran]]) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ valuation Consultancy]  community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.\n\nIt is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.\n\n[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)\n\n== Asset-based approaches ==\nIn asset-based analysis the value of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ '''business valuation''']. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.\nThe value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.\nIn considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.\n\nAdjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a \"sanity check\" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...\n\n== Market approaches ==\n{{main|Valuation using multiples}}\n\nThe market approach to [https://truth-uae.com/en/service/valuation-consultancy-appraisal-services-uae/ business valuation] is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the \"comparable sales\" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.\n\nThe difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.\n\nWhen there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.\n\n=== Guideline Public Company method ===\nGuideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a \"multiple.\" If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.\n\nHowever, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.\n\n==Option pricing approaches==\n[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.<ref name=\"Damodaran\">[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].</ref> \nFor general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|\u00a7 \"Valuing flexibility\"]] under [[corporate finance]], {{slink|Valuation (finance)|Specialised cases}}, and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; \nfor detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|\u00a7 \"Limitations\"]] under [[real options valuation]].\n\nIn general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,<ref name =\"Black-Scholes\">{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637\u2013654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]</ref> and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.<ref name=\"Damodaran2\">Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].</ref>  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.<ref name =\"Black-Scholes\"/> Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt\u2014and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. See also [[Merton model]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principal\u2013agent problem]]s;<ref name=\"Damodaran\"/> see [[Principal\u2013agent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principal\u2013agent problem]].)\n\nCertain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|\"Applications\"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.<ref>Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's \"Real Options\"?]</ref> Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare [[Price\u2013earnings ratio#PVGO|PVGO]].\n\nA common application is to [[natural resource]] investments.<ref>{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135\u2013157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}</ref>  Here, the [[underlying|underlying asset]] is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the [[Commodity market|price of the commodity in question]].  The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|developing the resource]]. Where positive (\"[[in the money]]\") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].  A [[:Category:Mining companies|resource firm]] may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].\n\nProduct [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents\u2014typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors\u2014can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.<ref>P.

See {{slink|Patent valuation|Option-based method}}. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.\n\n== Cultural valuation method ==\nBesides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.\n\n== Discounts and premiums ==\nThe valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.\nDiscussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the \"levels of value\". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.\nThe intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies \u2013 small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.\nControlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.\nNon-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less \"liquid\" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.\nDespite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.\nValuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.\n\n=== Discount for lack of control ===\nThe first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:\nMID = 1 \u2013 [1 / (1 + CP)]\nThe most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the \"control premium\" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&A transaction.\nWhile it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.\n\n=== Discount for lack of marketability ===\nA \"discount for lack of marketability\" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.<ref name=\"IRSpub\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf|title=Discount for Lack of Marketability|last=|first=|date=September 25, 2009|website=irs.gov|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref><ref name=\"WillDLOM\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf-----|title=The Discount for Lack of Marketability: Update on Current Studies and Analysis of Current Controversies, ''Tax Lawyer'', Vol 61, No 1|last=Robert Reilly|first=and Aaron Rotkowski|date=2007|website=willamette.com|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-10-18}}</ref> \n\nAnother factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nAll other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.<ref>Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}</ref> \"The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers\" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: \"Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid.\"{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nSeveral empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. <ref>Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}</ref> The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n==== Restricted stock studies ====\nRestricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.\nThe underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.\n\n==== Option pricing ====\n<!-- IS THIS ONLY VALID FOR USA?  IF NOT, THEN PLEASE GENERALISE IT! -->\nIn addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.\nStudies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.\n\n==== Pre-IPO studies ====\nAnother approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}\n\n=== Applying the studies ===\nThe studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.\nThe referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).\n\n== Estimates of business value ==\nThe evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are \"publicly traded,\" meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated \"market capitalization\" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded \"over the counter\" or in \"pink sheets\"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.\n\nA number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.<ref>Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, & Moore, \"Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances,\" Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009</ref> The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.<ref>Anderson, Patrick L., \"Value of Private Businesses in the United States,\" Business Economics (2009) 44, 87\u2013108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}</ref> He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Consolidation (business)]]\n*[[Divestment]]\n*[[Economic value added]]\n*[[EV/EBITDA]]\n*[[Goodwill (accounting)]]\n*[[Intangible asset]]\n*[[Market value added]]\n*[[Mergers and acquisitions]]\n*[[Patent valuation]]\n*[[P/E ratio]]\n*[[Price/sales ratio]]\n*[[Residual income valuation]]\n*[[Tax amortization benefit]]\n*[[Valuation using discounted cash flows]]\n*[[Valuation using multiples]]\n*[[Valuation using the Market Penetration Model]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|3}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*Anderson, Patrick L., Business Economics and Finance, Chapman & Hall/CRC, 2005. {{ISBN|1-58488-348-0}}.\n*Anderson, Patrick L., \"New Developments in Business Valuation.\" Developments in Litigation Economics.

Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city. The continuous warfare led to the establishment of a professional army, which turned out to be more loyal to its generals than to the republic.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the [[Colosseum]]),{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} and [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}} This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire and beyond.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=107}} The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to [[Egypt]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}}\n\n[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, approximately {{convert|6.5|e6km2|e6sqmi|1|abbr=off}}<ref>Parker, Philip, \"The Empire Stops Here\". p. 2.</ref> of land surface.]]\n[[File:Foro Romano Forum Romanum Roman Forum (8043630550).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Roman Forum]] are the remains of those buildings that during most of Ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic center of the city and the neuralgic center of all the Roman civilization.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Roman Forum | website=Ancient History Encyclopedia | date=2012-01-18 | url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/26/the-roman-forum/ | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''.

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy.

The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===[[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrimage]]===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages. The city became a major [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and \"holy city\" for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\n[[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrimages]] to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]] who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Object of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] are also several catacombs built in the Roman age, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the Jesuit Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] in Rome and Roman citizens thanking God for a grace should visit by foot the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrim]] in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major Basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (a palaeochristian Basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano|Roman catacombs]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and neoclassic architecture.<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement.

These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]].

Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port of Civitavecchia]], located about {{convert|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porti di Roma|url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/|accessdate=6 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307140526/http://www.port-of-rome.org/|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n[[File:Roma Metropolitana e Ferrovia 2012.png|thumb|Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016]]\n[[File:Inaugurazione metro B1.jpg|thumb|[[Conca d'Oro (Rome Metro)|Conca d'Oro]] metro station]]\nA 3-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome.

The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999\u20132000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.\n\nThe A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of \u20ac500&nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome therefore hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See,  to the  [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organizations. Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

Rome then began a period characterized by internal struggles between [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] (aristocrats) and [[Plebs|plebeians]] (small landowners), and by constant warfare against the populations of central Italy: Etruscans, Latins, [[Volsci]], [[Aequi]], and [[Marsi]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=77}} After becoming master of [[Latium]], Rome led several wars (against the [[Gauls]], [[Osci]]-[[Samnites]] and the Greek colony of [[Taranto]], allied with [[Pyrrhus of Epirus|Pyrrhus]], king of [[Epirus]]) whose result was the conquest of the [[Italian peninsula]], from the central area up to [[Magna Graecia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=79}}\n\nThe third and second century BC saw the establishment of Roman hegemony over the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Balkans]], through the three [[Punic Wars]] (264\u2013146 BC) fought against the city of [[Carthage]] and the three [[Macedonian Wars]] (212\u2013168 BC) against [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonia]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-83}} The first [[Roman province]]s were established at this time: [[Sicilia (Roman province)|Sicily]], [[Corsica et Sardinia|Sardinia and Corsica]], [[Hispania]], [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonia]], [[Achaea (Roman province)|Achaea]] and [[Africa (Roman province)|Africa]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | pp=81-85}}\n\nFrom the beginning of the 2nd century BC, power was contested between two groups of aristocrats: the [[optimates]], representing the conservative part of the [[Roman senate|Senate]], and the [[populares]], which relied on the help of the [[plebs]] (urban lower class) to gain power. In the same period, the bankruptcy of the small farmers and the establishment of large slave estates caused large-scale migration to the city.

Rome was confirmed as [[caput Mundi]], i.e. the capital of the world, an expression which had already been used in the Republican period. During its first two centuries, the empire was ruled by emperors of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty|Julio-Claudian]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} [[Flavian dynasty|Flavian]] (who also built an eponymous amphitheatre, known as the [[Colosseum]]),{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=97}} and [[Antonine dynasty|Antonine]] dynasties.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}} This time was also characterised by the spread of the Christian religion, preached by [[Jesus Christ]] in [[Judea]] in the first half of the first century (under [[Tiberius]]) and popularized by his [[apostle]]s through the empire and beyond.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=107}} The Antonine age is considered the apogee of the Empire, whose territory ranged from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the [[Euphrates]] and from [[Great Britain|Britain]] to [[Egypt]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=99}}\n\n[[File:Roman Empire Trajan 117AD.png|thumb|right|The Roman Empire at its greatest extent in 117 AD, approximately {{convert|6.5|e6km2|e6sqmi|1|abbr=off}}<ref>Parker, Philip, \"The Empire Stops Here\". p. 2.</ref> of land surface.]]\n[[File:Foro Romano Forum Romanum Roman Forum (8043630550).jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[Roman Forum]] are the remains of those buildings that during most of Ancient Rome's time represented the political, legal, religious and economic center of the city and the neuralgic center of all the Roman civilization.<ref>{{cite web | title=The Roman Forum | website=Ancient History Encyclopedia | date=2012-01-18 | url=https://www.ancient.eu/article/26/the-roman-forum/ | access-date=2019-08-22}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter the end of the Severan Dynasty in 235, the Empire entered into 50-year period known as the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] during which there were numerous putsches by generals, who sought to secure the region of the empire they were entrusted with due to the weakness of central authority in Rome. There was the so-called Gallic Empire from 260-274 and the revolts of Zenobia and her father from the mid-260s which sought to fend off Persian incursions. Some regions \u2013 Britain, Spain, and North Africa \u2013 were hardly affected. Instability caused economic deterioration, and there was a rapid rise in inflation as the government debased the currency in order to meet expenses. The [[Germanic tribes]] along the Rhine and north of the Balkans made serious, uncoordinated incursions from the 250s-280s that were more like giant raiding parties rather than attempts to settle. The [[Sasanian Empire|Persian Empire]] invaded from the east several times during the 230s to 260s but were eventually defeated.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\nEmperor [[Diocletian]] (284) undertook the restoration of the State. He ended the Principate and introduced the [[Tetrarchy]] which sought to increase state power. The most marked feature was the unprecedented intervention of the State down to the city level:  whereas the State had submitted a tax demand to a city and allowed it to allocate the charges, from his reign the State did this down to the village level. In a vain attempt to control inflation, he imposed [[price controls]]  which did not last. He or Constantine regionalized the administration of the empire which fundamentally changed the way it was governed by creating regional dioceses (the consensus seems to have shifted from 297 to 313/14 as the date of creation due to the argument of Constantin Zuckerman in 2002 \"Sur la liste de Verone et la province de grande armenie, Melanges Gilber Dagron). The existence of regional fiscal units from 286 served as the model for this unprecedented innovation. The emperor quickened the process of removing military command from governors. Henceforth, civilian administration and military command would be separate. He gave governors more fiscal duties and placed them in charge of the army logistical support system as an attempt to control it by removing the support system from its control. Diocletian ruled the eastern half, residing in [[Nicomedia]]. In 296, he elevated [[Maximian]] to ''Augustus'' of the western half, where he ruled mostly from [[Mediolanum]] when not on the move.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}} In 292, he created two 'junior' emperors, the Caesars, one for each Augustus, Constantius for Britain, Gaul, and Spain whose seat of power was in [[Trier]] and Licinius in [[Sirmium]] in the Balkans. The appointment of a Caesar was not unknown: Diocletian tried to turn into a system of non-dynastic succession. Upon abdication in 305, the Caesars succeeded and they in turn appointed two colleagues for themselves.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=101}}\n\n[[File:Piazza di porta san Paolo 102 2167.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Pyramid of Cestius|Pyramid of Caius Cestius]] and the [[Aurelian Walls]]]]\nAfter the abdication of Diocletian and Maximian in 305 and a series of civil wars between rival claimants to imperial power, during the years 306\u2013313, the Tetrarchy was abandoned. Constantine the Great undertook a major reform of the bureaucracy, not by changing the structure but by rationalizing the competencies of the several ministries during the years 325\u2013330, after he defeated Licinius, emperor in the East, at the end of 324. The so-called [[Edict of Milan]] of 313, actually a fragment of a letter from Licinius to the governors of the eastern provinces, granted freedom of worship to everyone, including Christians, and ordered the restoration of confiscated church properties upon petition to the newly created vicars of dioceses. He funded the building of several churches and allowed clergy to act as arbitrators in civil suits (a measure that did not outlast him but which was restored in part much later). He transformed the town of [[Byzantium]] into his new residence, which however, was not officially anything more than an imperial residence like Milan or Trier or Nicomedia until given a city prefect in May 359 by Constantius II; [[Constantinople]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nChristianity in the form of the Nicene Creed became the official religion of the empire in 380, via the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] issued in the name of three emperors \u2013 Gratian, Valentinian II, and [[Theodosius I]] \u2013 with Theodosius clearly the driving force behind it. He was the last emperor of a unified empire: after his death in 395, his sons, [[Arcadius]] and [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]] divided the empire into [[Western Roman Empire|a western]] and [[Eastern Roman Empire|an eastern]] part. The seat of government in the Western Roman Empire was transferred to [[Ravenna]] after the [[Siege of Milan]] in 402. During the 5th century, the emperors from the 430s mostly resided in the capital city, Rome.{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}}\n\nRome, which had lost its central role in the administration of the empire, [[Sack of Rome (410)|was sacked in 410]] by the [[Visigoths]] led by [[Alaric I]],{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=115}} but very little physical damage was done, most of which was repaired. What could not be so easily replaced were portable items such as art work in precious metals and items for domestic use (loot). The popes embellished the city with large basilicas, such as Santa Maria Maggiore (with the collaboration of the emperors). The population of the city had fallen from 800,000 to 450\u2013500,000 by the time the city was sacked in 455 by [[Genseric]], king of the [[Vandals]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=117}} The weak emperors of the fifth century could not stop the decay, leading to the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] on 22 August 476, which marked the end of the Western Roman Empire and, for many historians, the beginning of the [[Middle Ages]].{{sfn | Kinder | Hilgemann | 1964 | p=103}} The decline of the city's population was caused by the loss of grain shipments from North Africa, from 440 onward, and the unwillingness of the senatorial class to maintain donations to support a population that was too large for the resources available. Even so, strenuous efforts were made to maintain the monumental centre, the palatine, and the largest baths, which continued to function until the Gothic siege of 537. The large baths of Constantine on the Quirinale were even repaired in 443; and the extent of the damage exaggerated and dramatized.<ref>''Rome, An Urban History from Antiquity to the Present'', Rabun Taylor, Katherine W. Rinne and Spiro Kostof, 2016 pp.&nbsp;160\u2013179</ref> However, the city gave an appearance overall of shabbiness and decay because of the large abandoned areas due to population decline. Population declined to 500,000 by 452 and 100,000 by 500 AD (perhaps larger, though no certain figure can be known). After the Gothic siege of 537, population dropped to 30,000, but had risen to 90,000 by the papacy of Gregory the Great.<ref>''Rome, Profile of a City: 321\u20131308'', [[Richard Krautheimer]], p.&nbsp;165</ref> The population decline coincided with the general collapse of urban life in the West in the fifth and sixth centuries, with few exceptions. Subsidized state grain distributions to the poorer members of society continued right through the sixth century and probably prevented the population from falling further.<ref>''Rome, Urban History'', pp.&nbsp;184\u2013185</ref> The figure of 450,000\u2013500,000 is based on the amount of pork, 3,629,000 lbs. distributed to poorer Romans during five winter months at the rate of five Roman lbs per person per month, enough for 145,000 persons or 1/4 or 1/3 of the total population.<ref>Novel 36, 2, Emperor Valeninian III</ref> Grain distribution to 80,000 ticket holders at the same time suggests 400,000 (Augustus set the number at 200,000 or one-fifth of the population).\n\n===Middle Ages===\n[[File:Sack of Rome by Alaric - sacred vessels are brought to a church for safety (2nd of 2).jpg|thumb|right|15th-century illustration depicting the [[Sack of Rome (410)]] by the [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] king [[Alaric I]]]]\n\nThe Bishop of Rome, called the [[Pope]], was important since the early days of Christianity because of the martyrdom of both the apostles [[Simon Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] there.

The driving force behind this renewal was the monk [[Ildebrando da Soana]], who once elected pope under the name of [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory VII]] became involved into the [[Investiture Controversy]] against Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}} Subsequently, Rome [[Sack of Rome (1084)|was sacked and burned]] by the [[Normans]] under [[Robert Guiscard]] who had entered the city in support of the Pope, then besieged in [[Castel Sant'Angelo]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=20}}\n\nDuring this period, the city was autonomously ruled by a ''senatore'' or ''patrizio''.

Charles founded the [[Sapienza University of Rome|Sapienza]], the university of Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In that period the pope died, and the cardinals, summoned in [[Viterbo]], could not agree on his successor. This angered the people of the city, who then unroofed the building where they met, and imprisoned them until they had nominated the new pope; this marked the birth of the [[conclave]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} In this period the city was also shattered by continuous fights between the aristocratic families: [[Annibaldi family|Annibaldi]], [[Caetani]], [[Colonna family|Colonna]], [[Orsini family|Orsini]], [[Conti di Segni|Conti]], nested in their fortresses built above ancient Roman edifices, fought each other to control the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}}\n\n[[Pope Boniface VIII]], born Caetani, was the last pope to fight for the church's [[universal domain]]; he proclaimed a crusade against the [[Colonna family]] and, in 1300, called for the first [[Jubilee (Christianity)|Jubilee of Christianity]], which brought millions of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] to Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} However, his hopes were crushed by the French king [[Philip IV of France|Philip the Fair]], who took him prisoner and killed him in [[Anagni]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=21}} Afterwards, a new pope faithful to the French was elected, and the papacy was [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377).{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} During this period Rome was neglected, until a plebeian man, [[Cola di Rienzo]], came to power.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} An idealist and a lover of ancient Rome, Cola dreamed about a rebirth of the Roman Empire: after assuming power with the title of ''[[Tribune|Tribuno]]'', his reforms were rejected by the populace.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Forced to flee, Cola returned as part of the entourage of Cardinal [[Gil \u00c1lvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Albornoz]], who was charged with restoring the Church's power in Italy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Back in power for a short time, Cola was soon lynched by the populace, and Albornoz took possession of the city. In 1377, Rome became the seat of the papacy again under [[Gregory XI]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The return of the pope to Rome in that year unleashed the [[Western Schism]] (1377\u20131418), and for the next forty years, the city was affected by the divisions which rocked the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Early modern history===\n{{Main|Roman Renaissance}}\n[[File:Wolf-Dietrich-Klebeband St\u00e4dtebilder G 123 III.jpg|thumb|Almost 500 years old, this map of Rome by [[Mario Cartaro]] shows the city's primary monuments.]]\n[[File:0 Castel et pont Sant'Angelo (1).JPG|thumb|right|[[Castel Sant'Angelo]] or Hadrian's Mausoleum, is a Roman monument radically altered in the Middle Ages and the Renaissance built in 134 AD and crowned with 16th and 17th-century statues.]]\n[[File:Fontana della Barcaccia restaurata, guardando verso Piazza Mignanelli.jpg|thumb|[[Fontana della Barcaccia]] by [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]] in 1629]]\nIn 1418, the [[Council of Constance]] settled the [[Western Schism]], and a Roman pope, [[Martin V]], was elected.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\nThis brought to Rome a century of internal peace, which marked the beginning of the [[Renaissance]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} The ruling popes until the first half of the 16th century, from [[Nicholas V]], founder of the [[Vatican Library]],  to [[Pius II]], humanist and literate, from [[Sixtus IV]], a warrior pope, to [[Alexander VI]], immoral and [[Nepotism|nepotist]], from [[Julius II]], soldier and patron, to [[Leo X]], who gave his name to this period (\"the century of Leo X\"), all devoted their energy to the greatness and the beauty of the Eternal City and to the patronage of the arts.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nDuring those years, the centre of the [[Italian Renaissance]] moved to Rome from Florence. Majestic works, as the new [[St. Peter's Basilica|Saint Peter's Basilica]], the [[Sistine Chapel]] and ''[[Ponte Sisto]]'' (the first bridge to be built across the [[Tiber]] since antiquity, although on Roman foundations) were created. To accomplish that, the popes engaged the best artists of the time, including [[Michelangelo]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Raphael]], [[Domenico Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Luca Signorelli]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]], and [[Cosimo Rosselli]].\n\nThe period was also infamous for papal corruption, with many popes fathering children, and engaging in [[nepotism]] and [[simony]]. The corruption of the popes and the huge expenses for their building projects led, in part, to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and, in turn, the [[Counter-Reformation]]. Under extravagant and rich popes, Rome was transformed into a centre of art, poetry, music, literature, education and culture. Rome became able to compete with other major European cities of the time in terms of wealth, grandeur, the arts, learning and architecture.\n\nThe Renaissance period changed the face of Rome dramatically, with works like the [[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]] by Michelangelo and the frescoes of the [[Borgia Apartments]]. Rome reached the highest point of splendour under [[Pope Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) and his successors [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]], both members of the [[House of Medici|Medici family]].\n[[File:Lingelbach Karneval in Rom 001a.jpg|thumb|[[Carnival]] in Rome, {{circa|1650}}]]\n\n[[File:View of the Piazza Navona, Rome LACMA 49.17.3.jpg|thumb|''A View of the Piazza Navona, Rome'', [[Hendrik Frans van Lint]], {{circa|1730}}]]\nIn this twenty-year period, Rome became one of the greatest centres of art in the world.

The city hosted artists like [[Ridolfo Ghirlandaio|Ghirlandaio]], [[Pietro Perugino|Perugino]], [[Sandro Botticelli|Botticelli]] and [[Donato Bramante|Bramante]], who built the temple of [[San Pietro in Montorio]] and planned a great project to renovate the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. Raphael, who in Rome became one of the most famous painters of Italy, created frescoes in the [[Villa Farnesina]], the [[Raphael Rooms|Raphael's Rooms]], plus many other famous paintings. Michelangelo started the decoration of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and executed the famous statue of the [[Moses]] for the tomb of Julius II.\n\nIts economy was rich, with the presence of several Tuscan bankers, including [[Agostino Chigi]], who was a friend of Raphael and a patron of arts. Before his early death, Raphael also promoted for the first time the preservation of the ancient ruins. The [[War of the League of Cognac]] caused the first plunder of the city in more than five hundred years since [[Sack of Rome (1084)|the previous sack]]; in 1527, the [[Landsknecht]]s of Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] [[Sack of Rome (1527)|sacked the city]], bringing an abrupt end to the golden age of the Renaissance in Rome.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\nBeginning with the [[Council of Trent]] in 1545, the Church began the Counter-Reformation in response to the Reformation, a large-scale questioning of the Church's authority on spiritual matters and governmental affairs. This loss of confidence led to major shifts of power away from the Church.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} Under the popes from [[Pius IV]] to [[Sixtus V]], Rome became the centre of a reformed Catholicism and saw the building of new monuments which celebrated the papacy.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} The popes and cardinals of the 17th and early 18th centuries continued the movement by having the city's landscape enriched with baroque buildings.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}}\n\nThis was another nepotistic age; the new aristocratic families ([[Barberini family|Barberini]], [[Pamphili family|Pamphili]], [[Chigi family|Chigi]], [[Rospigliosi family|Rospigliosi]], [[Altieri family|Altieri]], [[Odescalchi family|Odescalchi]]) were protected by their respective popes, who built huge baroque buildings for their relatives.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=23}} During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], new ideas reached the Eternal City, where the papacy supported archaeological studies and improved the people's welfare.{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}} But not everything went well for the Church during the Counter-Reformation. There were setbacks in the attempts to assert the Church's power, a notable example being in 1773 when Pope Clement XIV was forced by secular powers to have the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuit order suppressed]].{{sfn | Bertarelli | 1925 | p=22}}\n\n===Late modern and contemporary===\nThe rule of the Popes was interrupted by the short-lived [[Roman Republic (18th century)|Roman Republic]] (1798\u20131800), which was built under the influence of the [[French Revolution]]. The [[Papal States]] were restored in June 1800, but during [[Napoleon]]'s reign Rome was [[Rome (department)|annexed as a ''D\u00e9partement'']] of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]]: first as ''D\u00e9partement du Tibre'' (1808\u20131810) and then as ''D\u00e9partement Rome'' (1810\u20131814). After the fall of Napoleon, the Papal States were reconstituted by a decision of the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1814.\n\nIn 1849, [[Roman Republic (19th century)|a second Roman Republic]] was proclaimed during a year of [[revolutions in 1848]]. Two of the most influential figures of the [[Italian unification]], [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], fought for the short-lived republic.\n\nRome then became the focus of hopes of Italian reunification after the rest of Italy was united as the [[Kingdom of Italy]] in 1861 with the temporary capital in [[Florence]]. That year Rome was declared capital of Italy even though it was still under the Pope's control. During the 1860s, the last vestiges of the Papal States were under French protection thanks to the foreign policy of [[Napoleon III]]. French troops were stationed in the region under Papal control. in 1870 the French troops were withdrawn due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. Italian troops were able to [[Capture of Rome|capture Rome]] entering the city through a breach near [[Porta Pia]]. [[Pope Pius IX]] declared himself a [[prisoner in the Vatican]]. In 1871 the capital of Italy was moved from Florence to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |encyclopedia=Catholic Encyclopedia |title=Pope Pius IX |publisher=Newadvent.org |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308223209/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12134b.htm |archivedate=8 March 2017 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> In 1870 the population of the city was 212,000, not all of whom lived with the area circumscribed by the ancient city, and in 1920, the population was 660,000. A significant portion lived outside the walls in the north and across the Tiber in the Vatican area.\n\n[[File:Bombardamento di Roma.gif|thumb|right|Bombardment of Rome by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] planes, 1943]]\n\nSoon after World War I in late 1922 Rome witnessed the rise of [[Italian Fascism]] led by [[Benito Mussolini]], who led a [[March on Rome|march on the city]]. He did away with democracy by 1926, eventually declaring a new [[Imperial Italy (fascist)|Italian Empire]] and allying Italy with [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Mussolini demolished fairly large parts of the city center in order to build wide avenues and squares which were supposed to celebrate the fascist regime and the resurgence and glorification of classical Rome.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Cederna|first1=Antonio|title=Mussolini urbanista|date=1979|publisher=Laterza |location=Bari|pages=passim|language=Italian}}</ref> The interwar period saw a rapid growth in the city's population which surpassed one million inhabitants soon after 1930. During World War II, due to the art treasuries and the presence of the Vatican, Rome largely escaped the tragic destiny of other European cities. However, on 19 July 1943 the [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo district]] was [[Bombing of Rome in World War II|bombed by Anglo-American forces]], resulting in about 3,000 immediate deaths and 11,000 wounded of whom another 1,500 died. Mussolini was arrested on July 25. On the date of the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian Armistice]] 8 September 1943 the city was occupied by the Germans. The Pope declared Rome an [[open city]]. It was liberated on June 4, 1944.\n\nRome developed greatly after the war as part of the \"[[Italian economic miracle]]\" of post-war reconstruction and modernisation in the 1950s and early 1960s. During this period, the years of ''la dolce vita'' (\"the sweet life\"), Rome became a fashionable city, with popular classic films such as ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'', ''[[Quo Vadis (1951 film)|Quo Vadis]]'', ''[[Roman Holiday]]'' and ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' filmed in the city's iconic [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] film studios. The rising trend in population growth continued until the mid-1980s, when the ''comune'' had more than 2.8 million residents. After this, the population declined slowly as people began to move to nearby suburbs.\n\n=== EUR (Esposizione Universale Roma) ===\n\nThe EUR (initial designation R 42) is a residential and business area south of the city center. The region was originally selected in the 1930s as the venue of the 1942 World Fair, which [[Benito Mussolini]] planned to open to celebrate 20 years of [[fascism]]. The letters EUR means ''Esposizione Universale Roma''. The EUR was also designed to direct the expansion of the city to the southwest and the sea and to become a new urban centre in Rome. The final design was presented in 1939 but due to the [[Second World War]] the exhibition never happened and the works stopped in 1942. After the war, the unfinished facilities of the EUR were severely damaged. However, the authorities of Rome decided that the EUR could be the start of an urban business centre, and the unfinished buildings from the fascist era were completed in the 1950s and 1960s. Newer buildings were also built for the use of offices and governmental services, amid large gardens and parks. The EUR was almost fully completed for the [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Olympic Games]].\n\n==Government==\n{{See also|Mayor of Rome|City Council of Rome|Elections in Rome|Administrative subdivision of Rome}}\n\n===Local government===\nRome constitutes a ''[[comune|speciale]]'', named ''\"Roma Capitale\"'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|title=Roma diventa Capitale|accessdate=6 March 2012|language=Italian|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205130517/http://www.comune.roma.it/wps/portal/pcr?contentId=NEW151061&jp_pagecode=newsview.wp&ahew=contentId:jp_pagecode|archivedate=5 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and is the largest both in terms of land area and population among the 8,101 ''comuni'' of Italy.

The needs of the new capital led to an explosion both in the urbanisation and in the population within and outside the [[Aurelian Walls|Aurelian walls]]. In 1874, a fifteenth rione, [[Esquilino (rione of Rome)|Esquilino]], was created on the newly urbanised zone of [[Monti (rione of Rome)|Monti]]. At the beginning of the 20th century other rioni where created (the last one was Prati \u2013 the only one outside the Walls of [[Pope Urban VIII]] \u2013 in 1921). Afterward, for the new administrative subdivisions of the city, the term \"quartiere\" was used. Today all the rioni are part of the first Municipio, which therefore coincides completely with the ''historical city'' (''Centro Storico'').\n\n===Metropolitan and regional government===\nRome is the principal town of the [[Metropolitan City of Rome]], operative since 1 January 2015. The Metropolitan City replaced the old [[Province of Rome|province]], which included the city's metropolitan area and extends further north until [[Civitavecchia]]. The Metropolitan City of Rome is the largest by area in Italy. At {{convert|5352|km2}}, its dimensions are comparable to the region of [[Liguria]]. Moreover, the city is also the capital of the [[Lazio]] region.\n\n===National government===\n[[File:Quirinale palazzo e obelico con dioscuri Roma.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palazzo del Quirinale]], now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]]]\nRome is the national capital of Italy and is the seat of the [[Politics of Italy|Italian Government]]. The official residences of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]] and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]], the seats of both houses of the [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliament]] and that of the [[Constitutional Court of Italy|Italian Constitutional Court]] are located in the historic centre. The state ministries are spread out around the city; these include the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which is located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] near the Olympic stadium.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nRome is in the [[Lazio]] region of [[central Italy]] on the [[Tiber]] ({{lang-it|Tevere}}) river. The original settlement developed on hills that faced onto a ford beside the [[Tiber Island]], the only natural ford of the river in this area. The Rome of the Kings was built on seven hills: the [[Aventine Hill]], the [[Caelian Hill]], the [[Capitoline Hill]], the [[Esquiline Hill]], the [[Palatine Hill]], the [[Quirinal Hill]], and the [[Viminal Hill]]. Modern Rome is also crossed by another river, the [[Aniene]], which flows into the Tiber north of the historic centre.\n\nAlthough the city centre is about {{convert|24|km|mi|0}} inland from the [[Tyrrhenian Sea]], the city territory extends to the shore, where the south-western district of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]] is located. The altitude of the central part of Rome ranges from {{convert|13|m|0}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] (at the base of the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]]) to {{convert|139|m|0}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (the peak of [[Monte Mario]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ravaglioli |first1=Armando |title=Roma anno 2750 ab Urbe condita |publisher=Tascabili Economici Newton |year=1997 |location=Rome |language=Italian |isbn=978-88-8183-670-3}}</ref> The ''Comune'' of Rome covers an overall area of about {{convert|1285|km2|0}}, including many green areas.\n\n===Topography===\n[[File:Satellite view of Rome 2001.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Rome]]\n[[File:Roma dall'aereo.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Rome]]\nThroughout the history of Rome, the urban limits of the city were considered to be the area within the city's  walls. Originally, these consisted of the [[Servian Wall]], which was built twelve years after the [[Gaul]]ish sack of the city in 390 BC. This contained most of the Esquiline and Caelian hills, as well as the whole of the other five. Rome outgrew the Servian Wall, but no more walls were constructed until almost 700 years later, when, in 270 AD, Emperor [[Aurelian]] began building the [[Aurelian Walls]]. These were almost {{convert |19|km|0}} long, and were still the walls the troops of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] had to breach to enter the city in 1870. The city's urban area is cut in two by its ring-road, the ''[[Grande Raccordo Anulare]]'' (\"GRA\"), finished in 1962, which circles the city centre at a distance of about {{convert|10|km|0|abbr=on}}. Although when the ring was completed most parts of the inhabited area lay inside it (one of the few exceptions was the former village of [[Ostia (Rome)|Ostia]], which lies along the Tyrrhenian coast), in the meantime quarters have been built which extend up to {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} beyond it.\n\nThe ''comune'' covers an area roughly three times the total area within the ''Raccordo'' and is comparable in area to the entire metropolitan cities of [[Milan]] and [[Naples]], and to an area six times the size of the territory of these cities. It also includes considerable areas of abandoned marsh land which is suitable neither for agriculture nor for urban development.\n\nAs a consequence, the density of the ''comune'' is not that high, its territory being divided between highly urbanised areas and areas designated as parks, [[nature reserves]], and for agricultural use.\n\n==Climate==\n{{Main|Climate of Rome}}\nRome has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Csa''),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |title=World Map of K\u00f6ppen\u2212Geiger Climate Classification |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906034159/http://koeppen-geiger.vu-wien.ac.at/ |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> with hot, dry summers and cool-mild, humid winters.\n\nIts average annual temperature is above {{convert|20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|10|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} at night.

Before the arrival of the Christians in Rome, the [[Religion in ancient Rome|Religio Romana]] (literally, the \"Roman Religion\") was the major religion of the city in classical antiquity. The first gods held sacred by the Romans were [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], the most high, and [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], god of war, and father of Rome's twin founders, [[Romulus and Remus]], according to tradition. Other gods and goddesses such as [[Vesta (mythology)|Vesta]] and [[Minerva]] were honoured. Rome was also the base of several mystery cults, such as [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithraism]]. Later, after [[Saint Peter|St Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|St Paul]] were martyred in the city, and the first Christians began to arrive, Rome became Christian, and the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] was constructed in 313 AD. Despite some interruptions (such as the [[Avignon Papacy|Avignon papacy]]), Rome has for centuries been the home of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Pope|Bishop of Rome]], otherwise known as the Pope.\n[[File:Roma - 2016-05-23 - Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore - 2957.jpg|thumb|left|[[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], one of the four papal [[major basilica]]s and has numerous architectural styles, built between the 4th century and 1743]]\nDespite the fact that Rome is home to the [[Vatican City]] and St. Peter's Basilica, Rome's cathedral is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]], in the south-east of the city centre. There are around 900 churches in Rome in total. Aside from the cathedral itself, some others of note include: the [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore]], the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]], the [[Basilica di San Clemente]], [[San Carlo alle Quattro Fontane]] and the [[Church of the Gesu|Church of the Ges\u00f9]]. There are also the ancient [[Catacombs of Rome]] underneath the city. Numerous highly important religious educational institutions are also in Rome, such as the [[Pontifical Lateran University]], [[Pontifical Biblical Institute]], [[Pontifical Gregorian University]], and [[Pontifical Oriental Institute]].\n\nIn recent years, there has been growth in Rome's [[Muslim]] community, mainly due to immigration from North Africa and the Middle East into the city.{{clarify |date=June 2017 |reason= How many Muslim migrants came; how many are living in Rome today?}} As a result of this increase of the local practitioners of the [[Islam]]ic faith, the ''comune'' promoted the building of the [[Mosque of Rome]], which is the largest mosque in [[Western Europe]], designed by architect [[Paolo Portoghesi]] and inaugurated on 21 June 1995. Since the end of the [[Roman Republic]], Rome is also the centre of an important [[Jewish]] community,<ref>Coarelli, p. 308.</ref> which was once based in [[Trastevere]], and later in the [[Roman Ghetto]]. There lies also the major synagogue in Rome, the ''[[Great Synagogue of Rome|Tempio Maggiore]]''.\n\n===Vatican City===\n{{Main|Vatican City}}\n{{wide image|Vatikan Kolonaden Petersdom.jpg|1000px|alt=Panorama of St. Peter's Square|[[St. Peter's Square]] in Vatican City}}\nThe territory of Vatican City is part of the ''Mons Vaticanus'' ([[Vatican Hill]]), and of the adjacent former Vatican Fields, where [[St. Peter's Basilica]], the [[Apostolic Palace]], the [[Sistine Chapel]], and museums were built, along with various other buildings. The area was part of the Roman [[rione]] of [[Borgo (rione of Rome)|Borgo]] until 1929. Being separated from the city on the west bank of the [[Tiber]], the area was a suburb that was protected by being included within the walls of [[Pope Leo IV|Leo IV]], later expanded by the current fortification walls of [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]], [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]], and [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]].\n\nWhen the [[Lateran Treaty]] of 1929 that created the Vatican state was being prepared, the boundaries of the proposed territory were influenced by the fact that much of it was all but enclosed by this loop. For some parts of the border there was no wall, but the line of certain buildings supplied part of the boundary, and for a small part a new wall was constructed.\n\nThe territory includes [[Saint Peter's Square]], separated from the territory of Italy only by a white line along the limit of the square, where it borders Piazza Pio XII. St. Peter's Square is reached through the [[Via della Conciliazione]], which runs from the Tiber to St. Peter's. This grand approach was designed by architects [[Marcello Piacentini|Piacentini]] and Spaccarelli, on the instructions of [[Benito Mussolini]] and in accordance with the church, after the conclusion of the [[Lateran Treaty]]. According to the Treaty, certain [[properties of the Holy See]] located in Italian territory, most notably the [[Papal Palace of Castel Gandolfo]] and the [[major basilica]]s, enjoy extraterritorial status similar to that of foreign [[Diplomatic mission|embassies]].\n\n===[[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrimage]]===\n[[File:Petersdom bei Nacht Via della Conciliazione in Rome.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|right|St. Peter's Basilica at night from [[Via della Conciliazione]] in Rome]]\nRome has been a major [[Christian pilgrimage]] site since the Middle Ages. People from all over the [[Christian world]] visit Vatican City, within the city of Rome, the seat of the papacy. The Pope was the most influential figure during the Middle Ages. The city became a major [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] site during the [[Middle Ages]] and the focus of struggles between the Papacy and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] starting with [[Charlemagne]], who was crowned its first emperor in Rome in 800 by [[Pope Leo III]]. Apart from brief periods as an independent city during the [[Middle Ages]], Rome kept its status as Papal capital and \"holy city\" for centuries, even when the Papacy [[Avignon papacy|briefly relocated]] to [[Avignon]] (1309\u20131377). Catholics believe that the Vatican is the last resting place of St. Peter.\n\n[[Christian pilgrimage|Pilgrimages]] to Rome can involve visits to many sites, both within Vatican City and in Italian territory. A popular stopping point is the [[scala sancta|Pilate's stairs]]: these are, according to the Christian tradition, the steps that led up to the [[praetorium]] of [[Pontius Pilate]] in [[Jerusalem]], which [[Jesus Christ]] stood on during his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] on his way to trial.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1554541/Steps-Jesus-walked-to-trial-restored-to-glory.html|title=Steps Jesus walked to trial restored to glory|last=Moore|first=Malcolm|date=2007-06-13|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2019-08-22|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref> The stairs were, reputedly, brought to Rome by [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] in the 4th Century. For centuries, the ''Scala Santa'' has attracted [[Christian pilgrimage|Christian pilgrims]] who wished to honour the Passion of Jesus. Object of [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrimage]] are also several catacombs built in the Roman age, in which Christians prayed, buried their dead and performed worship during periods of persecution, and various national churches (among them [[San Luigi dei francesi]] and [[Santa Maria dell'Anima]]), or churches associated with individual religious orders, such as the Jesuit Churches of Jesus and Sant'Ignazio.\n\nTraditionally, [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] in Rome and Roman citizens thanking God for a grace should visit by foot the [[Seven Pilgrim Churches of Rome|seven pilgrim churches]] ({{lang-it|Le sette chiese}}) in 24 hours. This custom, mandatory for each [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrim]] in the Middle Ages, was codified in the 16th century by Saint [[Philip Neri]]. The seven churches are the four major Basilicas ([[Basilica of St Peter|St Peter in Vatican]], [[St Paul outside the Walls]], [[St John in Lateran]] and [[Santa Maria Maggiore]]), while the other three are [[San Lorenzo fuori le mura]] (a palaeochristian Basilica), [[Santa Croce in Gerusalemme]] (a church founded by [[Helena (empress)|Helena]], the mother of Constantine, which hosts fragments of wood attributed to the holy cross) and [[San Sebastiano fuori le mura]] (which lies on the [[Appian Way]] and is built above [[Catacombs of San Sebastiano|Roman catacombs]]).\n\n==Cityscape==\n{{See also|List of tourist attractions in Rome|List of streets in Rome}}\n\n===Architecture===\n{{Main|Architecture of Rome|Churches of Rome}}\n[[File:ThePantheon.jpg|thumb|The [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], built as a temple dedicated to \"all the gods of the past, present and future\"]]\n[[File:Colosseo Romano Rome 04 2016 6289.jpg|thumb|The [[Colosseum]] is still today the largest [[amphitheater]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|title=Colosseum: The Largest Amphitheatre|work=Guinnesworldrecords.com|date=March 6, 2013|access-date=12 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141027170257/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/records-3000/largest-amphitheatre/|archive-date=27 October 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was used for [[gladiator]] shows and other public events (hunting shows, recreations of famous battles and dramas based on classical mythology).]]\n\nRome's architecture over the centuries has greatly developed, especially from the Classical and Imperial Roman styles to modern [[Fascist architecture]]. Rome was for a period one of the world's main epicentres of classical architecture, developing new forms such as the [[arch]], the [[dome]] and the [[vault (architecture)|vault]].<ref name=\"Eyewitness\">Eyewitness Travel (2006), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries was also widely used in Roman architecture, and later the city became one of the main centres of [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and neoclassic architecture.<ref name=\"Eyewitness\"/>\n\n====Ancient Rome====\n{{Main|List of ancient monuments in Rome|Ancient Roman architecture}}\nOne of the symbols of Rome is the [[Colosseum]] (70\u201380 AD), the largest [[amphitheatre]] ever built in the Roman Empire. Originally capable of seating 60,000 spectators, it was used for [[gladiator]]ial combat. A list of important monuments and sites of ancient Rome includes the [[Roman Forum]], the [[Domus Aurea]], the [[Pantheon, Rome|Pantheon]], [[Trajan's Column]], [[Trajan's Market]], the [[Catacombs of Rome|Catacombs]], the [[Circus Maximus]], the [[Baths of Caracalla]], [[Castel Sant'Angelo]], the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], the [[Ara Pacis]], the [[Arch of Constantine]], the [[Pyramid of Cestius]], and the [[Bocca della Verit\u00e0]].\n\n====Medieval====\nThe medieval popular quarters of the city, situated mainly around the Capitol, were largely demolished between the end of the 19th century and the fascist period, but many notable buildings still remain. Basilicas dating from the [[Early Christianity|Christian antiquity]] include [[Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore|Saint Mary Major]] and [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls|Saint Paul outside the Walls]] (the latter largely rebuilt in the 19th century), both housing precious 4th century AD mosaics. Notable later notable medieval mosaics and frescoes can be also found in the churches of [[Santa Maria in Trastevere]], [[Santi Quattro Coronati]], and [[Santa Prassede]]. Secular buildings include a number of towers, the largest being the [[Torre delle Milizie]] and the [[Torre dei Conti]], both next the Roman Forum, and the huge outdoor stairway  leading up to the basilica of [[Santa Maria in Aracoeli|Santa Maria in Ara Coeli]].\n\n====Renaissance and Baroque====\nRome was a major world centre of the [[Renaissance]], second only to Florence, and was profoundly affected by the movement. Among others, a masterpiece of [[Renaissance architecture]] in Rome is the Piazza del Campidoglio by [[Michelangelo]]. During this period, the great aristocratic families of Rome used to build opulent dwellings as the [[Quirinal Palace|Palazzo del Quirinale]] (now seat of the [[President of Italy|President of the Italian Republic]]), the [[Palazzo Venezia]], the [[Palazzo Farnese]], the [[Palazzo Barberini]], the [[Palazzo Chigi]] (now seat of the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]]), the [[Palazzo Spada]], the [[Palazzo della Cancelleria]], and the [[Villa Farnesina]].\n\n{{wide image|Piazza del Campidoglio panoramic view 39948px.jpg|800px|align-cap=center|Panoramic view of [[Piazza del Campidoglio]], with a copy of the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]]}}\n\nMany of the famous city's squares \u2013 some huge, majestic and often adorned with [[List of obelisks in Rome|obelisks]], some small and picturesque \u2013 got their present shape during the Renaissance and Baroque. The principal ones are [[Piazza Navona]], [[Spanish Steps|Piazza di Spagna]], [[Campo de' Fiori]], [[Piazza Venezia]], [[Palazzo Farnese, Rome|Piazza Farnese]], [[Pantheon, Rome|Piazza della Rotonda]] and [[Santa Maria sopra Minerva|Piazza della Minerva]]. One of the most emblematic examples of Baroque art is the [[Trevi Fountain|Fontana di Trevi]] by [[Nicola Salvi]]. Other notable 17th-century [[baroque architecture|baroque palaces]] are the [[Palazzo Madama]], now the seat of the [[Italian Senate]] and the [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], now the seat of the [[Italian Chamber of Deputies|Chamber of Deputies of Italy]].\n\n====Neoclassicism====\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Altare della Patria]]]]\nIn 1870, Rome became the capital city of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]]. During this time, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]], a building style influenced by the architecture of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], became a predominant influence in [[Architecture of ancient Rome|Roman architecture]]. During this period, many great palaces in neoclassical styles were built to host ministries, embassies, and other governing agencies. One of the best-known symbols of Roman neoclassicism is the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II|Monument of Vittorio Emanuele II]] or \"Altar of the Fatherland\", where the [[Monument to Vittorio Emanuele II#Unknown soldier|Grave of the Unknown Soldier]], that represents the 650,000 Italians that fell in World War I, is located.\n\n====Fascist architecture====\n[[File:Palazzo della civilt\u00e0 del lavoro (EUR, Rome) (5904657870).jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]]]]\n{{See also|Fascist architecture}}\n\nThe Fascist regime that ruled in Italy between 1922 and 1943 had its showcase in Rome. Mussolini allowed the construction of new roads and piazzas, resulting in the destruction of roads, houses, churches and palaces erected during the papal rule. The main activities during his government were: the \"isolation\" of the [[Capitoline Hill]]; Via dei Monti, later renamed Via del'Impero, and finally [[Via dei Fori Imperiali]]; Via del Mare, later renamed Via del [[Teatro di Marcello]]; the \"isolation\" of the [[Mausoleum of Augustus]], with the erection of Piazza Augusto Imperatore; [[Via della Conciliazione]].\n\nArchitecturally, Fascism favored the most modern movements, such as [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalism]]. Parallel to this, in the 1920s another style emerged, named \"Stile Novecento\", characterised by its links with ancient Roman architecture. One important construction in the latter style is the Foro Mussolini, now [[Foro Italico]], by [[Enrico Del Debbio]]. Next to it, the most important Fascist site in Rome is the [[EUR, Rome|EUR]] district, designed in 1938 by [[Marcello Piacentini]]. This new quarter emerged as a compromise between Rationalist and Novecento architects, the former being led by [[Giuseppe Pagano]]. The EUR was originally conceived for the [[Esposizione universale (1942)|1942 world exhibition]], and was called \"E.42\" (''\"Esposizione 42\"''). The most representative buildings of EUR are the [[Palazzo della Civilt\u00e0 Italiana]] (1938\u20131943), the iconic design of which has been labelled the cubic of Square Colosseum, and the [[Palazzo dei Congressi]], example of Rationalist style. The world exhibition, however, never took place because Italy entered the Second World War in 1940, and the realised buildings were partly destroyed in 1943 during the fighting between Italian and German army after the armistice and later abandoned. The quarter was restored in the 1950s, when the Roman authorities found that they already had the seed of an off-centre business district of the type that other capitals were still planning ([[London Docklands]] and [[La D\u00e9fense]] in Paris). Also, the [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], the current seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], was designed in 1935 in pure Fascist style.\n\n===Parks and gardens===\n[[File:Rome-VillaBorghese-TempleEsculape.jpg|thumb|The [[Temple of Aesculapius (Villa Borghese)|Temple of Aesculapius]], in the gardens of the [[Villa Borghese]]]]\n{{Main|List of parks and gardens in Rome}}\nPublic parks and nature reserves cover a large area in Rome, and the city has one of the largest areas of green space among European capitals.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080204030918/http://www.romaperkyoto.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=35&Itemid=52 |archivedate=4 February 2008 |title=Green Areas |publisher=RomaPerKyoto.org |accessdate=9 November 2008 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The most notable part of this green space is represented by the large number of villas and landscaped gardens created by the Italian aristocracy. While most of the parks surrounding the villas were destroyed during the building boom of the late 19th century, some of them remain. The most notable of these are [[Villa Borghese gardens|Villa Borghese]], [[Villa Ada]], and [[Villa Doria Pamphili]]. Villa Doria Pamphili is west of the Gianicolo hill comprising some {{convert|1.8|km2|1|abbr=out|lk=out}}. Also on the Gianicolo hill there is [[Villa Sciarra (Rome)|Villa Sciarra]], with playgrounds for children and shaded walking areas. In the nearby area of Trastevere the [[Orto Botanico dell'Universit\u00e0 di Roma \"La Sapienza\"|Orto Botanico]] (Botanical Garden) is a cool and shady green space. The old Roman hippodrome (Circus Maximus) is another large green space: it has few trees, but is overlooked by the Palatine and the Rose Garden ('roseto comunale'). Nearby is the lush [[Villa Celimontana]], close to the gardens surrounding the Baths of Caracalla. The Villa Borghese garden is the best known large green space in Rome, with famous art galleries among its shaded walks. Overlooking [[Piazza del Popolo]] and the Spanish Steps are the gardens of [[Pincio]] and [[Villa Medici]]. Noteworthy is also the Pine wood of [[Castelfusano]], near Ostia. Rome also has a number of regional parks of much more recent origin including the [[Pineto Regional Park]] and the Appian Way Regional Park. There are also nature reserves at Marcigliana and at Tenuta di Castelporziano.\n\n===Fountains and aqueducts===\n{{Main|List of fountains in Rome|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}\n[[File:Fontana di Trevi Rome 04 2016 6768.jpg|thumb|The [[Trevi Fountain]]. Construction began during the time of Ancient Rome and was completed in 1762 by a design of [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]].]]\nRome is a city famous for its numerous fountains, built in all different styles, from Classical and Medieval, to Baroque and Neoclassical. The city has had [[fountain]]s for more than two thousand years, and they have provided drinking water and decorated the [[piazza]]s of Rome. During the [[Roman Empire]], in 98 AD, according to [[Sextus Julius Frontinus]], the Roman consul who was named ''curator aquarum'' or guardian of the water of the city, Rome had nine [[aqueduct (watercourse)|aqueducts]] which fed 39 monumental fountains and 591 public basins, not counting the water supplied to the Imperial household, baths, and owners of private villas. Each of the major fountains was connected to two different aqueducts, in case one was shut down for service.<ref>Frontin, Les Aqueducs de la ville de Rome, translation and commentary by Pierre Grimal, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00e9dition Les Belles Lettres, Paris, 1944.</ref>\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, the Roman popes reconstructed other ruined Roman aqueducts and built new display fountains to mark their termini, launching the golden age of the Roman fountain. The fountains of Rome, like the paintings of [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], were expressions of the new style of Baroque art. They were crowded with allegorical figures, and filled with emotion and movement.

These are usually ancient statues which have become popular soapboxes for political and social discussion, and places for people to (often satirically) voice their opinions. There are two main talking statues: the [[Pasquino]] and the [[Marforio]], yet there are four other noted ones: [[il Babuino]], [[Madama Lucrezia]], [[il Facchino]] and [[Abbot Luigi]]. Most of these statues are ancient Roman or classical, and most of them also depict mythical gods, ancient people or legendary figures; il Pasquino represents [[Menelaus]], Abbot Luigi is an unknown Roman magistrate, il Babuino is supposed to be [[Silenus]], [[Marforio]] represents [[Oceanus]], Madama Lucrezia is a bust of [[Isis]], and [[il Facchino]] is the only non-Roman statue, created in 1580, and not representing anyone in particular. They are often, due to their status, covered with placards or [[graffiti]] expressing political ideas and points of view. Other statues in the city, which are not related to the talking statues, include those of the Ponte Sant'Angelo, or several monuments scattered across the city, such as that to [[Giordano Bruno]] in the Campo de'Fiori.\n\n===Obelisks and columns===\n{{Main|List of obelisks in Rome}}\n[[File:Piazza del Popolo Obelisco Flaminio a Roma.jpg|thumb|An ancient Egyptian obelisk in [[Piazza del Popolo]]]]\n\nThe city hosts eight [[ancient Egypt]]ian and five [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[obelisk]]s, together with a number of more modern obelisks; there was also formerly (until 2005) an [[Aksumite Empire|ancient Ethiopian]] obelisk in Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |title=Chasing Obelisks in Rome |publisher=Initaly.com |accessdate=3 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206125357/http://initaly.com/regions/classic/obelisks.htm |archivedate=6 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The city contains some of obelisks in [[piazza]]s, such as in [[Piazza Navona]], [[Saint Peter's Square|St Peter's Square]], [[Piazza di Monte Citorio|Piazza Montecitorio]], and [[Piazza del Popolo]], and others in [[villa]]s, [[thermae]] parks and gardens, such as in [[Villa Mattei|Villa Celimontana]], the [[Baths of Diocletian]], and the [[Pincian Hill]].

Though most famous for Christian burials, they include [[Religion in ancient Rome|pagan]] and Jewish burials, either in separate catacombs or mixed together. The first large-scale catacombs were excavated from the 2nd century onwards. Originally they were carved through [[tuff]], a soft [[volcanic rock]], outside the boundaries of the city, because [[Roman law]] forbade burial places within city limits. Currently, maintenance of the catacombs is in the hands of the [[Pope|Papacy]] which has invested in the [[Salesians of Don Bosco]] the supervision of the Catacombs of St. Callixtus on the outskirts of Rome.\n\n==Economy==\nAs the capital of Italy, Rome hosts all the principal institutions of the nation, including the Presidency of the Republic, the government (and its single Ministeri), the Parliament, the main judicial Courts, and the diplomatic representatives of all the countries for the states of Italy and Vatican City.

Rome became a major gastronomical centre during the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Age]]. [[Ancient Roman cuisine]] was highly influenced by Ancient Greek culture, and after, the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new, provincial culinary habits and cooking techniques. Later, during the [[Renaissance]], Rome became well known as a centre of high-cuisine, since some of the best chefs of the time worked for the popes. An example of this was [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], who was a chef working for [[Pope Pius IV|Pius IV]] in the Vatican kitchen, and he acquired fame in 1570 when his cookbook ''Opera dell'arte del cucinare'' was published. In the book he lists approximately 1000 recipes of the Renaissance [[cuisine]] and describes cooking techniques and tools, giving the first known picture of a [[fork]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Rolland | first=Jacques | title=The food encyclopedia | publisher=Robert Rose | location=Toronto | year=2006 | isbn=0-7788-0150-0 | oclc=70176309 | page=273}}</ref> <br /> In the modern age, the city developed its own peculiar cuisine, based on products of the nearby [[Roman Campagna|Campagna]], as lamb and vegetables ([[artichoke|globe artichokes]] are common).<ref>{{cite book | title=Culinaria Italy | first=Claudia | last=Piras | publisher=Culinaria Konemann | year=2000 | isbn=3-8290-2901-2 | oclc=881159457 | page=291}}</ref> In parallel, Roman Jews \u2013 present in the city since the 1st century BC \u2013 developed their own cuisine, the ''cucina giudaico-romanesca''.

In the 1950s, Cinecitt\u00e0 was the filming location for several large American film productions, and subsequently became the studio most closely associated with [[Federico Fellini]]. Today, Cinecitt\u00e0 is the only studio in the world with pre-production, production, and full post-production facilities on one lot, allowing directors and producers to walk in with their script and \"walk out\" with a completed film.\n\n===Language===\n{{Main|Roman dialect|Latin}}\n[[File:DM TI Claudius Tiberinus.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Latin]] inscription, [[National Roman Museum]]]]\nAlthough associated today only with Latin, ancient Rome was in fact multilingual. In highest antiquity, [[Sabine]] tribes shared the area of what is today Rome with Latin tribes. The Sabine language was one of the [[Italic languages|Italic]] group of ancient Italian languages, along with Etruscan, which would have been the main language of the last three kings who ruled the city till the founding of the Republic in 509 BC. Urganilla, or [[Plautia Urgulanilla]], wife of Emperor Claudius, is thought to have been a speaker of Etruscan many centuries after this date, according to Suetonius' entry on Claudius. However Latin, in various evolving forms, was the main language of classical Rome, but as the city had immigrants, slaves, residents, ambassadors from many parts of the world it was also multilingual. Many educated Romans also spoke Greek, and there was a large Greek, Syriac and Jewish population in parts of Rome from well before the Empire.\n\n[[Latin]] evolved during the Middle Ages into a new language, the \"''volgare''\". The latter emerged as the confluence of various regional dialects, among which the [[Tuscan language|Tuscan dialect]] predominated, but the population of Rome also developed its own dialect, the [[Romanesco dialect|Romanesco]]. The ''Romanesco'' spoken during the Middle Ages was more like a southern Italian dialect, very close to the [[Neapolitan language]] in [[Campania]]. The influence of the [[Florence|Florentine]] culture during the [[renaissance]], and above all, the immigration to Rome of many Florentines following the two [[House of Medici|Medici]] Popes ([[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]]), caused a major shift in the dialect, which began to resemble more the Tuscan varieties. This remained largely confined to Rome until the 19th century, but then expanded to other zones of [[Lazio]] ([[Civitavecchia]], [[Latina, Lazio|Latina]] and others), from the beginning of the 20th century, thanks to the rising population of Rome and to improving transportation systems. As a consequence of education and media like radio and television, Romanesco became more similar to standard Italian. Dialectal literature in the traditional form of Romanesco includes the works of such authors as [[Giuseppe Gioachino Belli]] (one of the most important Italian poets altogether), [[Trilussa]] and [[Cesare Pascarella]]. It is worth remembering though that Romanesco was a \"''lingua vernacola''\"  (vernacular language), meaning that for centuries, it did not have a written form but it was only spoken by the population.\n\nContemporary Romanesco is mainly represented by popular actors and actresses, such as [[Alberto Sordi]], [[Aldo Fabrizi]], [[Anna Magnani]]. [[Carlo Verdone]], [[Enrico Montesano]], [[Gigi Proietti]] and [[Nino Manfredi]].\n\nRome's historic contribution to language in a worldwide sense is much more extensive however. Through the process of [[Romanization (cultural)|Romanization]], the peoples of Italy, [[Gallia]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and [[Dacia]] developed languages which derive directly from Latin and were adopted in large areas of the world, all through cultural influence, colonization and migration. Moreover, also modern English, because of the [[Norman Conquest]], borrowed a large percentage of its vocabulary from the Latin language. The [[Latin alphabet|Roman or Latin alphabet]] is the most widely used writing system in the world used by the greatest number of languages.<ref>Ostler, N. (2007), ''Ad Infinitum: A Biography of Latin''. London: HarperCollins</ref>\n\nRome has long hosted artistic communities, foreign resident communities and many foreign religious students or [[Christian pilgrimage|pilgrims]] and so has always been a multilingual city. Today because of mass tourism, many languages are used in servicing tourism, especially English which is widely known in tourist areas, and the city hosts large numbers of immigrants and so has many multilingual immigrant areas.\n\n==Sports==\n[[File:Stadio Olimpico 2008.JPG|thumb|[[Stadio Olimpico]], home of [[A.S.

The main harbour which serves Rome is [[Port of Civitavecchia]], located about {{convert|62|km|abbr=off}} northwest of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Porti di Roma|url=http://www.port-of-rome.org/|accessdate=6 March 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150307140526/http://www.port-of-rome.org/|archivedate=7 March 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe city suffers from traffic problems largely due to this radial street pattern, making it difficult for Romans to move easily from the vicinity of one of the radial roads to another without going into the historic centre or using the ring-road. These problems are not helped by the limited size of Rome's metro system when compared to other cities of similar size. In addition, Rome has only 21 taxis for every 10,000 inhabitants, far below other major European cities.<ref>{{cite news |title=Central Rome Streets Blocked by Taxi Drivers |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=10 February 2008 |first=Peter |last=Kiefer |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417112759/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/30/world/europe/30rome.html?scp=93&sq=Rome&st=nyt |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Chronic congestion caused by cars during the 1970s and 1980s led to restrictions being placed on vehicle access to the inner city-centre during the hours of daylight. Areas where these restriction apply are known as Limited Traffic Zones (''Zona a Traffico Limitato'' (ZTL) in Italian). More recently, heavy night-time traffic in [[Trastevere]], [[Testaccio]] and [[Quartiere San Lorenzo|San Lorenzo]] has led to the creation of night-time ZTLs in those districts.\n\n[[File:Roma Metropolitana e Ferrovia 2012.png|thumb|Roma Metrorail and Underground map, 2016]]\n[[File:Inaugurazione metro B1.jpg|thumb|[[Conca d'Oro (Rome Metro)|Conca d'Oro]] metro station]]\nA 3-line metro system called the ''[[Rome Metro|Metropolitana]]'' operates in Rome.

The event never took place because of war, but the area was later partly redesigned and renamed [[Esposizione Universale Roma|EUR]] (Esposizione Universale di Roma: Rome Universal Exhibition) in the 1950s to serve as a modern business district. The line was finally opened in 1955, and it is now the south part of the B Line.\n\nThe A line opened in 1980 from Ottaviano to Anagnina stations, later extended in stages (1999\u20132000) to Battistini. In the 1990s, an extension of the B line was opened from Termini to Rebibbia. This underground network is generally reliable (although it may become very congested at peak times and during events, especially the A line) as it is relatively short.\n\nThe A and B lines intersect at Roma Termini station. A new branch of the B line (B1) opened on 13 June 2012 after an estimated building cost of \u20ac500&nbsp;million. B1 connects to line B at Piazza Bologna and has four stations over a distance of {{convert|3.9|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nA third line, the C line, is under construction with an estimated cost of \u20ac3&nbsp;billion and will have 30 stations over a distance of {{convert|25.5|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}.

The Vatican is an enclave of the Italian [[capital city]] and a sovereign possession of the [[Holy See]], which is the Diocese of Rome and the supreme government of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Rome therefore hosts foreign embassies to the Italian government, to the Holy See,  to the  [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta|Order of Malta]] and to certain international organizations. Several international [[Roman Colleges]] and [[Pontifical Universities in Rome|Pontifical Universities]] are located in Rome.\n\nThe Pope is the [[Bishop of Rome]] and its official seat is the [[Archbasilica of Saint John Lateran]] (of which the [[President of the French Republic]] is ''[[ex officio]]'' the \"first and only [[Honorary canons|honorary canon]]\", a title held by the heads of the French state since [[King Henry IV of France]]). Another body, the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] (SMOM), took refuge in Rome in 1834, due to the conquest of Malta by [[Napoleon]] in 1798. It is sometimes classified as having sovereignty but does not claim any territory in Rome or anywhere else, hence leading to dispute over its actual sovereign status.\n\nRome is the seat of the so-called '''Polo Romano'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402143221/http://www.parlamento.it/application/xmanager/projects/parlamento/file/repository/affariinternazionali/osservatorio/approfondimenti/PI0093.pdf|url-status=dead|title=parlamento.it|archivedate=2 April 2015}}</ref> made up by three main international agencies of the [[United Nations]]: the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] (FAO), the [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD).\n\nRome has traditionally been involved in the process of European political integration. The [[Treaties of the EU]] are located in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]], seat of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], due the fact that the Italian government is the depositary of the treaties. In 1957 the city hosted the signing of the [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], which established the [[European Economic Community]] (predecessor to the [[European Union]]), and also played host to the official signing of the proposed [[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe|European Constitution]] in July 2004.\n\nRome is the seat of the [[European Olympic Committee]] and of the [[NATO Defense College]]. The city is the place where the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Statute of the International Criminal Court]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] were formulated.\n\nThe city hosts also other important international entities such as the [[IDLO]] (International Development Law Organisation), the [[ICCROM]] (International Centre for the Study of the Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property) and the [[UNIDROIT]] (International Institute for the Unification of Private Law).\n\n==International relations==\n\n===Twin towns and sister cities===\n{{See

{"title_page": "Redistribution (Australia)", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=July 2012}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=September 2015}}\nIn Australia, a '''redistribution''' is the process of redrawing the [[Boundary delimitation|boundaries]] of electoral divisions to reflect changes in population and changes in the number of representatives. The [[Australian Electoral Commission]], an independent [[statutory authority]], oversees the redistribution process for federal elections, taking into account many factors.<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/Overview.htm AEC - Redistribution overview]</ref> Politicians, political parties and the public may make submissions to the AEC on proposed new boundaries, but any interference with their deliberations is considered a serious offence.\n\nSection 24 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] specifies that the number of members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in each state is to be calculated from their population, although a minimum of five members is guaranteed for each state regardless of population. This minimum condition is only met by Tasmania, the smallest state. Representation of territories has been specified by subsequent laws. After the number of members for each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] is determined, in a process called apportionment or determination, the state and territory is divided into that number of [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|electoral divisions]].\n\nA redistribution (sometimes called redrawing or \"revision\")<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9119574|title=Advertising.|date=27 March 1886|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|accessdate=2 July 2013|location=Hobart, Tasmania|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> of the geographic boundaries of divisions in a state or territory takes place when an apportionment determination results in a change in the number of seats to which a state or territory is entitled, at least once every seven years, or sooner when the AEC determines that population shifts within a state or territory have caused some seats to have too many or too few voters. The ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' requires that all electoral divisions within a state or territory have approximately an equal numbers of [[Electoral register|enrolled voters]]. The ''Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973'' reduced the allowed variation of electors in each division to 10% of the state or territory's average, down from 20%.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cea21973260/s4.html Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973, s.4]</ref>  New boundaries apply only to general elections held after the redistribution process has been completed, and by-elections are held on the previous electoral boundaries.\n\nEach state and territory has its own commission which follows similar but not identical processes and principles for determining electoral boundaries and conducting elections within their jurisdiction, and those of local governments.\n\n==Total number of members==\nSection 24 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] requires that the total number of members of the Australian House of Representatives shall be \"as nearly as practicable\" twice as many as the number of members of the [[Australian Senate]]. There is presently a total of 76 senators: 12 senators from each of the six states and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]). After the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]] there will be 151 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe total number of members of the Australian House of Representatives, and consequently electorates, has increased from time to time. Every time there is an increase in the number of members, a redistribution is required to be undertaken, except in Tasmania which has always had the constitutional minimum number of five members. At the [[List of Australian electorates contested at every election|first federal election there were 65 members]] of the House of Representatives. In 1949, the number was increased from 74 to 121 (excluding the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory),<ref>http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm</ref> and in 1984 it was increased from 125 to 148.<ref>''Representation Act 1983''</ref> Following the 2017 reapportionment, the total number of members increased from 150 to 151.\n\n==Apportionment of seats to States==\nSection 24 of the Constitution requires that electorates be apportioned among the States in proportion to their respective populations; provided that each original State has at least 5 members in the House of Representatives. Section 29 of the Constitution forbids electorate boundaries from crossing state lines, and the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' sets out further requirements.<ref>Australian Electoral Commission.[http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/publications/Strategy_Research_Analysis/paper4/page03.htm ''Research Report 4 \u2013 Australian Federal Redistributions 1901\u20132003.''] Accessed 5 May 2008.</ref>\n\nThe AEC determines the number of members to which each State and Territory is entitled. The determination is made one year after the first sitting day for a new House of Representatives. A redistribution is postponed if it would begin within one year of the expiration of the House of Representatives, to prevent a general [[Elections in Australia|election]] from occurring while a redistribution is in progress. The population in each State is officially communicated to the AEC by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], which estimates the population about a year after each election.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s46.html Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \u2014 Section 46:  Ascertainment of numbers of people of Commonwealth, States and Territories]</ref>\n\nThe AEC calculates the number of members/divisions for a State as follows:<ref name=Calcs>[http://www.aec.gov.au/electorates/Redistributions/calculating-entitlements.htm Calculating representation entitlements of states and territories]</ref>\n\n: <math> \\mbox{Population quota} = \\frac{\\mbox{Total population of the six States}}{\\mbox{Number of Senators for the States x 2} }</math>\n\n: <math> \\mbox{Number of members in the House of Representatives} = \\frac{\\mbox{Total population of individual State  }}{\\mbox{Population quota} }</math>\n\nThe entitlement of each state is rounded to the nearest whole number. However, each Original State is entitled to a minimum of 5 members, a provision that gives [[Tasmania]] higher representation than its population would justify.

After the redistribution process commences, a Redistribution Committee \u2014 consisting of the [[Electoral Commissioner]], the Australian Electoral Officer for the State concerned (in the ACT, the senior Divisional [[Returning officer]]), the State [[Surveyor General]] and the State [[Auditor General]] \u2014 is formed. The Electoral Commissioner invites [[Public consultation|public suggestions]] on the redistribution which must be lodged within 30 days. A further period of 14 days is allowed for comments on the suggestions lodged. The Redistribution Committee then divides the State or Territory into divisions and publishes its proposed redistribution. A period of 28 days is allowed after publication of the proposed redistribution for written objections. A further period of 14 days is provided for comments on the objections lodged. These objections are considered by an augmented Electoral Commission \u2014 consisting of the four members of the Redistribution Committee and the two part-time members of the Electoral Commission.\n\nAt the time of the redistribution the number of electors in the divisions may vary up to 10% from the 'quota' or average divisional figure but at a point 3.5 years after the expected completion of the redistribution, the figures should not vary from the average projected quota by more or less than 3.5%. Thus the most rapidly growing divisions are generally started with enrolments below the quota while those that are losing population are started above the quota.\n\nNeither the Government nor the Parliament can reject or amend the final determination of the augmented Electoral Commission.\n\n== Management ==\n{{see also|Australian electoral system#Gerrymandering and malapportionment}}\nBoundaries for the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and for the six state and two territorial legislatures are drawn up by independent authorities, at the federal level by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) and in the states and territories by their equivalent bodies. Politicians have no influence over the process, although they, along with any other citizen or organisation, can make submissions to the independent authorities suggesting changes.\n\nThere is significantly less political interference in the redistribution process than is [[Gerrymandering|common in the United States]]. In 1978, federal Cabinet minister [[Reg Withers]] was forced to resign for suggesting to another minister that the name of a federal electorate be changed to suit a political ally.<ref>[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/publications/papers-and-podcasts/cabinet-release/jim-stokes-transcript-78.aspx  National Archives of Australia: Background to the 1978 Cabinet records]. Retrieved 19 November 2014</ref>\n\nThere have been examples of [[malapportionment]] of federal and state electoral districts in the past, often resulting in rural constituencies containing far fewer voters than urban ones and maintaining in power those parties that have rural support despite polling fewer popular votes. Past malapportionments in [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]] and the '[[Playmander]]' in [[South Australia]] were notorious examples of the differences between urban and rural constituency sizes than their population would merit. The Playmander distorted electoral boundaries and policies that kept the [[Liberal and Country League]] in power for 32 years from 1936 to 1968.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120709065419/http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/Democracy%20Conference/JaenschPARTIES.pdf Labor and Liberal Parties, SA, Dean Jaensch], \"A 2:1 ratio of enrolments in favour of the rural areas was in force from 1936.\"</ref> In extreme cases, rural areas had four times the voting value of metropolitan areas. Supporters of such arrangements claimed Australia's urban population dominates the countryside and that these practices gave fair representation to country people.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Naming of divisions==\nThe redistribution, creation and abolition of divisions is the responsibility of the AEC. When new divisions are created, the AEC will select a name. Most divisions are named in honour of prominent historical people, such as former politicians (often [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers]]), explorers, artists and engineers, and rarely for geographic places.\n\nSome of the criteria the AEC uses when naming new divisions are:<ref>Australian Electoral Commission.

The [[Australian Electoral Commission]], an independent statutory authority, oversees the redistribution process for federal elections, taking into account many factors.<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/Overview.htm AEC - Redistribution overview]</ref> Politicians, political parties and the public may make submissions to the AEC on proposed new boundaries, but any interference with their deliberations is considered a serious offence.\n\nSection 24 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] specifies that the number of members of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in each state is to be calculated from their population, although a minimum of five members is guaranteed for each state regardless of population. This minimum condition is only met by Tasmania, the smallest state. Representation of territories has been specified by subsequent laws. After the number of members for each [[States and territories of Australia|state and territory]] is determined, in a process called apportionment or determination, the state and territory is divided into that number of [[Divisions of the Australian House of Representatives|electoral divisions]].\n\nA redistribution (sometimes called redrawing or \"revision\")<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9119574|title=Advertising.|date=27 March 1886|newspaper=[[The Mercury (Hobart)|The Mercury]]|accessdate=2 July 2013|location=Hobart, Tasmania|page=4|via=National Library of Australia}}</ref> of the geographic boundaries of divisions in a state or territory takes place when an apportionment determination results in a change in the number of seats to which a state or territory is entitled, at least once every seven years, or sooner when the AEC determines that population shifts within a state or territory have caused some seats to have too many or too few voters. The ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' requires that all electoral divisions within a state or territory have approximately an equal numbers of [[Electoral register|enrolled voters]]. The ''Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973'' reduced the allowed variation of electors in each division to 10% of the state or territory's average, down from 20%.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/num_act/cea21973260/s4.html Commonwealth Electoral Act (No. 2) 1973, s.4]</ref>  New boundaries apply only to general elections held after the redistribution process has been completed, and by-elections are held on the previous electoral boundaries.\n\nEach state and territory has its own commission which follows similar but not identical processes and principles for determining electoral boundaries and conducting elections within their jurisdiction, and those of local governments.\n\n==Total number of members==\nSection 24 of the [[Constitution of Australia]] requires that the total number of members of the Australian House of Representatives shall be \"as nearly as practicable\" twice as many as the number of members of the [[Australian Senate]]. There is presently a total of 76 senators: 12 senators from each of the six states and two from each of the two autonomous internal territories (the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and the [[Northern Territory]]). After the [[2019 Australian federal election|2019 federal election]] there will be 151 members of the House of Representatives.\n\nThe total number of members of the Australian House of Representatives, and consequently electorates, has increased from time to time. Every time there is an increase in the number of members, a redistribution is required to be undertaken, except in Tasmania which has always had the constitutional minimum number of five members. At the [[List of Australian electorates contested at every election|first federal election there were 65 members]] of the House of Representatives. In 1949, the number was increased from 74 to 121 (excluding the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory),<ref>http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm</ref> and in 1984 it was increased from 125 to 148.<ref>''Representation Act 1983''</ref> Following the 2017 reapportionment, the total number of members increased from 150 to 151.\n\n==Apportionment of seats to States==\nSection 24 of the Constitution requires that electorates be apportioned among the States in proportion to their respective populations; provided that each original State has at least 5 members in the House of Representatives. Section 29 of the Constitution forbids electorate boundaries from crossing state lines, and the ''[[Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918]]'' sets out further requirements.<ref>Australian Electoral Commission.[http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/publications/Strategy_Research_Analysis/paper4/page03.htm ''Research Report 4 \u2013 Australian Federal Redistributions 1901\u20132003.''] Accessed 5 May 2008.</ref>\n\nThe AEC determines the number of members to which each State and Territory is entitled. The determination is made one year after the first sitting day for a new House of Representatives. A redistribution is postponed if it would begin within one year of the expiration of the House of Representatives, to prevent a general [[Elections in Australia|election]] from occurring while a redistribution is in progress. The population in each State is officially communicated to the AEC by the [[Australian Bureau of Statistics]], which estimates the population about a year after each election.<ref>[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/cea1918233/s46.html Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 \u2014 Section 46:  Ascertainment of numbers of people of Commonwealth, States and Territories]</ref>\n\nThe AEC calculates the number of members/divisions for a State as follows:<ref name=Calcs>[http://www.aec.gov.au/electorates/Redistributions/calculating-entitlements.htm Calculating representation entitlements of states and territories]</ref>\n\n: <math> \\mbox{Population quota} = \\frac{\\mbox{Total population of the six States}}{\\mbox{Number of Senators for the States x 2} }</math>\n\n: <math> \\mbox{Number of members in the House of Representatives} = \\frac{\\mbox{Total population of individual State  }}{\\mbox{Population quota} }</math>\n\nThe entitlement of each state is rounded to the nearest whole number.

After the redistribution process commences, a Redistribution Committee \u2014 consisting of the [[Electoral Commissioner]], the Australian Electoral Officer for the State concerned (in the ACT, the senior Divisional [[Returning officer]]), the State [[Surveyor General]] and the State [[Auditor General]] \u2014 is formed. The Electoral Commissioner invites [[Public consultation|public suggestions]] on the redistribution which must be lodged within 30 days. A further period of 14 days is allowed for comments on the suggestions lodged. The Redistribution Committee then divides the State or Territory into divisions and publishes its proposed redistribution. A period of 28 days is allowed after publication of the proposed redistribution for written objections. A further period of 14 days is provided for comments on the objections lodged. These objections are considered by an augmented Electoral Commission \u2014 consisting of the four members of the Redistribution Committee and the two part-time members of the Electoral Commission.\n\nAt the time of the redistribution the number of electors in the divisions may vary up to 10% from the 'quota' or average divisional figure but at a point 3.5 years after the expected completion of the redistribution, the figures should not vary from the average projected quota by more or less than 3.5%. Thus the most rapidly growing divisions are generally started with enrolments below the quota while those that are losing population are started above the quota.\n\nNeither the Government nor the Parliament can reject or amend the final determination of the augmented Electoral Commission.\n\n== Management ==\n{{see also|Australian electoral system#Gerrymandering and malapportionment}}\nBoundaries for the [[Australian House of Representatives]] and for the six state and two territorial legislatures are drawn up by independent authorities, at the federal level by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] (AEC) and in the states and territories by their equivalent bodies. Politicians have no influence over the process, although they, along with any other citizen or organisation, can make submissions to the independent authorities suggesting changes.\n\nThere is significantly less political interference in the redistribution process than is [[Gerrymandering|common in the United States]]. In 1978, federal Cabinet minister [[Reg Withers]] was forced to resign for suggesting to another minister that the name of a federal electorate be changed to suit a political ally.<ref>[http://www.naa.gov.au/collection/publications/papers-and-podcasts/cabinet-release/jim-stokes-transcript-78.aspx  National Archives of Australia: Background to the 1978 Cabinet records]. Retrieved 19 November 2014</ref>\n\nThere have been examples of [[malapportionment]] of federal and state electoral districts in the past, often resulting in rural constituencies containing far fewer voters than urban ones and maintaining in power those parties that have rural support despite polling fewer popular votes. Past malapportionments in [[Queensland]], [[Western Australia]] and the '[[Playmander]]' in [[South Australia]] were notorious examples of the differences between urban and rural constituency sizes than their population would merit. The Playmander distorted electoral boundaries and policies that kept the [[Liberal and Country League]] in power for 32 years from 1936 to 1968.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120709065419/http://www.history.sa.gov.au/history/Democracy%20Conference/JaenschPARTIES.pdf Labor and Liberal Parties, SA, Dean Jaensch], \"A 2:1 ratio of enrolments in favour of the rural areas was in force from 1936.\"</ref> In extreme cases, rural areas had four times the voting value of metropolitan areas. Supporters of such arrangements claimed Australia's urban population dominates the countryside and that these practices gave fair representation to country people.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Naming of divisions==\nThe redistribution, creation and abolition of divisions is the responsibility of the AEC. When new divisions are created, the AEC will select a name. Most divisions are named in honour of prominent historical people, such as former politicians (often [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers]]), explorers, artists and engineers, and rarely for geographic places.\n\nSome of the criteria the AEC uses when naming new divisions are:<ref>Australian Electoral Commission. [http://www.aec.gov.au/Electorates/Redistributions/guidelines.htm ''Guideline for Naming Divisions.''] Updated 20 July 2011. Accessed 1 February 2012.</ref>\n* divisions are named ''after deceased Australians who have rendered outstanding service to their country'', with consideration given to former Prime Ministers\n* the [[List of Australian electorates contested at every election|original names of Divisions]] proclaimed at [[Federation of Australia|Federation]] in [[1901 Australian federal election|1901]] are to be retained where possible\n* geographical place names are to be avoided\n* [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] names can be used as appropriate\n* names that duplicate names of state electoral districts are not to be used.\n\n==Notional seat status==\nAfter a redistribution is carried out in a state or territory, the AEC calculates \"notional\" margins for the redistributed divisions by modelling the outcome of the previous election as if the new boundaries had been in place. These notional margins are used as the baseline for the [[Swing (politics)|electoral swings]] calculated and published in the AEC's virtual tally room at the following election.<ref name=\"aecnss\">{{cite web |title=National seat status |url=https://www.aec.gov.au/media/national-seat-status.htm |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref> In some cases, the change in electoral boundaries can see the party which notionally holds the seat differ from the party which won it at the election.<ref name=\"abcredist\">{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Antony |title=2017\u201318 Federal Redistributions |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/elections/federal-redistribution-2018/ |website=ABC Elections |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=13 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://psephos.adam-carr.net/countries/a/australia/divisions/divisions.shtml Adam Carr's Electoral Archive: Index of House of Representatives Divisions 1901-2001]\n\n[[Category:Voting theory]]\n[[Category:Elections in Australia]]\n", "name_user": "Daask", "label": "safe", "comment": "linkstatutory authorityusingFind link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redistribution_(Australia)"}
