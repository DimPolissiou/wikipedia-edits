But there is no doubt that Soest has been inhabited for a long time; excavations in the last two decades have uncovered signs of habitation stretching back more than 4000 years. In the 11th and 12th centuries, Soest grew considerably, making it one of the biggest towns in [[Westphalia]] with some 10,000 citizens. It was also an important member of the [[Hanseatic League]] until 1609.\n\nA self-confident Soest from 1444 to 1449 liberated itself from the [[Bishop of Cologne]], who controlled [[Westphalia]] (the so-called [[Soest Feud]]). Being no longer capital of Westphalia, the city aligned itself with the [[Duchy of Cleves|Duke of Cleves]]. This was a [[Pyrrhic victory]], however; the city had shown itself strong enough to defy the powerful Archbishop of Cologne, but lost much of its trade: the \"liberated\" town was two-thirds surrounded by territories with other allegiances. When the last Duke of Cleves died in 1609, that dukedom was inherited by Brandenburg and, after a short siege, Soest was incorporated into it.\n\nThe painter [[Peter Lely]], later to win fame in England, was born in 1618 to Dutch parents in Soest, where his father was an officer serving in the armed forces of Elector [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg|Johann Sigismund]] of [[Electorate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]].\n\nDuring and after the [[Thirty Years' War]], Soest suffered a tremendous loss of both population and influence; at the lowest point in 1756, it had only 3,600 citizens.\n\nWith the creation of the [[Soest (district)|Soest district]] in 1817, its influence slowly rose. However, the industrialization of the [[Ruhr area]] did not reach Soest, which remained a small town.\n\nThe [[Nazi Party]] placed Soest in [[Gau (administrative division)|Gau]] Westphalia-South.<ref>[http://www.historisches-centrum.de/index.php?id=280 Historic Centre]</ref> During [[World War II]], Soest was the target of several allied bomber raids targeted at the [[marshalling yard]], which was one of the biggest in the Reich, and the important battery factory Akku Hagen. Later, Soest suffered major fighting in early April 1945, starting when Allied forces captured the town at the beginning of the month. They were soon evicted by a German counterattack. Destructive front-line combat raged in Soest and its environs at the eastern edge of the [[Ruhr Pocket]] through the first week of April until the Allies gained a permanent upper hand.\n\nFrom around 1953 to 1971, a sizeable garrison of Canadian soldiers and their families was stationed at Soest (with the Canadian camps located just east of the town in Bad Sassendorf), as well as Werl and Hemer-Iserlohn and Deilinghofen to the southwest. Also, several Belgian Kasernes were located in Soest itself. In addition, an American Nike Battery (66th Battalion) was situated to the south, which was subsequently turned over to the German military.\n\nFrom 1971-1993, the former Canadian properties, including the Married Quarters along Hiddingser Weg, south of the B-1, were used and occupied by the British military personnel and their families. On the closure of the Belgian and British army facilities, many of these properties either became used for civilian purposes or were abandoned or demolished. The former Married Quarters area was converted to civilian housing. The former CLFEX (the Canadian Army's food and clothing store for NATO families) was converted to a NAAFI under the British and finally demolished in 2006.\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery widths=\"250\" perow=\"3\">\nFile:Soest, straatzicht3 foto4 2010-08-09 09.51.JPG|Soest, view to a street 1\nFile:Soest, straatzicht4 foto2 2010-08-09 09.53.JPG|Soest, view to a street 2\nFile:Soest, Baudenkm\u00e4ler Markt 8 tm 12 (=Dm406 tm 410) foto4 2015-09-12 09.01.jpg|Soest, view to a street 3\n</gallery>\n\n==Notable residents==\n\n* [[Johann Gropper]] (1503\u20131559), Catholic church politician of the Reformation period\n* Sir [[Peter Lely]] (actually Pieter van der Faes; (1618\u20131680), English (court) painter\n* [[Otto Modersohn]] (1865\u20131943) in [[Rotenburg (W\u00fcmme)]]), landscape painter and co-founder of [[Worpswede]], husband of [[Paula Modersohn-Becker]]\n* [[Sigfrid Henrici]] (1889\u20131964), German army officer of armoured forces\n[[File:Wilhelm Morgner, , Foto vor 1917.jpg|thumb|150px|Wilhelm Morgner before 1917]]\n* [[Wilhelm Morgner]] (1891\u20131917), important expressionist painter in Westfalen\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|August M\u00fcller (politician born 1895)|de|3=August M\u00fcller (CDU)|lt=August M\u00fcller}} (1895\u20131960), member of parliament (CDU)\n* [[Hartwig Bleidick]] (born 1944), football player\n* Pete Smith (born 1960), writer\n* [[Ralf K\u00f6nig]] (born 1960),  known comic book creator\n* [[Sascha Schmitz]] (born 1972), singer-songwriter, musician and actor\n* [[Sebastian Hille]] (born 1980), German footballer\n* [[Oliver Kirch]] (born 1982), footballer\n* [[Michael Lejan]] (born 1983), footballer\n* [[Rebecca Handke]] (born 1986), pair skater\n* [[Ga\u00ebtan Bille]] (born 1988), Belgian cyclist\n* [[Julian B\u00fcscher]] (born 1993), German footballer\n\n==Tourism==\nSoest has a multitude of historical buildings and attractions. The many medieval churches are built from a greenish sandstone unique to this area.\n\n===Night life===\nThe place comes alive on weekends, with the youngsters pub-hopping from Dimwittekar to Pesel, which is a pub with a dance floor. The place boasts a discoth\u00e8que and several pubs serving fresh-brewed beer.\n\n=== St. Patrokli ===\nIn 960, [[Bruno I, Archbishop of Cologne]] transferred [[relics]] of [[Patroclus of Troyes|St. Patroclus]] from [[Troyes]] to Soest. Since 964, they have been housed in what became the [[Provost (religion)|provost]] church ''[[St. Patrokli, Soest|St.-Patrokli-Dom]]'' (St. Patroclus' \"Cathedral\"), a particularly fine example of [[Romanesque architecture]].\n\n===Universities and education===\nThe city houses a university, FH S\u00fcdwestfalen, which has students from Pakistan, Peru, Mexico, India, USA, Indonesia etc., The Swiss German university at the Soest University has an influx of interns and exchange students from across India, Africa and Indonesia.\n\nThe cathedral is a beautiful{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} example of early medieval Romanesque architecture fashioned from the local greenish sandstone. Its massive squared bell tower or steeple can be seen for many kilometers,{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} rising up out of the town centre of the old town and a landmark of the Soester Boerde.\n\n===Allerheiligenkirmes===\nThe Allerheiligenkirmes is named for [[All Saints' Day]] as it starts every year at the first Wednesday after All Saints' and lasts for five days. It is Europe's biggest inner-city fair{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and was held for the 673rd time in 2010.\n\n===Specialties of Soest===\nAmong the old specialties of Soest are the M\u00f6ppken bread<!--What language is that?--> and [[pumpernickel]]. The Haverland bakery in the town center, which formerly supplied the dark bread to the royal court of Bavaria, has existed since 1570. A newer specialty is ''Bullenauge'' (bull's eye), a mocha liqueur, sold mostly at the Allerheiligenkirmes. Another specialty is the Soester beer, also called ''Zwiebel-Bier'', which literally translates as 'onion beer' as since 1993 it has been brewed in the Zwiebel (Onion) inn.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms shows a key, which is the symbol for [[Saint Peter]], the patron saint of Cologne. The coat was not modified even after Soest no longer fell within the jurisdiction of Cologne.\n\n==International relations==\n{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}\n\nSoest is [[Twin towns and sister cities|twinned]] with:<ref>{{cite web |title=St\u00e4dtepartnerschaften|url=https://www.soest.de/buergerservice_politik/buergerinfo/produkt/pr605.php|website=soest.de|publisher=Soest|language=de|accessdate=2019-11-28}}</ref>\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n*{{flagicon|WAL}} [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]], Wales\n*{{flagicon|SWE}} [[Gotland Municipality|Gotland]], Sweden\n*{{flagicon|FRA}} [[Gu\u00e9rard]], France\n*{{flagicon|GER}} [[Herzberg (Elster)|Herzberg]], Germany\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[Kampen, Overijssel|Kampen]], Netherlands\n*{{flagicon|HUN}} [[S\u00e1rospatak]], Hungary\n*{{flagicon|NED}} [[Soest, Netherlands|Soest]], Netherlands\n*{{flagicon|POL}} [[Strzelce Opolskie]], Poland\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Soest}}\n* [http://www.soest.de Official site] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.lwl.org/westfaelische-geschichte/portal/Internet/ku.php?tab=pro&ID=28 Articles about \"Aldegrever and the Protestant Reformation in Soest\" / virtual exhibition \"Iconoclastic Controversy and sensual pleasure - Heinrich Aldegrever\" with introductory texts and about 170 commented copperplate engravings] {{in lang|de}}\n* [http://www.skydive-soest.de Skydive Soest - Germany's largest weekend dropzone.] {{in lang|de}}\n\n{{Lower Rhenish\u2013Westphalian Circle}}\n{{Hanseatic League}}\n{{Cities and towns in Soest (district)}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1609 disestablishments]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1449]]\n[[Category:Towns in North Rhine-Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Province of Westphalia]]\n[[Category:Members of the Hanseatic League]]\n[[Category:Soest (district)]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{travel guide|date=August 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=August 2012}}\n}}\n\n{{stack|\n{{Infobox German location\n|name              = Soest\n|type              = Stadt\n|image_photo       = Soest.jpg\n|imagesize         = 300px\n|image_caption     = Soest\n|image_flag        = Flagge der Stadt Soest.svg\n|image_coa         = Soest-coa.svg\n|coordinates       = {{coord|51|34|16|N|8|06|33|E|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n|image_plan        = Soest in SO.svg\n|state             = NRW\n|region            = Arnsberg\n|district          = Soest\n|elevation         = 90\n|area              = 85.81\n|population        = 48682\n|Stand             = 2009-06-30\n|pop_source        = \n|postal_code       = 59494\n|area_code         = 02921\n|licence           = SO\n|Gemeindeschl\u00fcssel = 05 9 74 040\n|divisions         = 19\n|Stra\u00dfe            = Am Vreithof 8<br>59494 Soest\n|website           = [http://www.soest.de/ www.soest.de]\n|mayor             = Eckhard Ruthemeyer\n|party             = CDU\n}}\n{{Infobox country\n|native_name            = ''Freie Hansestadt Soest''\n|conventional_long_name = Imperial and Hanseatic City of Soest\n|common_name            = Soest\n|\n|era                    = Middle Ages\n|status                 = City-state\n|empire                 = Holy Roman Empire\n|government_type        = Republic\n|status_text            = [[Free Imperial City|Imperial]], [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] City {{nowrap|of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]}}\n|\n|year_start             = 1449\n|year_end               = 1609\n|\n|event_pre              = Mentioned in <br>{{spaces|4}}{{nowrap|''Dagobertsche Schenkung''}}\n|date_pre               = &nbsp;<br>836\n|event_start            = [[Soest Feud]] to gain <br>{{spaces|4}}''[[Reichsfrei]]heit'' from <br>{{spaces|4}}[[Archbishopric of Cologne|Abp Cologne]]\n|date_start             = &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1444\u201349\n|event_end              = Annexed by<br>{{spaces|4}}[[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]], with<br>{{spaces|4}}[[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]], on extinction<br>{{spaces|4}}of its ducal line\n|date_end               = &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>1609\n|\n|p1                     = Archbishopric of Cologne\n|image_p1               = [[File:DEU Koeln COA.svg|20px|Archbishopric of Cologne]]\n|s1                     = Margraviate of Brandenburg\n|image_s1               = [[File:Wappen Mark Brandenburg.png|20px|Margraviate of Brandenburg]]\n|\n|capital                = <nowiki>Soest</nowiki>\n}}\n}}\n\n'''Soest''' ({{IPA-de|\u02c8zo\u02d0st|-|De-Soest.ogg}}, as if it were 'Sohst'; [[Westphalian language|Westphalian]]: ''Saust'') is a [[city]] in [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Germany]].

The Haverland bakery in the town center, which formerly supplied the dark bread to the royal court of Bavaria, has existed since 1570. A newer specialty is ''Bullenauge'' (bull's eye), a mocha liqueur, sold mostly at the Allerheiligenkirmes. Another specialty is the Soester beer, also called ''Zwiebel-Bier'', which literally translates as 'onion beer' as since 1993 it has been brewed in the Zwiebel (Onion) inn.\n\n==Coat of arms==\nThe coat of arms shows a key, which is the symbol for [[Saint Peter]], the patron saint of Cologne.
