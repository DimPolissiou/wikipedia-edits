The first wave of Serbs to [[Austria]] began in the early 19th century, while the largest wave was during the [[migrant worker]] program of the 1960s and 1970s. Serb immigration to Austria is still active today due to economic and familial factors. Like in most Western European countries, the Serb community in Austria consists mainly of Serbs from Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n==History==\nSerbs were a notable minority of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]], having settled Central Europe following the [[Ottoman conquest of Serbia]]. The Serbs with the aid of Austrian troops [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1686\u201391)|occupied Serbia in 1686\u201391]], established the [[Kingdom of Serbia (1718\u201339)]], and [[Habsburg-occupied Serbia (1788\u201392)|occupied it again in 1788\u201392]].\n\nThe [http://www.oesg.or.at/ \u00d6sterreichisch Serbische Gesellschaft] (Austrian Serbian Society) was founded in 1936 as \"\u00d6sterreichisch-Jugoslawischen Gesellschaft\".\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to the [[Demographics of Austria|2014 census]], there were 132,553 (2.2%) Austrian citizens who declared [[Serbian

He is eventually caught and deported from the UK thus crushing his dreams of an ideal life.\n\nFour years later, Aakash returns with vengeance on his mind and teams up with his former employees Aadil Khan ([[Zayed Khan]]) and Megha ([[Sameera Reddy]]) to wreak some havoc. What follows is a bomb threat on a train and a tense railway control officer Sanjay Raina ([[Boman Irani]]) and anti-terrorism officer Arjun Khanna ([[Anil Kapoor]]) trying every trick in the book to avert the disaster and to apprehend the culprits. Sanjay Raina tries his best to save his daughter Piya ([[Avika Gor]]) and the passengers in the train who are thrown in the mix are police officer Shivan Menon ([[Mohanlal]]) and his team of cops, who are escorting a prisoner on the same ill-fated train. Aakash demands 10 million euros to tell them how to disarm the bomb. The ministry does not want to give the money, but Khanna convinces them that the money will be given back and is a way to lure the terrorists.\n\nAfter following Aakash's instructions and dropping the money in a river, he walks away. Megha gets the money and tries to get away. She evades the cops after a vicious chase but unfortunately she is killed by a van in an intersection. Khanna finds out that Khan is one of the bombers and chases him. Khan is shot in the leg, but he gets away after jumping from the bridge and landing on a jet ski driven by Aakash. Aakash once again demands money and asks it to be left in a dustbin. The dustbin falls inward and Aakash runs away with the money even though the police attempt to pursue him.\n\nKhanna and his team find out where Aadil is and go to arrest him. Aadil commits suicide with a bomb almost killing Khanna. Aakash calls Raina and tells him that a note has been left at a restaurant called Delhi Darbar that tells how to defuse the bomb. However, the restaurant catches on fire and the letter is burnt. Aakash visits Nikita and his son and they arrange to flight out of the UK that night. Khanna visits Nikita and tells who her husband is. After changing the plan (that they should leave UK via train because the police has found out about his plan of leaving via plane), he goes to the train station. There he sees a video of Raina asking the bomber to call again as the letter was burnt.\n\nAakash calls Raina and tells him that the bomb was not connected to the wheels and the train will not explode if stopped. Raina stops the train, and everyone disembarks safely. Nikita who is helping Khanna now, goes to the train station and sees Aakash and the news that the bomb threat was a hoax. She lets Aakash go, but Khanna finds out as Aakash's son calls him Daddy. Khanna chases him and they fight. Aakash pleas to Khanna to let him go and explains why he took such drastic actions. Realizing that Aakash was a victim of deportation and wants to just be with his family again at peace, Khanna stays silent (hinting he will let him leave scot free). However, the police arrive; after seeing that Aakash had a gun, they shoot him.\n\nIn the end, Nikita receives a letter Aakash had written. It stated that the money (which Aakash asked for defusing the bomb) was in Aakash's bank locker. He also states that she should give half the money to Megha's brother and Adil's mother. He asks her to tell his son that what he did was to get justice.

He is eventually caught and deported from the UK thus crushing his dreams of an ideal life.\n\nFour years later, Aakash returns with vengeance on his mind and teams up with his former employees Aadil Khan ([[Zayed Khan]]) and Megha ([[Sameera Reddy]]) to wreak some havoc. What follows is a bomb threat on a train and a tense railway control officer Sanjay Raina ([[Boman Irani]]) and anti-terrorism officer Arjun Khanna ([[Anil Kapoor]]) trying every trick in the book to avert the disaster and to apprehend the culprits. Sanjay Raina tries his best to save his daughter Piya ([[Avika Gor]]) and the passengers in the train who are thrown in the mix are police officer Shivan Menon ([[Mohanlal]]) and his team of cops, who are escorting a prisoner on the same ill-fated train. Aakash demands 10 million euros to tell them how to disarm the bomb. The ministry does not want to give the money, but Khanna convinces them that the money will be given back and is a way to lure the terrorists.\n\nAfter following Aakash's instructions and dropping the money in a river, he walks away. Megha gets the money and tries to get away. She evades the cops after a vicious chase but unfortunately she is killed by a van in an intersection. Khanna finds out that Khan is one of the bombers and chases him. Khan is shot in the leg, but he gets away after jumping from the bridge and landing on a jet ski driven by Aakash. Aakash once again demands money and asks it to be left in a dustbin. The dustbin falls inward and Aakash runs away with the money even though the police attempt to pursue him.\n\nKhanna and his team find out where Aadil is and go to arrest him. Aadil commits suicide with a bomb almost killing Khanna. Aakash calls Raina and tells him that a note has been left at a restaurant called Delhi Darbar that tells how to defuse the bomb. However, the restaurant catches on fire and the letter is burnt. Aakash visits Nikita and his son and they arrange to flight out of the UK that night. Khanna visits Nikita and tells who her husband is. After changing the plan (that they should leave UK via train because the police has found out about his plan of leaving via plane), he goes to the train station. There he sees a video of Raina asking the bomber to call again as the letter was burnt.\n\nAakash calls Raina and tells him that the bomb was not connected to the wheels and the train will not explode if stopped. Raina stops the train, and everyone disembarks safely. Nikita who is helping Khanna now, goes to the train station and sees Aakash and the news that the bomb threat was a hoax. She lets Aakash go, but Khanna finds out as Aakash's son calls him Daddy. Khanna chases him and they fight. Aakash pleas to Khanna to let him go and explains why he took such drastic actions. Realizing that Aakash was a victim of deportation and wants to just be with his family again at peace, Khanna stays silent (hinting he will let him leave scot free). However, the police arrive; after seeing that Aakash had a gun, they shoot him.\n\nIn the end, Nikita receives a letter Aakash had written. It stated that the money (which Aakash asked for defusing the bomb) was in Aakash's bank locker. He also states that she should give half the money to Megha's brother and Adil's mother. He asks her to tell his son that what he did was to get justice. Finally, Aakash tells Nikita that if they ever meet in the next life, the end of their love story would be much better and bids her goodbye.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Ajay Devgn]] as Aakash Rana, a engineer,small-time criminal and has an alliance with his fellow employees.\n* [[Anil Kapoor]] as Anti-Terrorism Officer Arjun Khanna, a cop who tries to stop Rana and his friends.\n* [[Zayed Khan]] as Aadil Khan, Aakash's employee who is a bomber and a stunt doubling ninja.\n* [[Kangana Ranaut]] as Nikita Malhotra, Aakash's wife who has no memory of him since he became a criminal.\n* [[Boman Irani]] as Sanjay Raina, Arjun's comrade whose daughter boards a train with a bomb\n* [[Sameera Reddy]] as Megha Singh, Aakash's 2nd employee who was hit by a speeding van.\n* [[Manpreet Bambra]] as Arjun Khanna's daughter\n* [[Philip Martin Brown]] as Police Chief Inspector Alan Fisher\n* [[Dominic Power]] as Jojo\n* [[Avika Gor]] as Piya Raina, Sanjay and Renu's daughter who boards a train with a hidden bomb.\n* [[Puja Bratt]] as Doctor Renu Raina\n* [[Bhavna Pani]] as Radhika\n* [[Cory Goldberg]]\n* Naveed Choudhry as Worker/Mechanic\n* [[Neeraj Vora]]\n* [[Lee Nicholas Harris]] as Armed Police Officer SO19\n* [[Jing Lusi]] as Reporter\n* [[Jamie Maclachlan]] as Reporter\n* [[Mohanlal]] as Shivan Menon ([[Cameo appearance]])\n* David Berg, Merrill Sells, Tara, Aidan and Dylan Berg (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite web|title=Everybody Tezz Tezz Tezz|url=http://bergiesindia.wordpress.com/2012/05/04/everybody-tezz-tezz-tezz/|work=blog|publisher=Bergie's India|accessdate=3 November 2013}}</ref>\n* [[Mallika Sherawat]] as Desi Club Dancer Laila ([[Item number]] in song ''Laila'')\n{{colend}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{empty section|date=July 2019}}\n\n== Soundtrack ==\nThe soundtrack was composed by the musical duo [[Sajid-Wajid]] and the lyrics were penned by [[Shabbir Ahmed (lyricist)|Shabbir Ahmed]] and [[Jalees Sherwani]].

{"title_page": "Cranaghan", "text_new": "[[File:Slieve Russell Hotel and Golf Course - geograph.org.uk - 910359.jpg|220px|right]]\n\n'''Cranaghan''' is a townland in the Parish of [[Tomregan]], Barony of [[Loughtee Lower]], [[County Cavan]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. \n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe townland name is an anglicisation of the Gaelic placename ''Crannachan'' which means \u2018Woodland\u2019. The earliest surviving mention of the townland is on the 1609 Ulster Plantation map of the Barony of Loughtee, where it is spelled ''Granchinah''. A 1610 grant spells it as ''Granchinagh''. A 1627 grant spells it as ''Granchynagh, or Craynkyney, and Cronaghan''. The 1790 Cavan Carvaghs list spells the name as ''Cranaghan''.<ref>[http://www.cavanlibrary.ie/file/Local-Studies/Library-Scanned-Docs/The-Carvaghs-A-List-Of-The-Several-Baronies-And-Parishes-in-the-County-Of-Cavan.pdf]</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\nIt is bounded on the north by Killywilly townland, on the east by Ardue, Ture and Greaghrahan townlands, on the south by [[Aghavoher]] and [[Carrigan]] townlands and on the west by [[Cavanagh (townland)]] and [[Mullaghduff, County Cavan|Mullaghduff]] townlands. Its chief geographical features are Killywilly Lough, Agavoher Lough, Lough Rud, the [[Rag River]] and several small drumlin hills reaching to an altitude of 250 feet above sea-level. Cranaghan is traversed by the [[N87 road (Ireland)]] and some minor lanes.
