Using a teleprompter is similar to using [[cue cards]]. The screen is in front of, and usually below, the [[Camera lens|lens]] of a [[professional video camera]], and the words on the screen are reflected to the eyes of the [[Television presenter|presenter]] using a sheet of clear glass or a specially prepared [[beam splitter]]. Light from the [[performer]] passes through the front side of the glass into the lens, while a shroud surrounding the lens and the back side of the glass prevents unwanted light from entering the lens. Mechanically this works in a very similar way to the \"[[Pepper's Ghost]]\" illusion from classic theatre \u2013 an image viewable from one angle but not another \u2013 and the concept may have similar origins.\n\nBecause the speaker does not need to look down to consult written notes, the teleprompter creates the illusion that the speaker has [[Memorization|memorized]] the speech or is speaking spontaneously, looking directly into the camera lens. Cue cards, on the other hand, are always placed away from the lens axis, making the speaker look at a point beside the camera, which leaves an impression of distraction.\n\nThe technology has continued to develop.

This system uses a mirror to reflect a script onto a piece of glass placed in front of the camera lens, thus allowing the reader to look directly into the camera. First used by [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] in 1953<ref name=\"Oppenheimer\"/> to read commercials on-camera, it soon became a staple of [[television news]] and is the primary system used with prompters today.\n\nThe first [[personal computer]]-based teleprompter, Compu=Prompt appeared in 1982. It was invented and marketed by Courtney M. Goodin and Laurence B. Abrams in Los Angeles, California. The custom software and specially-redesigned camera hardware ran on the Atari 800 Personal Computer, which featured smooth hardware-assisted scrolling. Their company later became ProPrompt, Inc., which is still providing teleprompting services over 32 years later. Other paper-based teleprompting companies Electronic Script Prompting, QTV and Telescript followed suit and developed their own software several years later, when computers with enough graphics power to provide the smooth scrolling text became available. In January 2010 Compu=Prompt received a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for \"Pioneering Development in Electronic Prompting\".\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:teleprompter.jpg|thumb|A teleprompter displaying text]]{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe word \"TelePrompTer\", with [[CamelCase|internal capitalization]], originated as a [[trade name]] used by the TelePrompTer Company, which first developed the device in the 1950s. The word \"teleprompter\", with no capitalization, has become a [[genericized trademark]], because it is used to refer to similar systems manufactured by many different companies. The [[United States Patent Office]] does not have any live trademarks registered for the word ''teleprompter'', but this does not rule out the possibility of a company enforcing the trademark without registering it. Some other common terms for this type of device are:\n* [[Autocue]] or Autoscript (the trademark of Autocue Group Ltd, most commonly used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries; Autoscript is used to brand the devices in the United States)\n* cueing device\n* electronic speech notes\n* idiot board (slang)\n* prompter\n\n==Modern design==\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Teleprompter in use.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Teleprompter in use]]\n\nModern teleprompters for [[news program]]s consist of a [[personal computer]], connected to [[video monitor]]s on each [[professional video camera]]. In certain systems, the PC connects to a separate display device to offer greater flexibility in setup, distances and cabling. The monitors are often black-and-white and have the scanning reversed to compensate for the reflection of the [[mirror]]. A [[peripheral device]] attached has a knob that can be turned to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the scrolling of the text. The text is usually displayed in white letters on a black background for the best readability, while cues are in inverse video ([[light-on-dark color scheme|black on white]]). Difficult words (mainly international names) are spelled out [[phonetic]]ally,<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN2540350420070926 Reuters: When words get in the way, Bush goes phonetic]</ref> as are other particulars like \"Nine-eleven\" (to specify that the event [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] should not be [[pronunciation|pronounced]] \"[[9-1-1|nine-one-one]]\", for example).\n\nWith the development of inexpensive teleprompter [[software application]]s as well as free Web-based teleprompter applets, many different disciplines are now using teleprompters to help them deliver sermons, deliver speeches, and to create quality audio recordings. Unlike their more advanced counterparts, these entry level products work on desktop computers, laptop computers, and even tablet computers to enable the speaker to control the rate and flow of their speech. They are also used by many different organizations and schools to deliver prewritten information by relative novices. They are usually called \"personal teleprompters.\"\n\n===Presidential (or glass) teleprompters===\n[[File:SOU2007.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[George W. Bush]] next to two glass teleprompters. They can be seen more clearly by clicking on this image and the one below.]]\n[[File:Joe Biden 2008 DNC (1).jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Joe Biden]] flanked by two glass teleprompters. The two teleprompter monitors are embedded in the floor of the podium.]]\n\nGlass teleprompters were first used at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. The inventor of the teleprompter, Hubert Schlafly, explained that he wanted to create a less obtrusive teleprompting system than the ones used at the time. He said, \"We developed a 'one way mirror' device we called the ''Speech View'' system... The prompter, hidden in the base, reflected the text on the glass to the speaker while the audience looked through the glass without being aware of the text. Two such prompters, one on the right and one on the left of the speaker allowed him to switch from one to the other and appear to address the entire audience\".<ref name=TTM>Laurie Brown, ''The Teleprompter Manual'' (Pleasant Ridge, Michigan: The Difference Press, 2006), pp. 5\u20136. {{ISBN|0-9767761-0-3}}.</ref>\n\nSchlafly's company then created a speaker's lectern that included two synchronized glass teleprompters and a range of technological innovations including air conditioning and an adjustable-height speaker's platform. The success of the system led the company to develop a new model for use on TV cameras, with the glass placed directly in front of the lens.

It was invented and marketed by Courtney M. Goodin and Laurence B. Abrams in Los Angeles, California. The custom software and specially-redesigned camera hardware ran on the Atari 800 Personal Computer, which featured smooth hardware-assisted scrolling. Their company later became ProPrompt, Inc., which is still providing teleprompting services over 32 years later. Other paper-based teleprompting companies Electronic Script Prompting, QTV and Telescript followed suit and developed their own software several years later, when computers with enough graphics power to provide the smooth scrolling text became available. In January 2010 Compu=Prompt received a Technology and Engineering Emmy Award for \"Pioneering Development in Electronic Prompting\".\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:teleprompter.jpg|thumb|A teleprompter displaying text]]{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}\n\nThe word \"TelePrompTer\", with [[CamelCase|internal capitalization]], originated as a [[trade name]] used by the TelePrompTer Company, which first developed the device in the 1950s. The word \"teleprompter\", with no capitalization, has become a [[genericized trademark]], because it is used to refer to similar systems manufactured by many different companies. The [[United States Patent Office]] does not have any live trademarks registered for the word ''teleprompter'', but this does not rule out the possibility of a company enforcing the trademark without registering it. Some other common terms for this type of device are:\n* [[Autocue]] or Autoscript (the trademark of Autocue Group Ltd, most commonly used in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries; Autoscript is used to brand the devices in the United States)\n* cueing device\n* electronic speech notes\n* idiot board (slang)\n* prompter\n\n==Modern design==\n\n===Television===\n[[File:Teleprompter in use.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Teleprompter in use]]\n\nModern teleprompters for [[news program]]s consist of a [[personal computer]], connected to [[video monitor]]s on each [[professional video camera]]. In certain systems, the PC connects to a separate display device to offer greater flexibility in setup, distances and cabling. The monitors are often black-and-white and have the scanning reversed to compensate for the reflection of the [[mirror]]. A [[peripheral device]] attached has a knob that can be turned to speed up, slow down, or even reverse the scrolling of the text. The text is usually displayed in white letters on a black background for the best readability, while cues are in inverse video ([[light-on-dark color scheme|black on white]]). Difficult words (mainly international names) are spelled out [[phonetic]]ally,<ref>[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN2540350420070926 Reuters: When words get in the way, Bush goes phonetic]</ref> as are other particulars like \"Nine-eleven\" (to specify that the event [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] should not be [[pronunciation|pronounced]] \"[[9-1-1|nine-one-one]]\", for example).\n\nWith the development of inexpensive teleprompter [[software application]]s as well as free Web-based teleprompter applets, many different disciplines are now using teleprompters to help them deliver sermons, deliver speeches, and to create quality audio recordings. Unlike their more advanced counterparts, these entry level products work on desktop computers, laptop computers, and even tablet computers to enable the speaker to control the rate and flow of their speech. They are also used by many different organizations and schools to deliver prewritten information by relative novices. They are usually called \"personal teleprompters.\"\n\n===Presidential (or glass) teleprompters===\n[[File:SOU2007.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[George W. Bush]] next to two glass teleprompters.

The two teleprompter monitors are embedded in the floor of the podium.]]\n\nGlass teleprompters were first used at the [[1956 Democratic National Convention]]. The inventor of the teleprompter, Hubert Schlafly, explained that he wanted to create a less obtrusive teleprompting system than the ones used at the time. He said, \"We developed a 'one way mirror' device we called the ''Speech View'' system... The prompter, hidden in the base, reflected the text on the glass to the speaker while the audience looked through the glass without being aware of the text. Two such prompters, one on the right and one on the left of the speaker allowed him to switch from one to the other and appear to address the entire audience\".<ref name=TTM>Laurie Brown, ''The Teleprompter Manual'' (Pleasant Ridge, Michigan: The Difference Press, 2006), pp. 5\u20136. {{ISBN|0-9767761-0-3}}.</ref>\n\nSchlafly's company then created a speaker's lectern that included two synchronized glass teleprompters and a range of technological innovations including air conditioning and an adjustable-height speaker's platform. The success of the system led the company to develop a new model for use on TV cameras, with the glass placed directly in front of the lens. The camera \"looked through the glass; the performer looked directly at the TV audience and was able to read the text word for word. This device now has worldwide use\".<ref name=TTM/>\n\nTypically, a screen on either side of the speaker shows mirrored text from upward-facing floor monitors at the base of a stand supporting a [[one-way mirror]] at the top, angled down towards the screen. The speaker sees the text on the screen reflected in the mirror, while the audience sees what looks like a sheet of tinted glass on each side of the speaker.\n\nSchlafly's glass teleprompters were also used for the [[1956 Republican National Convention]], and at both parties' conventions from then on.

A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964\u20131976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale presidential campaign, 1984|nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election of 1984]], but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Up Close with Walter Mondale|url=https://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106134345/http://give.umn.edu/content/close-walter-mondale|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 6, 2015|website=UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA FOUNDATION|publisher=University of Minnesota|access-date=May 2, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], to Claribel Hope (n\u00e9e Cowan), a part-time music teacher, and Theodore Sigvaard Mondale, a [[Methodist]] minister.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |title=American President: Walter Mondale |publisher=Millercenter.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704011945/http://millercenter.org/academic/americanpresident/carter/essays/vicepresident/1829 |archivedate=July 4, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/389066/Walter-Mondale |title=Walter Mondale|accessdate=July 20, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/VP_Walter_Mondale.htm |title=Walter F.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents followed this model.<ref>Paul Kengor, ''Wreath Layer or Policy Player: The Vice President's Role in Foreign Policy'' (2000) p. 85</ref>\n\n===1980 election===\n{{Further|U.S. presidential election, 1976 |U.S. presidential election, 1980}}\n[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter, in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]] in January 1979]]\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].\n\nCarter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W. Bush]]'s death on November 30, 2018, Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living U.S vice president]] and Carter the [[List of presidents of the United States by age#Oldest living U.S. presidents|oldest living U.S. president]].\n\n==Post-vice presidency (1981\u2013present)==\n\n===1984 presidential campaign===\n\n{{Main|1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1984 United States presidential election}}\nAfter losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at [[Winston and Strawn]], a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.\n\nMondale ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1984|Democratic Party presidential nomination]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you. I just did.\"<ref name=\":0\">[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/conventions/chicago/facts/famous.speeches/mondale.84.shtml Mondale's Acceptance Speech, 1984], AllPolitics</ref> While this was meant to show that Mondale would be honest with voters, it was instead largely interpreted as a campaign pledge to raise taxes to spend on domestic programs, which was unappealing to many voters.\n\n[[File:Mondale Ferraro.svg|thumb|left|One of the logos of the Mondale campaign]]\nMondale ran a [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] campaign, supporting a [[nuclear freeze]] and the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA). He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).

A [[United States Senator|United States senator]] from [[Minnesota]] (1964\u20131976), he was the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]'s [[Walter Mondale presidential campaign, 1984|nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election of 1984]], but lost to [[Ronald Reagan]] in an [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] [[Landslide victory|landslide]]. Reagan won 49 states while Mondale carried his home state of [[Minnesota]] and the [[District of Columbia]]. In October 2002, Mondale became the last-minute choice of the [[Minnesota Democratic\u2013Farmer\u2013Labor Party]] to run for [[2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota|Senate]] after the death of Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], but was defeated by [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living]] former U.S. vice president after the death of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 2018.\n\nMondale was born in [[Ceylon, Minnesota]], and graduated from the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1951 after attending [[Macalester College]]. He then served in the [[United States Army]] during the [[Korean War]] before earning a [[law degree]] in 1956. He married [[Joan Mondale|Joan Adams]] in 1955. Working as a lawyer in [[Minneapolis]], Mondale was appointed [[Minnesota Attorney General]] in 1960 by Governor [[Orville Freeman]] and was elected to a full term as attorney general in 1962 with 60% of the vote. He was appointed to the U.S. Senate by Governor [[Karl Rolvaag]] upon the resignation of Senator [[Hubert Humphrey]] following Humphrey's election as vice president in 1964. Mondale was elected to a full Senate term in 1966 and reelected in 1972, resigning in 1976 as he prepared to succeed to the vice presidency in 1977. While in the Senate, he supported [[consumer protection]], [[fair housing]], [[tax reform]], and the [[desegregation]] of schools. Importantly, he served as a member of the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities (\"[[Church Committee]]\").<ref>[https://fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm Staff Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003144646/http://www.fas.org/irp/ops/policy/church-chile.htm |date=October 3, 2009 }} of Church Committee, archived by [[Federation of American Scientists]], Retrieved October 22, 2014.</ref>\n\nIn [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]], [[Jimmy Carter]], the Democratic presidential nominee, chose Mondale as his vice-presidential running mate. The Carter\u2013Mondale ticket defeated incumbent president [[Gerald Ford]] and his vice presidential running mate, [[Bob Dole]]. Carter and Mondale's time in office was marred by a worsening economy and they lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|1980 election]] to Republicans Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush. In 1984, Mondale won the Democratic presidential nomination and campaigned for a [[nuclear freeze]], the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], an increase in taxes, and a reduction of [[U.S. public debt]]. His vice presidential nominee was [[Geraldine Ferraro]], a Congresswoman from [[New York (state)|New York]], the first female vice-presidential nominee of any major party. Mondale and Ferraro lost the election to the incumbents Reagan and Bush.\n\nAfter his defeat, Mondale joined the Minnesota-based law firm [[Dorsey & Whitney]] and the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] (1986\u201393). President [[Bill Clinton]] appointed Mondale [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] in 1993; he retired in 1996. In [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|2002]], Mondale ran for his old Senate seat, agreeing to be the last-minute replacement for Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], who died in a plane crash less than two weeks before the election. Mondale narrowly lost the race to [[Saint Paul, Minnesota|Saint Paul]] mayor [[Norm Coleman]]. He then returned to working at Dorsey & Whitney and remained active in the Democratic Party. Mondale later took up a part-time teaching position at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Hubert H.

[[NASA]] Administrator [[James E. Webb]] secured President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s approval for NASA to internally investigate the cause of the accident according to its established procedures, subject to Congressional oversight. NASA's procedure called for Deputy Administrator (and de facto general manager) [[Robert C. Seamans]] to appoint and oversee an investigative panel.\n\nIn February, a reporter leaked to Mondale the existence of [[Phillips Report|an internal NASA report]] issued in 1965 by Apollo program director [[Samuel C. Phillips]], detailing management, cost, delivery, and quality problems of the Apollo prime contractor [[North American Aviation]]. In the February 27 hearing, Mondale asked Webb if he knew of such a report. Webb had not yet seen the December 1965 written report, so he responded in the negative. Seamans had passed along to Webb neither the written report nor the briefing presentation made to him in January 1966 by Phillips and Phillips's boss, Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George Mueller (NASA)|George Mueller]].<ref name=\"wamu\">{{Cite episode|title=Washington Goes to the Moon (Part 2) |url=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|accessdate=March 15, 2011|series=Soundprint |network=NPR|station=WAMU 88.5 FM|location=Washington D.C.|airdate=May 24, 2001|transcript=yes |transcripturl=http://mail.dve.wamu.org/d/programs/special/moon/fire_show.txt|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728170238/http://mail.dve.wamu.org/programs/special/01/washington_goes_to_the_moon.php|archivedate=July 28, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBoth Seamans and Mueller had also been called to testify at this session.

Under repeated questioning from Mondale, Webb promised that he would investigate whether the \"Phillips Report\" existed, and if so, whether a controlled release could be made to Congress. Immediately after the hearing, Webb saw the Phillips report for the first time.<ref name=\"wamu\"/>\n\nThe controversy spread to both houses of Congress and grew (through the efforts of three of Mondale's fellow committee members, Republicans [[Margaret Chase Smith]], [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]]) to include the second-guessing of NASA's original selection in 1961 of North American as the prime Apollo spacecraft contractor, which Webb became forced to defend. The House NASA oversight committee, which was conducting its own hearings and had picked up on the controversy, was ultimately given a copy of the Phillips report.\n\nWhile the Committee, as a whole, believed that NASA should have informed Congress of the Phillips review results in 1966, its final report issued on January 30, 1968, concluded (as had NASA's own accident investigation completed on April 5, 1967), that \"the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident\". Yet Mondale wrote a minority opinion accusing NASA of \"evasiveness,... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy\".<ref name=\"as204_senate\">{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Clinton P.|authorlink=Clinton P.

He became the fourth vice president in four years, after [[Spiro Agnew]] (1969\u201373), [[Gerald Ford]] (1973\u201374), and [[Nelson Rockefeller]] (1974\u201377).\n\nUnder Carter, Mondale traveled extensively throughout the nation and the world advocating the administration's foreign policy. His travels also included a visit to the {{USS|Midway|CV-41}}, which was on station at the time in the Indian Ocean, during the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. Mondale was the first vice president to have an office in the White House and established the concept of an \"activist Vice President.\" He began the tradition of weekly lunches with the president, which continues to this day. More importantly, he expanded the vice president's role from figurehead to presidential advisor, full-time participant, and troubleshooter for the administration. Subsequent vice presidents followed this model.<ref>Paul Kengor, ''Wreath Layer or Policy Player: The Vice President's Role in Foreign Policy'' (2000) p. 85</ref>\n\n===1980 election===\n{{Further|U.S. presidential election, 1976 |U.S. presidential election, 1980}}\n[[File:Mondale and Carter.JPG|thumb|Walter Mondale and Jimmy Carter, in front of Presidential helicopter [[Marine One]] in January 1979]]\nCarter and Mondale were renominated at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]], but soundly lost to the Republican ticket of [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[George H. W. Bush]]. That year, Mondale opened the [[XIII Olympic Winter Games]] in [[Lake Placid, New York]].\n\nCarter and Mondale are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On May 23, 2006, they had been out of office for 9,254 days (25 years, 4 months and 3 days), surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], both of whom died on July 4, 1826. On September 8, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the president with the longest retirement from office. On April 23, 2014, Mondale surpassed [[Richard Nixon]] as the vice president with the longest retirement from office at 12,146 days (33 years, 3 months and 3 days). With [[George H. W. Bush]]'s death on November 30, 2018, Mondale became the [[List of vice presidents of the United States by age#Timeline of oldest living vice presidents|oldest living U.S vice president]] and Carter the [[List of presidents of the United States by age#Oldest living U.S. presidents|oldest living U.S. president]].\n\n==Post-vice presidency (1981\u2013present)==\n\n===1984 presidential campaign===\n\n{{Main|1984 Democratic Party presidential primaries|1984 United States presidential election}}\nAfter losing the 1980 election, Mondale returned briefly to the practice of law at [[Winston and Strawn]], a large Chicago-based law firm, but he intended to return to politics before long.\n\nMondale ran for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1984|Democratic Party presidential nomination]] in the [[1984 United States presidential election|1984 election]], and was soon the front-runner. His opposition included Reverend [[Jesse Jackson]] and Senator [[Gary Hart]] from [[Colorado]]. Hart won the New Hampshire primary in March, but Mondale had much of the party leadership behind him. To great effect, Mondale used the [[Wendy's]] slogan \"[[Where's the beef?]]\" to describe Hart's policies as lacking depth. Jackson, widely regarded as the first serious African-American candidate for president, held on longer, but Mondale gained the nomination with the majority of delegates on the first ballot.\n\n[[File:Carter and Mondale celebrate primary victories in Minneapolis, MN. 3-13-84..jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|Mondale celebrates victories in the 1984 primaries with Carter.]]\n\nAt the Democratic Convention, Mondale chose [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] as his running mate, making her the first woman nominated for that position by a major party. Aides later said that Mondale was determined to make a historic choice with his vice presidential candidate, having considered San Francisco Mayor [[Dianne Feinstein]] (female and Jewish); Los Angeles Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]], an African American; and [[San Antonio]] Mayor [[Henry Cisneros]], a Mexican American, as finalists.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926644,00.html Trying to Win the Peace], by Even Thomas, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.</ref> Others preferred Senator [[Lloyd Bentsen]] because he would appeal to the Deep South, or even nomination rival [[Gary Hart]]. Ferraro, as a Catholic, was criticized by some Catholic Church leaders for being [[pro-choice]]. Much more controversy erupted over her changing positions about the release of her husband's tax returns, and her own ethics record in the House. Ferraro was on the defensive throughout much of the campaign, largely negating her breakthrough as the first woman on a major national ticket. She was also the first [[Italian American]] to reach that level in American politics.\n\nWhen Mondale made his acceptance speech at the Democratic Convention, he said: \"By the end of my first term, I will reduce the Reagan budget deficit by two\u2011thirds. Let's tell the truth. It must be done, it must be done. Mr. Reagan will raise taxes, and so will I. He won't tell you.

He spoke against [[Reaganomics|Reagan's economic policies]] and in support of reducing federal [[budget deficit]]s. But the incumbent was popular and his campaign was widely considered ineffective. Mondale was also perceived as supporting the poor at the expense of the middle class. Southern whites and northern blue-collar workers who [[Reagan Democrat|usually voted Democratic]] supported Reagan because they credited him with the economic boom and saw him as strong on [[national security]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\nIn the first televised debate, Mondale performed unexpectedly well, which led many to question Reagan's age and capacity to endure the grueling demands of the presidency (Reagan was the oldest person to serve as president\u201473 at the time\u2014while Mondale was 56). In the next debate on October 21, 1984, Reagan deflected the issue by quipping, \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\"\n\nMondale was defeated in a landslide, winning only the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] and his home state of Minnesota (even there his margin of victory was fewer than 3,800 votes),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |title=1984 Presidential Election Data\u2014Minnesota |accessdate=April 5, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010711205902/http://h0040055bf148.ne.mediaone.net/~dave/POL/PE1984/pedata1984MN.html |archivedate=July 11, 2001}}</ref> securing only 13 electoral votes to Reagan's 525. The result was the worst electoral college defeat for any Democratic Party candidate in history, and the worst for any major-party candidate since [[Alf Landon]]'s loss to [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in [[1936 United States presidential election|1936]].\n\nMondale received 37,577,352 votes\u201440.6% of the popular vote. He won 40\u201349% in California, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Vermont, Washington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin.\n\n===Private citizen and ambassador===\nMondale returned to private law practice with [[Dorsey & Whitney]] in Minneapolis in 1987. From 1986 to 1993, he chaired the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]]. During Bill Clinton's presidency, he was [[United States Ambassador to Japan]] from 1993 to 1996, chaired a bipartisan group to study [[campaign finance reform]], and was Clinton's [[Diplomatic rank|special envoy]] to [[Indonesia]] in 1998.\n\nUntil his appointment as Ambassador to Japan, Mondale was a Distinguished University Fellow in Law and Public Affairs at the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs]] at the [[University of Minnesota]]. In 1990, he established the Mondale Policy Forum at the Humphrey Institute. The forum has brought together leading scholars and policymakers for annual conferences on domestic and international issues. He also served on nonprofit boards of directors for the [[Guthrie Theater]] Foundation, the [[Mayo Clinic|Mayo Foundation]], the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, the Diogenes Institute of Higher Learning, the Prince Hall Masonic Temple, the [[RAND Corporation]], and the University of Minnesota Foundation. His corporate board memberships included BlackRock Advantage Term Trust and other BlackRock Mutual Funds, [[Cargill]] Incorporated, [[CNA Financial]], the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], First Financial Fund, and other Prudential Mutual Funds, [[Northwest Airlines]], and United HealthCare Corporation.\n\nMondale spoke before the Senate on September 4, 2002, delivering a lecture on his service, with commentary on the transformation of the office of the Vice President during the Carter administration, the Senate [[cloture]] rule for ending debate, and his view of the future of the Senate. The lecture was a part of a continuing Senate \"Leaders Lecture Series\" that ran from 1998 to 2002.<ref>\n[https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/generic/Leaders_Lecture_Series_Mondale.htm Address by Vice President Walter Mondale, September 4, 2002, in the United States Senate]<br>[https://www.senate.gov/pagelayout/history/f_two_sections_with_teasers/leader_lecture_series.htm Leader's Lecture Series Speakers]\n</ref>\n\n===2002 U.S. Senate election and beyond===\n{{Main|United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 United States Senate election in Minnesota}}\n[[File:Mondale speech.jpg|thumb|left|Former Vice President Mondale giving a lecture in the Senate in 2002]]\nIn 2002, Democratic Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] from Minnesota, who was running for reelection, died in a [[plane crash]] 11 days before the November 5 election. Mondale replaced Wellstone on the ballot at the urging of Wellstone's relatives. The Senate seat was the one Mondale had held before resigning to become Vice President in 1977.\n\nDuring his debate with the Republican nominee, former [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] Mayor [[Norm Coleman]], Mondale emphasized his experience in foreign affairs while painting Coleman as a finger-in-the-wind opportunist. \"We have seen you shift around, Norman\", Mondale said, alluding to Coleman's past as an antiwar college activist and, more recently, as a Democrat who had changed his party allegiance to the GOP while serving as mayor of St. Paul.\n\nMondale lost the election, receiving 1,067,246 votes (47.34%) to Coleman's 1,116,697 (49.53%), earning him the unique distinction of having lost a statewide general election in all 50 states as the nominee of a major party (he lost the other 49 in the 1984 presidential election and George McGovern had lost 49 states in the 1972 presidential election and lost the Massachusetts primary in 1984).
