It is often used for cooking in [[North India]], [[East India|Eastern India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Pakistan]]. In [[Bengali cuisine|Bengal]], [[Oriya cuisine|Odisha]], [[Assamese cuisine|Assam]], Meghalaya, Manipur, and  [[Nepalese cuisine|Nepal]], it is the traditionally preferred oil for cooking. The oil makes up about 30% of the mustard seeds.  It can be produced from black mustard (''[[Brassica nigra]]''), brown Indian mustard (''[[Brassica juncea|B. juncea]]''), and white mustard (''[[Brassica hirta|B. hirta]]'').\n\nThe characteristic pungent flavour of mustard oil is due to [[allyl isothiocyanate]]. Mustard oil has about 60% monounsaturated [[fatty acid]]s (42% [[erucic acid]] and 12% [[oleic acid]]); it has about 21% polyunsaturated fats (6% the omega-3 [[alpha-linolenic acid]] and 15% the omega-6 [[linoleic acid]]), and it has about 12% saturated fats.<ref>[http://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/668?fg=&man=&lfacet=&count=&max=&sort=&qlookup=&offset=&format=Full&new= Entry for mustard oil in the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference, Release 22]</ref>\n\n===Effects on health===\nMustard oil has high levels of both [[alpha-linolenic acid]] and [[erucic acid]].

This enables the typical Indian drum [[glissando]] sound, created by rubbing the heel of the hand over it. This is also known as a ''tel masala'', ''[[dholak|dholak masala]]'' or oil ''[[syahi]]''.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=18em}}\n\n* [[List of mustard brands]]\n*[[Mustard plant]]\n*[[Mustard seed]]\n*[[Condiment]]\n*[[Brassica|''Brassica'' species]]\n*[[Brassica nigra]]\n*[[Brassica juncea]]\n*[[White mustard]]\n*[[Rapeseed]]\n*[[Canola]]\n*[[Brassicaceae]]\n*[[Myrosinase]]\n*[[Glycoside|thioglycoside]]\n*[[Glucoside]]\n*[[Glucosinolate]]\n*[[Sinigrin]]\n*[[Sinalbin]]\n*[[Isothiocyanate]]\n*[[Allyl isothiocyanate]]\n*[[Bengali cuisine]]\n*[[Press cake|Oil cake]]\n\n{{div col end}}\n\n{{portal|Food}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12433513?dopt=Abstract Effect of an Indo-Mediterranean diet on progression of coronary artery disease in high risk patients (Indo-Mediterranean Diet Heart Study)] a randomised single-blind trial.\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040703133046/http://www.grad.cmu.ac.th/abstract/1999/gs/abstract/gs990057.html Isolation of Erucic Acid from Mustard Seed Oil by Candida rugosa lipase]\n*{{cite journal | author = Tanuja Rastogi | year = 2004 | title = Diet and risk of ischemic heart disease in India | journal = American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 582\u2013592 | pmid = 15051601 | last2 = Reddy | first2 = KS | last3 = Vaz | first3 = M | last4 = Spiegelman | first4 = D | last5 = Prabhakaran | first5 = D | last6 = Willett | first6 = WC | last7 = Stampfer | first7 = MJ | last8 = Ascherio | first8 = A| doi = 10.1093/ajcn/79.4.582 | doi-access = free }}\n\n{{fatsandoils}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2011}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Mustard Oil}}\n[[Category:Cooking oils]]\n[[Category:Vegetable oils]]\n[[Category:Essential oils]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, added 2 DOIs, added 1 PMC, templated 2 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mustard_oil"}

This condition is now more commonly called [[frontotemporal dementia]] by professionals, and the use of \"Pick's disease\" as a clinical diagnosis has fallen out of fashion. These two uses have previously led to confusion among professionals and patients.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of Pick's disease include difficulty in language and thinking, efforts to dissociate from family, behavioral changes, unwarranted anxiety, irrational fears, [[compulsive buying disorder]] (CBD or oniomania), impaired regulation of social conduct (e.g., breaches of etiquette, vulgar language, tactlessness, [[wikt:disinhibition|disinhibition]], misperception), passivity, low motivation ([[aboulia]]), inertia, overactivity, pacing, and wandering.<ref>Semple, David. \"Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry\". Oxford Press. 2005. p.143</ref> A characteristic of Pick\u2019s disease is that dysfunctional, argumentative, or hostile social conduct is initially exhibited towards family members and not initially exhibited in a workplace or neutral environment. <!-- Research published in the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology indicates that --> PiD is highly hereditary.<ref>American Academy of Neurology. \"Dementia: Rare Brain Disorder Is Highly Hereditary\".

PiD pathology is associated more with the frontotemporal dementia and [[progressive nonfluent aphasia]] subtypes than the [[semantic dementia]] subtype.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile other pathologies causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with a genetic cause, evidence is not conclusive in modern research on whether classical PiD pathology has or does not have a direct genetic link, or whether it has been shown to run in families or certain ethnic- or gender-specific subgroups. However, excess of a protein called \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in neural cells has been linked to neural degeneration. A buildup of A\u03b2 within cells causes inflammation, leading to cell destruction by the immune system.<ref>Carlson, Neil R. Physiology of Behavior. Eleventh ed. 543.

Pick bodies are almost universally present in patients with PiD, but some new cases of atypical PiD have come to light that lack noticeable Pick bodies.<ref name = K>{{cite journal | last = Yamakawa | first = K |author2=Takanashi M |author3=Watanabe M |author4=Nakamura N |author5=Kobayashi T |author6=Hasegawa M |author7=Mizuno Y |author8=Tanaka S |author9=Mori H   | title = Pathological and biochemical studies on a case of Pick disease with severe white matter atrophy| journal = Neuropathology | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 586\u2013591 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17203597 | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1789.2006.00738.x }}</ref> A variety of stains can aid in the visualization of Pick bodies and Pick cells, but [[immunohistochemical staining]] using anti-tau and anti-[[ubiquitin]] [[antibodies]] have proven the most efficient and specific.<ref name = Armstrong>{{cite journal | last = Armstrong | first = RA | author2 = Cairns NJ, Lantos, PL | title = A comparison of histological and immunohistochemical methods for quantifying the pathological lesions of Pick's disease | journal = Neuropathology | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 295\u2013300 | year = 1998 | pmid =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1440-1789.1998.tb00118.x}}</ref> [[Hematoxylin]] and [[eosin]] staining allows visualization of another population of Pick cells, which are both tau and [[ubiquitin]] protein negative.

Pick bodies are almost always found in several places in the brain, including the [[dentate gyrus]], the pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector and subiculum of the [[hippocampus]], and the neocortex as well as a plurality of other nuclei. The location in the layers of the brain, as well as the anatomical placement, demonstrates some of the unique features of PiD. A striking feature is that in the neocortex the Pick bodies are in the II and IV layers of the cortex, which send neurons within the cortex and to thalamic synapses, respectively. While layers III and V have very few if any Pick bodies, they show extreme neuronal loss that can, in some cases, be so severe as to leave a void in the brain altogether. Other regions involved include the caudate, which is severely affected, the dorsomedial region of the [[putamen]], the [[globus pallidus]], and locus coeruleus.<ref name = Wang/> The hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus is also very severely affected.

This condition is now more commonly called [[frontotemporal dementia]] by professionals, and the use of \"Pick's disease\" as a clinical diagnosis has fallen out of fashion. These two uses have previously led to confusion among professionals and patients.\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nThe symptoms of Pick's disease include difficulty in language and thinking, efforts to dissociate from family, behavioral changes, unwarranted anxiety, irrational fears, [[compulsive buying disorder]] (CBD or oniomania), impaired regulation of social conduct (e.g., breaches of etiquette, vulgar language, tactlessness, [[wikt:disinhibition|disinhibition]], misperception), passivity, low motivation ([[aboulia]]), inertia, overactivity, pacing, and wandering.<ref>Semple, David. \"Oxford Handbook of Psychiatry\".

PiD pathology is associated more with the frontotemporal dementia and [[progressive nonfluent aphasia]] subtypes than the [[semantic dementia]] subtype.\n\n==Causes==\nWhile other pathologies causing frontotemporal lobar degeneration are associated with a genetic cause, evidence is not conclusive in modern research on whether classical PiD pathology has or does not have a direct genetic link, or whether it has been shown to run in families or certain ethnic- or gender-specific subgroups. However, excess of a protein called \u03b2-amyloid (A\u03b2) in neural cells has been linked to neural degeneration. A buildup of A\u03b2 within cells causes inflammation, leading to cell destruction by the immune system.<ref>Carlson, Neil R. Physiology of Behavior. Eleventh ed. 543.

Pick bodies are almost always found in several places in the brain, including the [[dentate gyrus]], the pyramidal cells of the CA1 sector and subiculum of the [[hippocampus]], and the neocortex as well as a plurality of other nuclei. The location in the layers of the brain, as well as the anatomical placement, demonstrates some of the unique features of PiD. A striking feature is that in the neocortex the Pick bodies are in the II and IV layers of the cortex, which send neurons within the cortex and to thalamic synapses, respectively. While layers III and V have very few if any Pick bodies, they show extreme neuronal loss that can, in some cases, be so severe as to leave a void in the brain altogether. Other regions involved include the caudate, which is severely affected, the dorsomedial region of the [[putamen]], the [[globus pallidus]], and locus coeruleus.<ref name = Wang/> The hypothalamic lateral tuberal nucleus is also very severely affected. The cerebellar elements that are important in receiving input, including the mossy fibers and the monodendritic brush cells in the granule cell layer, and generating output signals, most notably the dentate nucleus, are stricken with tau protein inclusions.
