The city is located at the intersection of the [[DN22]] ([[European route E87|E87]]) and DN22D national roads. The DN22 road links it to the Romanian capital, [[Bucharest]] (230&nbsp;km to the West, via [[Br\u0103ila]]) and to cities of [[Isaccea]] and [[Tulcea]] (to the East). The DN22D road connects M\u0103cin through a southern route with [[Tulcea]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]. According to the 2011 census, the population numbered 7,666 inhabitants, composed of 91.46% Romanians, 4.8% [[Roma in Romania|Roma]], 2.92% Turks and 0.37% Russian Lipovans.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Arrubium|Action off M\u0103cin}}\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |5286\n|1930 |5628\n|1948 |5217\n|1956 |6533\n|1966 |8147\n|1977 |10544\n|1992 |12104\n|2002 |11803\n|2011 |8245\n}}\n\n[[Image:Geamia din M\u0103cin M\u0103cin Mosque, Romania.jpg|right|A [[mosque]] in M\u0103cin|thumb|200px]]\n\nThe town is located on an ancient [[Celt]]ic settlement, named ''[[Arrubium]]''. It was included in the [[Getae|Getic]] polities of [[Rhemaxos]] and [[Zyraxes]], then conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], which [[Arrubium (castra)|stationed a cavalry unit in this place]] between 99 and 241 AD. The ruins of the old Roman fortifications can be seen today on the top of \"Cetate\" Hill. Part of the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later [[Ottoman Empire]], it was included for some time in the [[Wallachia]]n and [[Moldavia]]n voivodates.\n\nIt was the site of the [[Battle of M\u0103cin]] in 1791.\n\n==Economy==\nThe main share of the local economy is taken by agriculture, especially animal husbandry, cereal growing and in less extent, fishing. The local industry is centered on surface mining, mainly  extraction of [[granite]] rocks, from quarries situated on southern slopes of [[M\u0103cin Mountains]]; textile and clothing manufacturing are also relatively well represented. A significant proportion of the area's population (especially women) is still involved in the textile industry. There is also a factory producing electrostatic air purifiers and ventilation systems.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, the wine industry has grown in importance, with new vineyards being planted on Carcaliu Hill along the DJ222L road, six kilometers outside city limits to the southeast. The local wine producer sells on the national and foreign markets white and red wines with the \"[[Romanian wine|D.O.C.]]\" designation, \"Controlled term of origin\", from Sarica-Niculi\u021bel region.\n\nM\u0103cin has also an \"[[inland port]]\" on the Danube, operated by two local fixed cranes and sometimes depending on the freight fluxes, by additional floating cranes brought in from [[Br\u0103ila]].

The city is located at the intersection of the [[DN22]] ([[European route E87|E87]]) and DN22D national roads. The DN22 road links it to the Romanian capital, [[Bucharest]] (230&nbsp;km to the West, via [[Br\u0103ila]]) and to cities of [[Isaccea]] and [[Tulcea]] (to the East). The DN22D road connects M\u0103cin through a southern route with [[Tulcea]] and [[Constan\u0163a]]. According to the 2011 census, the population numbered 7,666 inhabitants, composed of 91.46% Romanians, 4.8% [[Roma in Romania|Roma]], 2.92% Turks and 0.37% Russian Lipovans.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Arrubium|Action off M\u0103cin}}\n{{Historical populations\n|source = Census data\n|1912 |5286\n|1930 |5628\n|1948 |5217\n|1956 |6533\n|1966 |8147\n|1977 |10544\n|1992 |12104\n|2002 |11803\n|2011 |8245\n}}\n\n[[Image:Geamia din M\u0103cin M\u0103cin Mosque, Romania.jpg|right|A [[mosque]] in M\u0103cin|thumb|200px]]\n\nThe town is located on an ancient [[Celt]]ic settlement, named ''[[Arrubium]]''. It was included in the [[Getae|Getic]] polities of [[Rhemaxos]] and [[Zyraxes]], then conquered by the [[Roman Empire]], which [[Arrubium (castra)|stationed a cavalry unit in this place]] between 99 and 241 AD. The ruins of the old Roman fortifications can be seen today on the top of \"Cetate\" Hill. Part of the [[Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later [[Ottoman Empire]], it was included for some time in the [[Wallachia]]n and [[Moldavia]]n voivodates.\n\nIt was the site of the [[Battle of M\u0103cin]] in 1791.\n\n==Economy==\nThe main share of the local economy is taken by agriculture, especially animal husbandry, cereal growing and in less extent, fishing. The local industry is centered on surface mining, mainly  extraction of [[granite]] rocks, from quarries situated on southern slopes of [[M\u0103cin Mountains]]; textile and clothing manufacturing are also relatively well represented. A significant proportion of the area's population (especially women) is still involved in the textile industry. There is also a factory producing electrostatic air purifiers and ventilation systems.\n\nSince the mid-2000s, the wine industry has grown in importance, with new vineyards being planted on Carcaliu Hill along the DJ222L road, six kilometers outside city limits to the southeast. The local wine producer sells on the national and foreign markets white and red wines with the \"[[Romanian wine|D.O.C.]]\" designation, \"Controlled term of origin\", from Sarica-Niculi\u021bel region.\n\nM\u0103cin has also an \"[[inland port]]\" on the Danube, operated by two local fixed cranes and sometimes depending on the freight fluxes, by additional floating cranes brought in from [[Br\u0103ila]]. The port has grain-handling and some warehousing facilities.\n\n==Tourism==\n\nTourism development contributes to improving the attractiveness of the region and creates new jobs.

Involved in the discovery and definition of the [[human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) system of genetic markers, Bodmer became one of the world's leading experts in HLA serology and the genetic definition of the HLA system. A prominent figure in the field of [[immunogenetics]], her discoveries helped the understanding and development of knowledge about HLA associations with diseases including [[acquired immunodeficiency syndrome]] (AIDS) and cancer. As well as being a distinguished scientist in her own right, she collaborated throughout her career with her husband, the human and cancer geneticist [[Walter Bodmer|Sir Walter Bodmer]]. The couple had three children.\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nBorn Julia Pilkington in Manchester, she was educated at [[Manchester High School for Girls]] where she became head prefect.

However, his sister has confirmed that his name was in fact ''' Leonard Knapp'''. He also claimed that his family was killed in a car accident in 1935. In reality, the accident only killed his first wife. <ref>{{Cite news | title = People & Publishing | newspaper =  Locus | pages = 8 | date = January 2008  | publisher=[[Locus Publications]]}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDel Rey first started publishing stories in [[pulp magazines]] in the late 1930s, at the dawn of the so-called [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]. He was associated with the most prestigious science fiction magazine of the era, ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', from the time its editor [[John W. Campbell]] published his first short story in the April 1938 issue: \"The Faithful\", already under the name Lester del Rey. The December 1938 issue featured his story \"[[Helen O'Loy]]\" which was selected for the prestigious anthology ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929\u20131964|The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]]''. By the end of 1939 he had also placed stories in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' (edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]]) and ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' (Campbell),<ref name=isfdb/> which featured more horror and more fantasy respectively. In the 1950s, del Rey was one of the main authors writing science fiction for adolescents (along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Andre Norton]]). During this time some of his fiction was published under the name \"Erik van Lhin\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nDuring a period when del Rey's work was not selling well, he worked as a [[short order cook]] at the White Tower Restaurant in New York.  After he married his second wife, Helen Schlaz, in 1945, he quit that job to write full-time.  After meeting [[Scott Meredith]] at the 1947 [[World Science Fiction Convention]], he began working as a first reader for the new Scott Meredith Literary Agency, where he also served as office manager.<ref>{{cite book | last = Moskowitz| first = Sam | authorlink = Sam Moskowitz | title = Seekers of Tomorrow | publisher = World Publishing Company | year = 1966 | pages = 181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Knight | first = Damon | authorlink = Damon Knight | title = The Futurians | publisher = John Day | year = 1977 | pages = 180 | isbn = 0-381-98288-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Davin | first = Eric Leif  | title = From Wisconsin to Mars: A Conversation with Raymond F.

He was the author of many books in the juvenile [[Winston Science Fiction]] series, and the editor at [[Del Rey Books]], the fantasy and science fiction imprint of [[Ballantine Books]], along with his fourth wife [[Judy-Lynn del Rey]].\n\n==Birth name==\n\nDel Rey often told people his real name was Ramon Felipe Alvarez-del Rey (and sometimes even Ramon Felipe San Juan Mario Silvio Enrico Smith [[Harcourt Brace|Heartcourt-Brace]] Sierra y Alvarez del Rey y de los Uerdes). However, his sister has confirmed that his name was in fact ''' Leonard Knapp'''. He also claimed that his family was killed in a car accident in 1935. In reality, the accident only killed his first wife. <ref>{{Cite news | title = People & Publishing | newspaper =  Locus | pages = 8 | date = January 2008  | publisher=[[Locus Publications]]}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\nDel Rey first started publishing stories in [[pulp magazines]] in the late 1930s, at the dawn of the so-called [[Golden Age of Science Fiction]]. He was associated with the most prestigious science fiction magazine of the era, ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', from the time its editor [[John W. Campbell]] published his first short story in the April 1938 issue: \"The Faithful\", already under the name Lester del Rey. The December 1938 issue featured his story \"[[Helen O'Loy]]\" which was selected for the prestigious anthology ''[[The Science Fiction Hall of Fame, Volume One, 1929\u20131964|The Science Fiction Hall of Fame]]''. By the end of 1939 he had also placed stories in ''[[Weird Tales]]'' (edited by [[Farnsworth Wright]]) and ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown]]'' (Campbell),<ref name=isfdb/> which featured more horror and more fantasy respectively. In the 1950s, del Rey was one of the main authors writing science fiction for adolescents (along with [[Robert A. Heinlein]] and [[Andre Norton]]). During this time some of his fiction was published under the name \"Erik van Lhin\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nDuring a period when del Rey's work was not selling well, he worked as a [[short order cook]] at the White Tower Restaurant in New York.  After he married his second wife, Helen Schlaz, in 1945, he quit that job to write full-time.  After meeting [[Scott Meredith]] at the 1947 [[World Science Fiction Convention]], he began working as a first reader for the new Scott Meredith Literary Agency, where he also served as office manager.<ref>{{cite book | last = Moskowitz| first = Sam | authorlink = Sam Moskowitz | title = Seekers of Tomorrow | publisher = World Publishing Company | year = 1966 | pages = 181}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Knight | first = Damon | authorlink = Damon Knight | title = The Futurians | publisher = John Day | year = 1977 | pages = 180 | isbn = 0-381-98288-2}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal | last = Davin | first = Eric Leif  | title = From Wisconsin to Mars: A Conversation with Raymond F.

During 1952 and 1953, del Rey edited several magazines: ''Space SF'', ''Fantasy Fiction'', ''Science Fiction Adventures'' (as Philip St. John), ''Rocket Stories'' (as Wade Kaempfert), and ''Fantasy Fiction'' (as Cameron Hall).<ref>{{cite book | last = Ashley | first = Michael | authorlink = Michael Ashley (writer) | title = The History of the Science Fiction Magazine, Vol. 3: 1946-1955 | publisher = CBI  | year = 1975 | pages = 331 | isbn = 0-8092-7841-3 }}</ref> Also during 1952, his first two novels were published in the Winston juvenile series, one with an [[Italian-language]] edition in the same year.<ref name=isfdb/>\n\nIn 1957, del Rey and [[Damon Knight]] co-edited a small amateur magazine named ''[[Science Fiction Forum]]''.

Reporting that the stories in a collection of del Rey's fiction could not be dated by reading them, Budrys stated that he had remained a successful writer because \"del Rey has remained his own individual ... he writes for himself, and his readers\".

The typical del Rey story problem is that of a good and faithful being trying to understand a complex situation which prevents his immediately knowing the decent thing to do. When he writes a story whose problem becomes apparent only in the last paragraphs, this is frequently the nature of his \"trick\" ending \u2014 the mood is not shock but sorrow; the payoff is not in some irrevocable destruction of this personality but in the reader's realization that even a decent individual must pay the price of ignorance.\n\nNormally, del Rey even then leaves an opening for the protagonist to grow and go on in, and even his worst losers retrieve something \u2014 call it dignity.}}\n\n===Awards===\nDel Rey was awarded the 1972 [[Edward E.

She speculates that the ''pulao'' was an army dish in medieval India. The armies, unable to cook elaborate meals, would prepare a one-pot dish where they cooked rice with whichever meat was available.

Biryani is also cooked with additional dressings.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\"/> Pratibha Karan states that while the terms are often applied arbitrarily, the main distinction is that a biryani consists of two layers of rice with a layer of meat (or vegetables) in the middle; whereas, the pulao is not layered.<ref name=\"Vir_invention\" />\n\n[[Colleen Taylor Sen]] lists the following distinctions between biryani and pulao:<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VN_vCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA194 |title=Feasts and Fasts: A History of Food in India |last=Taylor Sen |first=Colleen |publisher=Reaktion Books |year=2014 |isbn=9781780233918 |pages=194\u2013195}}</ref>\n* Biryani is the primary dish in a meal, while the pulao is usually a secondary accompaniment to a larger meal.\n* In biryani, meat and rice are cooked separately before being layered and cooked together. Pulao is a single-pot dish: meat and rice are simmered in a liquid until the liquid is absorbed. However, some other writers, such as Holly Shaffer (based on her observations in [[Lucknow]]), R. K.

It is also known as ''kacchi yeqni''. It is typically cooked with chicken or [[goat meat]] and occasionally with fish or [[prawn]]s. The dish is cooked layered with the meat and a dahi-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot. A layer of rice (usually [[basmati rice]] or chinigura rice) is placed over it. Potatoes are often added before adding the rice layer. The pot is usually sealed (typically with wheat dough) to allow it to cook in its own steam and it is not opened until it is ready to serve.\n\n'''Tehari'''\n:[[Tehri (dish)|Tehari]], tehri or tehari are various names for the vegetarian version of biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of traditional biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In [[Kashmir]], tehari is sold as [[street food]]. Tehari became more popular during [[World War II]], when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani.\n\n'''Beef biryani'''\n[[File:Food-Beef-Biryani-2.jpg|thumb|Beef biryani |right]]\n:Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat.

Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travelers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as [[Jama Masjid]] (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as [[Chandni Chowk]]). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\" /> A non-''dum'' biryani, using a lot of green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani.

The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. However, this theory is vehemently opposed by Janab Shahanshah Mirza, great great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. According to him, Awadh's last ruler used to get an annual pension of Rs.12 Lakh and he was the highest paid pensioner in India. He was an animal lover and had set up a zoo in Kolkata. He used to spend about 25% of his pension on the maintenance of zoo and upkeep of animals. A man who can spend a substantial part of his income on the welfare of animals can certainly afford meat in his biryani, argues Mirza. He points out that potatoes were first introduced in Surat in the 17th century. They slowly spread to different regions and were brought to Bengal by English traders. In those days, potato was an exotic vegetable and because of low yield it was extremely expensive. The chefs who had accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried various combinations and experiments to enhance the taste of biryani. On one such occasion potatoes were added while cooking the biryani. It appealed to the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was so pleased that he ordered that henceforth whenever biryani was cooked it should be with this vegetable. \n:The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade uses primarily [[nutmeg]], cinnamon, [[mace (spice)|mace]] along with cloves and cardamom in the [[dahi (curd)|dahi]]-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with [[Pandanus tectorius|ketaki]] water or [[rose]] water along with saffron to give it flavour and a light yellowish colour.\n\n'''Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani'''\n:Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a type of biryani cooked in the neighboring towns of [[Ambur]] and [[Vaniyambadi]] in the [[Vellore district]] of the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]], which has a high Muslim population.

It is also known as ''kacchi yeqni''. It is typically cooked with chicken or [[goat meat]] and occasionally with fish or [[prawn]]s. The dish is cooked layered with the meat and a dahi-based marinade at the bottom of the cooking pot. A layer of rice (usually [[basmati rice]] or chinigura rice) is placed over it. Potatoes are often added before adding the rice layer. The pot is usually sealed (typically with wheat dough) to allow it to cook in its own steam and it is not opened until it is ready to serve.\n\n'''Tehari'''\n:[[Tehri (dish)|Tehari]], tehri or tehari are various names for the vegetarian version of biryani. It was developed for the Hindu bookkeepers of the Muslim [[Nawab]]s. It is prepared by adding the potatoes to the rice, as opposed to the case of traditional biryani, where the rice is added to the meat. In [[Kashmir]], tehari is sold as [[street food]]. Tehari became more popular during [[World War II]], when meat prices increased substantially and potatoes became the popular substitute in biryani.\n\n'''Beef biryani'''\n[[File:Food-Beef-Biryani-2.jpg|thumb|Beef biryani |right]]\n:Beef biryani, as the name implies, uses beef as the meat.

Until the 1950s, most people cooked biryani in their home and rarely ate at eateries outside of their homes. Hence, restaurants primarily catered to travelers and merchants. Any region that saw more of these two classes of people nurtured more restaurants, and thus their own versions of biryani. This is the reason why most shops that sold biryani in Delhi, tended to be near mosques such as [[Jama Masjid]] (for travellers) or traditional shopping districts (such as [[Chandni Chowk]]). Each part of Delhi has its own style of biryani, often based on its original purpose, thus giving rise to Nizamuddin biryani, Shahjahanabad biryani, etc.  Nizamuddin biryani usually had little expensive meat and spices as it was primarily meant to be made in bulk for offering at the [[Nizamuddin Dargah]] shrine and thereafter to be distributed to devotees.<ref name=\"ndtvravish\" /> A non-''dum'' biryani, using a lot of green chillies, popularized by the Babu Shahi Bawarchi shops located outside the National Sports Club in Delhi is informally called Babu Shahi biryani.

The poorer households of Kolkata, which could not afford meat, used potatoes instead, which went on to become a specialty of the Calcutta biryani. The Calcutta biryani primarily uses meat and potatoes. However, this theory is vehemently opposed by Janab Shahanshah Mirza, great great grandson of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. According to him, Awadh's last ruler used to get an annual pension of Rs.12 Lakh and he was the highest paid pensioner in India. He was an animal lover and had set up a zoo in Kolkata. He used to spend about 25% of his pension on the maintenance of zoo and upkeep of animals. A man who can spend a substantial part of his income on the welfare of animals can certainly afford meat in his biryani, argues Mirza. He points out that potatoes were first introduced in Surat in the 17th century. They slowly spread to different regions and were brought to Bengal by English traders. In those days, potato was an exotic vegetable and because of low yield it was extremely expensive. The chefs who had accompanied Nawab Wajid Ali Shah tried various combinations and experiments to enhance the taste of biryani. On one such occasion potatoes were added while cooking the biryani. It appealed to the taste buds of Nawab Wajid Ali Shah. He was so pleased that he ordered that henceforth whenever biryani was cooked it should be with this vegetable. \n:The Calcutta biryani is much lighter on spices. The marinade uses primarily [[nutmeg]], cinnamon, [[mace (spice)|mace]] along with cloves and cardamom in the [[dahi (curd)|dahi]]-based marinade for the meat which is cooked separately from rice. This combination of spices gives it a distinct flavour compared to other styles of biryani. The rice is flavoured with [[Pandanus tectorius|ketaki]] water or [[rose]] water along with saffron to give it flavour and a light yellowish colour.\n\n'''Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani'''\n:Ambur/Vaniyambadi biryani is a type of biryani cooked in the neighboring towns of [[Ambur]] and [[Vaniyambadi]] in the [[Vellore district]] of the northeastern part of [[Tamil Nadu]], which has a high Muslim population.

Some of their illustrious cooks set up their own stalls and introduced Kalyani biryani to the local populace of Hyderabad state.{{cn|date=January 2018}}\n'''Degh Ki biryani'''\n:Degh ki  biryani is a typical biryani made from small cubes of Beef or mutton.This biryani is famous in [[Parbhani]] and generally serves in marriages.\n:The meat is flavoured  with [[ginger]], garlic, [[Chili pepper|red chili]], [[cumin]], [[garam masala]], fried onion and [[Curd]]. This biryani is also known as kachay gosht ki biryani or the dum biryani, where the  meat is marinated and cooked along with the rice. It is left on a slow fire or dum for a fragrant and aromatic flavor. \n'''Sri Lankan biryani'''\n[[File:Chicken Biryani.jpg|thumbnail|Sri Lankan chicken biryani]]\n:Biryani was brought into [[Sri Lanka]] by the South Indian [[Muslims]] who were trading in the Northern part of Sri Lanka and in Colombo in the early 1900s.{{cn|date=February 2018}} In Sri Lanka, it is ''Buryani'', a colloquial word which generated from Buhari Biryani.

Biryan traces its origins to the same source as biryani, and is today sold in [[Afghanistan]] as well as in [[Bhopal]], India. Biryan is prepared by cooking [[gosht]] and rice together, but without the additional gravy (''yakhni'') and other condiments that are used in biryani. The Delhi-based historian Sohail Hashmi refers to the biryan as midway between the [[Pilaf|pulao]] and biryani.

It seems she enjoyed periodic visits to the [[Court (royal)|court]] and to London, including court visits during the summers of 1587 and 1588 and one that lasted from November 1591 to July 1592.<ref>David N.

She also notes he had hoped for an annuity of \u00a340 a year ({{Inflation|GBP|40|1589|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from Arbella based on the fact that he had \"been so much damnified [i.e. that much out of pocket] by leaving the University\". This has led to speculation that Morley was the poet [[Christopher Marlowe]],<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe'', 1992, pp.340\u2013342</ref> whose name was sometimes spelled that way.\n\n== Heiress to the English throne==\n{{details|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nFor some time before 1592, Arbella was considered one of the natural candidates to succeed her first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Marshall, p.601</ref> However, between the end of 1592 and the spring of 1593, the influential Cecils \u2013 Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, and his son, Secretary of State [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] \u2013 turned their attention away from Arbella towards her cousin [[James VI of Scotland]], regarding him as a preferable successor.<ref>Handover, ''The Second Cecil'', 55-6; 297; Read, ''Lord Burghley'', 484</ref>\n\nSometimes she was invited to Elizabeth's court, but much of her time she spent away living with her grandmother.

When she was invited to participate by agreeing in writing to [[Philip III of Spain]], however, she immediately reported the invitation to the king.<ref>Gristwood, pp. 267\u2013269</ref>\n\n==Marriage negotiations==\nOwing to Arbella's status as a possible heir to the throne, there were discussions of appropriate marriages for her throughout her childhood. \n\nIn 1588, it was proposed to James VI of Scotland that [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]], should be married to Arbella, but nothing seems to have come of this suggestion either.<ref>Gristwood, p.109</ref> James VI was interested in this match but the Countess of Lennox's servant [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] discouraged him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> Other potential matches were the sons of  [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who could claim the English throne as descendants of [[John of Gaunt]]. The idea was to secure toleration for English Catholics or even win Arbella for the Catholic faith. However, the eldest son, [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio]], was already married, and the younger son, [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo]], was a Cardinal. The Pope was reportedly prepared to absolve Odoardo from his obligations but the resistance of Queen Elizabeth I to such a marriage stopped the plan probably even before Arbella could be approached.<ref name=AS /> \n\nIn the closing months of Elizabeth's reign, Arbella fell into trouble through reports that she intended to marry Edward Seymour, a member of the prominent Seymour family. This was reported to the Queen by the supposed groom's grandfather, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]]. Arbella denied having any intention of marrying without the Queen's permission. In 1604, [[Sigismund III Vasa]], [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], sent an ambassador to England to ask for Arbella to be his wife. This offer was rejected.<ref>Gristwood, p. 301\u2013302</ref>\n\n==Marriage to William, Lord Beauchamp==\n[[File:2ndDukeOfSomerset.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William, 2nd Duke of Somerset]].]]\n[[File:Houghton - STC 8469.

She followed, in order of precedence, Anne of Denmark and Princess Elizabeth.<ref>''Memorials of Affairs of State from the papers of Ralph Winwood'', vol. 3 (London, 1725), p. 181: Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales'' (London, 1986), pp. 155-158.</ref>\n\nArbella, who was fourth in line to the English throne, was in trouble again in 1610 for planning to marry [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]], then known as Lord Beauchamp, who later succeeded as 2nd [[Duke of Somerset]]. Lord Beauchamp was sixth-in-line, grandson of [[Lady Katherine Grey]], a younger sister of [[Lady Jane Grey]] and a granddaughter of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]], younger sister of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Arbella's ancestor, Margaret Tudor. Under the circumstances, the King wondered whether the marriage was the prelude to an attempt to seize [[the Crown]] itself.\n\nAlthough the couple at first denied that any arrangement existed between them, they later married in secret on 22 June 1610 at [[Greenwich Palace]]. For marrying without his permission, King James imprisoned them: Arbella in Sir Thomas Perry's house in [[Lambeth]] and Lord Beauchamp in the [[Tower of London]]. The couple had some liberty within those buildings, and some of Arbella's letters to Beauchamp and to the King during this period survive.  When the King learned of her letters to Lord Beauchamp, however, he ordered Arbella's transfer to the custody of [[William James (bishop)|William James]], [[Bishop of Durham]]. Arbella claimed to be ill, so her departure for [[Durham, England|Durham]] was delayed.\n\nThe couple used that delay to plan their escape.  Arbella dressed as a man and escaped to Lee (in [[Kent]]), but Lord Beauchamp did not meet her there before their getaway ship was to sail for France.  Sara Jayne Steen records that Imogen, the virtuous, cross-dressed heroine of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1610\u20131611), has sometimes been read as a reference to Arbella<ref>Steen, 96</ref> but the warrant for the couple's arrest is dated 3 June 1611 and [[Simon Forman]] recorded seeing a production of that play 2 months earlier in April.\n\nBeauchamp did escape from the Tower, but by the time he reached Lee, Arbella was gone, so he caught the next ship to [[Flanders]]. Arbella's ship was overtaken by King James's men just before it reached [[Calais]], France. She was returned to England and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  She never saw her husband again and died in the Tower on 25 September 1615 from illnesses exacerbated by her refusal to eat.\n\n==Literary legacy==\nOver one hundred letters written by Arbella have survived. In 1993, a collection of them was published, edited by Sara Jayne Steen, providing details of her activities and ideas. The English novelist and historical biographer [[Doris Leslie]] wrote 'Wreath for Arabella' in 1948. [[Emilia Lanier]]'s poem ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' is dedicated to Arbella. Lanier recalls a former personal friendship with Arbella that was unrequited; she addresses her as \"Great learned Ladie ... whom long I have known but not known so much as I desired\".\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem ''Arabella Stuart'' is about Arbella, imagining her thoughts as she died in prison.

During the reign of [[King James VI and I]], she married [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset]] in secret. King James imprisoned William Seymour and placed her under house arrest.

Arbella was therefore a great-great-granddaughter of King Henry VII of England and was in line of succession to the English throne, although she did not herself aspire to it.<ref>Rosalind K.

Her maternal grandparents were [[William Cavendish (courtier)|Sir William Cavendish]] and his wife [[Bess of Hardwick|Elizabeth]], better known as \"Bess of Hardwick\".\n\nIn her final days as a prisoner in the [[Tower of London]], Arbella Seymour (her married name), refusing to eat, fell ill, and died on 25 September 1615. She was buried in [[Westminster Abbey]] on 29 September 1615. In the 19th century, during a search for the tomb of James VI and I, Arbella's lead coffin was found in the vault of Mary, Queen of Scots, placed directly on top of that of the Scots queen.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanley|first=A.

She was raised by her mother Elizabeth Cavendish, Countess of Lennox, until 1582.<ref>Antonia Fraser, ''Mary, Queen of Scots'', p. 535</ref> The death of her mother left seven-year-old Arbella an orphan, whereupon she became the [[Ward (law)|ward]] of her grandmother Bess, rather than [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]] the Master of the [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Court of Wards]], as might have been expected.<ref>Sarah Gristwood, ''Arbella: England's Lost Queen'', Bantam, 2003, p.49</ref>\n\nDuring most of her childhood she lived in the [[protective isolation]] of [[Hardwick Hall]] in Derbyshire with her grandmother, who had married [[George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury]] in 1568. It seems she enjoyed periodic visits to the [[Court (royal)|court]] and to London, including court visits during the summers of 1587 and 1588 and one that lasted from November 1591 to July 1592.<ref>David N. Durant, ''Arbella Stuart: A Rival to the Queen'', 1978, pp.41, 51, 61</ref>\n\nStarting in early 1589 or thereabouts \"one Morley ... attended on Arbell and read to her\", as reported in a dispatch from Bess of Hardwick to Lord Burghley, dated 21 September 1592.<ref name=AS>Blanche C. Hardy, [https://archive.org/stream/arbellastuartbio00harduoft/arbellastuartbio00harduoft_djvu.txt ''Arbella Stuart: A Biography''], Dutton, 1913, pp.64\u201367</ref> Bess recounts Morley's service to Arbella over \"the space of three years and a half\". She also notes he had hoped for an annuity of \u00a340 a year ({{Inflation|GBP|40|1589|r=-2|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from Arbella based on the fact that he had \"been so much damnified [i.e. that much out of pocket] by leaving the University\". This has led to speculation that Morley was the poet [[Christopher Marlowe]],<ref>Charles Nicholl, ''The Reckoning: The Murder of Christopher Marlowe'', 1992, pp.340\u2013342</ref> whose name was sometimes spelled that way.\n\n== Heiress to the English throne==\n{{details|Succession to Elizabeth I of England}}\nFor some time before 1592, Arbella was considered one of the natural candidates to succeed her first cousin twice removed, Queen Elizabeth I.<ref>Marshall, p.601</ref> However, between the end of 1592 and the spring of 1593, the influential Cecils \u2013 Elizabeth's Lord Treasurer, Lord Burghley, and his son, Secretary of State [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Sir Robert Cecil]] \u2013 turned their attention away from Arbella towards her cousin [[James VI of Scotland]], regarding him as a preferable successor.<ref>Handover, ''The Second Cecil'', 55-6; 297; Read, ''Lord Burghley'', 484</ref>\n\nSometimes she was invited to Elizabeth's court, but much of her time she spent away living with her grandmother.

When she was invited to participate by agreeing in writing to [[Philip III of Spain]], however, she immediately reported the invitation to the king.<ref>Gristwood, pp. 267\u2013269</ref>\n\n==Marriage negotiations==\nOwing to Arbella's status as a possible heir to the throne, there were discussions of appropriate marriages for her throughout her childhood. \n\nIn 1588, it was proposed to James VI of Scotland that [[Ludovic Stuart, 2nd Duke of Lennox]], should be married to Arbella, but nothing seems to have come of this suggestion either.<ref>Gristwood, p.109</ref> James VI was interested in this match but the Countess of Lennox's servant [[Thomas Fowler (courtier)|Thomas Fowler]] discouraged him.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 17.</ref> Other potential matches were the sons of  [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma]], who could claim the English throne as descendants of [[John of Gaunt]]. The idea was to secure toleration for English Catholics or even win Arbella for the Catholic faith. However, the eldest son, [[Ranuccio I Farnese, Duke of Parma|Ranuccio]], was already married, and the younger son, [[Odoardo Farnese (cardinal)|Odoardo]], was a Cardinal. The Pope was reportedly prepared to absolve Odoardo from his obligations but the resistance of Queen Elizabeth I to such a marriage stopped the plan probably even before Arbella could be approached.<ref name=AS /> \n\nIn the closing months of Elizabeth's reign, Arbella fell into trouble through reports that she intended to marry Edward Seymour, a member of the prominent Seymour family. This was reported to the Queen by the supposed groom's grandfather, [[Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford]]. Arbella denied having any intention of marrying without the Queen's permission. In 1604, [[Sigismund III Vasa]], [[List of Polish monarchs|King of Poland]], sent an ambassador to England to ask for Arbella to be his wife. This offer was rejected.<ref>Gristwood, p. 301\u2013302</ref>\n\n==Marriage to William, Lord Beauchamp==\n[[File:2ndDukeOfSomerset.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William, 2nd Duke of Somerset]].]]\n[[File:Houghton - STC 8469. Arabella Stuart warrant.jpg|thumb|Royal warrant for arrest of Arbella, Lady Beauchamp, and [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|Lord Beauchamp]], 1611]]\nOn 5 June 1610 Arbella danced in [[Samuel Daniel]]'s masque ''[[Tethys' Festival]]'', one of the festivities at the investiture of Prince Henry as [[Prince of Wales]]. She followed, in order of precedence, Anne of Denmark and Princess Elizabeth.<ref>''Memorials of Affairs of State from the papers of Ralph Winwood'', vol. 3 (London, 1725), p. 181: Roy Strong, ''Henry Prince of Wales'' (London, 1986), pp. 155-158.</ref>\n\nArbella, who was fourth in line to the English throne, was in trouble again in 1610 for planning to marry [[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]], then known as Lord Beauchamp, who later succeeded as 2nd [[Duke of Somerset]]. Lord Beauchamp was sixth-in-line, grandson of [[Lady Katherine Grey]], a younger sister of [[Lady Jane Grey]] and a granddaughter of [[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]], younger sister of King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and Arbella's ancestor, Margaret Tudor. Under the circumstances, the King wondered whether the marriage was the prelude to an attempt to seize [[the Crown]] itself.\n\nAlthough the couple at first denied that any arrangement existed between them, they later married in secret on 22 June 1610 at [[Greenwich Palace]]. For marrying without his permission, King James imprisoned them: Arbella in Sir Thomas Perry's house in [[Lambeth]] and Lord Beauchamp in the [[Tower of London]]. The couple had some liberty within those buildings, and some of Arbella's letters to Beauchamp and to the King during this period survive.  When the King learned of her letters to Lord Beauchamp, however, he ordered Arbella's transfer to the custody of [[William James (bishop)|William James]], [[Bishop of Durham]]. Arbella claimed to be ill, so her departure for [[Durham, England|Durham]] was delayed.\n\nThe couple used that delay to plan their escape.  Arbella dressed as a man and escaped to Lee (in [[Kent]]), but Lord Beauchamp did not meet her there before their getaway ship was to sail for France.  Sara Jayne Steen records that Imogen, the virtuous, cross-dressed heroine of [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Cymbeline]]'' (1610\u20131611), has sometimes been read as a reference to Arbella<ref>Steen, 96</ref> but the warrant for the couple's arrest is dated 3 June 1611 and [[Simon Forman]] recorded seeing a production of that play 2 months earlier in April.\n\nBeauchamp did escape from the Tower, but by the time he reached Lee, Arbella was gone, so he caught the next ship to [[Flanders]]. Arbella's ship was overtaken by King James's men just before it reached [[Calais]], France. She was returned to England and imprisoned in the [[Tower of London]].  She never saw her husband again and died in the Tower on 25 September 1615 from illnesses exacerbated by her refusal to eat.\n\n==Literary legacy==\nOver one hundred letters written by Arbella have survived. In 1993, a collection of them was published, edited by Sara Jayne Steen, providing details of her activities and ideas. The English novelist and historical biographer [[Doris Leslie]] wrote 'Wreath for Arabella' in 1948. [[Emilia Lanier]]'s poem ''Salve Deus Rex Judaeorum'' is dedicated to Arbella. Lanier recalls a former personal friendship with Arbella that was unrequited; she addresses her as \"Great learned Ladie ... whom long I have known but not known so much as I desired\".\n\n[[Felicia Hemans]]' poem ''Arabella Stuart'' is about Arbella, imagining her thoughts as she died in prison. In 2005, [[Sarah Gristwood]] published ''Arbella: England's Lost Queen''.\n\n==Family tree==\n{{family tree/start|align=center}}\n{{familytree | Jim| | | | | | | | | | | |Hank|Jim=[[James III of Scotland]]|Hank=[[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | | |,|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|.| |}}\n{{familytree | Jim|v|Marge| | | | | | | |Henry| | | | | |Mary|Jim=[[James IV of Scotland]]|Henry=[[Henry VIII of England]]|Mary=[[Mary Tudor, Queen of France|Mary Tudor]]|Marge=[[Margaret Tudor]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | |!| | | | | |,|-|-|-|+|-|-|-|.| | | |!| | | ||}}\n{{familytree | |Jim| | |Marge| |Mary| |Bess| |Ed| |Fran|Mary=[[Mary I of England]]|Bess=[[Elizabeth I of England]]|Ed=[[Edward VI]]|Fran=[[Frances Grey, Duchess of Suffolk|Frances Brandon]]|Jim=[[James V of Scotland]]|Marge=[[Margaret Douglas]]}}\n{{familytree | |!| | | |,|-|^|-|.| | | | | | | | | | | |,|-|^|-|.|}}\n{{familytree |Mary|v|Henry| |Charles| | | | | | | | | |Jane| |Kate|Jane=[[Lady Jane Grey|Jane Grey]]|Kate=[[Lady Katherine Grey|Katherine Grey]]|Mary=[[Mary, Queen of Scots]]|Henry=[[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Henry Stuart]]|Charles=[[Charles Stuart, 1st Earl of Lennox|Charles Stuart]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!| |}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | |Ed|Jim=[[Christopher Storey of England 6th earl of The Chantry Arms]]|Ed=[[Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp|Edward Seymour]]}}\n{{familytree | | | |!| | | | | |!| | | | | | | | | | | | | | | |!|}}\n{{familytree | | |Jim| | | |Bella|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|Will|Will=[[William Seymour, 2nd Duke of Somerset|William Seymour]]|Bella=Arbella Stuart|Jim=[[James VI and I]]}}\n{{Family tree/end}}\n\n===Ancestry===\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.
