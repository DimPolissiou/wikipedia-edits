He gained a following in 2013, posting song covers on the video-sharing application [[Vine (software)|Vine]]. The following year, he caught the attention of artist manager [[Andrew Gertler]] and [[Island Records]] [[Artists and repertoire|A&R]] Ziggy Chareton, which led to him signing a deal with the record label. He has since released [[Shawn Mendes discography|three studio albums]], headlined [[Shawn Mendes#Tours|three world tours]], and received [[List of awards and nominations received by Shawn Mendes|several awards]].\n\nMendes released his [[The Shawn Mendes EP|self-titled debut EP]] (2014) and his debut studio album ''[[Handwritten (Shawn Mendes album)|Handwritten]]'' (2015), whose single \"[[Stitches (Shawn Mendes song)|Stitches]]\" reached number one in the United Kingdom and the top 10 in the United States and Canada.

His [[Shawn Mendes (album)|self-titled third studio album]] (2018) was supported by the lead single \"[[In My Blood (Shawn Mendes song)|In My Blood]]\". All three albums debuted atop the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], with the first one making Mendes one of five artists ever to debut at number one before the age of 18 and the third one making him the third-youngest artist to achieve three number one albums. In 2017, Mendes became the first artist to land three number-one singles on the ''Billboard'' [[Adult Contemporary (chart)|Adult Contemporary]] chart before turning 20 years old. In 2018, he became the first artist to achieve four number-one singles on the [[Adult Top 40|Adult Pop Songs]] chart before the age of 20 as well. In 2019, he released the hit singles \"[[If I Can't Have You (Shawn Mendes song)|If I Can't Have You]]\" and \"[[Se\u00f1orita (Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello song)|Se\u00f1orita]]\", with the latter peaking at number one on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].\n\nAmong his accolades, Mendes has won 13 [[Society of Composers, Authors and Music Publishers of Canada|SOCAN]] awards, 10 [[MTV Europe Music Award]]s, eight [[Juno Award]]s, eight [[iHeartRadio MMVAs]], two [[American Music Awards]], and received three [[Grammy Award]] nominations.

Research published in March 2013 shows that B\u00e9ziers dates from 575&nbsp;BC, making it older than [[Agde]] (Greek Agathe Tyche, founded in 525&nbsp;BC) and a bit younger than [[Marseille]] (Greek Massalia, founded in 600&nbsp;BC)<ref>{{cite web|author=Ludovic Trabuchet |url=http://www.midilibre.fr/2013/03/11/beziers-la-grecque-des-fouilles-au-livre,658082.php |title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations sur le pass\u00e9 grec de B\u00e9ziers |website=Midi Libre|date= 11 March 2013 |language=French |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe site has been occupied since [[Neolithic]] times, before the influx of [[Celts]]. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''Betarra'' was on the [[Roman roads|road]] that linked [[Provence]] with [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. The Romans refounded the city as a new ''colonia'' for veterans in 36\u201335&nbsp;BC and called it ''Colonia Julia Baeterrae Septimanorum''. Stones from the Roman [[amphitheatre]] were used to construct the [[Defensive wall|city wall]] during the 3rd century.\n\n[[Wine|White wine]] was exported to Rome. A ''dolia'' discovered in an excavation near Rome is marked \"I am a wine from Baeterrae and I am five years old\"; another simply \"white wine of Baeterrae\". It was occupied by the [[Moors]] between 720 and 752.\n\nFrom the 10th to the 12th century, B\u00e9ziers was the centre of a [[List of viscounts of B\u00e9ziers|Viscountship of B\u00e9ziers]]. The viscounts ruled most of the [[coastal plain]] around B\u00e9ziers, including also the town of [[Agde]]. They also controlled the major east-west route through Languedoc, which roughly follows the old Roman [[Via Domitia]], with the two key bridges over the Orb at B\u00e9ziers and over the [[H\u00e9rault River|H\u00e9rault]] at [[Saint-Thib\u00e9ry]].\n\nAfter the death of Viscount William around 990, the viscounty passed to his daughter Garsendis and her husband, count Raimond-Roger of [[Carcassonne]] (d. {{circa}}1012). It was then ruled by their son Peter-Raimond (d. {{circa}}1060) and his son Roger (d. 1067), both of whom were also [[County of Carcassonne|Counts of Carcassonne]].\n\nRoger died without issue and B\u00e9ziers passed to his sister Ermengard and her husband Raimond-Bertrand [[Trencavel]]. The Trencavels ruled for the next 142&nbsp;years, until the [[Albigensian Crusade]], a formal [[crusade]] (holy war) authorised by [[Pope Innocent III]].\n\n===Massacre at B\u00e9ziers===\n{{main|Massacre at B\u00e9ziers}}\nB\u00e9ziers was a Languedoc stronghold of [[Catharism]], which [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]] condemned as heretical and which Catholic forces exterminated in the [[Albigensian Crusade]].\n[[File:Beziers (the old bridge).JPG|thumb|The old bridge]]\nB\u00e9ziers was the first place to be attacked. The crusaders reached the town on 21 July 1209. B\u00e9ziers' Catholics were given an ultimatum to hand over the heretics or leave before the crusaders besieged the city and to \"avoid sharing their fate and perishing with them\".<ref name=lebedel>{{cite book| author=Claude Leb\u00e9del| title=Understanding the tragedy of the Cathars |publisher=Editions Ouest-France, 2011 |page=59f| isbn=978-2-7373-5267-6}}</ref> However, they refused and resisted with the Cathars. The town was sacked the following day and in the bloody massacre, no one was spared, not even Catholic priests and those who took refuge in the churches.\n\nOne of the commanders of the crusade was the [[Papal legate]] [[Arnaud Amalric|Arnaud-Amaury]] (or Arnald Amalaricus, Abbot of [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey|Citeaux]]). When asked by a crusader how to tell Catholics from Cathars once they had taken the city, the abbot supposedly replied, \"''[[Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius]]''\" (\"Kill them all, for the Lord knoweth them that are His\"). (This oft quoted phrase is sourced from [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] along with a story of all the heretics who desecrated a copy of the Gospels and threw it down from the town's walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/caesarius-heresies.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Caesarius of Heisterbach: Medieval Heresies: Waldensians, Albigensians, Intellectuals |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>) Amalric's own version of the siege, described in his letter to Pope Innocent III in August 1209 (col. 139), states:\n<blockquote>\nWhile discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying \"to arms, to arms!\", within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and B\u00e9ziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt&nbsp;...<ref>[[Albigensian Crusade#cite note-21|Albigensian Crusade]]</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe invaders burned the [[B\u00e9ziers Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Nazaire]], which collapsed on those who had taken refuge inside. The town was pillaged and burnt. By some accounts, none was left alive \u2013 by others, there were a handful of survivors. (A plaque opposite the cathedral records the \"Day of Butchery\" perpetrated by the \"northern barons\".)\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nDespite the massacre, the city was repopulated. A few parts of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral of St-Nazaire had survived the carnage, and repairs started in 1215. The restoration, along with that of the rest of the city, continued until the 15th century.\n\nB\u00e9ziers became part of the royal domain in 1247.\n\nRule of the city was for a long time divided among three powers: the Bishopric, which reached its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries when it was held by the [[Bonsi]] family, allied to the [[Medici]]; the consuls, local magistrates created at the end of the 12th century; and finally the king, represented by a \"Viguier for judicial affairs\", and from the 17th century onwards by a sub-delegate of the Intendant.\n\nB\u00e9ziers was not damaged in the [[Hundred Years War]].\n\nOn 8 September, 1381, a riot broke out at the seat of the municipal council, rioters setting the Town House on fire. The councillors tried to take refuge in the tower, but fire spread there as well, and they all died either by fire or in jumping from the tower to the square.\n\n===Early modern times===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nKing [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564\u20131566), accompanied by the Court and the great men of the kingdom: his brother the [[Duke of Anjou]], [[Henri of Navarre]], and the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine.\n\nIn 1551, B\u00e9ziers became the seat of a [[Seneschal]], being removed from the jurisdiction of the Seneschals of [[Carcassonne]].\n\nThe city served as a rear base during various wars of the modern period, especially those against the Habsburgs. It was only once directly threatened. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the British in 1710 landed at [[S\u00e8te]] and moved to within a few kilometres of B\u00e9ziers, before being repulsed by the [[Duke of Roquelaure]]. B\u00e9ziers was at the heart of the [[Montmorency Revolt]] in 1632. It was in B\u00e9ziers that [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Gaston d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Henri II de Montmorency]], Governor of [[Languedoc]], province met at the beginning of the rebellion. It was also here that the king, by the [[Edict of Beziers]] (October 1632) abolished the privileges of the province. (They were restored in 1649.)\n\nDuring the 18th century, B\u00e9ziers prospered, notably thanks to the cultivation of vines which enabled it to become an important centre for alcohol trading.\n\n===French Revolution===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nDuring the French Revolution, citizens of B\u00e9ziers met in a revolutionary society created in May 1790 and numbering up to 400 members. It had several successive names: first, \"The Literary and Patriotic Cabinet\", a name still derived from the social life of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]; it then became \"Society of the Friends of the Constitution and Liberty\". Later becoming affiliated to the [[Jacobin Club]] of Paris, the B\u00e9ziers organization was accordingly renamed the \"Society of the Jacobins\"; then, the abolition of the French monarchy precipitated two further changes of name: \"Society of Brothers and Friends of the Republic\" and then \"Regenerated Society of the Jacobins, Friends of the Republic\".\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, B\u00e9ziers was the chief town of the district of B\u00e9ziers. The city did not take part in the [[Girondins|Girondin]] (\"Federalist\") movement.\n\n===Napoleon the Third===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the repression following [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napol\u00e9on]]'s coup d'\u00e9tat in 1851, troops fired on and killed Republican protesters in B\u00e9ziers. Others were condemned to death or transported to [[French Guiana|Guiana]], including a former mayor who died at sea attempting to escape from there. In the Place de la R\u00e9volution a plaque and a monument by [[Jean Antoine Injalbert]] commemorates these events. (Injalbert also designed the Fontaine du Titan in B\u00e9ziers' Pl\u00e2teau des Po\u00e8tes park and the [[Moli\u00e8re]] monument in nearby [[P\u00e9zenas]].)\n\n===The Languedoc vine growers' revolt in B\u00e9ziers===\n{{main|Revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nWhile elsewhere in France, the area planted with vines was decreasing, it increased in the Departments of [[Aude]], Gard, [[H\u00e9rault]] and the [[Pyrenees-Orientales]]. Together, these supplied some 40% of French wine production. Haut Languedoc, and more particularly the [[Biterrois]] and B\u00e9ziers, proclaimed themselves to be \"The World Capital of Wine\" and grew rapidly. Great fortunes were made. Large landowners, coming from industry, finance or the liberal professions, gained possession of immense vineyards.\n\nThere was also a growing foreign competition, with smuggled wines appearing on the market. The fraudsters remained unpunished. In 1892, the winegrowers of the Midi demanded \"The restoration and enforcement of customs duties\". But the market remained partly held by wines made from imported dried grapes (such as grapes from [[Corinth]]), and wines called \"wet\" (adulterated with water). Though the vintners attached great importance to this unfair competition, in fact it did not represent more than 5% of the market.\n\nOn 12 May 1907, no less than 150,000 protesters gathered in B\u00e9ziers with the declared aim of \"Defending the Southern Viticulture\". The crowd spilled into Paul-Riquet and the Champ-de-Mars. The slogans on the banners Proclaimed: \"Victory or death! Enough of talking, the time has come for action! Death to fraudsters! Bread or death! Live by working or die fighting!\".\n\nThe demonstrators, who came from more than 200 communes, were joined by numerous Biterrois employees and shopkeepers. The event ended with speeches on the Place de la Citadelle, (now Place Jean-Jaur\u00e8s). the Speakers included [[Marcelin Albert]] who issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that it raise the price of wine, [[Ernest Ferroul]] who advocated tax refusal and the B\u00e9ziers Mayor \u00c9mile Suchon, (close to [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]]), who took a stand in support of the winegrowers' struggle. There were some minor incidents during the dispersal of the demonstrators.\n\nOn 16 May, the B\u00e9ziers municipal council, of Radical and Socialist tendency, resigned. The pressure of the street continued. The police station and the town hall fa\u00e7ade were set on fire. Alerted, [[Georges Clemenceau]] decided to launch a counterattack. The 17th regiment of line infantry, composed of reservists and conscripts, was on his orders transferred from Beziers to [[Agde]] on 18 June 1907.\n\nOn the evening of 20 June, learning of the [[Narbonne]] shooting, about 500 soldiers of the 6th company of the 17th regiment mutinied, plundered the armory and headed for B\u00e9ziers. They traveled about twenty kilometers by night. On 21 June, in the early morning, they arrived in town. They were warmly welcomed by the Biterrois, \"fraternizing with the demonstrators, and peacefully opposing the armed forces\". The soldiers sat down on the All\u00e9es Paul Riquet and the population offered them wine and food.\n\nThe South was on the brink of insurrection. In [[Paulhan, H\u00e9rault|Paulhan]], the railway was taken out of commission by protesters who stopped a military convoy sent to quell the mutineers. In [[Lod\u00e8ve]], the sub-prefect was taken hostage. The military authorities were not ready to accept this mutiny, apprehensive that the example of the 17th regiment would give similar ideas to other regiments in the region.\n\nIn Paris, the Republic trembled, as Clemenceau had to face a vote of no confidence. However, he survived by letting the military command urgently negotiate with the mutineers. In the afternoon, after obtaining a guarantee that no sanctions will be imposed on them, the 17th soldiers put down their arms and marched to the station under escort, without any major incident. On 22 June, they returned by train to their barracks. Clemenceau announced the end of the mutiny and gained a parliamentary vote of confidence by 327 votes to 223.\n\nOn 23 June, a law was finally passed, which repressed the massive chaptalisation of the wines.\n\nNegotiations and the scale of the movement prevented collective punishment: the mutineers of the 17th were assigned to [[Gafsa]] ([[Tunisia]]), a place where soldiers were often sent for \"disciplinary companies\", but these soldiers remained outside this framework, and were under ordinary military status. There was therefore no penal sanction for the revolt of the 17th, contrary to the legend that developed on this subject. However, during the [[First World War]], haunted by their reputation as deserters, many of them were sent to the front line, particularly in the bloody assaults of 1914.\n\nThe mutiny of soldiers of the 17th has remained in historical memory, especially with the words of [[Mont\u00e9hus]]' anti-militarist song \"Gloire au 17\", with the refrain: \"Salute, salute to you / Brave soldiers of the seventeenth....\"\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left|\n1793|12501|\n1800|14535|\n1806|14565|\n1821|16140|\n1831|16679|\n1836|16233|\n1841|18874|\n1846|19596|\n1851|19333|\n1856|23557|\n1861|24270|\n1866|27722|\n1872|31468|\n1876|38227|\n1881|42915|\n1886|42785|\n1891|45475|\n1896|48012|\n1901|52310|\n1906|52268|\n1911|51042|\n1921|56008|\n1926|65754|\n1931|71527|\n1936|73305|\n1946|64561|\n1954|64929|\n1962|73528|\n1968|80481|\n1975|84029|\n1982|76647|\n1990|70996|\n1999|69153|\n2008|71672|\n2012|72970|\n2014|75701}}\n\nThe inhabitants of B\u00e9ziers are known as ''Biterrois'', after ''Baeterrae'', the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman name]] for the town.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Nazaire B\u00e9ziers.JPG|thumb|Saint-Nazaire cathedral]]\n[[File:Saint-Jean d'Aureilhan.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Le domaine de Saint-Jean-d'Aureilhan, neo-Gothic style tower (19th century)]]\n[[File:Beziers2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|\u00c9glise de la Madeleine]]\n[[File:Rochelongue 129 B\u00e9ziers.JPG|thumb|Place Gabriel P\u00e9ri]]\n*[[B\u00e9ziers Cathedral|Saint-Nazaire Cathedral]] : Situated in the high part of town, it occupies a picturesque site, visible from afar when approaching B\u00e9ziers on the road from [[Narbonne]].

Research published in March 2013 shows that B\u00e9ziers dates from 575&nbsp;BC, making it older than [[Agde]] (Greek Agathe Tyche, founded in 525&nbsp;BC) and a bit younger than [[Marseille]] (Greek Massalia, founded in 600&nbsp;BC)<ref>{{cite web|author=Ludovic Trabuchet |url=http://www.midilibre.fr/2013/03/11/beziers-la-grecque-des-fouilles-au-livre,658082.php |title=Des r\u00e9v\u00e9lations sur le pass\u00e9 grec de B\u00e9ziers |website=Midi Libre|date= 11 March 2013 |language=French |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe site has been occupied since [[Neolithic]] times, before the influx of [[Celts]]. [[Roman Empire|Roman]] ''Betarra'' was on the [[Roman roads|road]] that linked [[Provence]] with [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. The Romans refounded the city as a new ''colonia'' for veterans in 36\u201335&nbsp;BC and called it ''Colonia Julia Baeterrae Septimanorum''. Stones from the Roman [[amphitheatre]] were used to construct the [[Defensive wall|city wall]] during the 3rd century.\n\n[[Wine|White wine]] was exported to Rome. A ''dolia'' discovered in an excavation near Rome is marked \"I am a wine from Baeterrae and I am five years old\"; another simply \"white wine of Baeterrae\". It was occupied by the [[Moors]] between 720 and 752.\n\nFrom the 10th to the 12th century, B\u00e9ziers was the centre of a [[List of viscounts of B\u00e9ziers|Viscountship of B\u00e9ziers]]. The viscounts ruled most of the [[coastal plain]] around B\u00e9ziers, including also the town of [[Agde]]. They also controlled the major east-west route through Languedoc, which roughly follows the old Roman [[Via Domitia]], with the two key bridges over the Orb at B\u00e9ziers and over the [[H\u00e9rault River|H\u00e9rault]] at [[Saint-Thib\u00e9ry]].\n\nAfter the death of Viscount William around 990, the viscounty passed to his daughter Garsendis and her husband, count Raimond-Roger of [[Carcassonne]] (d. {{circa}}1012). It was then ruled by their son Peter-Raimond (d. {{circa}}1060) and his son Roger (d. 1067), both of whom were also [[County of Carcassonne|Counts of Carcassonne]].\n\nRoger died without issue and B\u00e9ziers passed to his sister Ermengard and her husband Raimond-Bertrand [[Trencavel]]. The Trencavels ruled for the next 142&nbsp;years, until the [[Albigensian Crusade]], a formal [[crusade]] (holy war) authorised by [[Pope Innocent III]].\n\n===Massacre at B\u00e9ziers===\n{{main|Massacre at B\u00e9ziers}}\nB\u00e9ziers was a Languedoc stronghold of [[Catharism]], which [[Roman Catholic Church|the Catholic Church]] condemned as heretical and which Catholic forces exterminated in the [[Albigensian Crusade]].\n[[File:Beziers (the old bridge).JPG|thumb|The old bridge]]\nB\u00e9ziers was the first place to be attacked. The crusaders reached the town on 21 July, 1209. B\u00e9ziers' Catholics were given an ultimatum to hand over the heretics or leave before the crusaders besieged the city and to \"avoid sharing their fate and perishing with them\".<ref name=lebedel>{{cite book| author=Claude Leb\u00e9del| title=Understanding the tragedy of the Cathars |publisher=Editions Ouest-France, 2011 |page=59f| isbn=978-2-7373-5267-6}}</ref> However, they refused and resisted with the Cathars. The town was sacked the following day and in the bloody massacre, no one was spared, not even Catholic priests and those who took refuge in the churches.\n\nOne of the commanders of the crusade was the [[Papal legate]] [[Arnaud Amalric|Arnaud-Amaury]] (or Arnald Amalaricus, Abbot of [[C\u00eeteaux Abbey|Citeaux]]). When asked by a crusader how to tell Catholics from Cathars once they had taken the city, the abbot supposedly replied, \"''[[Caedite eos. Novit enim Dominus qui sunt eius]]''\" (\"Kill them all, for the Lord knoweth them that are His\"). (This oft quoted phrase is sourced from [[Caesarius of Heisterbach]] along with a story of all the heretics who desecrated a copy of the Gospels and threw it down from the town's walls.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/caesarius-heresies.html |title=Medieval Sourcebook: Caesarius of Heisterbach: Medieval Heresies: Waldensians, Albigensians, Intellectuals |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=16 September 2011}}</ref>) Amalric's own version of the siege, described in his letter to Pope Innocent III in August 1209 (col. 139), states:\n<blockquote>\nWhile discussions were still going on with the barons about the release of those in the city who were deemed to be Catholics, the servants and other persons of low rank and unarmed attacked the city without waiting for orders from their leaders. To our amazement, crying \"to arms, to arms!\", within the space of two or three hours they crossed the ditches and the walls and B\u00e9ziers was taken. Our men spared no one, irrespective of rank, sex or age, and put to the sword almost 20,000 people. After this great slaughter the whole city was despoiled and burnt&nbsp;...<ref>[[Albigensian Crusade#cite note-21|Albigensian Crusade]]</ref> </blockquote>\n\nThe invaders burned the [[B\u00e9ziers Cathedral|Cathedral of Saint Nazaire]], which collapsed on those who had taken refuge inside. The town was pillaged and burnt. By some accounts, none was left alive \u2013 by others, there were a handful of survivors. (A plaque opposite the cathedral records the \"Day of Butchery\" perpetrated by the \"northern barons\".)\n\n===Later Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nDespite the massacre, the city was repopulated. A few parts of the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] cathedral of St-Nazaire had survived the carnage, and repairs started in 1215. The restoration, along with that of the rest of the city, continued until the 15th century.\n\nB\u00e9ziers became part of the royal domain in 1247.\n\nRule of the city was for a long time divided among three powers: the Bishopric, which reached its apogee in the 16th and 17th centuries when it was held by the [[Bonsi]] family, allied to the [[Medici]]; the consuls, local magistrates created at the end of the 12th century; and finally the king, represented by a \"Viguier for judicial affairs\", and from the 17th century onwards by a sub-delegate of the Intendant.\n\nB\u00e9ziers was not damaged in the [[Hundred Years War]].\n\nOn 8 September, 1381, a riot broke out at the seat of the municipal council, rioters setting the Town House on fire. The councillors tried to take refuge in the tower, but fire spread there as well, and they all died either by fire or in jumping from the tower to the square.\n\n===Early modern times===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nKing [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]] passed through the city during his royal tour of France (1564\u20131566), accompanied by the Court and the great men of the kingdom: his brother the [[Duke of Anjou]], [[Henri of Navarre]], and the cardinals of Bourbon and Lorraine.\n\nIn 1551, B\u00e9ziers became the seat of a [[Seneschal]], being removed from the jurisdiction of the Seneschals of [[Carcassonne]].\n\nThe city served as a rear base during various wars of the modern period, especially those against the Habsburgs. It was only once directly threatened. During the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], the British in 1710 landed at [[S\u00e8te]] and moved to within a few kilometres of B\u00e9ziers, before being repulsed by the [[Duke of Roquelaure]]. B\u00e9ziers was at the heart of the [[Montmorency Revolt]] in 1632. It was in B\u00e9ziers that [[Gaston, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans|Gaston d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and [[Henri II de Montmorency]], Governor of [[Languedoc]], province met at the beginning of the rebellion. It was also here that the king, by the [[Edict of Beziers]] (October 1632) abolished the privileges of the province. (They were restored in 1649.)\n\nDuring the 18th century, B\u00e9ziers prospered, notably thanks to the cultivation of vines which enabled it to become an important centre for alcohol trading.\n\n===French Revolution===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nDuring the French Revolution, citizens of B\u00e9ziers met in a revolutionary society created in May 1790 and numbering up to 400 members. It had several successive names: first, \"The Literary and Patriotic Cabinet\", a name still derived from the social life of the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]]; it then became \"Society of the Friends of the Constitution and Liberty\". Later becoming affiliated to the [[Jacobin Club]] of Paris, the B\u00e9ziers organization was accordingly renamed the \"Society of the Jacobins\"; then, the abolition of the French monarchy precipitated two further changes of name: \"Society of Brothers and Friends of the Republic\" and then \"Regenerated Society of the Jacobins, Friends of the Republic\".\n\nFrom 1790 to 1800, B\u00e9ziers was the chief town of the district of B\u00e9ziers. The city did not take part in the [[Girondins|Girondin]] (\"Federalist\") movement.\n\n===Napoleon the Third===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nIn the repression following [[Napoleon III of France|Louis Napol\u00e9on]]'s coup d'\u00e9tat in 1851, troops fired on and killed Republican protesters in B\u00e9ziers. Others were condemned to death or transported to [[French Guiana|Guiana]], including a former mayor who died at sea attempting to escape from there. In the Place de la R\u00e9volution a plaque and a monument by [[Jean Antoine Injalbert]] commemorates these events. (Injalbert also designed the Fontaine du Titan in B\u00e9ziers' Pl\u00e2teau des Po\u00e8tes park and the [[Moli\u00e8re]] monument in nearby [[P\u00e9zenas]].)\n\n===The Languedoc vine growers' revolt in B\u00e9ziers===\n{{main|Revolt of the Languedoc winegrowers}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}\nWhile elsewhere in France, the area planted with vines was decreasing, it increased in the Departments of [[Aude]], Gard, [[H\u00e9rault]] and the [[Pyrenees-Orientales]]. Together, these supplied some 40% of French wine production. Haut Languedoc, and more particularly the [[Biterrois]] and B\u00e9ziers, proclaimed themselves to be \"The World Capital of Wine\" and grew rapidly. Great fortunes were made. Large landowners, coming from industry, finance or the liberal professions, gained possession of immense vineyards.\n\nThere was also a growing foreign competition, with smuggled wines appearing on the market. The fraudsters remained unpunished. In 1892, the winegrowers of the Midi demanded \"The restoration and enforcement of customs duties\". But the market remained partly held by wines made from imported dried grapes (such as grapes from [[Corinth]]), and wines called \"wet\" (adulterated with water). Though the vintners attached great importance to this unfair competition, in fact it did not represent more than 5% of the market.\n\nOn 12 May 1907, no less than 150,000 protesters gathered in B\u00e9ziers with the declared aim of \"Defending the Southern Viticulture\". The crowd spilled into Paul-Riquet and the Champ-de-Mars. The slogans on the banners Proclaimed: \"Victory or death! Enough of talking, the time has come for action! Death to fraudsters! Bread or death! Live by working or die fighting!\".\n\nThe demonstrators, who came from more than 200 communes, were joined by numerous Biterrois employees and shopkeepers. The event ended with speeches on the Place de la Citadelle, (now Place Jean-Jaur\u00e8s). the Speakers included [[Marcelin Albert]] who issued an ultimatum to the government, demanding that it raise the price of wine, [[Ernest Ferroul]] who advocated tax refusal and the B\u00e9ziers Mayor \u00c9mile Suchon, (close to [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]]), who took a stand in support of the winegrowers' struggle. There were some minor incidents during the dispersal of the demonstrators.\n\nOn 16 May, the B\u00e9ziers municipal council, of Radical and Socialist tendency, resigned. The pressure of the street continued. The police station and the town hall fa\u00e7ade were set on fire. Alerted, [[Georges Clemenceau]] decided to launch a counterattack. The 17th regiment of line infantry, composed of reservists and conscripts, was on his orders transferred from Beziers to [[Agde]] on 18 June 1907.\n\nOn the evening of 20 June, learning of the [[Narbonne]] shooting, about 500 soldiers of the 6th company of the 17th regiment mutinied, plundered the armory and headed for B\u00e9ziers. They traveled about twenty kilometers by night. On 21 June, in the early morning, they arrived in town. They were warmly welcomed by the Biterrois, \"fraternizing with the demonstrators, and peacefully opposing the armed forces\". The soldiers sat down on the All\u00e9es Paul Riquet and the population offered them wine and food.\n\nThe South was on the brink of insurrection. In [[Paulhan, H\u00e9rault|Paulhan]], the railway was taken out of commission by protesters who stopped a military convoy sent to quell the mutineers. In [[Lod\u00e8ve]], the sub-prefect was taken hostage. The military authorities were not ready to accept this mutiny, apprehensive that the example of the 17th regiment would give similar ideas to other regiments in the region.\n\nIn Paris, the Republic trembled, as Clemenceau had to face a vote of no confidence. However, he survived by letting the military command urgently negotiate with the mutineers. In the afternoon, after obtaining a guarantee that no sanctions will be imposed on them, the 17th soldiers put down their arms and marched to the station under escort, without any major incident. On 22 June, they returned by train to their barracks. Clemenceau announced the end of the mutiny and gained a parliamentary vote of confidence by 327 votes to 223.\n\nOn 23 June, a law was finally passed, which repressed the massive chaptalisation of the wines.\n\nNegotiations and the scale of the movement prevented collective punishment: the mutineers of the 17th were assigned to [[Gafsa]] ([[Tunisia]]), a place where soldiers were often sent for \"disciplinary companies\", but these soldiers remained outside this framework, and were under ordinary military status. There was therefore no penal sanction for the revolt of the 17th, contrary to the legend that developed on this subject. However, during the [[First World War]], haunted by their reputation as deserters, many of them were sent to the front line, particularly in the bloody assaults of 1914.\n\nThe mutiny of soldiers of the 17th has remained in historical memory, especially with the words of [[Mont\u00e9hus]]' anti-militarist song \"Gloire au 17\", with the refrain: \"Salute, salute to you / Brave soldiers of the seventeenth....\"\n\n==Population==\n{{Historical populations\n|align=left|\n1793|12501|\n1800|14535|\n1806|14565|\n1821|16140|\n1831|16679|\n1836|16233|\n1841|18874|\n1846|19596|\n1851|19333|\n1856|23557|\n1861|24270|\n1866|27722|\n1872|31468|\n1876|38227|\n1881|42915|\n1886|42785|\n1891|45475|\n1896|48012|\n1901|52310|\n1906|52268|\n1911|51042|\n1921|56008|\n1926|65754|\n1931|71527|\n1936|73305|\n1946|64561|\n1954|64929|\n1962|73528|\n1968|80481|\n1975|84029|\n1982|76647|\n1990|70996|\n1999|69153|\n2008|71672|\n2012|72970|\n2014|75701}}\n\nThe inhabitants of B\u00e9ziers are known as ''Biterrois'', after ''Baeterrae'', the [[Roman naming conventions|Roman name]] for the town.\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Sights==\n[[File:Cath\u00e9drale Saint-Nazaire B\u00e9ziers.JPG|thumb|Saint-Nazaire cathedral]]\n[[File:Saint-Jean d'Aureilhan.JPG|thumb|230px|right|Le domaine de Saint-Jean-d'Aureilhan, neo-Gothic style tower (19th century)]]\n[[File:Beziers2.jpg|thumb|230px|right|\u00c9glise de la Madeleine]]\n[[File:Rochelongue 129 B\u00e9ziers.JPG|thumb|Place Gabriel P\u00e9ri]]\n*[[B\u00e9ziers Cathedral|Saint-Nazaire Cathedral]] : Situated in the high part of town, it occupies a picturesque site, visible from afar when approaching B\u00e9ziers on the road from [[Narbonne]].

It contains numerous statues of poets and a monumental fountain of the Titan by Injalbert. The park connects the station with the all\u00e9es Paul Riquet where a large bronze statue by [[David d'Angers]] celebrates the creator of the Canal du Midi, Pierre-Paul Riquet. The same sculptor created the bas reliefs which decorate the neo-Classical fa\u00e7ade of the Municipal Theatre (1844) at the top of the ''all\u00e9es''.\n*Arenas : B\u00e9ziers has two arenas, one dating from the Roman era whose structures and foundations have been preserved following major works in the Saint-Jacques district, and the other built in 1905 in the style of Spanish bullrings by Fernand Castelbon de Beauxhostes. The latter is one of the largest such structures in France (seating 13100). The arena hosts concerts and, every August, a bullfighting festival (the ''F\u00e9ria'').\n*The Fine Arts Museum (mus\u00e9e des Beaux-Arts), founded in 1859, received in 1934 the legacy of Injalbert's widow and, in 1975, drawings and the art collection of [[Jean Moulin]].

Crates have 18-in. (46-cm) \"troughs\" on each side where the piglets can safely lie without being in danger of sow overlay (when the sow lies down on top of a piglet).\n\nPiglet survival also depends on selection pressure.  Groups of piglets bred for higher survival showed no difference in mortality when weaned in farrowing crates and outdoor systems.<ref>E. M. Baxter, et al., \"Breeding for improved pre-weaning piglet survival in alternative farrowing systems,\" Proceedings of the 41st congress of the International Society for Applied Ethology (F. Galindo and L. Alvarez, eds.), 2007, Merida, Mexico.</ref>\n\n====Piglet Mortality====\nAlthough farrowing crates have been used based on the assumption that they reduce piglet mortality rates, there is little published evidence in support of this claim. The most comprehensive publication to date on this subject concluded that there is no significant effect of housing on overall piglet mortality, the authors stating that \u201cDespite the fact that the crate system has been considered to reduce piglet mortality mainly through a reduction of crushing, there is not much scientific evidence for this when considering the few large surveys that compare the mortality rate in commercial herds\u201c. The review goes on to describe several large studies dating from as early as 1983, the majority of which found no difference in piglet mortality rates between loose and crated sows. The review also details an argument as to why piglet mortality rates have been reported to be somewhat higher in a comparably small number of studies, citing methodological flaws.<ref name=Pedersen>L.J.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = SA | last2 = Morris | first2 = MC | year = 2003 | title = Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 51\u201366 | doi = 10.1023/b:jage.0000010844.52041.32 }}</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.

According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised.

The same effect could be achieved with larger pens that kept the animals separate, but allowed them more freedom of movement. There are also other ways of reducing, but not eliminating, aggression besides gestation crates. These include eliminating overcrowding, not mixing pigs from different litters, providing straw or other bedding material, and providing sufficient food that not only meets nutritional needs but satisfies the appetite.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Weaver | first1 = SA | last2 = Morris | first2 = MC | year = 2003 | title = Science, pigs and politics: an New Zealand perspective on the phase-out of sow stalls | url = | journal = Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics | volume = 17 | issue = | pages = 51\u201366 | doi = 10.1023/b:jage.0000010844.52041.32 }}</ref>  Other important means to reduce aggression among sows rely on alternative feeding methods, as many sows will compete with each other for food.

Group housing: alternative systems, alternative management. Advances in Pork Production 14:101-7.</ref>\n\nEarly veterinary studies seemed to support the use of gestation crates. According to the [[U.S. National Pork Producers Council]], which promotes pork as a food product and is a leading proponent of gestation crates, the [[American Veterinary Medical Association]] \"recognize[s] gestation stalls and group housing systems as appropriate for providing for the well-being of sows during pregnancy.\"<ref name=Kaufmann1/> While the practice of immobilizing the animals in crates limits fighting, it subsequently increases the animals' stress levels, causing other health problems. The American Association of Swine Veterinarians adopted a position statement in 2002 specifying five standards of sow welfare and concluding, \"Current scientific literature indicates that individual gestation stalls meet each of the aforementioned, provided the appropriate level of stockmanship is administered.\"<ref>\"AASV Position Statement: Pregnant Sow Housing.\" Accessed 31 July 2012.</ref>\n\n{{farming}}\n''The Washington Post'' reported in 2001 that researchers have not found sows in gestation crates to have elevated levels of [[stress hormone]]s. The paper notes that this suggests their overall health is not compromised. Some producers in Europe use a \u201cfree access\u201d maternity pen configuration in which sows are in individual pens for the first four weeks of pregnancy but can \u201cunlock\u201d the stall by backing out and entering a common area. The producers observed that pregnant pigs will stay in the individual pens more than 90 percent of the time, and return to the same stall more than 90 percent of the time.<ref name=\"Salek-Johnson\">{{cite news|last=Salek-Johnson|first=Janeen|title=Individual pens for sows' safety|url=http://thegazette.com/2012/09/30/individual-pens-for-sows-safety/|accessdate=10 January 2014|newspaper=[[The Gazette (Cedar Rapids)|The Gazette]]|date=30 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nHowever, other veterinary studies contradict those earlier studies. A 1997 report of the Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Union, where a gestation crate ban went into effect in 2013, noted that because \"overall welfare appears to be better when sows are not confined throughout gestation, sows should be preferably be kept in groups.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\">Tim Carman, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/food/pork-industry-gives-sows-room-to-move/2012/05/25/gJQAISlxyU_story.html \"Pork industry gives sows room to move\"], ''The Washington Post'', 29 May 2012.</ref> Likewise in 2008, the Pew Commission on Industrial Farm Animal Production, after 2.5 years of research, recommended \"the phase-out, within 10 years, of all intensive confinement systems that restrict natural movement and normal behaviors, including swine gestation crates.\"<ref name=\"washingtonpost.com\"/>\n\nMany studies have shown that sows in crates exhibit behavior such as bar-biting, head weaving, and tongue rolling, indicating chronic frustration.

James Glen stayed in England to protest this change and [[William Bull (governor)|William Bull]] acted as governor in his stead.\n\n=== King George's War ===\nDuring [[King George's War]], Governor Glen sent a trade delegation led by notable Indian trader and historian [[James Adair (historian)|James Adair]] to win over [[Red Shoes (Choctaw chief)]] to abandon their alliance with the French and to side with the British.  The efforts led to a great civil war amongst the [[Choctaw Nation]].  Adair blames the resulting failure on the Glen for not supporting this mission.<ref>''History of the American Indians'' by [[James Adair (historian)|James Adair]], pg 143-148.</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of colonial governors of South Carolina]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*[http://library.sc.edu/socar/mnscrpts/glenj.html ''The James Glen Papers'']\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Glen, James}}\n[[Category:Scottish people of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:1701 births]]\n[[Category:1777 deaths]]\n[[Category:Colonial governors of South Carolina]]\n\n\n{{SouthCarolina-politician-stub}}\n", "name_user": "R'n'B", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toGeorge II(link changed toGeorge II of Great Britain) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Glen"}
