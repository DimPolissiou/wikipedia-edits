The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though the City extends further west than Londonium's [[Ludgate]], and the Thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today, with Londonium's shoreline slightly north of the City's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as AD 50, near to today's [[London Bridge]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy the time '''the London Wall''' was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in AD 410 the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (\"London market\"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===\n\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nDuring the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]\n\n[[Bede]] records that in AD 604 [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]].

The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (\"London Fort\", a [[borough]]).

While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.<ref>''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&nbsp;33\u201335</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.\n\nAs the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the \"old settlement\"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the \"old market-place\"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|right|Map of London in about 1300]]\n[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]\n{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.

Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nWilliam built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:\n\n* [[Tower of London]]\n* [[Baynard's Castle]]\n* [[Montfichet's Tower]]\n\nAbout 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref name=vch_middlesex>[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&nbsp;15\u201360 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055113/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153 |date=31 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 2 April 2012</ref> By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a mayor in 1189\u2014and to directly elect the mayor from 1215.\n\nFrom medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].\n\nIn 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]\n\nThe City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nBy the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].\n\nIn 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n=== Growth of London ===\n\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for [[London]], reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].\n\nExpansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nAn attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]\n\nThe City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].\n\nThere was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].\n\nThe City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]] ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the \"[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]\" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.\n\nThe 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (\"the Gherkin\"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (\"the Cheesegrater\"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (\"the Walkie-Talkie\"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.\n\nThe main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.\n\n''For a history of the etymology behind the City's streets see: [[Street names of the City of London]]''\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|thumb|[[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City.]]\n[[File:London MMB \u00bb2K9 Mansion House.jpg|thumb|[[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] is the official residence of the Lord Mayor.]]\n[[File:Lord Mayor of London - John Stuttard - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Stuttard]], Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u20132007, during the Lord Mayor's Show of 2006.]]\n{{Contradicts other|Freedom of the City|here|Necessity of Freedom of the City to stand for election?|date=June 2018}}\n{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}\nThe City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]]. Historically its system of government was not unusual, but it was not reformed by the [[Municipal Reform Act 1835]] and little changed by later reforms.\n\nIt is administered by the [[City of London Corporation]], headed by the [[Lord Mayor of London]] (''not the same as the more recent [[Mayor of London]]''), which is responsible for a number of functions and has interests in land beyond the City's boundaries. Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The [[Court of Aldermen]] represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].\n\nThe City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]]. Senior members of the Livery Companies are known as [[Liveryman|Liverymen]] and form the Common Hall, which chooses the Lord Mayor, the Sheriffs and certain other officers.\n\n=== Wards ===\n{{Main|Wards of the City of London}}\nThe City is made up of [[:Category:Wards of the City of London|25 wards]].

The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.\n\nEach ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.\n\nCensus data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population. Being subject to renaming and definition at any time, these census 'wards' are notable in that four of the eight wards accounted for 67% of the 'square mile' and held 86% of the population, and these were in fact similar to and named after four City of London wards:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|+ Extract of census 'wards' where approximate to underlying legal wards<ref name=ons>{{cite web|url=http://neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk|title=Neighbourhood Statistics|first=Neil|last=Sillitoe|date=14 April 2008|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030211201309/http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/|archive-date=11 February 2003|url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Census ward\n! rowspan=\"2\"|% of the City<br />of London\n! rowspan=\"2\"|Residents\n! colspan=\"2\"|% of built-upon land\n|-\n!Commercial\n!Residential\n|-\n|Cripplegate (east half of [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] neighbourhood)||10.0%\t||2,782\t\t||79%\t||21%\n|-\n|Aldersgate (west half of Barbican neighbourhood)||4.5%\t||1,465\t\t||81%\t||19%\n|-\n|Farringdon Without (and much of Castle Baynard)||22.1%||1,099\t\t||90%\t||10%\n|-\n|Portsoken (contains [[Aldgate tube station|Aldgate Underground station]])||6.6%||985||86%||14%\n|}\n\n=== Elections ===\nThe City has a unique electoral system. Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.\n\nThe City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]]. In 2009, the business vote was about 24,000, greatly exceeding residential voters.<ref name=tribune>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|title=Labour runs in City of London poll against 'get-rich' bankers|date=12 February 2009|author=Ren\u00e9 Lavanchy|work=[[Tribune (magazine)|The Express Tribune]]|accessdate=14 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222210319/http://www.tribunemagazine.co.uk/2009/02/12/labour-runs-in-city-of-london-poll-against-%E2%80%98get-rich%E2%80%99-bankers/|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> As the City of London Corporation has not been affected by other municipal legislation over the period of time since then, its electoral practice has become increasingly anomalous.

However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement\u2014the [[River Fleet]]\u2014along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other \"City bars\" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.\n[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]\n\nMost of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible.

The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\n[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]].

Of the [[Districts of England|326 English districts]], it is the second smallest [[List of English districts by population|by population]], after the [[Isles of Scilly]], and the smallest [[List of English districts by area|by area]]. It is also [[List of cities in the United Kingdom#England|the smallest English]] [[City status in the United Kingdom|city]] by population (and in Britain, only two cities in Wales are smaller), and the [[List of smallest cities in the United Kingdom|smallest in the UK by area]].\n\nThe elevation of the City ranges from sea level at the Thames to {{convert|21.6|m|ft}} at the junction of High Holborn and Chancery Lane.<ref>[[Ordnance Survey]] data</ref> Two small but notable hills are within the historic core, [[Ludgate Hill]] to the west and [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] to the east. Between them ran the [[Walbrook]], one of the many [[Subterranean rivers of London|\"lost\" rivers or streams of London]] (another is the [[River Fleet|Fleet]]).\n\n=== Boundary ===\n[[File:City of London map 01.svg|thumb|right|Borders of the City of London, showing surrounding [[London borough]]s and the pre-1994 boundary (where changed) in red. The area covered by the [[Inner Temple|Inner]] and [[Middle Temple]] is marked.]]\n[https://web.archive.org/web/20171221090919/http://www.mapping.cityoflondon.gov.uk/geocortex/mapping/?viewer=compass Official boundary map, with wards.]\n\nBeginning in the west, where the City borders Westminster, the boundary crosses the [[Victoria Embankment]] from the Thames, passes to the west of [[Middle Temple]], then turns for a short distance along [[Strand, London|Strand]] and then north up [[Chancery Lane]], where it borders Camden. It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.\n\nThe boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn. A more substantial monument marks the boundary at [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] on Fleet Street.\n\nIn some places the financial district extends slightly beyond the boundaries, notably to the north and east, into the London Boroughs of Tower Hamlets, Hackney and Islington, and informally these locations are seen as part of the \"Square Mile\". Since the 1990s the eastern fringe, extending into Hackney and Tower Hamlets, has increasingly been a focus for large office developments due to the availability of large sites compared to within the City.\n\n=== Gardens and public art ===\n{{See also|List of public art in the City of London}}\n[[File:Finsbury Circus.jpg|thumb|right|[[Finsbury Circus]], the largest public open space, seen from [[Tower 42]]]]\nThe City has no sizeable parks within its boundary, but does have a network of a large number of gardens and small open spaces, many of them maintained by the Corporation. These range from formal gardens such as the one in [[Finsbury Circus]], containing a [[bowling green]] and [[bandstand]], to churchyards such as [[St Olave Hart Street]], to water features and artwork in courtyards and pedestrianised lanes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk |title=Gardens of the City of London |publisher=Gardens of the City of London |accessdate=30 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115212318/http://www.gardensofthecityoflondon.co.uk/ |archive-date=15 November 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nGardens include:\n* Barber-Surgeon's Hall Garden, [[London Wall]]\n* Cleary Garden, [[Queen Victoria Street, London|Queen Victoria Street]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |title=The History of the Bay Trust, Fred Cleary \u2013 Founder |publisher=baytrust.org.uk |year=2013 |accessdate=8 December 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109223713/http://baytrust.org.uk/about/the-history-of-the-bay-trust/ |archivedate=9 January 2014  }}</ref>\n* [[Finsbury Circus]], Blomfield Street/London Wall/[[Moorgate]]\n* [[Jubilee Garden]], [[Houndsditch]]\n* Portsoken Street Garden, Portsoken Street/Goodman's Yard\n* [[Postman's Park]], [[Little Britain, London|Little Britain]]\n* Seething Lane Garden, Seething Lane\n* [[St Dunstan-in-the-East]], St Dunstan's Hill\n* [[St Mary Aldermanbury]], Aldermanbury\n* St Olave Hart Street churchyard, Seething Lane\n* St Paul's churchyard, [[St Paul's Cathedral]]\n* West Smithfield Garden, [[West Smithfield]]\n* Whittington Gardens, College Street\n\nThere are a number of private gardens and open spaces, often within courtyards of the larger commercial developments.

Now St. James Park provides the nearest official readings.\n\nThe City has an [[Maritime Climate|oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] \"Cfb\") modified by the [[Urban Heat Island]] in the centre of London.

The [[London Stock Exchange]] ([[Stock|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]]), [[Lloyd's of London]] (insurance) and the [[Bank of England]] are all based in the City. Over 500 banks have offices in the City, and the City is an established leader in trading in [[Eurobond (international)|Eurobond]]s, [[foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]], energy [[Futures contract|futures]] and global insurance. The [[Alternative Investment Market]], a market for trades in [[Stock|equities]] of smaller firms, is a recent development. In 2009, the City of London accounted for 2.4% of UK GDP.<ref name=citylondon />\n\nLondon is the world's greatest [[foreign exchange market]], with much of the trade conducted in the City of London.

The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the \"night-time\" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.\n\n=== Retail and residential ===\nThe trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites.

Recent residential developments include \"the Heron\", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.\n\nSince the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nFire bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment have meant that the City, despite its history, has fewer intact historic structures than one might expect. Nonetheless, there remain many dozens of (mostly Victorian and Edwardian) fine buildings, typically in historicist and [http://claxity.com/ neoclassical style]. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (\"the Monument\"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].\n\nThe [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\n[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]\n\n=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}\n\n[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]\n\n;Completed\n\nA growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector.

The boundaries of the Roman city were similar to those of the City of London today, though the City extends further west than Londonium's [[Ludgate]], and the Thames was undredged and thus wider than it is today, with Londonium's shoreline slightly north of the City's present shoreline. The Romans built a bridge across the river, as early as AD 50, near to today's [[London Bridge]].\n\n=== Decline ===\nBy the time '''the London Wall''' was constructed, the City's fortunes were in decline, and it faced problems of plague and fire. The Roman Empire entered a long period of [[Decline of the Roman Empire|instability and decline]], including the [[Carausian Revolt]] in Britain. In the 3rd and 4th centuries, the city was under attack from [[Picts]], Scots, and [[Saxons|Saxon]] raiders. The decline continued, both for Londinium and the Empire, and in AD 410 the Romans withdrew entirely from Britain. Many of the Roman public buildings in Londinium by this time had fallen into decay and disuse, and gradually after the formal withdrawal the city became almost (if not, at times, entirely) uninhabited. The centre of trade and population moved away from the walled Londinium to [[Lundenwic]] (\"London market\"), a settlement to the west, roughly in the modern day [[Strand, London|Strand]]/[[Aldwych]]/[[Covent Garden]] area.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\n=== Anglo-Saxon restoration ===\n\n{{Main|Anglo-Saxon London}}\nDuring the Anglo-Saxon [[Heptarchy]], the London area came in turn under the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Essex|Essex]], [[Mercia]], and later [[Wessex]], though from the mid 8th century it was frequently under the control or threat of the [[Vikings]].\n[[File:Southwark Bridge City Plaque.JPG|left|thumb|Plaque near [[Southwark Bridge]] noting the activities around the time of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]].]]\n\n[[Bede]] records that in AD 604 [[Augustine of Canterbury|St Augustine]] consecrated [[Mellitus]] as the first bishop to the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of the [[East Saxons]] and their king, [[S\u00e6berht of Essex|S\u00e6berht]].

The refortified Anglo-Saxon settlement was known as [[Lundenburh]] (\"London Fort\", a [[borough]]).

While London, and indeed England, were afterwards subjected to further periods of Viking and Danish raids and occupation, the establishment of the City of London and the [[Kingdom of England]] prevailed.<ref>''London: The Biography'', 2000, [[Peter Ackroyd]], p.&nbsp;33\u201335</ref>\n\nIn the 10th century, [[Athelstan]] permitted eight [[royal mint|mints]] to be established, compared with six in his capital, [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]], indicating the wealth of the city. [[London Bridge]], which had fallen into ruin following the Roman evacuation and abandonment of Londinium, was rebuilt by the Saxons, but was periodically destroyed by Viking raids and storms.\n\nAs the focus of trade and population was moved back to within the old Roman walls, the older Saxon settlement of Lundenwic was largely abandoned and gained the name of ''Ealdwic'' (the \"old settlement\"). The name survives today as [[Aldwych]] (the \"old market-place\"), a name of a street and an area of the [[City of Westminster]] between [[Westminster]] and the City of London.\n\n=== Medieval era ===\n[[File:Map of London, 1300.svg|thumb|right|Map of London in about 1300]]\n[[File:DeathWatTyler.jpg|thumb|right|A pivotal event during the [[Peasants' Revolt]], 1381: their leader [[Wat Tyler]] is stabbed by [[William Walworth]], Lord Mayor]]\n{{See also|Norman and Medieval London}}\nFollowing the [[Battle of Hastings]], [[William the Conqueror]] marched on London ''(reaching as far as [[Southwark]])'', but failed to get across London Bridge or to defeat the Londoners.

Rather than continuing the war, [[Edgar the \u00c6theling]], [[Edwin, Earl of Mercia|Edwin of Mercia]] and [[Morcar]] of Northumbria surrendered at [[Berkhamsted]]. William granted the citizens of London a charter in 1075; the City was one of a few examples of the English retaining some authority. The City was not covered by the [[Domesday Book]].\n\nWilliam built three castles nearby, to keep Londoners subdued:\n\n* [[Tower of London]]\n* [[Baynard's Castle]]\n* [[Montfichet's Tower]]\n\nAbout 1130, [[Henry I of England|Henry I]] granted a [[Shrievalty of London|sheriff]] to the people of London, along with control of the county of [[Middlesex]]: this meant that the two entities were regarded as one administratively (not that the county was a dependency of the City) until the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref name=vch_middlesex>[[Victoria County History]]: A history of the County of Middlesex: Vol 2 pp&nbsp;15\u201360 paragraph 12, [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055113/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22153 |date=31 May 2012 }}. Retrieved 2 April 2012</ref> By 1141 the whole body of the citizenry was considered to constitute a single community. This 'commune' was the origin of the [[City of London Corporation]] and the citizens gained the right to appoint, with the king's consent, a mayor in 1189\u2014and to directly elect the mayor from 1215.\n\nFrom medieval times, the City has been composed of [[Wards of the City of London|25 ancient wards]], each headed by an [[alderman]], who chairs [[Wardmote]]s, which still take place at least annually. A [[Folkmoot]], for the whole of the City held at the outdoor cross of [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was formerly also held. Many of the medieval offices and traditions continue to the present day, demonstrating the unique nature of the City and its [[Corporation of London|Corporation]].\n\nIn 1381, the [[Peasants' Revolt]] affected London. The rebels took the City and the Tower of London, but the rebellion ended after its leader, Wat Tyler, was killed during a confrontation that included Lord Mayor [[William Walworth]].\n\n[[File:Civitas Londinium or The Agas Map of London.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Woodcut map of London|\"Woodcut\" map of London]], dating from the 1560s]]\n[[File:Great fire of london map.png|thumb|right|Map showing the extent of the [[Great Fire of London]], which destroyed nearly 80% of the City]]\n[[File:Great Fire London.jpg|thumb|right|The 1666 Great Fire as depicted in a 17th-century painting: it depicts Old London Bridge, churches, houses, and the Tower of London as seen from a boat near Tower Wharf]]\n\nThe City was burnt severely on a number of occasions, the worst being in 1123 and (more famously) in the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666. Both of these fires were referred to as ''the'' Great Fire. After the fire of 1666, a number of plans were drawn up to remodel the City and its street pattern into a [[renaissance]]-style city with planned urban blocks, squares and boulevards. These plans were almost entirely not taken up, and the medieval street pattern re-emerged almost intact.\n\n=== Early modern period ===\nBy the late 16th century, London increasingly became a major centre for banking, international trade and commerce. The [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]] was founded in 1565 by Sir [[Thomas Gresham]] as a centre of commerce for London's merchants, and gained Royal patronage in 1571. Although no longer used for its original purpose, its location at the corner of [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] and [[Threadneedle Street]] continues to be the geographical centre of the City's core of banking and financial services, with the [[Bank of England]] moving to its present site in 1734, opposite the Royal Exchange on Threadneedle Street. Immediately to the south of Cornhill, [[Lombard Street, London|Lombard Street]] was the location from 1691 of [[Lloyd's Coffee House]], which became the world-leading insurance market. London's insurance sector continues to be based in the area, particularly in [[Lime Street (ward)|Lime Street]].\n\nIn 1708, [[Christopher Wren]]'s masterpiece, [[St Paul's Cathedral]], was completed on his birthday. The first service had been held on 2 December 1697, more than 10 years earlier. It replaced the original St Paul's, which had been completely destroyed in the Great Fire of London, and is considered to be one of the finest cathedrals in Britain and a fine example of [[Baroque architecture]].\n\n=== Growth of London ===\n\nThe 18th century was a period of rapid growth for [[London]], reflecting an increasing national population, the early stirrings of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and London's role at the centre of the evolving [[British Empire]]. The urban area expanded beyond the borders of the City of London, most notably during this period towards the [[West End of London|West End]] and [[Westminster]].\n\nExpansion continued and became more rapid by the beginning of the 19th century, with London growing in all directions. To the [[East End of London|East]] the [[Port of London]] grew rapidly during the century, with the construction of many docks, needed as the Thames at the City could not cope with the volume of trade. The arrival of the railways and the [[London Underground|Tube]] meant that London could expand over a much greater area. By the mid-19th century, with London still rapidly expanding in population and area, the City had already become only a small part of the wider metropolis.\n\n=== 19th and 20th centuries ===\nAn attempt was made in 1894 with the [[Royal Commission on the Amalgamation of the City and County of London]] to end the distinction between the City and the surrounding County of London, but a change of government at Westminster meant the option was not taken up. The City as a distinct [[polity]] survived despite its position within the London conurbation and [[History of local government in London|numerous local government reforms]]. Supporting this status, the City was a special [[parliamentary borough]] that elected four members to the [[unreformed House of Commons]], who were retained after the [[Reform Act 1832]]; reduced to two under the [[Redistribution of Seats Act 1885]]; and ceased to be a separate constituency under the [[Representation of the People Act 1948]]. Since then the City is a minority (in terms of population and area) of the [[Cities of London and Westminster]].\n[[File:St Pauls Cathedral in 1896.JPG|thumb|left|[[St Paul's Cathedral]], 1896.]]\n\nThe City's population fell rapidly in the 19th century and through most of the 20th century, as people moved outwards in all directions to London's vast [[Metro-land|suburbs]], and many residential buildings were demolished to make way for office blocks. Like many areas of London and other British cities, the City fell victim to large scale and highly destructive aerial bombing during [[World War II]], especially in [[the Blitz]]. Whilst St Paul's Cathedral survived the onslaught, large swathes of the area did not and the particularly heavy raids of late December 1940 led to a [[firestorm]] called the [[Second Great Fire of London]].\n\nThere was a major rebuilding programme in the decades following the war, in some parts (such as at the Barbican) dramatically altering the urban landscape. But the destruction of the older historic fabric allowed the construction of modern and larger-scale developments, whereas in those parts not so badly affected by bomb damage the City retains its older character of smaller buildings. The street pattern, which is still largely medieval, was altered slightly in places, although there is a more recent trend of reversing some of the post-war modernist changes made, such as at [[Paternoster Square]].\n\nThe City suffered terrorist attacks including the [[1993 Bishopsgate bombing]] ([[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]]) and the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] ([[Islamic terrorism|Islamist]]). In response to the 1993 bombing, a system of road barriers, checkpoints and surveillance cameras referred to as the \"[[ring of steel (London)|ring of steel]]\" has been maintained to control entry points to the City.\n\nThe 1970s saw the construction of tall office buildings including the 600-foot (183&nbsp;m), 47-storey [[Natwest Tower]], the first skyscraper in the UK. Office space development has intensified especially in the central, northern and eastern parts, with skyscrapers including [[30 St Mary Axe|30 St. Mary Axe]] (\"the Gherkin\"'), [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (\"the Cheesegrater\"), [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (\"the Walkie-Talkie\"), the [[Broadgate Tower]] and the [[Heron Tower]], the tallest in the City. Another skyscraper, [[22 Bishopsgate]], is under construction.\n\nThe main residential section of the City today is the [[Barbican Estate]], constructed between 1965 and 1976. The [[Museum of London]] is based there, as are a number of other services provided by the Corporation.\n\n''For a history of the etymology behind the City's streets see: [[Street names of the City of London]]''\n\n== Governance ==\n[[File:Guildhall, Londres, Inglaterra, 2014-08-11, DD 139.JPG|thumb|[[Guildhall, London|Guildhall]] is the ceremonial and administrative centre of the City.]]\n[[File:London MMB \u00bb2K9 Mansion House.jpg|thumb|[[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] is the official residence of the Lord Mayor.]]\n[[File:Lord Mayor of London - John Stuttard - Nov 2006.jpg|thumb|right|[[John Stuttard]], Lord Mayor of the City of London 2006\u20132007, during the Lord Mayor's Show of 2006.]]\n{{Contradicts other|Freedom of the City|here|Necessity of Freedom of the City to stand for election?|date=June 2018}}\n{{See also|City of London Corporation|History of local government in England#The City of London}}\nThe City has a unique political status, a legacy of its uninterrupted integrity as a corporate city since the [[Heptarchy|Anglo-Saxon period]] and its singular relationship with the [[British monarchy|Crown]].

Unlike other English local authorities, the Corporation has two council bodies: the (now largely ceremonial) [[Court of Aldermen]] and the [[Court of Common Council]]. The [[Court of Aldermen]] represents the wards, with each ward (irrespective of size) returning one Alderman. The chief executive of the Corporation holds the ancient office of [[Town Clerk of London]].\n\nThe City is a [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] which has a Commission of Lieutenancy headed by the Lord Mayor instead of a [[Lord-Lieutenant]] and has [[Sheriffs of the City of London|two Sheriffs]] instead of a [[High Sheriff]] (see [[list of Sheriffs of London]]), quasi-judicial offices appointed by the [[Livery Company|Livery Companies]], an ancient political system based on the representation and [[Guild|protection of trades (Guilds)]].

The procedure of review is unique in the United Kingdom as it is not conducted by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] or a local government boundary commission every 8 to 12 years, which is the case for all other [[Wards and electoral divisions of the United Kingdom|wards in Great Britain]]. Particular churches, [[livery company]] halls and other historic buildings and structures are associated with a ward, such as St Paul's Cathedral with [[Castle Baynard]], and London Bridge with Bridge; boundary changes in 2003 removed some of these historic connections.\n\nEach ward elects an [[Alderman]] to the [[Court of Aldermen]], and [[Commoners]] (the City equivalent of a [[Councillor]]) to the [[Court of Common Council]] of the Corporation. Only electors who are [[Freeman of the City of London|Freemen of the City of London]] are eligible to stand. The number of Commoners a ward sends to the Common Council varies from two to ten, depending on the number of electors in each ward. Since the 2003 review it has been agreed that the four more residential wards: [[Portsoken]], [[Queenhithe]], [[Aldersgate]] and [[Cripplegate]] together elect 20 of the 100 Commoners, whereas the business-dominated remainder elect the remaining 80 Commoners. 2003 and 2013 boundary changes have increased the residential emphasis of the mentioned four wards.\n\nCensus data provides eight nominal rather than 25 real wards, all of varying size and population.

Most of its voters are representatives of businesses and other bodies that occupy premises in the City. Its ancient wards have very unequal numbers of voters. In elections, both the businesses based in the City and the residents of the City vote.\n\nThe City of London Corporation was not reformed by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], because it had a more extensive electoral franchise than any other borough or city; in fact, it widened this further with its own equivalent legislation allowing one to become a [[Freedom of the City|freeman]] without being a [[liveryman]]. In 1801, the City had a population of about 130,000, but increasing development of the City as a central business district led to this falling to below 5,000 after the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} It has risen slightly to around 9,000 since, largely due to the development of the [[Barbican Estate]].

However the boundaries of the City of London no longer coincide with the old city wall, as the City expanded its jurisdiction slightly over time. During the [[medieval]] era, the City's jurisdiction expanded westwards, crossing the historic western border of the original settlement\u2014the [[River Fleet]]\u2014along [[Fleet Street]] to [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]]. The City also took in the other \"City bars\" which were situated just beyond the old walled area, such as at Holborn, Aldersgate, Bishopsgate and Aldgate. These were the important entrances to the City and their control was vital in maintaining the City's special privileges over certain trades.\n[[File:Temple-bar-griffin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Dragon statue on the [[Temple Bar, London|Temple Bar]] monument, which marks the boundary between the City of London and [[City of Westminster]].]]\n\nMost of the wall has disappeared, but several sections remain visible. A section near the [[Museum of London]] was revealed after the devastation of an air raid on 29 December 1940 at the height of the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. Other visible sections are at [[St Alphage London Wall|St Alphage]], and there are two sections near the [[Tower of London]]. The River Fleet was [[canal]]ised after the Great Fire of 1666 and then in stages was bricked up and has been since the 18th century one of London's \"[[Subterranean rivers of London|lost rivers or streams]]\", today underground as a [[storm drain]].\n\nThe boundary of the City was unchanged until minor boundary changes on 1 April 1994, when it expanded slightly to the west, north and east, taking small parcels of land from the London Boroughs of [[City of Westminster|Westminster]], [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]], [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]], [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]] and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. The main purpose of these changes was to tidy up the boundary where it had been rendered obsolete by changes in the urban landscape. In this process the City also lost small parcels of land, though there was an overall net gain (the City grew from 1.05 to 1.12 square miles). Most notably, the changes placed the (then recently developed) [[Broadgate]] estate entirely in the City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |title=The City and London Borough Boundaries Order 1993 |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |date=4 July 2011 |accessdate=30 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620210431/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/SI/si1993/Uksi_19931445_en_1.htm |archivedate=20 June 2010  }}</ref>\n\n[[Southwark]], to the south of the City on the other side of the [[River Thames|Thames]], was within the City between 1550 and 1899 as the ''Ward of [[Bridge Without]]'', a situation connected with the [[Guildable Manor]].

It turns east along [[Holborn]] to Holborn Circus, and then goes north east to [[Charterhouse Street]]. As it crosses [[Farringdon Road]] it becomes the boundary with Islington. It continues to [[Aldersgate]], goes north, and turns east into some back streets soon after Aldersgate becomes [[Goswell Road]], since 1994 embracing all of the Corporation's Golden Lane Estate. Here, at Baltic Street West, is the most northerly extent. The boundary includes all of the [[Barbican Estate]] and continues east along Ropemaker Street and its continuation on the other side of [[Moorgate]], becomes South Place. It goes north, reaching the border with Hackney, then east, north, east on back streets, with Worship Street forming a northern boundary, so as to include the [[Broadgate]] estate. The boundary then turns south at [[Norton Folgate]] and becomes the border with [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]. It continues south into [[Bishopsgate]], and takes some backstreets to Middlesex Street ([[Petticoat Lane]]) where it continues south-east then south. It then turns south-west, crossing the [[Minories]] so as to exclude the [[Tower of London]], and then reaches the river. It then runs up the centre of the Thames, with the exception that [[Blackfriars Bridge]] falls within the City; the City controls [[London Bridge]] (as part of [[Bridge (ward)|Bridge]] ward) but only half of the river underneath it, a feature which is unique in British local administration.\n\nThe boundaries are marked by black bollards bearing the City's emblem, and by [[dragon boundary mark]]s at major entrances, such as Holborn.

Of the $3.98&nbsp;trillion daily global turnover, as measured in 2009, trading in London accounted for around $1.85&nbsp;trillion, or 46.7% of the total.<ref name=citylondon /> The [[pound sterling]], the currency of the United Kingdom, is globally the fourth most traded currency and the third most held [[reserve currency]].\n\nSince 1991 [[Canary Wharf]], a few miles east of the City in Tower Hamlets, has become another centre for London's financial services industry which houses many banks and other institutions formerly located in the Square Mile. Although growth has continued in both locations, and there have been relocations in both directions, the Corporation has come to realise that its planning policies may have been causing financial firms to choose Canary Wharf as a location.\n\n=== Headquarters ===\n[[File:Paternoster Square.jpg|thumb|[[Paternoster Square]], since 2004 the home of the [[London Stock Exchange]]]]\nMany major global companies have their headquarters in the City, including [[Aviva]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|title=Contact us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Aviva|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007062338/http://www.aviva.com/about-us/contact-us/|archive-date=7 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[BT Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|title=Contact BT|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=BT Group|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6DosNnqp9?url=http://www.btplc.com/thegroup/contactbt/index.cfm|archive-date=20 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Lloyds Banking Group]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310191913/http://www.lloydsbankinggroup.com/about_us/company_contacts.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=10 March 2009|title=Company Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Lloyds Banking Group}}</ref> [[Old Mutual]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|title=Investor Relations Contacts|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Old Mutual|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829165111/http://www.oldmutual.com/ir/contacts.jsp|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Prudential plc|Prudential]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060106183040/http://www.prudential.co.uk/prudential-plc/siteservices/directory/plccontact/|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 January 2006|title=Contact|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Prudential}}</ref> [[Schroders plc|Schroders]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|title=Contact us|accessdate=3 November 2016|publisher=Schroders|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104014437/http://www.schroders.com/en/contact-us/worldwide-locations/uk/|archive-date=4 November 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Standard Chartered Bank|Standard Chartered]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|title=Contact Us|accessdate=15 August 2010|publisher=Standard Chartered|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100829014438/http://www.standardchartered.com/uk/contact-us/en/|archive-date=29 August 2010|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[Unilever PLC|Unilever]].<ref>[http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx Unilever registered offices] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100830072007/http://www.unilever.com/resource/unilever-registered-offices.aspx |date=30 August 2010 }}</ref>\n\nA number of the world's largest law firms are headquartered in the City, including four of the \"[[Magic Circle (law firms)|Magic Circle]]\" law firms ([[Allen & Overy]], [[Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer]], [[Linklaters]] and [[Slaughter & May]]), as well as other firms such as [[DLA Piper]], [[Eversheds Sutherland]], [[Herbert Smith Freehills]] and [[Hogan Lovells]].\n\n=== Other sectors ===\n[[File:Barbican Centre City of London.jpg|thumb|right|Barbican Centre]]\nWhilst the financial sector, and related businesses and institutions, continue to dominate, the economy is not limited to that sector. The legal profession has a strong presence, especially in the west and north (i.e., towards the [[Inns of Court]]). Retail businesses were once important, but have gradually moved to the [[West End of London]], though it is now Corporation policy to encourage retailing in some locations, for example at [[Cheapside]] near St Paul's. The City has a number of visitor attractions, mainly based on its historic heritage as well as the [[Barbican Centre]] and adjacent [[Museum of London]], though tourism is not at present a major contributor to the City's economy or character. The City has many pubs, bars and restaurants, and the \"night-time\" economy does feature in the [[Bishopsgate]] area, towards [[Shoreditch]]. The meat market [[Smithfield Market|at Smithfield]], wholly within the City, continues to be one of London's main markets (the only one remaining in central London) and the country's largest [[butcher|meat market]]. In the east is [[Leadenhall Market]], a fresh food market that is also a visitor attraction.\n\n=== Retail and residential ===\nThe trend for purely office development is beginning to reverse as the Corporation encourages residential use, albeit with development occurring when it arises on windfall sites. The City has a target of 90 additional dwellings per year.<ref>[http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm City of London Corporation] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100512135507/http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/Corporation/LGNL_Services/Environment_and_planning/Planning/Local_Development_Framework/core_strategy.htm |date=12 May 2010 }} Core Strategy</ref> Some of the extra accommodation is in small pre-[[World War II]] [[listed building]]s, which are not suitable for occupation by the large companies which now provide much of the City's employment. Recent residential developments include \"the Heron\", a high-rise residential building on the Milton Court site adjacent to the Barbican, and the [[Heron Tower#Heron Plaza|Heron Plaza]] development on Bishopsgate is also expected to include residential parts.\n\nSince the 1990s, the City has diversified away from near exclusive office use in other ways. For example, several hotels and the first [[department store]] opened in the 2000s. A shopping centre was more recently opened at [[One New Change]], [[Cheapside]] (near St Paul's Cathedral) in October 2010, which is open seven days a week. However, large sections remain quiet at weekends, especially in the eastern section, and it is quite common to find shops, [[Public house|pubs]] and cafes closed on these days.\n\n== Landmarks ==\n\n=== Historical buildings ===\nFire bombing and post-[[World War II]] redevelopment have meant that the City, despite its history, has fewer intact historic structures than one might expect. Nonetheless, there remain many dozens of (mostly Victorian and Edwardian) fine buildings, typically in historicist and [http://claxity.com/ neoclassical style]. They include the [[Monument to the Great Fire of London]] (\"the Monument\"), [[St Paul's Cathedral]], [[Guildhall, London|the Guildhall]], the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], [[Dr. Johnson's House]], [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] and a [[:Category:Churches in the City of London|great many churches]], many designed by [[Sir Christopher Wren]], who also designed St Paul's. [[2 King's Bench Walk]] and [[Prince Henry's Room]] are notable historic survivors of heavy bombing of [[Temple, London|the Temple]] area, which has largely been rebuilt to its historic form. Another example of a bomb-damaged place having been restored is [[Staple Inn]] on Holborn. A few small sections of the Roman [[London Wall]] exist, for example near the Tower of London and in the Barbican area. Among the twentieth-century [[listed buildings]] are [[Bracken House, London|Bracken House]], the first post World War II buildings in the country to be given statutory protection, and the whole of the [[Barbican Estate|Barbican]] and [[Golden Lane Estate]].\n\nThe [[Tower of London]] is not in the City, but is a notable visitor attraction which brings tourists to the southeast of the City. Other landmark buildings with historical significance include the [[Bank of England]], the [[Old Bailey]], the [[Custom House, City of London|Custom House]], [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield Market]], [[Leadenhall Market]] and [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. Noteworthy contemporary buildings include a number of modern high-rise buildings (see section below) as well as the [[Lloyd's building]].\n\n[[File:Royal Exchange Panorama.jpg|centre|thumb|upright=2.25|The Bank of England (left) and the Royal Exchange (centre) are two of the many significant buildings in the City of London.]]\n\n=== Skyscrapers and tall buildings ===\n{{See also|List of tallest buildings and structures in London}}\n\n[[File:2016-02 City of London.jpg|thumb|The City skyline in February 2016, including [[20 Fenchurch Street]] (left), the [[122 Leadenhall Street|Leadenhall Building]] (centre) and [[30 St Mary Axe]] (right)]]\n\n;Completed\n\nA growing number of tall buildings and skyscrapers are principally used by the financial sector.

In addition, the increasing demand for low-cost timber products only supports the lumber company to continue logging{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The carbon emitted from the process of converting timber to [[wood product]]s accounts for 15%<ref name=\"auto\"/> of the [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] in the environment. Deforestation is the main concern in tropical rainforests since they are home to millions of animals and much biodiversity. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Not only does the lumber industry impact local deforestation, but it also impacts the whole environment, as deforestation is a major driver of climate change.\n\n=== Livestock ranching ===\n[[Livestock]] [[Ranch|ranching]] requires large portions of land to raise herds of animals and livestock crops for consumer needs. Livestock ranching originated in Texas between 1820 and 1865 which were mainly driven by Mexican cowboys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/americanwest/cattleranchingrev1.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Cattle ranching - a brief history|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Later, Texans drove the Mexicans out, while leaving the cattle behind. After the civil war, Texans began rounding up the cattle and selling them around states such as California and New Orleans{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. According to [[Greenpeace]], a non-governmental global environmental organization, the cattle industry is responsible for a significant amount of methane emissions. This is because speculators burn huge areas of rainforest for pasture. According to Rhett Butler, over 60% of land that is deforested becomes pasture for animals such as cattle and cows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/how-cattle-ranching-chewing-amazon-rainforest-20090129/|title=How cattle ranches are chewing up the Amazon rainforest {{!}} Greenpeace UK|date=2009-01-31|work=Greenpeace UK|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n=== Agricultural expansion ===\n{{see|Agricultural expansion}}\nThe largest cause of deforestation and acute degradation is agriculture. According to Wageningen University and Research Centre, more than 80% of deforestation can be contributed to agriculture.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120925091608.htm|title=Agriculture is the direct driver for worldwide deforestation|work=ScienceDaily|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en}}</ref>  Forests are being converted to plantations for coffee, tea, [[palm oil]], rice, [[rubber]], and various other popular products{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.

The main drivers of deforestation in relation to agriculture are population growth and the increased pressures for agricultural expansion. Deforestation is linked with [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, in part due from crops having a relatively less impressive carbon storage per unit area then wooded areas or forests. Agricultural deforestation can take different forms, the most salient of which are the commercial plantations in tropical regions.\n\nAnother prevalent method of agricultural deforestation is [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]], which was primarily used by subsistence farmers in tropical regions but has now become increasingly less sustainable. The method does not leave land for continuous agricultural production, but instead cuts and burns small plots of forest land which are then converted into agricultural zones. The farmers then exploit the nutrients in the ashes of the burned plants{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This method is not sustainable because the plots can only be tilled for 2\u20133 years, where after farmers will move to a different plot and repeat the process. This process will be repeated about 5 to 10 times before a farmer would return to a patch of once deforested land allowed to return to a forested state. If land is not available, the length of time between cycles can be shortened leading to less nutrients in the soil. This lack of nutrients can then lead to smaller crop yields and a need to convert more forest land into agricultural zones. The repeated cycle of low yields and shortened fallow periods eventually results in less vegetation being able to grow on once burned lands and a decrease in average soil biomass.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Houghton|first=R.A|date=December 2012|title=Carbon emissions and the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2012.06.006|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=4|issue=6|pages=597\u2013603|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2012.06.006|issn=1877-3435}}</ref> In small local plots sustainability is not an issue because of longer fallow periods and lesser overall deforestation.

Slash-and-burn agriculture accounts for about 30% of all global arable land. \u00a0\n\nResearchers Offiong and Ita question whether increased food production through cropland expansion would be possible without resulting in greater climatic impacts. This is posited given that deforested soil is often unsatisfactory for growing crops. Poor quality soil would require extensive modifications and amendments through, primarily, the use of chemical fertilizers. The chemical based alterations along with contemporary farming practices would lead to erosion and soil depletion unless continually treated with these substances. These repeated practices would create an unsustainable cycle needed to keep producing expected yields.<ref name=\":07\">{{Cite journal|last=Offiong|first=E. E.|last2=Ita|first2=P.

Animal-based food production (whether for meat, dairy, or other products) impacts the land in a different way. Land used for grazing livestock is vulnerable to erosion, depletion of the soil biome, and desertification. Additionally, livestock contribute high levels of methane emissions, which have an enormous environmental impact.<ref name=\":07\" />\n\nDeforestation, particularly in large swaths of the Amazon, where nearly 20% of the rainforest has been clear cut, has climactic effects and effects on water sources as well as on the soil.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Morton|first=D.

Farmers in these studies were encouraged to change from a merely subsistence farming system to an intensive \u201cfor-profit\u201d farming system where products grown were primarily coffee, oil palm, and cocoa, all for export. According to Kovacic and Salazar, there is not an equal exchange between agricultural expansion and economic gains as touted by both governments and large scale agricultural production companies. This holds true for small scale farmers who move from subsistence farming to a small scale intensive farming scheme regardless of product grown.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kovacic|first=Zora|last2=Viteri Salazar|first2=Oswaldo|date=April 2017|title=The lose - lose predicament of deforestation through subsistence farming: Unpacking agricultural expansion in the Ecuadorian Amazon|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=51|pages=105\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.02.002|issn=0743-0167}}</ref>\n\nIt is also important to note that not all deforestation is as result of agriculture expansion. Food production is only one driver. Between 2001 and 2015 only 27 +/- 5% of all forest disturbances globally were for agricultural expansion. Among other drivers were urbanization, forest fires, logging, and for shifting agriculture practices. The percentages are 0.6 +/- 0.3% for urbanization, 23 +/- 4% for forest fires, 26 +/- 4% for logging, and 24 +/- 3% for shifting agricultural practices. The types of drivers vary greatly depending on the region in which they take place. The regions with the greatest amount of deforestation for livestock and row crop agriculture are Central and South America, while commodity crop deforestation was found mainly in Southeast Asia.

Reforestation can also help mitigate the effects of soil degradation and pollution depending on the methods of planting, location, and plant species.<ref name=\"Cunningham 301\u2013317\"/>\n\n=== Afforestation ===\n{{main|Afforestation}}\n[[Afforestation]] is the planting of trees where there was no previous tree coverage. Degradation of forests ultimately leads to a decrease in oxygen and a sufficient increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to make up for the loss, more trees are being planted. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could significantly decrease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/29/planting-trees-climate-change|title=To what extent could planting trees help solve climate change?|last=Institute|first=Grantham Research|date=2012-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> According to scientific research{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, plantation forest could absorb more carbon dioxide than natural forest since they grow faster leading to a higher absorbance rate.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The process is usually encouraged by governments because they want it to lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide and because it increases the aesthetics of the area. Although, it could lead to infringing upon ecosystems and create complications in environments that previously did not have tree coverage or forests.\n\n==== Afforestation in China ====\nAlthough China has set official goals for reforestation, these goals were set for an 80-year time horizon and were not significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems with projects such as the [[Three-North Shelter Forest Program|Green Wall of China]], which aims to replant forests and halt the expansion of the [[Gobi Desert]]. A law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. But average success rates, especially in state-sponsored plantings, remains relatively low. And even the properly planted trees have had great difficulty surviving the combined impacts of prolonged droughts, pest infestation, and fires. Nonetheless, China currently has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 4.77 million hectares (47,000 square kilometers) of afforestation in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Ling|title=China to plant more trees in 2009|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/09/content_10631987.htm|website=ChinaView|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Afforestation in Japan====\n{{main|Afforestation in Japan}}\nThe primary goal of afforestation projects in Japan is to develop the forest structure of the nation and to maintain the biodiversity found in the Japanese wilderness. The Japanese [[temperate rainforest]] is scattered throughout the Japanese archipelago and is home to many endemic species that are not naturally found anywhere else. As the development of the country's caused a decline in forest cover, a reduction in biodiversity was seen in those areas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miyamoto|first1=Asako|title=The Influence of Forest Management on Landscape Structure in the Cool-Temperate Forest Region of Central Japan.|date=2008|pages=248\u2013256}}</ref>\n\n=== Agroforestry ===\n{{main|Agroforestry}}\n[[Agroforestry]] or agro-sylviculture is a land use management system in which combinations of trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland.

With the use of satellite imagery, these methods can create maps of a given area to help better understand the health of a forest. Furthermore, from these satellite images, specialists can create false-color composites to differentiate forest cover from bare ground and soil{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This can help visualize the extent of the forest. Additionally, with the use of MODIS Satellites, specialists can stack satellite images of the given area from multiple dates to see if there is any regression of the forest to help visualize deforestation better. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ===\nRecognition of the negative impacts of deforestation and of the overwhelming evidence of global warming has led to the development of international policy surrounding the conservation of forests. One attempt towards fighting climate change globally is the ''[[United Nations REDD Programme|Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation]]'' (REDD+) efforts, and a few countries are already starting to implement and analyze ways to protect standing trees{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\t\nIn the case of the Bac Kan province in Vietnam, researchers came up with systems to encourage leaving forests intact while also meeting international, national, and individual investments successfully.

The relationship between deforestation and climate change is one of a positive feedback loop{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The more trees that are removed equals larger effects of climate change which, in turn, results in the loss of more trees{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In recent history, this process has been accelerated and amplified by humans in many different ways. These include logging, urbanization, mining, and agricultural development{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The incessant need to expand these operations has resulted in widespread deforestation worldwide.\n\n=== Agricultural ===\n[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|301x301px|[[:File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|Amazonie deforestation.jpg]]]]\nAgricultural expansion is one of the worst offenders in when it comes to deforestation in recent times.

The declarations were signed in November 2007 in Singapore at the ASEAN Summi{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}t. Among the environmental initiatives highlighted were forest management, resource conservation, and mitigating climate change. Moreover, this was to proceed with an emphasis on the need to work locally, regionally, nationally, and globally in the sharing and dissemination of environmentally sustainable practices.\n\n=== Community Based Forest Management ===\nCommunity Based Forest Management (CBFM) is a scheme that links governmental forest agencies and the local community in efforts to regenerate degraded forests, reforest deforested areas, and decrease carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. This partnership is done with the intent of not only repairing damage to the environment but also to provide economic and social benefits to the affected area.<ref name=\":06\"/> In principle, the benefits for the local community involvement in the management and protection of their forests would be to provide employment and to supplement income from both the wage labor and additional agriculture which would then strength the entire local economy while improving environmental conditions and mitigating climate change. Therefore, implementing a CBFM system can provide rural development while mitigating climate change and sustaining biodiversity within the region. It is important to engage the local community members, many of which are indigenous, since presumably they would have deeper knowledge of the local ecosystems as well as the life cycles of those ecosystems over time. Their involvement also helps to ensure that their cultural practices remain intact.<ref name=\":06\" />\n\n=== Arbor Day Foundation ===\n{{main|Arbor Day Foundation}}\n\nFounded in 1972, the centennial of the first [[Arbor Day]] observance in the 19th century, the Foundation has grown to become the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to planting trees, with over one million members, supporters, and valued partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Arbor Day Foundation|url=http://arborday.org/generalinfo/about.cfm|website=Arbor Day Foundation|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> They work on projects focused on planting trees around campuses, low-income communities, and communities that have been affected by natural disasters among other places.\n\n=== Trillion Tree Campaign ===\n{{main|Trillion Tree Campaign}}\n\nThe then Billion Tree Campaign was launched in 2006 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) as a response to the challenges of [[global warming]], as well as to a wider array of sustainability challenges, from water supply to [[biodiversity loss]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Commit to Action - Join the Billion Tree Campaign! |url=http://www.plant-for-the-planet-billiontreecampaign.org/About.aspx |website=UNEP |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |accessdate=22 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215181645/http://www.plant-for-the-planet-billiontreecampaign.org/About.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2014 }}</ref> Its initial target was the planting of one billion trees in 2007.

In addition, the increasing demand for low-cost timber products only supports the lumber company to continue logging{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The carbon emitted from the process of converting timber to [[wood product]]s accounts for 15%<ref name=\"auto\"/> of the [[Greenhouse gas|carbon emissions]] in the environment. Deforestation is the main concern in tropical rainforests since they are home to millions of animals and much biodiversity. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}} Not only does the lumber industry impact local deforestation, but it also impacts the whole environment, as deforestation is a major driver of climate change.\n\n=== Livestock ranching ===\n[[Livestock]] [[Ranch|ranching]] requires large portions of land to raise herds of animals and livestock crops for consumer needs. Livestock ranching originated in Texas between 1820 and 1865 which were mainly driven by Mexican cowboys.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/shp/americanwest/cattleranchingrev1.shtml|title=BBC - GCSE Bitesize: Cattle ranching - a brief history|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> Later, Texans drove the Mexicans out, while leaving the cattle behind.

According to [[Greenpeace]], a non-governmental global environmental organization, the cattle industry is responsible for a significant amount of methane emissions. This is because speculators burn huge areas of rainforest for pasture. According to Rhett Butler, over 60% of land that is deforested becomes pasture for animals such as cattle and cows.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.greenpeace.org.uk/how-cattle-ranching-chewing-amazon-rainforest-20090129/|title=How cattle ranches are chewing up the Amazon rainforest {{!}} Greenpeace UK|date=2009-01-31|work=Greenpeace UK|access-date=2018-04-29|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\n=== Agricultural expansion ===\n{{see|Agricultural expansion}}\nThe largest cause of deforestation and acute degradation is agriculture.

The main drivers of deforestation in relation to agriculture are population growth and the increased pressures for agricultural expansion. Deforestation is linked with [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] emissions{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, in part due from crops having a relatively less impressive carbon storage per unit area then wooded areas or forests. Agricultural deforestation can take different forms, the most salient of which are the commercial plantations in tropical regions.\n\nAnother prevalent method of agricultural deforestation is [[Slash-and-burn|slash-and-burn agriculture]], which was primarily used by subsistence farmers in tropical regions but has now become increasingly less sustainable. The method does not leave land for continuous agricultural production, but instead cuts and burns small plots of forest land which are then converted into agricultural zones. The farmers then exploit the nutrients in the ashes of the burned plants{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This method is not sustainable because the plots can only be tilled for 2\u20133 years, where after farmers will move to a different plot and repeat the process. This process will be repeated about 5 to 10 times before a farmer would return to a patch of once deforested land allowed to return to a forested state. If land is not available, the length of time between cycles can be shortened leading to less nutrients in the soil. This lack of nutrients can then lead to smaller crop yields and a need to convert more forest land into agricultural zones. The repeated cycle of low yields and shortened fallow periods eventually results in less vegetation being able to grow on once burned lands and a decrease in average soil biomass.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Houghton|first=R.A|date=December 2012|title=Carbon emissions and the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation in the tropics|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cosust.2012.06.006|journal=Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability|volume=4|issue=6|pages=597\u2013603|doi=10.1016/j.cosust.2012.06.006|issn=1877-3435}}</ref> In small local plots sustainability is not an issue because of longer fallow periods and lesser overall deforestation.

This is posited given that deforested soil is often unsatisfactory for growing crops. Poor quality soil would require extensive modifications and amendments through, primarily, the use of chemical fertilizers. The chemical based alterations along with contemporary farming practices would lead to erosion and soil depletion unless continually treated with these substances. These repeated practices would create an unsustainable cycle needed to keep producing expected yields.<ref name=\":07\">{{Cite journal|last=Offiong|first=E. E.|last2=Ita|first2=P.

Farmers in these studies were encouraged to change from a merely subsistence farming system to an intensive \u201cfor-profit\u201d farming system where products grown were primarily coffee, oil palm, and cocoa, all for export. According to Kovacic and Salazar, there is not an equal exchange between agricultural expansion and economic gains as touted by both governments and large scale agricultural production companies. This holds true for small scale farmers who move from subsistence farming to a small scale intensive farming scheme regardless of product grown.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kovacic|first=Zora|last2=Viteri Salazar|first2=Oswaldo|date=April 2017|title=The lose - lose predicament of deforestation through subsistence farming: Unpacking agricultural expansion in the Ecuadorian Amazon|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=51|pages=105\u2013114|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2017.02.002|issn=0743-0167}}</ref>\n\nIt is also important to note that not all deforestation is as result of agriculture expansion. Food production is only one driver. Between 2001 and 2015 only 27 +/- 5% of all forest disturbances globally were for agricultural expansion. Among other drivers were urbanization, forest fires, logging, and for shifting agriculture practices. The percentages are 0.6 +/- 0.3% for urbanization, 23 +/- 4% for forest fires, 26 +/- 4% for logging, and 24 +/- 3% for shifting agricultural practices. The types of drivers vary greatly depending on the region in which they take place.

This greater the above ground tree biomass density, the greater the amount of Carbon (C) that the forest is able to sequester and storage. A degraded forest therefore is unable to store greater amounts of Carbon (C), thus adding to Climate Change.<ref name=\":06\"/> In order to combat Carbon (C) emissions caused by deforestation and forest degradation actions that sequester and store this Carbon must be taken.

Many other countries and regions are beginning to start or have already started reforestation programs and initiatives in hopes of counteracting global climate change drivers. Reforestation has also been shown to be useful in the process of nurturing once farmed land back to a condition where it can be used for agriculture or conservation. Reforestation can also help mitigate the effects of soil degradation and pollution depending on the methods of planting, location, and plant species.<ref name=\"Cunningham 301\u2013317\"/>\n\n=== Afforestation ===\n{{main|Afforestation}}\n[[Afforestation]] is the planting of trees where there was no previous tree coverage. Degradation of forests ultimately leads to a decrease in oxygen and a sufficient increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. In order to make up for the loss, more trees are being planted. As a result, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could significantly decrease.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/nov/29/planting-trees-climate-change|title=To what extent could planting trees help solve climate change?|last=Institute|first=Grantham Research|date=2012-11-29|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> According to scientific research{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}, plantation forest could absorb more carbon dioxide than natural forest since they grow faster leading to a higher absorbance rate.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}} The process is usually encouraged by governments because they want it to lead to a decrease in carbon dioxide and because it increases the aesthetics of the area. Although, it could lead to infringing upon ecosystems and create complications in environments that previously did not have tree coverage or forests.\n\n==== Afforestation in China ====\nAlthough China has set official goals for reforestation, these goals were set for an 80-year time horizon and were not significantly met by 2008. China is trying to correct these problems with projects such as the [[Three-North Shelter Forest Program|Green Wall of China]], which aims to replant forests and halt the expansion of the [[Gobi Desert]]. A law promulgated in 1981 requires that every school student over the age of 11 plants at least one tree per year. But average success rates, especially in state-sponsored plantings, remains relatively low. And even the properly planted trees have had great difficulty surviving the combined impacts of prolonged droughts, pest infestation, and fires. Nonetheless, China currently has the highest afforestation rate of any country or region in the world, with 4.77 million hectares (47,000 square kilometers) of afforestation in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Yang|first1=Ling|title=China to plant more trees in 2009|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-01/09/content_10631987.htm|website=ChinaView|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|accessdate=23 October 2014}}</ref>\n\n====Afforestation in Japan====\n{{main|Afforestation in Japan}}\nThe primary goal of afforestation projects in Japan is to develop the forest structure of the nation and to maintain the biodiversity found in the Japanese wilderness. The Japanese [[temperate rainforest]] is scattered throughout the Japanese archipelago and is home to many endemic species that are not naturally found anywhere else. As the development of the country's caused a decline in forest cover, a reduction in biodiversity was seen in those areas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miyamoto|first1=Asako|title=The Influence of Forest Management on Landscape Structure in the Cool-Temperate Forest Region of Central Japan.|date=2008|pages=248\u2013256}}</ref>\n\n=== Agroforestry ===\n{{main|Agroforestry}}\n[[Agroforestry]] or agro-sylviculture is a land use management system in which combinations of trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland. It combines agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive, profitable, healthy, and sustainable land-use systems. There are many benefits to agroforestry such as increasing farm profitability.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aftaweb.org/about/what-is-agroforestry.html|title=What is agroforestry?|last=User|first=Super|website=www.aftaweb.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-04-29}}</ref> In addition, agroforestry helps to preserve and protect natural resources such as controlling soil erosions, creating habitat for the wildlife, and managing animal waste{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\n=== GIS and Remote Sensing ===\nGIS and Remote Sensing methods can be used to visualize deforestation in a given area. With the use of satellite imagery, these methods can create maps of a given area to help better understand the health of a forest. Furthermore, from these satellite images, specialists can create false-color composites to differentiate forest cover from bare ground and soil{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This can help visualize the extent of the forest. Additionally, with the use of MODIS Satellites, specialists can stack satellite images of the given area from multiple dates to see if there is any regression of the forest to help visualize deforestation better. {{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n=== Reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation ===\nRecognition of the negative impacts of deforestation and of the overwhelming evidence of global warming has led to the development of international policy surrounding the conservation of forests. One attempt towards fighting climate change globally is the ''[[United Nations REDD Programme|Reducing Emissions for Deforestation and Forest Degradation]]'' (REDD+) efforts, and a few countries are already starting to implement and analyze ways to protect standing trees{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.\n\t\nIn the case of the Bac Kan province in Vietnam, researchers came up with systems to encourage leaving forests intact while also meeting international, national, and individual investments successfully. Their methods included \u201cbenefit-distribution systems\u201d and dividends for [[ecosystem services]]. The researchers hope that their results \u201ccan be replicated and directly contribute to reducing carbon emissions globally.\u201d<ref>Hoang, M. H., et al. \"Benefit distribution across scales to reduce emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) in Vietnam.\" Land Use Policy, vol 31, 6 Sept. 2011, pp. 48-60.</ref>\n\n== Human Dimension Of Deforestation and Climate Change ==\nDeforestation is often described as the changing of land from forested to non-forested by means both natural and unnatural. The relationship between deforestation and climate change is one of a positive feedback loop{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The more trees that are removed equals larger effects of climate change which, in turn, results in the loss of more trees{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. In recent history, this process has been accelerated and amplified by humans in many different ways. These include logging, urbanization, mining, and agricultural development{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. The incessant need to expand these operations has resulted in widespread deforestation worldwide.\n\n=== Agricultural ===\n[[File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|301x301px|[[:File:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|Amazonie deforestation.jpg]]]]\nAgricultural expansion is one of the worst offenders in when it comes to deforestation in recent times.

It is displacing native tribes; it is eliminating one of the largest oxygen providers and carbon sinks in the world; and it can even lead to sickness and disease{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Deforestation sends a shock wave through the natural world, resulting in many previously unforeseen complications{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. This just goes to show just how much of an impact humans can have on themselves by continuing to take down forested land. One example regarding the possibility of human sickness can stem from some of the wildlife that is being displaced and killed off, birds to be more specific{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}. Birds are being forced to live in new habitats due to many species being relocated{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.

More people means that more space is needed, and there are two ways to accommodate it, going up or going out. Both require resources and going out requires land, so more deforestation is a very real possibility in this situation. More people in the cities means that more power is needed to keep every ting running, and more water needs to be pumped in to meet the growing needs{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.

Among the environmental initiatives highlighted were forest management, resource conservation, and mitigating climate change. Moreover, this was to proceed with an emphasis on the need to work locally, regionally, nationally, and globally in the sharing and dissemination of environmentally sustainable practices.\n\n=== Community Based Forest Management ===\nCommunity Based Forest Management (CBFM) is a scheme that links governmental forest agencies and the local community in efforts to regenerate degraded forests, reforest deforested areas, and decrease carbon emissions that contribute to climate change. This partnership is done with the intent of not only repairing damage to the environment but also to provide economic and social benefits to the affected area.<ref name=\":06\"/> In principle, the benefits for the local community involvement in the management and protection of their forests would be to provide employment and to supplement income from both the wage labor and additional agriculture which would then strength the entire local economy while improving environmental conditions and mitigating climate change. Therefore, implementing a CBFM system can provide rural development while mitigating climate change and sustaining biodiversity within the region. It is important to engage the local community members, many of which are indigenous, since presumably they would have deeper knowledge of the local ecosystems as well as the life cycles of those ecosystems over time. Their involvement also helps to ensure that their cultural practices remain intact.<ref name=\":06\" />\n\n=== Arbor Day Foundation ===\n{{main|Arbor Day Foundation}}\n\nFounded in 1972, the centennial of the first [[Arbor Day]] observance in the 19th century, the Foundation has grown to become the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to planting trees, with over one million members, supporters, and valued partners.<ref>{{cite web|title=About the Arbor Day Foundation|url=http://arborday.org/generalinfo/about.cfm|website=Arbor Day Foundation|accessdate=20 October 2014}}</ref> They work on projects focused on planting trees around campuses, low-income communities, and communities that have been affected by natural disasters among other places.\n\n=== Trillion Tree Campaign ===\n{{main|Trillion Tree Campaign}}\n\nThe then Billion Tree Campaign was launched in 2006 by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) as a response to the challenges of [[global warming]], as well as to a wider array of sustainability challenges, from water supply to [[biodiversity loss]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Commit to Action - Join the Billion Tree Campaign! |url=http://www.plant-for-the-planet-billiontreecampaign.org/About.aspx |website=UNEP |publisher=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) |accessdate=22 October 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141215181645/http://www.plant-for-the-planet-billiontreecampaign.org/About.aspx |archivedate=15 December 2014 }}</ref> Its initial target was the planting of one billion trees in 2007.

Three months before the conference, the 7 billion planted trees mark had been surpassed.

It was created as a result of a partnership between [[M6 Group]] and state-owned broadcaster [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]].\n\n==History==\nThe channel was launched on 18 November 2005 on the [[digital terrestrial television in France|digital terrestrial television]] platform in France. Ten years later, on 1 July 2015, Gulli launched its own HD simulcast feed on the [[Astra 1]] satellite. On 5 April 2016, its HD feed is launched on [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]].\n\nGulli is a joint venture between kids-television pioneer companies [[Lagard\u00e8re Active]] and the state-owned [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]]. The former is known due to is children's network, [[Canal J]], while the latter has a long history investing on kids programming through its youth-oriented division on [[France 3]]. On 23 December 2013, a deal was reached between Lagard\u00e8re and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions to purchase the latter's shares on Gulli. The deal was finalised on 29 October 2014 with the transfer of 34% of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions's shares to Lagard\u00e8re for \u20ac25&nbsp;million.\n\nThe network has been launched in Russia, Africa and the Middle East, broadcasting in Russian, French and Arabic. The brand itself was sold alongside the rest of the Lagad\u00e9re channels to [[Groupe M6]] in 2019.\n\n== Branding ==\nAt the CSA hearings for the new DTT channels, the channel was presented under the name of ''Gulliver'', named after [[Jonathan Swift]]'s character ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', before being baptized ''Gulli''.\n\nOn 8 April 2010, ''Gulli'' puts on the air a new branding designed by G\u00e9d\u00e9on. On the same occasion, the channel is modernizing its logo, which has become darker, giving it volume and changing to 16/9 but dynamically (4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio).\n\nA new branding, again designed by the G\u00e9d\u00e9on, is on the air in September 2013.\n\nOn 28 August 2017, ''Gulli'' changed its branding. This branding is done by the 17MARS.

It was created as a result of a partnership between [[M6 Group]] and state-owned broadcaster [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]].\n\n==History==\nThe channel was launched on 18 November 2005 on the [[digital terrestrial television in France|digital terrestrial television]] platform in France. Ten years later, on 1 July 2015, Gulli launched its own HD simulcast feed on the [[Astra 1]] satellite. On 5 April 2016, its HD feed is launched on [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]].\n\nGulli is a joint venture between kids-television pioneer companies [[Lagard\u00e8re Active]] and the state-owned [[France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions]]. The former is known due to is children's network, [[Canal J]], while the latter has a long history investing on kids programming through its youth-oriented division on [[France 3]]. On 23 December 2013, a deal was reached between Lagard\u00e8re and France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions to purchase the latter's shares on Gulli. The deal was finalised on 29 October 2014 with the transfer of 34% of France T\u00e9l\u00e9visions's shares to Lagard\u00e8re for \u20ac25&nbsp;million.\n\nThe network has been launched in Russia, Africa and the Middle East, broadcasting in Russian, French and Arabic. The brand itself was sold alongside the rest of the Lagad\u00e9re channels to [[Groupe M6]] in 2019.\n\n== Branding ==\nAt the CSA hearings for the new DTT channels, the channel was presented under the name of ''Gulliver'', named after [[Jonathan Swift]]'s character ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', before being baptized ''Gulli''.\n\nOn 8 April 2010, ''Gulli'' puts on the air a new branding designed by G\u00e9d\u00e9on. On the same occasion, the channel is modernizing its logo, which has become darker, giving it volume and changing to 16/9 but dynamically (4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratio).\n\nA new branding, again designed by the G\u00e9d\u00e9on, is on the air in September 2013.\n\nOn 28 August 2017, ''Gulli'' changed its branding. This branding is done by the 17MARS. This new skin receives very positive reviews and gives a lot of color to the channel.\n\n=== Logos ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Gulli arrive sur la TNT.PNG|Old logo from November 18, 2005 to April 8, 2010\nFile:Gulli Logo.png|Old logo from April 8, 2010 to August 27, 2017.\nFile:Gulli 2017 nouveau logo.jpg|Current logo since August 28, 2017.\n</gallery>\n\n=== Logos of derived channels ===\n<gallery>\nFile:Gulli Girl (2018-\u043d.\u0432.).png|New logo of Gulli Girl\n</gallery>\n\n=== Slogans ===\n\n==== Version 1 (2005 \u2013 2010) ====\n\n* November 18, 2005 to September 25, 2007: \"Gulli, la cha\u00eene des enfants sur la TNT \u00bb\n* September 26, 2007 to December 24, 2008: \"Gulli, pour tous les yeux \u00bb\n* December 26, 2008 to April 5, 2010: \"Gardez le contact \u00bb\n\n==== Version 2 (2010 \u2013 2017) ====\n\n* April 7, 2010 to August 3, 2013: \"Gulli remue toute la famille \u00bb\n* August 3, 2013 to March 17, 2014: \"Gulli.

One of his early career highlights came at the 360 Nationals at Skagit Speedway in [[Alger, Washington]], when he competed against an elite field of dirt racers and brought home an impressive second-place finish. He recently was the first Idaho native to make a debut at the Daytona 500.\n\n===NASCAR===\n\n====Camping World Truck Series====\nWhile splitting time between [[CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series|USAR]] and Late Models, Scott's father, JB, announced he had purchased the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series]] team [[Xpress Motorsports]]. Scott then made his NASCAR debut at the [[Smith's 350|Smith's Las Vegas 350]] and in 2008 moved to the Trucks full-time to run for and eventually finish second for the Rookie of the Year. [[Albertsons (SuperValu)|Albertsons]] became the team's new sponsor and after a change to [[Toyota]] they end the year strong with five top-tens in the last seven races, including a second-place finish at the season-ending Ford 200. He went on to finish out his Truck resume with a win in the 2009 [[AAA Insurance 200 (Dover)|AAA Insurance 200]] at [[Dover International Speedway]], twenty top-tens, nine top-fives, and several runner up finishes. On November 9, 2012, Scott added his second win in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series at Phoenix International Raceway in the Lucas Oil 150 and delivered [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] their second win of the season.\n\n====Xfinity Series====\n[[File:Nationwide 11 Brian Scott 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|left|Scott's No. 11 at Road America in 2011]]\nHis Nationwide Series debut came in 2009 with seven starts in the series driving No. 10 and No. 11 for [[Braun Racing]]. Scott's first full season in the Nationwide Series was completed in 2010 with one Top 5 and five Top 10 finishes en route to finishing the season as the runner-up for Raybestos Rookie of the Year honors. Scott ran the first 28 races in the Braun Racing No. 11 but was released from the ride when Steve Turner bought the team. Scott finished the season in the RAB Racing No. 09. \n\nScott joined Joe Gibbs Racing in 2011 driving No. 11. His 2011 Nationwide Series campaign earned him two top-five finishes, seven top-10 finishes and one pole under the Joe Gibbs Racing banner. He also scored the Featherlite Most Improved driver of the year award. Scott finished eighth in the Nationwide Series point standings in 2011.\n\nScott and crew chief [[Kevin Kidd]] returned to the No. 11 team in 2012, gaining a sponsorship from [[Dollar General]]. In addition, Scott signed to drive the No. 18 in the Camping World Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports in a few races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=404|title=Hoping to Make Truck Series Start No. 50 Very Nifty|date=April 17, 2012|publisher=Kyle Busch Motorsports|accessdate=2012-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011093225/http://kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=404|archivedate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> Scott would have a best finish of 3rd at Dover in the Nationwide Series, and returned to Victory Lane in the Truck Series at Phoenix.

In the race, Scott ran in the top 15 the entire race but was collected in \"[[The Big One (NASCAR)|The Big One]]\" that struck with 45 laps to go.\n\nIt was announced that Scott would drive the No. 29 for RCR in the [[2015 Daytona 500]], however just before the entry list was released, RCR cancelled plans to field the car for him. Instead, he was hired to drive the No. 62 Chevrolet of [[Premium Motorsports]] with RCR support, though Shore Lodge still sponsored the effort. Scott failed to qualify for the Daytona 500. Scott then successfully qualified RCR's No. 33 entry the next week at Atlanta. However, after [[Michael Annett]] failed to qualify, Scott gave up his ride to allow the Sprint Cup regular to earn driver points.

One of his early career highlights came at the 360 Nationals at Skagit Speedway in [[Alger, Washington]], when he competed against an elite field of dirt racers and brought home an impressive second-place finish. He recently was the first Idaho native to make a debut at the Daytona 500.\n\n===NASCAR===\n\n====Camping World Truck Series====\nWhile splitting time between [[CARS X-1R Pro Cup Series|USAR]] and Late Models, Scott's father, JB, announced he had purchased the [[NASCAR]] [[Camping World Truck Series]] team [[Xpress Motorsports]]. Scott then made his NASCAR debut at the [[Smith's 350|Smith's Las Vegas 350]] and in 2008 moved to the Trucks full-time to run for and eventually finish second for the Rookie of the Year. [[Albertsons (SuperValu)|Albertsons]] became the team's new sponsor and after a change to [[Toyota]] they end the year strong with five top-tens in the last seven races, including a second-place finish at the season-ending Ford 200. He went on to finish out his Truck resume with a win in the 2009 [[AAA Insurance 200 (Dover)|AAA Insurance 200]] at [[Dover International Speedway]], twenty top-tens, nine top-fives, and several runner up finishes. On November 9, 2012, Scott added his second win in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series at Phoenix International Raceway in the Lucas Oil 150 and delivered [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] their second win of the season.\n\n====Xfinity Series====\n[[File:Nationwide 11 Brian Scott 2011 Road America Bucyrus 200.jpg|thumb|left|Scott's No. 11 at Road America in 2011]]\nHis Nationwide Series debut came in 2009 with seven starts in the series driving No. 10 and No. 11 for [[Braun Racing]]. Scott's first full season in the Nationwide Series was completed in 2010 with one Top 5 and five Top 10 finishes en route to finishing the season as the runner-up for Raybestos Rookie of the Year honors. Scott ran the first 28 races in the Braun Racing No. 11 but was released from the ride when Steve Turner bought the team. Scott finished the season in the RAB Racing No. 09. \n\nScott joined Joe Gibbs Racing in 2011 driving No. 11. His 2011 Nationwide Series campaign earned him two top-five finishes, seven top-10 finishes and one pole under the Joe Gibbs Racing banner. He also scored the Featherlite Most Improved driver of the year award. Scott finished eighth in the Nationwide Series point standings in 2011.\n\nScott and crew chief [[Kevin Kidd]] returned to the No. 11 team in 2012, gaining a sponsorship from [[Dollar General]]. In addition, Scott signed to drive the No. 18 in the Camping World Truck Series for Kyle Busch Motorsports in a few races.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=404|title=Hoping to Make Truck Series Start No. 50 Very Nifty|date=April 17, 2012|publisher=Kyle Busch Motorsports|accessdate=2012-04-18|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011093225/http://kylebuschmotorsports.com/news/entry.php?nid=404|archivedate=October 11, 2013}}</ref> Scott would have a best finish of 3rd at Dover in the Nationwide Series, and returned to Victory Lane in the Truck Series at Phoenix.

Conway cited it as justification for [[Executive Order 13769|a travel and immigration ban]] from seven Muslim-majority countries enacted by [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Donald Trump]]. However, no such massacre occurred. The day after the interview, Conway said she misspoke and had been referring to the 2011 arrest of two Iraqi refugees in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]], on charges including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]]\".<ref name=fbi2011/> She stated that she had mentioned the incident because it led President [[Barack Obama]] to tighten immigration procedures for Iraqi citizens.\n\nHer false statement went [[Viral phenomenon|viral]] and became the top trending topic on [[Twitter]], with many tweets parodying it. A website was set up anonymously for the purpose of collecting donations for supposed victims. [[Facebook]] users used the site's [[Facebook Safety Check|safety check feature]] to act as if the event were real. Mock vigils were held in Kentucky and New York in commemoration. It provoked widespread press reaction, with many relating it to Conway's earlier use of the phrase ''[[alternative facts]]'' to describe false statements by [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Sean Spicer]] in the wake of the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]].\n\n==Background==\n===Terrorism-related arrests in Bowling Green===\n[[File:Fountain Square Park, Bowling Green, Kentucky.JPG|thumb|Bowling Green, Kentucky, the target in Conway's \"massacre\" statement]]\n\nIn 2011, two Iraqi men who had entered the country as refugees were arrested in Bowling Green, Kentucky, on federal terrorism charges after they attempted to send both money and weapons to al-Qaeda in Iraq.<ref name=fbi2011/><ref name=\"washpo\" /><ref name=\"NYT Coscarelli\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/us/politics/bowling-green-massacre-kellyanne-conway.html |title=Kellyanne Conway Admits 'Bowling Green massacre' Error |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=February 3, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |access-date=February 3, 2017}}</ref> Both were convicted of supporting attacks on the U.S. military while they were still in Iraq as well as attempting to provide material support to al-Qaeda in Iraq after they emigrated to the United States.<ref name=\"NYT Coscarelli\" /> Arrests were made on various charges, including \"attempting to provide material support to terrorists and to al Qaeda in Iraq\".<ref name=fbi2011>{{cite press release |publisher=U.S. Department of Justice |title=Federal Bureau of Investigation |url=https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/louisville/press-releases/2011/two-iraqi-nationals-indicted-on-federal-terrorism-charges-in-kentucky |accessdate=February 8, 2017 |language=English |date=May 31, 2011}}</ref>\n\nBefore entering the U.S., both had used [[improvised explosive device]]s in Iraq,<ref name=\"OPA\">{{cite press release |author=Office of Public Affairs |title=Former Iraqi Terrorists Living in Kentucky Sentenced for Terrorist Activities |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-iraqi-terrorists-living-kentucky-sentenced-terrorist-activities |date=January 29, 2013 |publisher=[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] |accessdate=February 3, 2017|author-link=Office of Public Affairs }}</ref> although this was not known at the time of their admission.

The campus sits on {{convert|300|acre|ha}} amid the scenic [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] and currently enrolls 295 students in grades nine through twelve.  The campus was named by [[Architectural Digest]] magazine in 2018 as the most beautiful private school campus in North Carolina.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/most-beautiful-private-high-schools-in-america|title=The Most Beautiful Private High School in Every State in America|first=Cond\u00e9|last=Nast|website=Architectural Digest}}</ref> The school was ranked the seventh best boarding school in the U.S. by independent education organization TheBestSchools.org.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thebestschools.org/features/best-boarding-schools-in-us/|title=The 50 Best Boarding Schools in the U.S.|first=Staff|last=Writers|date=7 May 2015|website=TheBestSchools.org}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nAsheville School was founded in 1900 by Charles Andrews Mitchell and Newton Mitchell Anderson. Previously, the pair founded the [[University School]] in [[Cleveland]], Ohio in 1890. Fifty-three male boarding students from grades 5 through 12 called \"forms\" were enrolled that first year.\n\n==Academics==\n\nAsheville School's academic course of study stresses a traditional core curriculum of the humanities, sciences, mathematics, foreign language and the arts. Classes are small.\n\nAsheville School has a humanities program that integrates the study of literature, history, religion, art, music, architecture, film and dance into a series of four year-long courses: Ancient Studies, World Studies, European Studies and American Studies. English and history teachers may team-teach these courses, sometimes with the assistance of the school's music teacher and other guest lecturers. The academic program is writing intensive, culminating in a final research project known as the Senior Demonstration demands that seniors produce two papers on a topic of their choosing and complete an oral defense for twenty minutes.\n\n==Honor and school life==\n\nStudents at Asheville School are expected to live by high ethical standards and to uphold an honor code. The Asheville School Honor Code stipulates that no student will lie, cheat or steal, and that he or she will report any student who does. When submitting any independent work, students \"pledge\" that they have adhered to the honor code. Six students are chosen by their peers to serve on the Honor Council, a body composed of these students as well as a handful of faculty members that hears all violations of the Code. The Honor Council is largely didactic rather than disciplinary, and is complemented by a Conduct Council that hears cases involving infractions of school rules not pertaining to honor.\n\n==Activities==\n\nAll students must participate in an \"afternoon activity\" after the academic day ends. Students participate in one activity during each of three seasons, and all third and fourth formers are required to participate in one team sport during the course of the year. Each student can participate in art, drama, music, technology/robotics, life fitness, equestrian, mountaineering, or an interscholastic sport.\n\n==Mountaineering==\n\nAsheville School has a well-established mountaineering program that participate in backpacking, rock climbing, [[whitewater kayaking]], snow skiing, caving and mountain biking. Many students take mountaineering as an afternoon activity for daily on-campus instruction and practice. On-campus facilities include a high-ropes course, an Alpine Tower, a bouldering wall, a swimming pool (for kayak instruction) and {{convert|200|acre|km2}} of forested land with miles of trails for biking and exploring. Off-campus trips are frequently offered to places such as Looking Glass Rock in Pisgah National Forest, the Tuckaseegee and French Broad rivers, and the Tsali Recreational area. All new students go on at least one overnight camping trip during their first year at Asheville School that introduces students to the school's mountaineering program.  Early (mid'60s)leaders of the outdoors program were mountaineering leaders, Pop Hollandsworth and [[Vincent Richards Lee|Vince Lee]].\n==Arts==\n\nAsheville School offers a variety of musical groups, including chorus, chamber choir, handbell ensemble, instrumental ensemble, and a cappella group. Students may also pursue musical endeavors on their own by taking music lessons. Dance is offered as an activity during the winter and spring seasons. Dancers often design and choreograph their own shows, and typically collaborate with thespians on the winter musical.\n\n==Community life==\n\nThe Asheville School student body is made up of approximately 80% boarding students and 20% day students. The school values diversity, and has students from twenty-six states and thirteen countries. Roughly a quarter of the students receive need-based financial aid. The school has about the same number of males and females.\n\nBoarding students live in one of three dormitories: Lawrence Hall, Anderson Hall, and Kehaya House.\n\nAsheville School students are expected to maintain a well-groomed, well-dressed appearance. For boys, classroom dress includes jackets and ties; for girls, a dress skirt, sweater, or dress pants with a blazer.\n\nThe school stresses the need for a strong community, and the concept of \"seated meals\" perfectly exemplifies this belief. Most weekday lunches, as well as dinners on Thursday and either lunches or dinners on Sunday, are \"seated\": students sit at a circular table headed by a faculty member, and are served by a student waiter. The composition of these table changes every two weeks so as to allow students to get to know nearly all members of the student body.\n\nThe entire school community gathers several times a week for chapel services and convocations. Sixth formers are required to deliver a ten-minute chapel or convocation talk on a topic of their choosing, an event that (along with the Senior Demonstration) represents the capstone of a student's career at Asheville School. Following the talk, the entire student body exchanges handshakes with and congratulates the speaker. Chapel and convocation services may also feature guest speakers ranging from Buddhist monks to notable authors.\n\n==Student leadership==\n\nThe headmaster, in consultation with teachers and former student leaders, appoints proctors and prefects to serve as the school's representatives amongst the student body. These fifth formers (proctors) and sixth formers (prefects) represent the most responsible members of their respective classes, and assist faculty members in running the dorms, managing study hall, and enforcing school standards. Prefects are also expected to serve on the Conduct Council (see \"Honor and School Life\").\n\n==Traditions==\n\nThe football rival of Asheville School (the Blues) is [[Christ School (North Carolina)|Christ School]] (the Greenies). At Asheville School, the rivalry game is preceded by a week of festivities that culminates in a pep rally the evening before the Blues take the field. The Asheville School-Christ School rivalry represents North Carolina's longest-running high school athletic rivalry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashevilleschool.org/asheville-school-news/~post/asheville-school-hosts-91st-rivalry-football-game-against-christ-school-20171024|title=Asheville School - Asheville School News|website=www.ashevilleschool.org}}</ref>\n\nThe traditional Asheville School dessert is the Asheville School banana: a banana is sliced in half lengthwise, then coated with lemon juice and sugar.  The dessert is also featured on Vineyard Vines ties, bags, and belts.\n \nEach September, the entire student body heads to Camp Rockmont in [[Black Mountain, North Carolina]] for a day of recreation. Traditionally, a game of hide-and-seek between the headmaster and the members of the sixth form class takes place. The headmaster attempts to conceal himself somewhere on the grounds of the camp, and the seniors attempt to discover his location so that they may toss him into the camp lake.\n\nTowards the end of the school year, seniors will go on a senior retreat at the Black Mountain College. During the retreat, seniors will vote and decide who they want to speak at graduation. \n\nFor graduation, it is tradition that the girls wear white.\n\n==Notable alumni==\nNotable [[Alumnus|alumni]] of Asheville School include:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ashevilleschool.org/alumni/notable-alumni|title=Notable Alumni - Asheville School|website=www.ashevilleschool.org}}</ref>\n* [[Pete Dye]]\n* [[James Hormel]]\n* [[H.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.

On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder. This saw them granted exclusive authority to negotiate the terms and conditions for an acquisition of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport holding and the construction and operation of the new airport for 50 years.<ref name=\"welt\">{{cite news| url=https://www.welt.de/print-welt/article630849/Hochtief-baut-in-Schoenefeld.html| work=[[Die Welt]]| title=Hochtief baut in Sch\u00f6nefeld| date=19 September 1998| last=Sch\u00fcmann| first=Timm| language=German| trans-title=Hochtief expands in Sch\u00f6nefeld}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 March 1999, BBF officially commissioned Hochtief and its partners to construct the new airport, causing IVG to file a lawsuit.

It became clear on 8 May 2012 that the building could not open on schedule, officially due to the failure of the fire protection system. In reality, according to a Brandenburg State Audit report in February 2016 the usability of the airport was at 56.2% (there were no ticket counters, the escalators did not work, etc.).

On the retail side of the airport, shops and restaurants prepared for the opening. As the airports in Tegel and Sch\u00f6nefeld were to close once the last flights of 2 June had been serviced, a major logistics operation for moving the airports' infrastructure was launched. Vehicles, equipment and supplies that were needed at Tegel until the final moments would have been transported to BER during the night of 2\u20133 June. To allow this, the authorities planned to restrict the highways linking the two airports ([[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]], [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and parts of [[Bundesautobahn 111|A111]]) to airport traffic only.<ref name=\"megamove\">{{cite news| url=http://www.thelocal.de/national/20120411-41867.html| title=Mega move to new Berlin Airport begins|date=11 April 2012| work=[[The Local]]}}</ref> [[Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg]], the national broadcaster for Berlin and Brandenburg, scheduled 24 hours of continuous live coverage of the airport move.<ref name=\"rbb\">{{cite press release| title=24 h Airport \u2013 Der Flughafenumzug live| trans-title=24 h Airport: The Airport Move Live| date=30 April 2012| publisher=RBB| url=http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130217064110/http://www.rbb-online.de/themen/flughafen-ber/flughafen_ber/programmtipp/24_stunden_live.html| url-status=dead|archive-date=17 February 2013| language=German}}</ref> A special Lufthansa flight to [[Frankfurt Airport]], operated with an [[Airbus A380]], was scheduled as the first departure from the new airport on 3 June at 06:00.<ref name=\"rbb\" />\n\nOn 8 May 2012 just 26 days before the move, FBB again postponed the opening date.

Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

The issue is complicated by the fact that the line would have to cross the state border and it is unclear who would have to pay for which parts of construction operations and maintenance. While Berlin has many \"ghost stations\" built in preparation for potential future construction, there is no provision underneath the terminal building for a subway station.\n\n===Road===\n[[File:Berlin Stra\u00dfenverkehr BER.png|thumb|Map of motorways in Berlin]]\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport is connected by its own exit to the [[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]]. The road carries traffic into Berlin to the [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and out to the [[Bundesautobahn 10|A10]] where it continues south as the [[Bundesautobahn 13|A13]] in the direction of Dresden. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin. There are also concerns at increased accidents and air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neues-verkehrsgutachten-zum-hauptstadtflughafen-der-ber-koennte-die-stadtautobahn-lahmlegen/14535896.html |title=Der BER k\u00f6nnte die Stadtautobahn lahmlegen|trans-title=BER could cripple traffic on city highways |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> The traffic volumes would also cause frequent closings of the Britz tunnel on the A100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/kolumne/wenn-der-flughafen-ber-oeffnet-dann-schliesst-der-tunnel-britz-2|title=Wenn der Flughafen BER \u00f6ffnet, dann schlie\u00dft der Tunnel Britz|trans-title=if BER opens tunnel Britz closes}}\n</ref>\n\nOver 10% of passengers are expected to come from [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/hauptstadtflughafen-landkreis-warnt-vor--verkehrsinfarkt--am-ber-29614178| title=Hauptstadtflughafen Landkreis warnt vor \"Verkehrsinfarkt\" am BER |accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> also thanks to upgraded highways on the Polish side of the border.

The X11 bus continues to [[Lichterfelde-West]] and to [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]].

A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.

On 22 April 1945, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops occupied the airfield as part of the [[Battle of Berlin]]. In 1946, the headquarters of the [[Soviet Air Forces]] moved to Sch\u00f6nefeld from [[Johannisthal Air Field]].\n\nDuring the following years Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport became the most important civilian airport in the newly-founded German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]), with national flag carrier [[Interflug]] based there. In 1976, the modern passenger terminal, currently known as Terminal A, opened.\n\n===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===\n[[File:Map Berlin-Schoenefeld Airport SFX with planed BBI.png|thumb|Map showing the infrastructure of the Sch\u00f6nefeld area and the relationship between the new and old airports]]\n\nAfter the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1989, and following the [[German reunification]] in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognize the city's increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. Existing airports [[Berlin Tegel Airport|Tegel Airport]], [[Berlin Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport|Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport]] and [[Berlin Tempelhof Airport|Tempelhof Airport]] were aging and becoming increasingly congested due to rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the ''single airport concept'', meaning that the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Sch\u00f6nefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.\n\nOn 2 May 1991, the ''[[Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH|Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH]]'' (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37 percent each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26 percent). [[Eberhard Diepgen]], Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board.  The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that [[Sperenberg Airfield]], [[J\u00fcterbog Airfield]] and the area south of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, J\u00fcterbog East, J\u00fcterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Sch\u00f6nefeld South was carried out according to 5 criteria with different weighting.

They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by [[Hochtief]] through its [[Hochtief Airport]] subsidiary and included [[ABB Group|ABB]], [[Fraport]] and [[Landesbank Berlin Holding|Bankengesellschaft Berlin]] as partners.

On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder.

Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of {{convert|60|km|mi}} of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.<ref name=\"failures\" /> The {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} long exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire is leaking.<ref name=\"leaking\">{{cite news| url=https://de.nachrichten.yahoo.com/zeitung-brandschutzanlage-am-ber-undicht-091259096.html |title=Zeitung: Brandschutzanlage am BER undicht| date=18 May 2014| work=Yahoo!

The underground railway station needs a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains may suck smoke into the station. As such, air flow guidance is needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport cannot decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the [[Federal Railway Authority]] (''Eisenbahnbundesamt''). The construction authority of the district of [[Dahme-Spreewald]], Eisenbahnbundesamt and the airport thus need to take part in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/flughafen-berlin-brandenburg-ber-liegt-acht-monate-hinter-dem-zeitplan/13423488.html |date=9 April 2016 |title=BER liegt acht Monate hinter dem Zeitplan |trans-title=BER is 8 months behind schedule |work=Tagesspiegel}}</ref>\n\nOn 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would check on the plans intensively.

They are the same company which designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport which opened in 1974.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} At BER the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called ''midfield airport'' above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.\n\nThe [[Airport check-in|check-in area]] is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called ''check-in isles''. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015 two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airliners.de/pavillons-hauptstadtflughafen-ber/35849 |title=Pavillons am neuen Hauptstadtflughafen BER sind fertig |publisher=airliners.de |accessdate=17 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and [[Airport security|screened]] passengers. [[Securitas (Swedish security company)|Securitas Germany]] will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 [[jet bridge]]s with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier {{convert|715|m|ft|sigfig=3}} long and the north and south piers at {{convert|350|m|ft|sigfig=3}} each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges, all but one have two levels, thus separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for [[Schengen Area|Schengen passengers]] (gates A01\u2013A20, B01\u2013B20), while Level 2 (gates C01\u2013C19, D01\u2013D17) is for non-Schengen passengers.<ref name=presskit/>{{rp|8\u201310}}  Eight of the gates can accommodate [[wide-body aircraft]] and one gate has been designed to accommodate the [[Airbus A380]]. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21\u201322 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the [[United States]] and [[Israel]].

The issue is complicated by the fact that the line would have to cross the state border and it is unclear who would have to pay for which parts of construction operations and maintenance. While Berlin has many \"ghost stations\" built in preparation for potential future construction, there is no provision underneath the terminal building for a subway station.\n\n===Road===\n[[File:Berlin Stra\u00dfenverkehr BER.png|thumb|Map of motorways in Berlin]]\nBerlin Brandenburg Airport is connected by its own exit to the [[Bundesautobahn 113|A113]]. The road carries traffic into Berlin to the [[Bundesautobahn 100|A100]] and out to the [[Bundesautobahn 10|A10]] where it continues south as the [[Bundesautobahn 13|A13]] in the direction of Dresden. The [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 96|highway 96a]] along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards [[Potsdam]].\n\nFour car parks and a car rental centre will be completed by the opening of BER. Around 10,000 parking spaces will be available in four [[multi-storey car park]]s.\n\nA study released in September 2016 attested that BER will double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the [[Autobahn]] once the airport opens. The A100 and A113 do not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and will lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin. There are also concerns at increased accidents and air pollution.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/neues-verkehrsgutachten-zum-hauptstadtflughafen-der-ber-koennte-die-stadtautobahn-lahmlegen/14535896.html |title=Der BER k\u00f6nnte die Stadtautobahn lahmlegen|trans-title=BER could cripple traffic on city highways |accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref> The traffic volumes would also cause frequent closings of the Britz tunnel on the A100.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bz-berlin.de/berlin/kolumne/wenn-der-flughafen-ber-oeffnet-dann-schliesst-der-tunnel-britz-2|title=Wenn der Flughafen BER \u00f6ffnet, dann schlie\u00dft der Tunnel Britz|trans-title=if BER opens tunnel Britz closes}}\n</ref>\n\nOver 10% of passengers are expected to come from [[Poland]],<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/berlin/verkehr/hauptstadtflughafen-landkreis-warnt-vor--verkehrsinfarkt--am-ber-29614178| title=Hauptstadtflughafen Landkreis warnt vor \"Verkehrsinfarkt\" am BER |accessdate=18 February 2018}}</ref> also thanks to upgraded highways on the Polish side of the border.

BER will be served by the express buses X7 and X11. The X7 connects to the [[U7 (Berlin U-Bahn)|U7]] subway at [[Rudow (Berlin U-Bahn)|Rudow station]]. The X11 bus continues to [[Lichterfelde-West]] and to [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]]. Other bus lines also stop at a number of stations, providing connections with Berlin's public transport network and destinations in Brandenburg.\n\n==Commercial and exposition area==\n\n===Berlin Air Show (ILA)===\n[[File:F-WWIQ Airbus A320 sharklet ILA 2012 02.jpg|thumb|right|Visitors to the Berlin Air Show watching a flight display of an [[Airbus A320]] (2012)]]\nOn 3 July 2012, the [[Berlin ExpoCenter Airport]] opened on the southeastern portion of the airport grounds.<ref name=expocenter>{{cite press release| title=Berlin ExpoCenter Airport built in record time| url=http://www.berlin-expocenter-airport.de/en/Presse/Pressemitteilungen/index.jsp?lang=en&id=219969| publisher=Messe Berlin| date=3 July 2012}}</ref> [[Messe Berlin]] operates the {{convert|250000|m2|adj=off}} exposition facility that is primarily intended as the site of the biennial [[Berlin Air Show]].<ref name=bdli>{{cite press release| url=http://www.bdli.de/en/images/pm_spatenstich%20e_.pdf| title=Groundbreaking ceremony at new ILA grounds| publisher=BDLI| date=18 August 2011| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101205634/http://www.bdli.de/en/images/pm_spatenstich%20e_.pdf| archivedate=1 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Airport Information Center===\nCoinciding with groundbreaking for construction of the new airport, an information and public relations center called ''airportworld'' opened near the old Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport.

Marketing of the real estate began in autumn 2006 and beginning in 2009 offices, hotels, car rentals, four parking decks with a capacity of 10,000, restaurants and retail spaces were built here.\n\nTo the north is the ''BER Business Park Berlin'' with a planned area of {{convert|109|ha}} for industrial and commercial use as well as congress centers. A further ''Business Park North'' was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Sch\u00f6nefeld terminal. However, so far there are no definite plans for the future use of this area.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\n==Controversies==\nIn September 2010 [[Deutsche Flugsicherung]] published aircraft arrival and departure paths for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin ([[Lichtenrade]], [[Steglitz]] and [[Zehlendorf, Berlin|Zehlendorf]]) and adjacent Brandenburg ([[Teltow]], [[Stahnsdorf]], [[Kleinmachnow]] and [[Potsdam]]) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.<ref name=warner>{{cite news| url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/a-749894.html| work=Der Spiegel| title=Resistance Builds to Planned Flight Paths at New Berlin Airport| date=3 November 2011| first=Mary Beth| last=Warner}}</ref>\n\nBoth the expansion of Sch\u00f6nefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The ''B\u00fcrgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.'' represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the [[Berlin Hauptbahnhof]]. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the [[Berlin\u2013Dresden railway]], which was planned to be finished by 2020.<ref name=dresdnerbahn>{{cite news| title=Reisezeitverl\u00e4ngerungen f\u00fcr Airport-Express-Reisende| url=http://www.berliner-zeitung.de/newsticker/reisezeitverlaengerungen-fuer-airport-express-reisende,10917074,10928694.html| work=Berliner Zeitung| date=26 August 2011| trans-title=Longer travel times for Airport Express travelers| language=German}}</ref> However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be more than 50 minutes until at least 2025.
