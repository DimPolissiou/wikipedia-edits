Taggart most recently served as the head coach at [[Florida State University]] where he almost single-handedly destroyed the entire football program he is the worst coach in school history and should never be hired again.  He has held the head coach position at four NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision programs:  [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky]] (2009 to 2012 seasons);  [[South Florida Bulls football|South Florida]] (2013 to 2016 seasons);  [[Oregon Ducks football|Oregon]] (2017 season);  and [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]] (2018 season and part of the 2019 season -- through November 3, 2019).  At all four schools, he was the first African-American to be hired as the head coach.\n\n==Playing career==\n===High school career===\nTaggart was a prep standout at [[Manatee High School]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]], where he was a first team all-state and all-conference selection as a senior after guiding the Hurricanes to the state 5A Championship game. He helped lead the [[high school football|football]] team to the state title his junior season and helped the school post a 26\u20134 record during that two-year span, while recording more than 3,000 yards passing and 975 yards on the ground.\n\n===College career===\nAfter high school, Taggart became a star [[quarterback]] for the Western Kentucky University (WKU) Hilltoppers from 1995 through 1998, being one of only three WKU players in the previous 50 years to be a four-year starter at the position and one of only four Hilltoppers players to have his jersey retired. In each of his last two collegiate seasons, he was a finalist for the prestigious [[Walter Payton Award]], which is an honor given annually to the top offensive player in I-AA football. Taggart finished fourth in the balloting in 1997 and seventh as a senior the following year. An All-American as a senior, he was also the 1998 I-AA Independents\u2019 Offensive Player of the Year. Taggart was recruited to WKU by [[Jim Harbaugh]] to play for his father, [[Jack Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/get-to-know-willie-taggart/|title=Get To Know Willie Taggart|date=December 8, 2012|website=[[WTSP]]|url-status=live|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Early coaching years===\nAfter graduating from WKU in 1998, Taggart stayed on at the school as an assistant through 2006, serving as co-offensive coordinator under [[Jack Harbaugh]] on the Hilltoppers' 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA national champions]].

During the off-season, Taggart made several personnel changes, including replacing the offensive and defensive coordinators. The change of schemes as well as the development of his first two recruiting classes provided the team with much needed energy and depth of positions.\n\nIn 2015, led by conference leaders quarterback [[Quinton Flowers]] and running back [[Marlon Mack]], the Bulls started the season 1\u20133 before finishing the regular season with a record of 8\u20135 and earning bowl eligibility for the first time in five years.

Florida State fans were not used to staying home for bowl season, and there were numerous calls for Taggart's firing. However, school president [[John Thrasher]] and athletic director Dave Coburn voiced confidence in Taggart. According to a story in ''[[Bleacher Report]],'' Florida State had bottomed out in 2018 due in part to cultural problems dating from Fisher's tenure. In particular, Taggart was stunned at the casual approach to academics that prevailed at the time of his arrival. Under Fisher's tenure, FSU's [[Academic Progress Rate]] (APR) was the worst in FBS, further complicating Taggart's efforts to rebuild the program.<ref>{{cite

At all four schools, he was the first African-American to be hired as the head coach.\n\n==Playing career==\n===High school career===\nTaggart was a prep standout at [[Manatee High School]] in [[Bradenton, Florida]], where he was a first team all-state and all-conference selection as a senior after guiding the Hurricanes to the state 5A Championship game.

In each of his last two collegiate seasons, he was a finalist for the prestigious [[Walter Payton Award]], which is an honor given annually to the top offensive player in I-AA football. Taggart finished fourth in the balloting in 1997 and seventh as a senior the following year. An All-American as a senior, he was also the 1998 I-AA Independents\u2019 Offensive Player of the Year. Taggart was recruited to WKU by [[Jim Harbaugh]] to play for his father, [[Jack Harbaugh]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tampa.cbslocal.com/2012/12/08/get-to-know-willie-taggart/|title=Get To Know Willie Taggart|date=December 8, 2012|website=[[WTSP]]|url-status=live|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Coaching career==\n\n===Early coaching years===\nAfter graduating from WKU in 1998, Taggart stayed on at the school as an assistant through 2006, serving as co-offensive coordinator under [[Jack Harbaugh]] on the Hilltoppers' 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|Division I-AA national champions]].

During the off-season, Taggart made several personnel changes, including replacing the offensive and defensive coordinators. The change of schemes as well as the development of his first two recruiting classes provided the team with much needed energy and depth of positions.\n\nIn 2015, led by conference leaders quarterback [[Quinton Flowers]] and running back [[Marlon Mack]], the Bulls started the season 1\u20133 before finishing the regular season with a record of 8\u20135 and earning bowl eligibility for the first time in five years.

Florida State fans were not used to staying home for bowl season, and there were numerous calls for Taggart's firing. However, school president [[John Thrasher]] and athletic director Dave Coburn voiced confidence in Taggart. According to a story in ''[[Bleacher Report]],'' Florida State had bottomed out in 2018 due in part to cultural problems dating from Fisher's tenure. In particular, Taggart was stunned at the casual approach to academics that prevailed at the time of his arrival. Under Fisher's tenure, FSU's [[Academic Progress Rate]] (APR) was the worst in FBS, further complicating Taggart's efforts to rebuild the program.<ref>{{cite

It bears the [[nostril]]s and is the first organ of the [[respiratory system]].  It is also the principal organ in the [[olfactory system]].  The shape of the [[nose]] is determined by the [[nasal bone]]s and the [[nasal cartilages]], including the [[nasal septum]] which separates the nostrils and divides the [[nasal cavity]] into two. On average the nose of a [[male]] is larger than that of a [[female]].\n\nThe main function of the nose is [[breathing]], and the [[nasal mucosa]] lining the nasal cavity and the [[paranasal sinuses]] carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it. [[Nasal concha]]e, [[Conch|shell-like]] bones in the walls of the cavities, play a major part in this process. Filtering of the air by [[nasal hair]] in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs. [[Sneezing]] is a [[reflex]] to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining. Sneezing can [[Transmission (medicine)|transmit infections]], because [[aerosol]]s are created in which the [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]] can harbour [[pathogen]]s.\n\nAnother major function of the nose is [[olfaction]], the sense of smell. The area of [[olfactory epithelium]], in the upper nasal cavity, contains specialised [[olfactory cells]] responsible for this function.\n\nThe nose is also involved in the function of speech. [[Nasal vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s are produced in the process of [[nasalisation]]. The hollow cavities of the paranasal sinuses act as sound chambers that modify and amplify speech and other vocal sounds.\n\nThere are many [[plastic surgery]] procedures on the nose, known as [[Rhinoplasty|rhinoplasties]] available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose. Defects may be [[Birth defect|congenital]], or result from nasal disorders or from trauma. These procedures are a type of [[plastic surgery#Reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgery]]. [[Elective surgery|Elective procedures]] to change a nose shape are a type of [[plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery procedures|cosmetic surgery]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Structure==\nSeveral [[bone]]s and [[cartilage]]s make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose, and the internal structure.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> The nose is also made up of types of [[soft tissue]] such as [[skin]], [[epithelium|epithelia]], [[mucous membrane]], [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, and [[blood vessel]]s. In the skin there are [[sebaceous gland]]s, and in the mucous membrane there are [[nasal glands]].<ref name=\"Singh\" /> The bones and cartilages provide strong protection for the internal structures of the nose. There are several muscles that are involved in movements of the nose. The arrangement of the cartilages allows flexibility through muscle control to enable airflow to be modified.<ref name=\"Singh\" />\n\n===Bones===\n[[File:714 Bone of Nasal Cavity.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Bones of the nose and septal cartilage]]\n[[File: Sobo 1909 100.png|thumb|Roof of the mouth showing position of palatine bones making up the floor of the nose, and forming the [[posterior nasal spine]] for the attachment of the [[musculus uvulae]].]]\nThe bony structure of the nose is provided by the [[maxilla]], [[frontal bone]], and a number of smaller bones.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\">{{cite book |last1=Standring |first1=Susan |title=Gray's anatomy : the anatomical basis of clinical practice |date=2016 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780702052309 |pages=556\u2013565 |edition=Forty-first}}</ref>\n\n<!-- From top to bottom -->The topmost bony part of the nose is formed by the nasal part of the frontal bone, which lies between the brow ridges,<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> and ends in a serrated [[nasal notch]].<ref name=\"Gray's E-Book\">{{cite book |last1=Standring |first1=Susan |title=Gray's Anatomy E-Book: The Anatomical Basis of Clinical Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b7FVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA479&lpg=PA479&dq=nasal+notch#v=onepage&q=nasal%20notch&f=false |publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences |language=en |date=7 August 2015|isbn=9780702068515 }}</ref> A left and a right [[nasal bone]] join with the nasal part of the frontal bone at either side; and these at the side with the small [[lacrimal bone]]s and the [[Frontal process of maxilla|frontal process of each maxilla]].<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> The internal roof of the nasal cavity is composed of the horizontal, perforated [[cribriform plate]] of the [[ethmoid bone]] through which pass [[Axon#Sensory|sensory fibres]] of the [[olfactory nerve]].

The septum is laterally attached, with loose ligaments, to the bony margin of the [[anterior nasal aperture]], while the inferior ends of the lateral cartilages are free (unattached). The three or four [[minor alar cartilage]]s are adjacent to the lateral cartilages, held in the [[connective tissue]] membrane, that connects the lateral cartilages to the frontal process of the maxilla.\n\nThe nasal bones in the upper part of the nose are joined together by the midline [[nasal bone|internasal suture]]. They join with the [[Septal nasal cartilage|septal cartilage]] at a junction known as the '''rhinion'''. The rhinion is the midpoint of the internasal suture at the join with the cartilage, and from the rhinion to the apex, or tip, the framework is of cartilage.\n\nThe [[major alar cartilage]]s are thin, U-shaped plates of cartilage on each side of the nose that form the lateral and medial walls of the vestibule, known as the medial and lateral crura. The medial crura are attached to the septal cartilage, forming fleshy parts at the front of the nostrils on each side of the septum, called the ''medial crural footpods''. The medial crura meet at the midline below the end of the septum to form the '''columella'''<ref name=\"Bell\">{{cite web |last1=Bell |first1=Daniel J. |title=Columella {{!}} Radiology Reference Article {{!}} Radiopaedia.org |url=https://radiopaedia.org/articles/columella |website=Radiopaedia}}</ref> and '''lobule'''.

They are involved in respiration and facial expression. The muscles of the nose include the procerus, nasalis, depressor septi nasalis, levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis, and the orbicularis oris of the mouth. As are all of the facial muscles, the muscles of the nose are innervated by the facial nerve and its branches.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> Although each muscle is independent, the muscles of the nose form a continuous layer with connections between all the components of the muscles and ligaments, in the nasal part of a [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system]] (SMAS).<ref name=\"Gray's2016\"  /><ref name=\"Saban\">{{cite journal |last1=Saban |first1=Y |last2=Andretto Amodeo |first2=C |last3=Hammou |first3=JC |last4=Polselli |first4=R |title=An anatomical study of the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system: surgical applications in rhinoplasty. |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201315 |doi=10.1001/archfaci.10.2.109 |pmid=18347238}}</ref> The SMAS is continuous from the nasofrontal process to the nasal tip. It divides at level of the nasal valve  into superficial and deep layers, each layer having medial and lateral components.<ref name=\"Saban\" />\n\nThe [[procerus muscle]] produces wrinkling over the bridge of the nose, and is active in concentration and frowning. It is a prime target for [[Botulinum toxin#Cosmetics|Botox procedures]] in the forehead to remove the lines between the eyes.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[nasalis muscle]] consists of two main parts: a transverse part called the [[compressor naris]], and an alar part termed the [[dilator naris muscle|dilator naris]].  The compressor naris muscle compresses the nostrils and may completely close them. The alar part, the dilator naris mainly consists of the dilator naris posterior, and a much smaller dilator naris anterior, and this muscle flares the nostrils. The dilator naris helps to form the upper ridge of the philtrum.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> The anterior, and the posterior dilator naris, (the alar part of the nasalis muscle), give support to the nasal valves.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[Depressor septi nasi muscle|depressor septi muscle]] may sometimes be absent or rudimentary.  The depressor septi pulls the columella, the septum, and the tip of the nose downwards. At the start of inspiration this muscle tenses the nasal septum and with the dilator naris widens the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[levator labii superioris alaeque nasi]],  divides into a medial and a lateral slip. The medial slip blends into the perichondrium of the major alar cartilage and its overlying skin. The lateral slip blends at the side of the upper lip with the [[levator labii superioris]], and with the [[orbicularis oris]].  The lateral slip raises the upper lip and deepens  and increases the curve above the nasolabial furrow. The medial slip pulls the lateral crus upwards and modifies the curve of the furrow around the alae, and dilates the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\n===Soft tissue===\n\nThe skin of the nose varies in thickness along its length.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> From the glabella to the bridge (the nasofrontal angle) the skin is thick, fairly flexible, and mobile. It tapers to the bridge where it is thinnest and least flexible as it is closest to the underlying bone.  From the bridge until the tip of the nose the skin is thin. The tip is covered in skin that is as thick as the top section, and has many large sebaceous glands.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /><ref name= \"Moore\" />\nThe thickness of the skin varies but is still separated from the underlying bones and cartilage by four layers \u2013 a superficial  [[panniculus adiposus|fatty layer]]; a [[connective tissue#Types|fibromuscular layer]] continued from the [[Superficial muscular aponeurotic system|SMAS]]; a deep fatty layer, and the [[periosteum]].<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nOther areas of [[soft tissue]] are found where there is no support from cartilage - these include an area around the sides of the septum - the paraseptal area; an area around the lateral cartliages; an area at the top of the nostril, and an area in the alae.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\n===External nose===\n\nThe nasal root is the top of the nose that attaches the nose to the [[forehead]].<ref name=\"Moore\" /> The nasal root is above the [[nasal bridge|bridge]] and below the [[glabella]], forming an indentation known as the [[nasion]] at the frontonasal suture where the [[frontal bone]] meets the nasal bones.<ref name=\"Collins\">{{cite web |title=Nasion definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/nasion |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |accessdate=2019-11-06 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThe '''nasal dorsum''' also known as the ''nasal ridge'' is the border between the root and the tip of the nose which in profile can be variously shaped.<ref name=\"TortAnag\">{{cite book |last1=Tortora |first1=G |last2=Anagnostakos |first2=N |title=Principles of anatomy and physiology |url=https://archive.org/details/principlesofan1987tort |url-access=registration |date=1987 |publisher=Harper & Row |isbn=978-0063507296 |page=[https://archive.org/details/principlesofan1987tort/page/556 556] |edition=5th.

The frontonasal process gives rise to the bridge of the nose. The medial nasal processes provide the crest and the tip of the nose, and the lateral nasal processes form the alae or sides of the nose. The frontonasal process is a proliferation of mesenchyme in front of\u00a0 the brain vesicles,<ref name=Sadler /> and makes up the upper border of the stomadeum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nDuring the fifth week the [[maxillary prominence|maxillary process]]es increase in size and at the same time the ectoderm of\u00a0 the frontonasal process becomes thickened at its sides and also increases in size,\u00a0 forming the nasal placodes. The nasal placodes are also known as the olfactory placodes. This development is induced by the ventral part of the forebrain.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\nIn the sixth week the ectoderm in each nasal placode invaginates to form an indented oval-shaped pit, which forms a\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 raised ridge of tissue.<ref name=Larsen /> Each nasal pit forms a\u00a0 division between the ridges,\u00a0into a lateral nasal process on the outer edge, and a medial nasal process on the inner edge.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nIn the sixth week the nasal pits deepen as they penetrate into the underlying mesenchyme.<ref name=Sadler />\u00a0At this time, the medial nasal processes migrate towards each other and fuse forming the primordium of the bridge of the nose and the septum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0The migration is helped by the increased growth of the maxillary prominences medially, which compresses the medial nasal processes towards the midline.\u00a0 Their merging takes place at the surface, and also at a deeper level.<ref name=Sadler /> The merge forms the [[intermaxillary segment]], and this is continuous with the rostral part of the nasal septum. The tips of the maxillary processes also grow and fuse with the intermaxillary process. The intermaxillary process gives rise to the [[philtrum]] of the upper lip.<ref name=Sadler />\n\nAt the end of the sixth week the nasal pits have deepened further and they fuse to make a large ectodermal nasal sac. This sac will be above and to the back of the intermaxillary process. Leading into the seventh week, the nasal sac floor and posterior wall grow to form a thickened plate-like ectodermal structure called the nasal fin.<ref name=Larsen /> The nasal fin separates the sac from the oral cavity. Within the fin, vacuoles develop that fuse with the nasal sac. This enlarges the nasal sac and at the same time thins the fin to a membrane - the oronasal membrane that separates the nasal pits from the oral cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the seventh week the oronasal membrane ruptures and disintegrates to form an opening - the single primitive choana.\u00a0 The intermaxillary segment extends posteriorly to form the primary palate which makes up the floor of the nasal cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the eighth and ninth weeks a pair of thin extensions form from the medial walls of the maxillary process. These extensions are called the palatine shelves that form the secondary palate.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen /> The secondary palate will endochondrally ossify to form the hard palate - the end-stage floor of the nasal cavity.\u00a0 During this time ectoderm and mesoderm of the frontonasal process produce the midline septum. The septum grows down from the roof of the nasal cavity and fuses with the developing palates along the midline. The septum divides the nasal cavity into two nasal passages opening into the pharynx through the definitive choanae.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nAt ten weeks, the cells differentiate into [[muscle]], [[cartilage]], and [[bone]].

Two pairs of sinuses form during prenatal development and two pairs form after birth. The maxillary sinuses are the first to appear during the fetal third month. They slowly expand within the maxillary bones and continue to expand throughout childhood.\u00a0The maxillary sinuses form as invaginations from the nasal sac. The ethmoid sinuses appear in the fetal fifth month as invaginations of the middle meatus. The ethmoid sinuses do not grow into the ethmoid bone and do not completely develop until puberty.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nThe sphenoid sinuses are extensions of the ethmoid sinuses into the sphenoid bones.

It bears the [[nostril]]s and is the first organ of the [[respiratory system]].  It is also the principal organ in the [[olfactory system]].  The shape of the [[nose]] is determined by the [[nasal bone]]s and the [[nasal cartilages]], including the [[nasal septum]] which separates the nostrils and divides the [[nasal cavity]] into two. On average the nose of a [[male]] is larger than that of a [[female]].\n\nThe main function of the nose is [[breathing]], and the [[nasal mucosa]] lining the nasal cavity and the [[paranasal sinuses]] carries out the necessary conditioning of inhaled air by warming and moistening it. [[Nasal concha]]e, [[Conch|shell-like]] bones in the walls of the cavities, play a major part in this process. Filtering of the air by [[nasal hair]] in the nostrils prevents large particles from entering the lungs. [[Sneezing]] is a [[reflex]] to expel unwanted particles from the nose that irritate the mucosal lining. Sneezing can [[Transmission (medicine)|transmit infections]], because [[aerosol]]s are created in which the [[Respiratory droplets|droplets]] can harbour [[pathogen]]s.\n\nAnother major function of the nose is [[olfaction]], the sense of smell. The area of [[olfactory epithelium]], in the upper nasal cavity, contains specialised [[olfactory cells]] responsible for this function.\n\nThe nose is also involved in the function of speech. [[Nasal vowel]]s and [[nasal consonant]]s are produced in the process of [[nasalisation]]. The hollow cavities of the paranasal sinuses act as sound chambers that modify and amplify speech and other vocal sounds.\n\nThere are many [[plastic surgery]] procedures on the nose, known as [[Rhinoplasty|rhinoplasties]] available to correct various structural defects or to change the shape of the nose. Defects may be [[Birth defect|congenital]], or result from nasal disorders or from trauma. These procedures are a type of [[plastic surgery#Reconstructive surgery|reconstructive surgery]]. [[Elective surgery|Elective procedures]] to change a nose shape are a type of [[plastic surgery#Cosmetic surgery procedures|cosmetic surgery]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Structure==\nSeveral [[bone]]s and [[cartilage]]s make up the bony-cartilaginous framework of the nose, and the internal structure.<ref name=\"anatomy\" /> The nose is also made up of types of [[soft tissue]] such as [[skin]], [[epithelium|epithelia]], [[mucous membrane]], [[muscle]]s, [[nerve]]s, and [[blood vessel]]s. In the skin there are [[sebaceous gland]]s, and in the mucous membrane there are [[nasal glands]].<ref name=\"Singh\" /> The bones and cartilages provide strong protection for the internal structures of the nose.

The three or four [[minor alar cartilage]]s are adjacent to the lateral cartilages, held in the [[connective tissue]] membrane, that connects the lateral cartilages to the frontal process of the maxilla.\n\nThe nasal bones in the upper part of the nose are joined together by the midline [[nasal bone|internasal suture]]. They join with the [[Septal nasal cartilage|septal cartilage]] at a junction known as the '''rhinion'''. The rhinion is the midpoint of the internasal suture at the join with the cartilage, and from the rhinion to the apex, or tip, the framework is of cartilage.\n\nThe [[major alar cartilage]]s are thin, U-shaped plates of cartilage on each side of the nose that form the lateral and medial walls of the vestibule, known as the medial and lateral crura. The medial crura are attached to the septal cartilage, forming fleshy parts at the front of the nostrils on each side of the septum, called the ''medial crural footpods''.

They are involved in respiration and facial expression. The muscles of the nose include the procerus, nasalis, depressor septi nasalis, levator labii superioris alaeque nasalis, and the orbicularis oris of the mouth. As are all of the facial muscles, the muscles of the nose are innervated by the facial nerve and its branches.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> Although each muscle is independent, the muscles of the nose form a continuous layer with connections between all the components of the muscles and ligaments, in the nasal part of a [[superficial muscular aponeurotic system]] (SMAS).<ref name=\"Gray's2016\"  /><ref name=\"Saban\">{{cite journal |last1=Saban |first1=Y |last2=Andretto Amodeo |first2=C |last3=Hammou |first3=JC |last4=Polselli |first4=R |title=An anatomical study of the nasal superficial musculoaponeurotic system: surgical applications in rhinoplasty. |journal=Archives of Facial Plastic Surgery |date=2009 |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=109\u201315 |doi=10.1001/archfaci.10.2.109 |pmid=18347238}}</ref> The SMAS is continuous from the nasofrontal process to the nasal tip. It divides at level of the nasal valve  into superficial and deep layers, each layer having medial and lateral components.<ref name=\"Saban\" />\n\nThe [[procerus muscle]] produces wrinkling over the bridge of the nose, and is active in concentration and frowning. It is a prime target for [[Botulinum toxin#Cosmetics|Botox procedures]] in the forehead to remove the lines between the eyes.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[nasalis muscle]] consists of two main parts: a transverse part called the [[compressor naris]], and an alar part termed the [[dilator naris muscle|dilator naris]].  The compressor naris muscle compresses the nostrils and may completely close them. The alar part, the dilator naris mainly consists of the dilator naris posterior, and a much smaller dilator naris anterior, and this muscle flares the nostrils. The dilator naris helps to form the upper ridge of the philtrum.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> The anterior, and the posterior dilator naris, (the alar part of the nasalis muscle), give support to the nasal valves.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[Depressor septi nasi muscle|depressor septi muscle]] may sometimes be absent or rudimentary.  The depressor septi pulls the columella, the septum, and the tip of the nose downwards. At the start of inspiration this muscle tenses the nasal septum and with the dilator naris widens the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\nThe [[levator labii superioris alaeque nasi]],  divides into a medial and a lateral slip. The medial slip blends into the perichondrium of the major alar cartilage and its overlying skin. The lateral slip blends at the side of the upper lip with the [[levator labii superioris]], and with the [[orbicularis oris]].  The lateral slip raises the upper lip and deepens  and increases the curve above the nasolabial furrow. The medial slip pulls the lateral crus upwards and modifies the curve of the furrow around the alae, and dilates the nostrils.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" />\n\n===Soft tissue===\n\nThe skin of the nose varies in thickness along its length.<ref name=\"Gray's2016\" /> From the glabella to the bridge (the nasofrontal angle) the skin is thick, fairly flexible, and mobile.

The frontonasal process gives rise to the bridge of the nose. The medial nasal processes provide the crest and the tip of the nose, and the lateral nasal processes form the alae or sides of the nose. The frontonasal process is a proliferation of mesenchyme in front of\u00a0 the brain vesicles,<ref name=Sadler /> and makes up the upper border of the stomadeum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\n\nDuring the fifth week the [[maxillary prominence|maxillary process]]es increase in size and at the same time the ectoderm of\u00a0 the frontonasal process becomes thickened at its sides and also increases in size,\u00a0 forming the nasal placodes. The nasal placodes are also known as the olfactory placodes. This development is induced by the ventral part of the forebrain.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\u00a0\nIn the sixth week the ectoderm in each nasal placode invaginates to form an indented oval-shaped pit, which forms a\u00a0 surrounding\u00a0 raised ridge of tissue.<ref name=Larsen /> Each nasal pit forms a\u00a0 division between the ridges,\u00a0into a lateral nasal process on the outer edge, and a medial nasal process on the inner edge.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nIn the sixth week the nasal pits deepen as they penetrate into the underlying mesenchyme.<ref name=Sadler />\u00a0At this time, the medial nasal processes migrate towards each other and fuse forming the primordium of the bridge of the nose and the septum.<ref name=Larsen />\u00a0The migration is helped by the increased growth of the maxillary prominences medially, which compresses the medial nasal processes towards the midline.\u00a0 Their merging takes place at the surface, and also at a deeper level.<ref name=Sadler /> The merge forms the [[intermaxillary segment]], and this is continuous with the rostral part of the nasal septum. The tips of the maxillary processes also grow and fuse with the intermaxillary process. The intermaxillary process gives rise to the [[philtrum]] of the upper lip.<ref name=Sadler />\n\nAt the end of the sixth week the nasal pits have deepened further and they fuse to make a large ectodermal nasal sac. This sac will be above and to the back of the intermaxillary process. Leading into the seventh week, the nasal sac floor and posterior wall grow to form a thickened plate-like ectodermal structure called the nasal fin.<ref name=Larsen /> The nasal fin separates the sac from the oral cavity. Within the fin, vacuoles develop that fuse with the nasal sac. This enlarges the nasal sac and at the same time thins the fin to a membrane - the oronasal membrane that separates the nasal pits from the oral cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the seventh week the oronasal membrane ruptures and disintegrates to form an opening - the single primitive choana.\u00a0 The intermaxillary segment extends posteriorly to form the primary palate which makes up the floor of the nasal cavity.<ref name=Larsen /> During the eighth and ninth weeks a pair of thin extensions form from the medial walls of the maxillary process. These extensions are called the palatine shelves that form the secondary palate.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen /> The secondary palate will endochondrally ossify to form the hard palate - the end-stage floor of the nasal cavity.\u00a0 During this time ectoderm and mesoderm of the frontonasal process produce the midline septum. The septum grows down from the roof of the nasal cavity and fuses with the developing palates along the midline. The septum divides the nasal cavity into two nasal passages opening into the pharynx through the definitive choanae.<ref name=Sadler /><ref name=Larsen />\n\nAt ten weeks, the cells differentiate into [[muscle]], [[cartilage]], and [[bone]].

They slowly expand within the maxillary bones and continue to expand throughout childhood.\u00a0The maxillary sinuses form as invaginations from the nasal sac. The ethmoid sinuses appear in the fetal fifth month as invaginations of the middle meatus.

He studied at the [[\u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts|Ecole des Beaux-Arts]] in Toulouse, where he was a pupil of [[Alexandre Cabanel]]. A journey to [[Morocco]] in 1872 strongly influenced his early artistic development and lead him to produce [[Romanticism|Romantic]] scenes under the spell of [[Orientalism]]. Among his noted works in this vein are  ''Last Rebels'', ''Justice in the [[Harem]]'' (both in the Luxembourg Gallery), ''Les Ch\u00e9rifas'', and ''Moroccan Prisoners'' (Bordeaux).  His large canvas, ''[[:File:Benjamin-Constant-The Entry of Mahomet II into Constantinople-1876.jpg|The Entrance of Mahomet II into Constantinople]]'' (Mus\u00e9e des Augustins Toulouse), received a medal in 1876.\n\n[[File:Benjamin Constant, between ca. 1890 and ca. 1910.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Frances Benjamin Johnston]], ''Benjamin Constant'', {{circa|1890\u20131910}}, [[Library of Congress]]]]\n\nAfter 1880, he changed his manner, devoting himself to [[mural]] decorations and to [[portrait]]s.  Prominent examples include the great [[plafond]] in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris]], entitled ''Paris Convening the World''; his paintings in the [[Sorbonne|New Sorbonne]], representing ''Literature'', ''The Sciences'', and the ''Academy of Paris''; and the plafond of the Op\u00e9ra Comique theatre.  He was distinguished as a portrait painter, especially in England, where he was a favorite of the [[aristocracy]].  His portrait ''Mons fils Andr\u00e9'' (Luxembourg) was awarded a medal of honor at the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] in 1896.\n\nBenjamin-Constant painted [[Pope Leo XIII]], [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom]] (1901), [[Baron Savile of Rufford|Lord John Lumley-Savile]], and [[Henri Blowitz]] (1902).  He was made a member of the Institute in 1893, and was a commander of the [[L\u00e9gion d'honneur|Legion of Honor]].  He visited the United States several times, and painted a number of portraits.  The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York exhibited a large painting by Benjamin-Constant entitled ''Justinian in Council''. The painting was returned by the Metropolitan to the owners family in 1928.
