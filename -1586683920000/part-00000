Bunnicula is the name of the family's pet rabbit who the family found during a screening of the film Dracula. The narrative unfolds around the family, their dog, cat, and rabbit.\n\nFollowing the end of the ''Bunnicula'' series, James Howe began a spin-off series called ''Tales from the House of Bunnicula'', which is \"written\" by Howie. The dachshund puppy introduced into the series in ''Howliday Inn''. There is also a series called ''Bunnicula and Friends: Ready To Read,'' six picture books about the adventures of the characters from the stories. It is aimed at beginner readers.\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Bunnicula ===\nThe titular character is a harmless rabbit with unusual eating habits and minor vampiric qualities. Toby, a member of the Monroe family, found the rabbit in the theater during a showing of the film ''Dracula'' with a note written in [[Russian language|Russian]], reading \"Please take care of my baby.\" The rabbit was aptly named ''Bunnicula''. It is unknown who left Bunnicula in the theater or wrote the note, but the letter was written in a dialect that nobody except the family's dog, Harold, could read.\n\nBunnicula is subjected to many murder attempts by Chester, who thinks that the rabbit would eventually become [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. However, his indestructible stature proves to Chester that he cannot be killed. Due to his young age, Bunnicula can't talk but he could wink and cry. He does exhibit the unusual ability to get in and out of his cage without using the door and initially opens the refrigerator by himself. Instead of a rabbit's [[buck teeth]], Bunnicula has [[fang]]s, which enable him to bite vegetables and suck the juice out of them, similar to the method by which [[Dracula]] dines, leaving them ghostly white. Bunnicula is put on a blender-based vegetable juice diet. Then he escapes his cage and runs off into the night leaving a trail of white vegetables in his wake. Chester is convinced that he must be destroyed by using a stake through their hearts. Chester learned from previous mistakes and chose toothpicks as his weapon of choice. One of Bunnicula's apparent victims tries to sneak up on Harold at the end of the book, and it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chester was playing a prank on Harold, though Chester seemed to be oblivious to the thumping noise the vegetable was making, or if this was indeed an actual attempt at an attack by a vampire vegetable.\n\nBunnicula eventually sires a litter of offspring with a rabbit owned by Pete's best friend Kyle as part of a project for their scout troop. Pete remarks that at least one of the offspring looks identical to Bunnicula in ''Bunnicula meets Edger Allan Crow.'' He is named Sonnicula because he is the son of Bunnicula and carries an identical appearance to his father. Sonnicula never makes any direct appearances in the series and is only referred to twice in passing. In ''Nighty-Nightmare'', Chester's story implies that Bunnicula's parents were vampire rabbits who were created by a lonely vampire, though Chester may have made the entire story up as implied by revelations at the end of the novel. However, Chester seems personally convinced that the story is a complete truth at the time that he tells it and tells it in such a way that it resembles a ghost story, one that entrances the other characters until the truth about the subject that brought up the story is revealed. This is the closest there has ever been to an origin story for Bunnicula and his apparent powers, whether or not it was concocted entirely in Chester's imagination is never explained. The author has never produced an actual origin for him or his abilities, nor has he ever explicitly confirmed or denied whether or not Bunnicula is vampiric outside of occasional hints in the novels by way of Bunnicula's odd abilities and physical features. In the animated special, Bunnicula's name is written in the note itself, to avoid having the Monroe's name him. The note is one of the few aspects of the novel to carry over into the animated special, as Bunnicula is found near a processing plant in the special. When Bunnicula goes into his vampiric form, he sprouts bat wings under his arms and his eyes turn yellow. His vampire powers include flight, hypnosis, levitation, and telekinesis. Chester's murder attempts do not take place in the special and he ultimately decides that the idea that Bunnicula is a vampire is \"ridiculous\", something which doesn't occur in the novels, which has a touch of irony since Bunnicula is blatantly shown using his vampiric powers and Chester was correct in his belief of Bunnicula's true nature.\n\n=== Harold ===\nThe main character, Harold, despite Bunnicula being the title-bearing character, is an old, scruffy and loving dog under the Monroe's care. He narrates the books, sometimes claiming he would not even write the books if it wasn't for Bunnicula. He enjoys his life with the Monroe family, particularly with Toby, always being a diligent and loyal pet. His longtime friends are Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie, who also live in the Monroe household. Harold has a strong affection for [[chocolate]] [[cupcake]]s, as well as other typical snacks such as [[cheese]] [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[fudge]], despite the potential risk of [[Theobromine poisoning#In animals|food poisoning due to chocolate consumption]]. He is a mongrel, but is part-[[Russian wolfhound]] and has pride in his bloodlines. He says that this is why he can recognize an obscure dialect of [[Transylvania]]n writing (albeit in a [[Cyrillic]] script as per the 1982 cartoon special) in the first book. In the first book, Harold sees Bunnicula for the first time, as well as seeing a bunny for the first time. While Bunnicula's vampiric activities do scare him a little, he holds no grudges against the bunny, even befriending him. Unluckily, Chester, who has an outrageously vivid imagination and a narrow mind, thinks Bunnicula is a ''real'' vampire and forces Harold to assist him to kill the rabbit. All attempts fail, and finally, Harold goes against Chester's crazy attempts to do away with Bunnicula. Throughout the series, Harold is portrayed as good-hearted, sensible, and kind. Harold remains unconvinced of Chester's belief that Bunnicula is a vampire regardless of some actual evidence that may support Chester's theories, however briefly seen or referenced. Despite everything, Harold never stops thinking of Chester as his best friend. He also is like a family watchdog when the Monroes leave the house.\n\n=== Chester ===\nThe highly imaginative, prideful [[Tabby cat|orange tabby]] who loves good literature and milk. He was given to Mr. Monroe as a birthday present, and the name \"Chester\" was derived from [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Ever since Bunnicula's arrival, Chester becomes increasingly convinced that the bunny could be a threat (\"Today vegetables, tomorrow the world!\" he exclaims in reference to Bunnicula's \"[[Hegemony|diabolical plans]]\" when trying to convince Harold of his belief that Bunnicula is a vampire), and becomes singlemindedly obsessed with controlling him. For a long time, out of jealousy, Chester wanted to kill or at least disable Bunnicula and has done the latter by drinking the bunny's vegetable juice or spreading garlic around to contain him. He once tried to kill Bunnicula by using a [[steak]] (not a ''stake''), a mistake he prefers not to dwell on. Another time, he led Harold and Howie on a chase around Centerville, \"[[murder]]ing\" [[Vampire pumpkins and watermelons|vampire vegetables]], which were, in fact, the leftover meals from Bunnicula. An apparent 'survivor' of the purge Chester leads them on appears to try sneaking up on Harold at the climax of ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight'', only to be spotted by Harold, who then asks Chester for a toothpick in order to 'kill' the offending object. It is never explicitly stated if Chester was playing a prank using one of the leftover vegetables that they hadn't \"destroyed\" or if this was an actual attempt at an attack by one of Bunnicula's 'minions'. Harold and Howie disagree with Chester's methods, as Chester is often paranoid. Harold mentions in ''Nighty-Nightmare'' that Chester's constant reading and watching horror movies have given him \"a reality leak that requires constant attention\". He usually calls both of his canine friends \"dolts\", \"[[simpleton]]s\", or \"[[idiot]]s\". He is known not to apologize for his errors that greatly affect Harold, instead referring to them as \"a slight misinterpretation in the facts.\" Despite having a tense relationship with Bunnicula, deep down he accepts him as one of the family, and in the final two books of the series, ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' and ''Bunnicula meets Edgar Allan Crow''', becomes friends with Bunnicula, claiming that by knowing the facts about vampires best, he can protect Bunnicula from himself.\n\n=== Howie ===\nThe carefree and sometimes slightly dim [[Dachshund]] puppy who was adopted by the Monroes from Chateau Bow-Wow, making him the newest member of the family. He was the [[runt]] of the [[litter]] and his parents, Howard and Heather, were valuable long-haired Dachshunds (whom Chester secretly suspected of being werewolves). Howie's somewhat eerie howling has not changed the cat's mind on the matter. Howie usually does not understand the seriousness of matters, thinking that murdering vampire vegetables is a game and chasing Bunnicula is a race. He did not even know what a vampire was when Chester informed him, though he does not think Bunnicula is a danger. For an unknown reason, he calls Harold and Chester \"Uncle Harold\" and \"Pop\", respectively; while Harold is perfectly comfortable with his nickname, Chester is still not used to his own. Howie's hobbies include chewing things, eating and chasing cars (which he's not allowed to do). Despite his boldness, Howie was a bit unnerved by scary stories at first, then outgrew it after the pets' adventures in ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' Later, he decided he wanted to try writing too, and his first drafts turn out to be pretty good for a puppy's work.\n\n=== Robert Monroe ===\nThe husband of Ann Monroe and the father of Pete and Toby. He works as a college professor of literature, and he often used Chester to practice his lectures, which enabled Chester to read as well. In the animated special, he is described by Harold as being a scientist, rather than a college professor, and works at the plant where Bunnicula is discovered.\n\n=== Ann Monroe ===\nRobert's wife and the mother of Pete and Toby. She thought up of the name Bunnicula by combining \"Bunny\" and \"Dracula\". She had previously tried to name him \"Bun-Bun\" and \"Fluffy\". Names like this seem to be a habit with her because Harold and Chester were both called \"Fluffy\" for a short time. In the books, she is a lawyer, but her profession is unmentioned in the animated special. She also does not name Bunnicula in the special, as the name is included in the note they find with him.\n\n=== Peter \"Pete\" Monroe ===\nThe oldest of two boys who slacks off often. He's often selfish, and usually bullies his younger brother Toby and the pets, except for Bunnicula. Harold and Chester avoid him, Chester being largely indifferent, but Howie finds him intriguing, mainly because of the scary books he reads. The space under his bed is very messy, and in addition to keeping a stuffed animal named Puddikins under it for emergency hugs, much other stuff has turned up such as Oreos, dirty socks and a notebook that Harold gives to Howie.\n\n=== Toby Monroe ===\nThe younger brother, and much more dignified and kinder than Pete. He likes to share his snacks with Harold during his late-night readings and is adored by Harold, Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie. He cares a lot for the pets and was known to slip pieces of food to Harold at dinner. Toby's family found Bunnicula abandoned at a movie theatre one night on an outing to the movies. Toby's family adopted Bunnicula after the family brought him home.\n\n=== Sonnicula ===\nThe son of Bunnicula. He looked just like Bunnicula and was born during ''Nighty-Nightmare''. His mother was a rabbit brought by Pete's best friend Kyle. It was not said whether he inherited his father's vampiric appetite, but he sleeps during the day, just like Bunnicula. In the last book, he was adopted by Miles Tanner.\n\n=== Miles Tanner \"M.T. Graves\" ===\nThe author of the \"Fleshcrawlers\" series, of which Peter is a fan. He lived temporarily at the Monroes' house when Peter won a contest allowing it. He shows interest in Bunnicula and carried his pet, Edgar Allan Crow, around. He had a pale face, long curly hair, a black cape, and was very attached to a black bag. The black bag was thought to contain Bunnicula (by Chester, of course) when Bunnicula escaped. The pets opened the bag, greatly embarrassing Miles Tanner in front of the company. The contents were stuffed animals. Miles admitted that they were to train him to overcome his fear of animals. He said he was scared of dogs, cats, and people. He wanted a rabbit because a rabbit never barked at him before. Therefore, he wants Bunnicula. In the end, he adopts Sonnicula, saying \"It won't be Bunnicula, but it will be fine.\" The Monroes are greatly relieved to still keep their amazing pet. In a letter, Miles says he will marry Ms. Pickles, Peter's school librarian and they shall be neighbors. The Monroe pets changed his mind towards animals.\n\n=== Edgar Allan Crow ===\nA crow Miles adopted, found on his doorstep when he was a wounded baby. Edgar gives Miles company and Miles has said he can't do anything without him. Edgar, however, wants to go back to his own kind. He was seen courting another crow in the Monroes' place. Edgar learns to write and sends an e-mail to the Monroes. Edgar Allan Crow's name is a parody of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n\n=== Mrs. Marjorie Pickles Tanner ===\nPete and Kyle's English teacher, who is also a fan of M.T. Graves and in fact his wife. She first met Tanner when she brought over a cake as an excuse to meet him before he came to visit Peter's school. Soon after the Monroes received a letter from Tanner announcing his engagement to Pete's teacher.\n\n==List of books==\n''Source:''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/43326|title=Bunnicula Series by Deborah Howe|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery (1979)'' ===\n{{main|Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery}}\n\n===''Howliday Inn (1982)''===\nWhen the Monroe family decides to leave for a vacation, they send Harold and Chester off to a kennel called Chateau Bow-Wow (A special boarding house for special cats and dogs). There, they meet the other inhabitants of the kennel: A frustrated poodle named Louise, an athletic bulldog, a mutt named Taxi, a crazy cat named Lyle, a flirtatious poodle named Georgette, and two dachshunds named Heather and Howard, who Chester is certain are werewolves. The owner of the kennel, Dr. Greenbriar, is taking the week off and the other staff, an aspiring vet named Jill and a comic-book reader named Harrison who hopes to make a million bucks before he is twenty-one, are overworked. Because they are overworked, they make a lot of mistakes, especially Jill. These mistakes include feeding the animals late and temporarily misplacing Chester's file. Harrison will later use this tendency to forget things to his advantage. Tensions are high between the two as a result of stress. While adapting to their temporary new lives, a mystery soon unfolds when Louise goes missing.\n\nAlthough the kennel workers decide she ran away, Chester becomes certain that foul play was involved. Just when he seems to have solved the mystery, Chester vanishes. When investigating, Harold overhears Harrison, one of the kennel workers, reporting that he tested Chester's cat food and that it was laced with poison. Horrified, Harold attempts to continue Chester's work and solve the mystery. One evening, Harold finds the message \"Help Howls out now!\" scratched into his dog dish. Chester mysteriously returns later, then rounds up Harold, Taxi, and Lyle. He leads them to find Harrison attempting to capture Heather and Howard. The animals raise the alarm and Harrison is caught by the other kennel workers. Chester tells Harold later that Harrison caught wind that one of the animals in the shelter was very valuable. He first kidnapped Louise and then Chester thinking that it could have been them, but found out that it was the dachshunds, who were actually rare wire-haired dachshunds. He also learned that Heather was going to have puppies, making him even more determined to capture them all to get rich. When Dr. Greenbriar and Jill hear the dogs barking and find, first Louise at Harrison's house with Max and Georgette, who sneaked out to find her, barking outside and then Harrison trying to capture the dachshunds with the other animals attacking him, he is tried and sentenced. The sentence is to go to university and pay for it by working at the zoo. When the Monroe family arrives after their vacation, they reveal that they're also adopting the runt of the dachshund litter, which they name Howie\u2014Pete named him this because the puppy's father's name was Howard.\n\n=== ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight (1983)'' ===\nBunnicula has gone missing and Chester begins to fear for the town again. This time, he believes that the vegetables that Bunnicula sucks dry could return as the rabbit's vampire slaves, which he will then use as an army to take over the town. Armed with a box of toothpicks to stab through the \"hearts\" of vegetables, he, Harold, and Howie set off to search the neighborhood for white vegetables. After some success, they witness Toby and Pete wearing dark robes and holding a group of frightened children prisoner. The pets fear that Bunnicula has begun to take over people as well and run to the nearby school, which is full of what they suspect are the rabbit's servants.\n\nAfter causing much mayhem (including Chester destroying a large white carrot, which he believes is the head of the [[undead]] vegetables), they are caught by the Monroes. It is revealed that there was a carnival at the school that day, and Toby and Pete and the other children were rehearsing for a play they were going to put on. The \"carrot\" that Chester destroyed was actually a carrot cake, shaped like a carrot and covered in cream cheese. Finally, Bunnicula was found at the school, entered in the pet show. The pets find out that Bunnicula spent the previous night in the garage, which was accidentally left open, which meant he did indeed leave the house to feed on vegetables.\n\nIn the end, [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" is parodied when Chester finds an artichoke heart under his favorite chair. After telling Chester there's nothing to worry about and trying to fall asleep, Harold hears a faint thumping.... he opens his eyes to find the vegetable in question right in front of his nose, which leads him to ask if Chester has a toothpick handy. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not this is a prank by Chester or an actual attempt at a vampiric attack on Harold by the artichoke.\n\n=== ''Nighty Nightmare (1987)'' ===\nA.K.A. ''The Return Of Bunnicula''. While at their lakeside retreat of Boggy Lake and fishing with Harold, Mr. Monroe begins to have a [[mid-life crisis]] and wants to do something exciting while they are there. They decide to go camping out in the woods; Harold only likes the idea because of [[S'more|s'mores,]] and Chester is skeptical about going out due to it being the eve of [[Saint George's Day]], the one night of the year where evil monsters and spirits come out to prey. Upon going out into the woods, they meet two men; Bud (who constantly holds a [[knife]] out in plain sight for some reason) and Spud (described by Harold as having a [[potato]]-shaped head), along with their dog Teufel ([[German language|German]] for \"[[Devil]]\"), nicknamed \"Dawg\", a bulldog with a [[scar]] on his face and a long ribbon of drool constantly hanging from his lower lip. That night, they go out for a walk, and Dawg leads Harold, Chester, and Howie away from his masters and the Monroes to show them something \"neat\", getting them lost in the woods in the process.\n\nChester begins to suspect that Bud and Spud may plan to [[murder]] the Monroes and that Dawg is luring them away to keep them from interfering, and Harold slowly begins to believe him. Once they reach a house right in the middle of the woods, Chester tells a story about Bunnicula's origin in an attempt to lull Dawg to sleep and allow himself, Harold, and Howie to escape; he claims that Bunnicula is the child of two rabbits who were artificially transformed into vampires by a lonely vampiric scientist named Diabolicus and that three humans that he turned into vampires live in the house right before them right now, continuing his work. While the plan is successful, Harold, Howie, and even Chester fall asleep along with Dawg, and awaken shortly before dawn due to the rain and constant [[nightmares]], presumably brought on by Chester's story, which is left open to interpretation by the end of the book as to whether or not Chester made the whole thing up or if it was based on actual 'fact' within the canon of the series, though Chester's belief that the house is an 'American house of Dr. E.A.D' which lead to the story, is proven to be mistaken by story's end.\n\nAfter they return to the Monroes' camp, only to find it trashed and deserted, Dawg reveals that the house they visited is his own and that Bud and Spud (real names Buford and Spalding) live there with their mother. Buford is revealed to be an architect while Spalding is a practicing lawyer. The Monroes also stayed the night with them in order to get out of the rain, and are relieved that Harold, Howie, and Chester are unharmed. Bud and Spud give their mother a baby [[skunk]] they caught last night as an early [[birthday]] present, and everyone sings campfire songs while eating s' mores; all except for Chester, who sulks in a corner. It is also revealed that Pete had been using Bunnicula in a rabbit breeding project he had been working on and one of the baby rabbits looked like Bunnicula (indicating that it too might be a vampire rabbit).\n\n=== ''Return to Howliday Inn (1992)'' ===\nThe Monroe family again leaves Harold, Chester, and Howie at Chateau Bow-Wow. The pets quickly notice differences, including a new group of animals staying there (a weasel, two cats named Felony and Miss Demeanor, a sad Great Dane named Hamlet, a pair of homesick dogs, and a parrot named Ditto). Howie is thrilled to be at his birthplace; Chester is none too pleased. Soon, however, all of the animals are in for a shock\u2014They hear a female dog named Rosebud calling from the other side of the fence. When they dig at the dirt around the fence, they find a few bones and a dog collar. Rosebud tells them that she discovered a horrid secret about Chateau Bow-Wow which sealed her fate and warns the animals to escape. Undaunted, Chester begins to investigate.\n\nAfter listening in on Ditto, he hears her repeated \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5\". Later, she repeats what appears to be the entire sequence of numbers: \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2\". Upon hearing this, Felony and Miss Demeanor are thrilled. When asked, they reluctantly reveal that they wanted to sneak into the kennel worker's building to steal better food and believed that the code would get them in. Shortly after, a tearful kennel worker takes Hamlet into the building. Georgette is brought to Chateau Bow-Wow and tells the animals the true story of Rosebud: She was alive and well and back with her owners. The bones were chicken bones and her collar had been lost prior. The animals enter the building and find Hamlet, who tells them that his old owner left him there a long time ago. He was now set to be put to sleep. Chester finds his owner's new address and they set off to bring Hamlet there. The new address turns out to be a nursing home, one which does not allow animals. The pets break in and in the chaos, it becomes clear that the patients love the arrival of the animals, who remind them of their old pets. Hamlet finds his old owner, and it is revealed that the owner was a ventriloquist, explaining how Hamlet caused \"Rosebud\" to speak. Using ventriloquism of their own, the pets and patients convince the staff of the nursing home to allow Hamlet to stay. When Harold, Chester, and Howie are picked up at the end, they fool the Monroes with the ventriloquism tricks they picked up.\n\n=== ''Bunnicula Strikes Again! (1995)'' ===\nChester has once again come to the crazy conclusion that Bunnicula is a threatening vampire. The cat starts drinking the rabbit's juice in the daytime so Bunnicula will die of starvation. Harold and Howie are upset, but once again Chester insists this is all for the best. One night, Harold notices Bunnicula crying while singing him a lullaby. Chester thinks he misses his mother, and in the next few days, he leads the two dogs to search for her. This is unsuccessful, as she very likely is not around town. When Bunnicula becomes increasingly ill, either due to lack of food or to his lack of parental love, he is taken to the veterinarian, Chester, however, escapes and gets to the theater first. Before he can kill Bunnicula, the demolition starts, crushing both the cat and the rabbit under rubble. Harold and Howie manage to alert the Monroes and the other witnesses, and together they dig through the piles of fragments. They find Chester in a weakened state, but Bunnicula miraculously is completely unharmed. Chester comforts the rabbit, finally claiming that his attempts to murder Bunnicula were futile and that because he survived the demolition without a scratch, he is 'indestructible.' In the end, the Monroes return to their normal lives, and Bunnicula is, at last, happy because Chester has accepted him as one of the family.\n\n=== ''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow (2006)'' ===\nA.K.A. ''Bunnicula vs The Monster Raven''. Pete writes to the author of his (and Howie's) favorite series, FleshCrawlers. He visits the Monroe household and stays in the guestroom, bringing with him his favorite pet crow, Edgar Allan Crow. Everyone is thrilled, except for Chester, who insists that the author, M.T. Graves, is suspicious. He notes that something bad always happens to the pets in Graves's books, and when he wrote back to Pete, he seemed especially interested in spending some \"quality time with the pets,\" particularly Bunnicula, whom Chester has now befriended. Harold and Howie aren't convinced, but Chester feels certain that there is a secret society amongst the crows, and Edgar is a messenger sent to help Graves transform Bunnicula into a bat. When Bunnicula escapes, the entire party follows him to catch him, and Harold and Howie begin to think that Chester may have been right. M.T. Graves is very careful about a black bag, and when Bunnicula is not found, Chester believes he is trapped in the bag. Harold dumps the bag, only to embarrass Graves in front of everyone because it was filled with stuffed animals. In the end, M.T. Graves tells them that he was a nervous boy when he was younger and was afraid of dogs and cats, so he figured he would stay at the Monroe's house so that he could conquer his phobia. Graves falls in love with Pete's school librarian and marries her. Graves releases Edgar because Edgar fell in love with another crow. Then he adopts Sonnicula, Bunnicula's son. After Graves left, Pete got a letter that said he was inspired to write two books from visiting the Monroes: one called ''Quoth the Raven'' about his relationship with Edgar, and another called ''The Excellently Weird Adventures of Charlie the Cat from Galaxy Nine'', inspired by Chester, who was less than thrilled to discover he was one of them, as he put it, \"psycho creatures from M.T. Graves' demented novels.\"\n\nJames Howe is mentioned when Pete says that all of the other kids wanted to choose authors like [[J.K. Rowling]] or James Howe.\n\n==Tales from the House of Bunnicula==\nA spin-off series centering around the writings of Howie, which involves Howie encountering a supernatural or extraterrestrial creature or event with his trusty friend, Delilah. The books also contain ''notes'' that Howie receives from Harold or Chester.

Bunnicula is the name of the family's pet rabbit who the family found during a screening of the film Dracula. The narrative unfolds around the family, their dog, cat, and rabbit.\n\nFollowing the end of the ''Bunnicula'' series, James Howe began a spin-off series called ''Tales from the House of Bunnicula'', which is \"written\" by Howie. The dachshund puppy introduced into the series in ''Howliday Inn''. There is also a series called ''Bunnicula and Friends: Ready To Read,'' six picture books about the adventures of the characters from the stories. It is aimed at beginner readers.\n\nA 1982 animated TV special (from [[Ruby-Spears]]) by the same name was created based on the first book and aired on the ''[[ABC Weekend Special]]''.<ref name=\":0\">{{Citation|title=Bunnicula, the Vampire Rabbit|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0272016/|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\nAn [[Bunnicula (TV series)|animated series]] that is a loose adaptation of ''Bunnicula'' began airing on [[Cartoon Network]] and on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] on February 6, 2016.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=http://idlehands1.blogspot.com/2015/06/boomerang-presents-bunnicula-be-cool.html|title=Idle Hands: Boomerang Presents Bunnicula, Be Cool Scooby Doo & Wabbit \u2013 A Looney Tunes Production|first=Paul|last=Nicholasi|date=29 June 2015|website=idlehands1.blogspot.com}}</ref><ref name=\":2\">{{cite web|url=http://kidscreen.com/2015/06/29/turner-inks-original-wb-content-deal-for-boomerang/|title=Turner inks original WB content deal for Boomerang|website=kidscreen.com}}</ref>\n\n== Characters ==\n\n=== Bunnicula ===\nThe titular character is a harmless rabbit with unusual eating habits and minor vampiric qualities. Toby, a member of the Monroe family, found the rabbit in the theater during a showing of the film ''Dracula'' with a note written in [[Russian language|Russian]], reading \"Please take care of my baby.\" The rabbit was aptly named ''Bunnicula''. It is unknown who left Bunnicula in the theater or wrote the note, but the letter was written in a dialect that nobody except the family's dog, Harold, could read.\n\nBunnicula is subjected to many murder attempts by Chester, who thinks that the rabbit would eventually become [[Carnivore|carnivorous]]. However, his indestructible stature proves to Chester that he cannot be killed. Due to his young age, Bunnicula can't talk but he could wink and cry. He does exhibit the unusual ability to get in and out of his cage without using the door and initially opens the refrigerator by himself. Instead of a rabbit's [[buck teeth]], Bunnicula has [[fang]]s, which enable him to bite vegetables and suck the juice out of them, similar to the method by which [[Dracula]] dines, leaving them ghostly white. Bunnicula is put on a blender-based vegetable juice diet. Then he escapes his cage and runs off into the night leaving a trail of white vegetables in his wake. Chester is convinced that he must be destroyed by using a stake through their hearts. Chester learned from previous mistakes and chose toothpicks as his weapon of choice. One of Bunnicula's apparent victims tries to sneak up on Harold at the end of the book, and it is left ambiguous as to whether or not Chester was playing a prank on Harold, though Chester seemed to be oblivious to the thumping noise the vegetable was making, or if this was indeed an actual attempt at an attack by a vampire vegetable.\n\nBunnicula eventually sires a litter of offspring with a rabbit owned by Pete's best friend Kyle as part of a project for their scout troop. Pete remarks that at least one of the offspring looks identical to Bunnicula in ''Bunnicula meets Edger Allan Crow.'' He is named Sonnicula because he is the son of Bunnicula and carries an identical appearance to his father. Sonnicula never makes any direct appearances in the series and is only referred to twice in passing. In ''Nighty-Nightmare'', Chester's story implies that Bunnicula's parents were vampire rabbits who were created by a lonely vampire, though Chester may have made the entire story up as implied by revelations at the end of the novel. However, Chester seems personally convinced that the story is a complete truth at the time that he tells it and tells it in such a way that it resembles a ghost story, one that entrances the other characters until the truth about the subject that brought up the story is revealed. This is the closest there has ever been to an origin story for Bunnicula and his apparent powers, whether or not it was concocted entirely in Chester's imagination is never explained. The author has never produced an actual origin for him or his abilities, nor has he ever explicitly confirmed or denied whether or not Bunnicula is vampiric outside of occasional hints in the novels by way of Bunnicula's odd abilities and physical features. In the animated special, Bunnicula's name is written in the note itself, to avoid having the Monroe's name him. The note is one of the few aspects of the novel to carry over into the animated special, as Bunnicula is found near a processing plant in the special. When Bunnicula goes into his vampiric form, he sprouts bat wings under his arms and his eyes turn yellow. His vampire powers include flight, hypnosis, levitation, and telekinesis. Chester's murder attempts do not take place in the special and he ultimately decides that the idea that Bunnicula is a vampire is \"ridiculous\", something which doesn't occur in the novels, which has a touch of irony since Bunnicula is blatantly shown using his vampiric powers and Chester was correct in his belief of Bunnicula's true nature.\n\n=== Harold ===\nThe main character, Harold, despite Bunnicula being the title-bearing character, is an old, scruffy and loving dog under the Monroe's care. He narrates the books, sometimes claiming he would not even write the books if it wasn't for Bunnicula. He enjoys his life with the Monroe family, particularly with Toby, always being a diligent and loyal pet. His longtime friends are Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie, who also live in the Monroe household. Harold has a strong affection for [[chocolate]] [[cupcake]]s, as well as other typical snacks such as [[cheese]] [[Cracker (food)|crackers]] and [[fudge]], despite the potential risk of [[Theobromine poisoning#In animals|food poisoning due to chocolate consumption]]. He is a mongrel, but is part-[[Russian wolfhound]] and has pride in his bloodlines. He says that this is why he can recognize an obscure dialect of [[Transylvania]]n writing (albeit in a [[Cyrillic]] script as per the 1982 cartoon special) in the first book. In the first book, Harold sees Bunnicula for the first time, as well as seeing a bunny for the first time. While Bunnicula's vampiric activities do scare him a little, he holds no grudges against the bunny, even befriending him. Unluckily, Chester, who has an outrageously vivid imagination and a narrow mind, thinks Bunnicula is a ''real'' vampire and forces Harold to assist him to kill the rabbit. All attempts fail, and finally, Harold goes against Chester's crazy attempts to do away with Bunnicula. Throughout the series, Harold is portrayed as good-hearted, sensible, and kind. Harold remains unconvinced of Chester's belief that Bunnicula is a vampire regardless of some actual evidence that may support Chester's theories, however briefly seen or referenced. Despite everything, Harold never stops thinking of Chester as his best friend. He also is like a family watchdog when the Monroes leave the house.\n\n=== Chester ===\nThe highly imaginative, prideful [[Tabby cat|orange tabby]] who loves good literature and milk. He was given to Mr. Monroe as a birthday present, and the name \"Chester\" was derived from [[G. K. Chesterton]]. Ever since Bunnicula's arrival, Chester becomes increasingly convinced that the bunny could be a threat (\"Today vegetables, tomorrow the world!\" he exclaims in reference to Bunnicula's \"[[Hegemony|diabolical plans]]\" when trying to convince Harold of his belief that Bunnicula is a vampire), and becomes singlemindedly obsessed with controlling him. For a long time, out of jealousy, Chester wanted to kill or at least disable Bunnicula and has done the latter by drinking the bunny's vegetable juice or spreading garlic around to contain him. He once tried to kill Bunnicula by using a [[steak]] (not a ''stake''), a mistake he prefers not to dwell on. Another time, he led Harold and Howie on a chase around Centerville, \"[[murder]]ing\" [[Vampire pumpkins and watermelons|vampire vegetables]], which were, in fact, the leftover meals from Bunnicula. An apparent 'survivor' of the purge Chester leads them on appears to try sneaking up on Harold at the climax of ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight'', only to be spotted by Harold, who then asks Chester for a toothpick in order to 'kill' the offending object. It is never explicitly stated if Chester was playing a prank using one of the leftover vegetables that they hadn't \"destroyed\" or if this was an actual attempt at an attack by one of Bunnicula's 'minions'. Harold and Howie disagree with Chester's methods, as Chester is often paranoid. Harold mentions in ''Nighty-Nightmare'' that Chester's constant reading and watching horror movies have given him \"a reality leak that requires constant attention\". He usually calls both of his canine friends \"dolts\", \"[[simpleton]]s\", or \"[[idiot]]s\". He is known not to apologize for his errors that greatly affect Harold, instead referring to them as \"a slight misinterpretation in the facts.\" Despite having a tense relationship with Bunnicula, deep down he accepts him as one of the family, and in the final two books of the series, ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' and ''Bunnicula meets Edgar Allan Crow''', becomes friends with Bunnicula, claiming that by knowing the facts about vampires best, he can protect Bunnicula from himself.\n\n=== Howie ===\nThe carefree and sometimes slightly dim [[Dachshund]] puppy who was adopted by the Monroes from Chateau Bow-Wow, making him the newest member of the family. He was the [[runt]] of the [[litter]] and his parents, Howard and Heather, were valuable long-haired Dachshunds (whom Chester secretly suspected of being werewolves). Howie's somewhat eerie howling has not changed the cat's mind on the matter. Howie usually does not understand the seriousness of matters, thinking that murdering vampire vegetables is a game and chasing Bunnicula is a race. He did not even know what a vampire was when Chester informed him, though he does not think Bunnicula is a danger. For an unknown reason, he calls Harold and Chester \"Uncle Harold\" and \"Pop\", respectively; while Harold is perfectly comfortable with his nickname, Chester is still not used to his own. Howie's hobbies include chewing things, eating and chasing cars (which he's not allowed to do). Despite his boldness, Howie was a bit unnerved by scary stories at first, then outgrew it after the pets' adventures in ''Bunnicula Strikes Again!'' Later, he decided he wanted to try writing too, and his first drafts turn out to be pretty good for a puppy's work.\n\n=== Robert Monroe ===\nThe husband of Ann Monroe and the father of Pete and Toby. He works as a college professor of literature, and he often used Chester to practice his lectures, which enabled Chester to read as well. In the animated special, he is described by Harold as being a scientist, rather than a college professor, and works at the plant where Bunnicula is discovered.\n\n=== Ann Monroe ===\nRobert's wife and the mother of Pete and Toby. She thought up of the name Bunnicula by combining \"Bunny\" and \"Dracula\". She had previously tried to name him \"Bun-Bun\" and \"Fluffy\". Names like this seem to be a habit with her because Harold and Chester were both called \"Fluffy\" for a short time. In the books, she is a lawyer, but her profession is unmentioned in the animated special. She also does not name Bunnicula in the special, as the name is included in the note they find with him.\n\n=== Peter \"Pete\" Monroe ===\nThe oldest of two boys who slacks off often. He's often selfish, and usually bullies his younger brother Toby and the pets, except for Bunnicula. Harold and Chester avoid him, Chester being largely indifferent, but Howie finds him intriguing, mainly because of the scary books he reads. The space under his bed is very messy, and in addition to keeping a stuffed animal named Puddikins under it for emergency hugs, much other stuff has turned up such as Oreos, dirty socks and a notebook that Harold gives to Howie.\n\n=== Toby Monroe ===\nThe younger brother, and much more dignified and kinder than Pete. He likes to share his snacks with Harold during his late-night readings and is adored by Harold, Chester, Bunnicula, and Howie. He cares a lot for the pets and was known to slip pieces of food to Harold at dinner. Toby's family found Bunnicula abandoned at a movie theatre one night on an outing to the movies. Toby's family adopted Bunnicula after the family brought him home.\n\n=== Sonnicula ===\nThe son of Bunnicula. He looked just like Bunnicula and was born during ''Nighty-Nightmare''. His mother was a rabbit brought by Pete's best friend Kyle. It was not said whether he inherited his father's vampiric appetite, but he sleeps during the day, just like Bunnicula. In the last book, he was adopted by Miles Tanner.\n\n=== Miles Tanner \"M.T. Graves\" ===\nThe author of the \"Fleshcrawlers\" series, of which Peter is a fan. He lived temporarily at the Monroes' house when Peter won a contest allowing it. He shows interest in Bunnicula and carried his pet, Edgar Allan Crow, around. He had a pale face, long curly hair, a black cape, and was very attached to a black bag. The black bag was thought to contain Bunnicula (by Chester, of course) when Bunnicula escaped. The pets opened the bag, greatly embarrassing Miles Tanner in front of the company. The contents were stuffed animals. Miles admitted that they were to train him to overcome his fear of animals. He said he was scared of dogs, cats, and people. He wanted a rabbit because a rabbit never barked at him before. Therefore, he wants Bunnicula. In the end, he adopts Sonnicula, saying \"It won't be Bunnicula, but it will be fine.\" The Monroes are greatly relieved to still keep their amazing pet. In a letter, Miles says he will marry Ms. Pickles, Peter's school librarian and they shall be neighbors. The Monroe pets changed his mind towards animals.\n\n=== Edgar Allan Crow ===\nA crow Miles adopted, found on his doorstep when he was a wounded baby. Edgar gives Miles company and Miles has said he can't do anything without him. Edgar, however, wants to go back to his own kind. He was seen courting another crow in the Monroes' place. Edgar learns to write and sends an e-mail to the Monroes. Edgar Allan Crow's name is a parody of [[Edgar Allan Poe]].\n\n=== Mrs. Marjorie Pickles Tanner ===\nPete and Kyle's English teacher, who is also a fan of M.T. Graves and in fact his wife. She first met Tanner when she brought over a cake as an excuse to meet him before he came to visit Peter's school. Soon after the Monroes received a letter from Tanner announcing his engagement to Pete's teacher.\n\n==List of books==\n''Source:''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodreads.com/series/43326|title=Bunnicula Series by Deborah Howe|website=www.goodreads.com|access-date=2020-04-12}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery (1979)'' ===\n{{main|Bunnicula: A Rabbit-Tale of Mystery}}\n\n===''Howliday Inn (1982)''===\nWhen the Monroe family decides to leave for a vacation, they send Harold and Chester off to a kennel called Chateau Bow-Wow (A special boarding house for special cats and dogs). There, they meet the other inhabitants of the kennel: A frustrated poodle named Louise, an athletic bulldog, a mutt named Taxi, a crazy cat named Lyle, a flirtatious poodle named Georgette, and two dachshunds named Heather and Howard, who Chester is certain are werewolves. The owner of the kennel, Dr. Greenbriar, is taking the week off and the other staff, an aspiring vet named Jill and a comic-book reader named Harrison who hopes to make a million bucks before he is twenty-one, are overworked. Because they are overworked, they make a lot of mistakes, especially Jill. These mistakes include feeding the animals late and temporarily misplacing Chester's file. Harrison will later use this tendency to forget things to his advantage. Tensions are high between the two as a result of stress. While adapting to their temporary new lives, a mystery soon unfolds when Louise goes missing.\n\nAlthough the kennel workers decide she ran away, Chester becomes certain that foul play was involved. Just when he seems to have solved the mystery, Chester vanishes. When investigating, Harold overhears Harrison, one of the kennel workers, reporting that he tested Chester's cat food and that it was laced with poison. Horrified, Harold attempts to continue Chester's work and solve the mystery. One evening, Harold finds the message \"Help Howls out now!\" scratched into his dog dish. Chester mysteriously returns later, then rounds up Harold, Taxi, and Lyle. He leads them to find Harrison attempting to capture Heather and Howard. The animals raise the alarm and Harrison is caught by the other kennel workers. Chester tells Harold later that Harrison caught wind that one of the animals in the shelter was very valuable. He first kidnapped Louise and then Chester thinking that it could have been them, but found out that it was the dachshunds, who were actually rare wire-haired dachshunds. He also learned that Heather was going to have puppies, making him even more determined to capture them all to get rich. When Dr. Greenbriar and Jill hear the dogs barking and find, first Louise at Harrison's house with Max and Georgette, who sneaked out to find her, barking outside and then Harrison trying to capture the dachshunds with the other animals attacking him, he is tried and sentenced. The sentence is to go to university and pay for it by working at the zoo. When the Monroe family arrives after their vacation, they reveal that they're also adopting the runt of the dachshund litter, which they name Howie\u2014Pete named him this because the puppy's father's name was Howard.\n\n=== ''The Celery Stalks at Midnight (1983)'' ===\nBunnicula has gone missing and Chester begins to fear for the town again. This time, he believes that the vegetables that Bunnicula sucks dry could return as the rabbit's vampire slaves, which he will then use as an army to take over the town. Armed with a box of toothpicks to stab through the \"hearts\" of vegetables, he, Harold, and Howie set off to search the neighborhood for white vegetables. After some success, they witness Toby and Pete wearing dark robes and holding a group of frightened children prisoner. The pets fear that Bunnicula has begun to take over people as well and run to the nearby school, which is full of what they suspect are the rabbit's servants.\n\nAfter causing much mayhem (including Chester destroying a large white carrot, which he believes is the head of the [[undead]] vegetables), they are caught by the Monroes. It is revealed that there was a carnival at the school that day, and Toby and Pete and the other children were rehearsing for a play they were going to put on. The \"carrot\" that Chester destroyed was actually a carrot cake, shaped like a carrot and covered in cream cheese. Finally, Bunnicula was found at the school, entered in the pet show. The pets find out that Bunnicula spent the previous night in the garage, which was accidentally left open, which meant he did indeed leave the house to feed on vegetables.\n\nIn the end, [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s \"[[The Tell-Tale Heart]]\" is parodied when Chester finds an artichoke heart under his favorite chair. After telling Chester there's nothing to worry about and trying to fall asleep, Harold hears a faint thumping.... he opens his eyes to find the vegetable in question right in front of his nose, which leads him to ask if Chester has a toothpick handy. It is left ambiguous as to whether or not this is a prank by Chester or an actual attempt at a vampiric attack on Harold by the artichoke.\n\n=== ''Nighty Nightmare (1987)'' ===\nA.K.A. ''The Return Of Bunnicula''. While at their lakeside retreat of Boggy Lake and fishing with Harold, Mr. Monroe begins to have a [[mid-life crisis]] and wants to do something exciting while they are there. They decide to go camping out in the woods; Harold only likes the idea because of [[S'more|s'mores,]] and Chester is skeptical about going out due to it being the eve of [[Saint George's Day]], the one night of the year where evil monsters and spirits come out to prey. Upon going out into the woods, they meet two men; Bud (who constantly holds a [[knife]] out in plain sight for some reason) and Spud (described by Harold as having a [[potato]]-shaped head), along with their dog Teufel ([[German language|German]] for \"[[Devil]]\"), nicknamed \"Dawg\", a bulldog with a [[scar]] on his face and a long ribbon of drool constantly hanging from his lower lip. That night, they go out for a walk, and Dawg leads Harold, Chester, and Howie away from his masters and the Monroes to show them something \"neat\", getting them lost in the woods in the process.\n\nChester begins to suspect that Bud and Spud may plan to [[murder]] the Monroes and that Dawg is luring them away to keep them from interfering, and Harold slowly begins to believe him. Once they reach a house right in the middle of the woods, Chester tells a story about Bunnicula's origin in an attempt to lull Dawg to sleep and allow himself, Harold, and Howie to escape; he claims that Bunnicula is the child of two rabbits who were artificially transformed into vampires by a lonely vampiric scientist named Diabolicus and that three humans that he turned into vampires live in the house right before them right now, continuing his work. While the plan is successful, Harold, Howie, and even Chester fall asleep along with Dawg, and awaken shortly before dawn due to the rain and constant [[nightmares]], presumably brought on by Chester's story, which is left open to interpretation by the end of the book as to whether or not Chester made the whole thing up or if it was based on actual 'fact' within the canon of the series, though Chester's belief that the house is an 'American house of Dr. E.A.D' which lead to the story, is proven to be mistaken by story's end.\n\nAfter they return to the Monroes' camp, only to find it trashed and deserted, Dawg reveals that the house they visited is his own and that Bud and Spud (real names Buford and Spalding) live there with their mother. Buford is revealed to be an architect while Spalding is a practicing lawyer. The Monroes also stayed the night with them in order to get out of the rain, and are relieved that Harold, Howie, and Chester are unharmed. Bud and Spud give their mother a baby [[skunk]] they caught last night as an early [[birthday]] present, and everyone sings campfire songs while eating s' mores; all except for Chester, who sulks in a corner. It is also revealed that Pete had been using Bunnicula in a rabbit breeding project he had been working on and one of the baby rabbits looked like Bunnicula (indicating that it too might be a vampire rabbit).\n\n=== ''Return to Howliday Inn (1992)'' ===\nThe Monroe family again leaves Harold, Chester, and Howie at Chateau Bow-Wow. The pets quickly notice differences, including a new group of animals staying there (a weasel, two cats named Felony and Miss Demeanor, a sad Great Dane named Hamlet, a pair of homesick dogs, and a parrot named Ditto). Howie is thrilled to be at his birthplace; Chester is none too pleased. Soon, however, all of the animals are in for a shock\u2014They hear a female dog named Rosebud calling from the other side of the fence. When they dig at the dirt around the fence, they find a few bones and a dog collar. Rosebud tells them that she discovered a horrid secret about Chateau Bow-Wow which sealed her fate and warns the animals to escape. Undaunted, Chester begins to investigate.\n\nAfter listening in on Ditto, he hears her repeated \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5\". Later, she repeats what appears to be the entire sequence of numbers: \"6, 1, 1, 1, 5, 2\". Upon hearing this, Felony and Miss Demeanor are thrilled. When asked, they reluctantly reveal that they wanted to sneak into the kennel worker's building to steal better food and believed that the code would get them in. Shortly after, a tearful kennel worker takes Hamlet into the building. Georgette is brought to Chateau Bow-Wow and tells the animals the true story of Rosebud: She was alive and well and back with her owners. The bones were chicken bones and her collar had been lost prior. The animals enter the building and find Hamlet, who tells them that his old owner left him there a long time ago. He was now set to be put to sleep. Chester finds his owner's new address and they set off to bring Hamlet there. The new address turns out to be a nursing home, one which does not allow animals. The pets break in and in the chaos, it becomes clear that the patients love the arrival of the animals, who remind them of their old pets. Hamlet finds his old owner, and it is revealed that the owner was a ventriloquist, explaining how Hamlet caused \"Rosebud\" to speak. Using ventriloquism of their own, the pets and patients convince the staff of the nursing home to allow Hamlet to stay. When Harold, Chester, and Howie are picked up at the end, they fool the Monroes with the ventriloquism tricks they picked up.\n\n=== ''Bunnicula Strikes Again! (1995)'' ===\nChester has once again come to the crazy conclusion that Bunnicula is a threatening vampire. The cat starts drinking the rabbit's juice in the daytime so Bunnicula will die of starvation. Harold and Howie are upset, but once again Chester insists this is all for the best. One night, Harold notices Bunnicula crying while singing him a lullaby. Chester thinks he misses his mother, and in the next few days, he leads the two dogs to search for her. This is unsuccessful, as she very likely is not around town. When Bunnicula becomes increasingly ill, either due to lack of food or to his lack of parental love, he is taken to the veterinarian, Chester, however, escapes and gets to the theater first. Before he can kill Bunnicula, the demolition starts, crushing both the cat and the rabbit under rubble. Harold and Howie manage to alert the Monroes and the other witnesses, and together they dig through the piles of fragments. They find Chester in a weakened state, but Bunnicula miraculously is completely unharmed. Chester comforts the rabbit, finally claiming that his attempts to murder Bunnicula were futile and that because he survived the demolition without a scratch, he is 'indestructible.' In the end, the Monroes return to their normal lives, and Bunnicula is, at last, happy because Chester has accepted him as one of the family.\n\n=== ''Bunnicula Meets Edgar Allan Crow (2006)'' ===\nA.K.A. ''Bunnicula vs The Monster Raven''. Pete writes to the author of his (and Howie's) favorite series, FleshCrawlers. He visits the Monroe household and stays in the guestroom, bringing with him his favorite pet crow, Edgar Allan Crow. Everyone is thrilled, except for Chester, who insists that the author, M.T. Graves, is suspicious. He notes that something bad always happens to the pets in Graves's books, and when he wrote back to Pete, he seemed especially interested in spending some \"quality time with the pets,\" particularly Bunnicula, whom Chester has now befriended. Harold and Howie aren't convinced, but Chester feels certain that there is a secret society amongst the crows, and Edgar is a messenger sent to help Graves transform Bunnicula into a bat. When Bunnicula escapes, the entire party follows him to catch him, and Harold and Howie begin to think that Chester may have been right. M.T. Graves is very careful about a black bag, and when Bunnicula is not found, Chester believes he is trapped in the bag. Harold dumps the bag, only to embarrass Graves in front of everyone because it was filled with stuffed animals. In the end, M.T. Graves tells them that he was a nervous boy when he was younger and was afraid of dogs and cats, so he figured he would stay at the Monroe's house so that he could conquer his phobia. Graves falls in love with Pete's school librarian and marries her. Graves releases Edgar because Edgar fell in love with another crow. Then he adopts Sonnicula, Bunnicula's son. After Graves left, Pete got a letter that said he was inspired to write two books from visiting the Monroes: one called ''Quoth the Raven'' about his relationship with Edgar, and another called ''The Excellently Weird Adventures of Charlie the Cat from Galaxy Nine'', inspired by Chester, who was less than thrilled to discover he was one of them, as he put it, \"psycho creatures from M.T. Graves' demented novels.\"\n\nJames Howe is mentioned when Pete says that all of the other kids wanted to choose authors like [[J.K. Rowling]] or James Howe.\n\n==Tales from the House of Bunnicula==\nA spin-off series centering around the writings of Howie, which involves Howie encountering a supernatural or extraterrestrial creature or event with his trusty friend, Delilah. The books also contain ''notes'' that Howie receives from Harold or Chester. The first book was published in 2003<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/itcamefrombeneat00howe_0|title=It Came from Beneath the Bed!|date=2003-06-01|isbn=978-0-689-83948-1|language=en|last1=Howe|first1=James|url-access=registration}}</ref> and the final book was published in 2004.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/odorousadventure00jame|title=The Odorous Adventures of Stinky Dog|date=2004-09-01|isbn=978-0-689-87412-3|language=en|last1=Howe|first1=James|url-access=registration}}</ref> \n\n===''It Came from Beneath the Bed''===\n===''Invasion of the Mind Swappers from Asteroid 6''===\n\n===''Howie Monroe and the Doghouse of Doom''===\n\n===''Screaming Mummies of the Pharaoh's Tomb II''===\n\n===''Bud Barkin, Private Eye''===\n\n===''The Amazing-Odorous Adventures of Stinky Dog''===\n\n== Adaptions ==\nA 1982 animated TV special (from [[Ruby-Spears]]) by the same name was created based on the first book and aired on the ''[[ABC Weekend Special]]''.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn [[Bunnicula (TV series)|animated series]] that is a loose adaptation of ''Bunnicula'' began airing on [[Cartoon Network]] and on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]] on February 6, 2016.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":2\" />\n\nA stage adaptation based on the books was written by Jon Klein and performed by the B Street Theatre in Sacramento, California.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.newsreview.com/sacramento/stage-reviews/content?oid=32021|title=Stage Reviews - Stage Reviews - Arts&Culture - October 28, 2004|website=Sacramento News & Review|access-date=2016-04-10}}</ref> An additional stage adaptation was created for a children's theatre at the DR2 Theatre in New York, adapted by writer [[Charles Busch]].<ref>{{Cite news|last=Zinoman|first=Jason|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/theater/reviews/bunnicula-a-rabbit-tale-of-musical-mystery-at-dr2-theater.html|title='Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale of Musical Mystery,' at DR2 Theater|date=2013-02-11|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2016-04-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist |refs=\n\n<ref name=isfdb>\n{{isfdb series|30840|Bunnicula Universe}}.

The [[National Liberation Council]] (NLC) imposed stricter controls on domestic private outlets; for example, the Rumours Decree in 1966 that prevented anyone from suing government-owned newspapers.<ref name=Anokwa/>\n\nIn 1969, the democratically elected civilian government of [[Kofi Busia]] that followed the NLC were left with a large number of media outlets under state control. Busia repealed various acts and dismissed the owner of the state-owned ''[[Daily Graphic (Ghana)|Daily Graphic]]'' for opposing Busia, who had appealed for African dialogue with the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid government in South Africa]].<ref name=Anokwa/> However, when Ignatius Kutu Acheampong overthrew the Busia government, he reinstated strict media control and clamped down on opposition outlets by cutting off foreign exchange.<ref name=Anokwa/> However, a number of opposition media remained unimpeded during the Acheampong regime, and by 1978 had grown in their calls for a [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracy]] in Ghana.<ref name=Anokwa/>\n\nThe regime of Acheampong was overthrown in May 1978 by [[Fred Akuffo|General Akuffo]], who reversed some of his predecessors media policies and released jailed journalists and opposition members. This led to the establishment of two party papers: the ''Star'' of the [[Popular Front Party]] (PFP) and the ''Gong Gong'' of the [[People's National Party (Ghana)|People's National Party]] (PNP). The Akuffo regime was short lived, ending in another [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] by the [[Armed Forces Revolutionary Council, Ghana|Armed Forces Revolutionary Council]] (AFRC) headed by [[Jerry Rawlings]], who repealed the press laws that were passed by Acheampong. Rawlings replaced the chief editor of the ''Daily Graphic'' who criticised the AFRC executions,<ref name=Anokwa/> though they had no authority to do so as it undermined the Constitution of the Third Republic, which stated they had to be replaced by the Press Commission.<ref>''Africa Contemporary Record''. Volume 12, 1979-1980. London: Africana Publishing Company.</ref> After eight months of the AFRC regime, which had promised media reform but in the end did not materialise, power was returned to the democratically elected PNP with [[Hilla Limann]] on 24 September 1979. Limann was an advocate of liberal media reform, establishing a 12-member Press Commission on 25 July 1980.<ref name=Anokwa/> In a speech he said:\n\n{{quote|I shall, as elected President of Ghana, be forever prepared to submit to the acid test of public judgement the claims of those who may think that they represent the public more than me or any other political leader. Bluff, snobbery and arrogance on all sides must now cease, so that the Press Commission can function in a way that it has been envisaged by those who have never had any personal axe to grind. I have long been one of the protaganists myself. Since the functions of the Press Commission have clearly been spelt out in the Constitution, I can do no more than reassure its members and our journalists that my government will respect, uphold and defend the Constitution and thus do everything in our power to help the Press Commission discharge its obligation, in the overall interest of the public to which we are all to varying degrees accountable.<ref>''Democracy and Ghana: Selected Speeches of President Hilla Limann.'' London: [[Rex Collings]], 1983.</ref>}}\n\nThe Press Commission, as enshrined in law, were to investigate complaints about the press, uphold [[press freedom]] and provide necessary regulation and licensing to media outlets.<ref name=Anokwa/> During Limann's rule, he respected the new Constitution and accepted criticism from the media. This did not last long however, as [[John Rawlings]], citing \"corruption and maladministration\", once again seized power under the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] on 31 December 1981, and repealed the liberal media reforms instigated by Limann.<ref name=pr/> Under the new government, the Third Constitution, along with the Press Commission, was abolished. Through the state-owned ''Daily Graphic'' on 5 January 1982, he told the press to lead the \"Holy War\" and direct the revolution.<ref>''Daily Graphic'', 5 January 1982.</ref> Rawlings passed laws that prevented criticism of the government or its policies, dismissed editors critical of him and passed various laws such as the Preventive Custody Law and Newspaper Licensing Law which allowed indefinite detention without trial of journalists, and stifled private media development respectively.<ref name=Anokwa/> The PNDC Secretary of Information [[Joyce Aryee]] in 1983 defended direct government control:\n\n{{quote|I don't see the [[news media|press]] as lying outside the political institutions that we already have. This is where I feel people ought to realise that the press differs from country to country. In a situation like ours, where we need to [[conscientization|conscientize]] people, and where we have an illiteracy problem, you use institutions like the press to do the conscientization.<ref>''Africa Contemporary Record.''

Rawlings as part of the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (he retired a Flight Lieutenant of the Ghana Armed Forces) liberalised the media by repealing previous laws the PNDC signed in. The private media, which had previously been silenced under the regime for the past decade, used the new press freedom laws to voice criticism at Rawlings of the years of strict laws and published several accusations of violent [[authoritarianism]] and drug abuse.<ref name=pr/> The state media however, maintained a favourable image of Rawlings. Rawlings acknowledged the years of media repression, though he defended the military coup:\n\n{{quote|All that has happened during the last decade cannot be divorced from today's constitutional order. No one can fail to appreciate the significance of the 31st December Revolution in bringing Ghanaians to the threshold of the Fourth Republic, and in establishing firm principles of [[social justice]] which will make the constitution a living reality - to do so would mean distorting Ghana's history and putting aside those vital lessons which would indeed enrich this phase of Ghanaian experience.<ref>''[[West Africa (magazine)|West Africa]]'', 18\u201324 January 1993: 52.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, Rawlings had pledged to uphold Chapter 12 of the Constitution of Ghana, promoting press freedom, responsibility of both private and state outlets and these freedoms to be additional to [[human rights]].<ref name=gov>[http://www.ghana.gov.gh/ghana/constitution_republic_ghana.jsp Constitution of Ghana], ''Government of Ghana''.</ref> A new 15-member National Press Commission (later Ghanaian Media Commission) was created that was independent of government, which would uphold the aforementioned responsibilities. Despite these new reforms, President Rawlings and the NDC government remained critical of the private press, calling it \"politically irresponsible\" and motivated by profit.<ref name=pr/> One government official claimed the private media \"tested the limits of the government\", while others accused it of portraying Parliament as inferior.<ref name=Anokwa/> A group named Friends of Democracy claimed it had 1,000 signatories protesting against the private media.<ref>''West Africa''. 21\u201327 June 1994: 550.</ref> Editors from the ''Free Press'' and ''New Statesman'' had reported being sent death threats from the NDC for criticising the regime.<ref name=Anokwa/> Valerie Sackey who was an assistant to President Rawlings, noted that the private press had a duty to provide legitimate criticism of the government and to act responsibly, rather than simply portraying that the government was attempting to muzzle them.<ref name=Anokwa/>\n\n===2000-present===\nAfter the election in 2000 of [[John Kufuor]] the tensions between the private media and government decreased. Kufuor was a supporter of press freedom and repealed the criminal [[Defamation|libel]] law, though maintained that the media had to act responsibly.<ref name=pr/> The Ghanaian media has been described as \"one of the most unfettered\" in Africa, operating with little restriction on private media.

Journalists are not hindered during their work, and information is not censored into or out of the country.<ref name=pr/> The main news agency, ''[[Ghana News Agency]]'', was set up in 1957 by Nkrumah to provide balanced information on local and international news. [[Reuters]] helped provide the agency with guidance and technical assistance until 1961. The agency had subscriptions from over 140 organisations and six news agencies in 2000.<ref name=pr/>\n\n==Challenges to Ghanaian media==\nDespite its relative freedom, the media in Ghana does face some challenges. Journalists in Ghana are often poorly paid, under resourced, and often lack training. As a result, journalists in Ghana find themselves susceptible to bribery and self-censorship.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/researchlearning/story/2006/12/061206_amdi_ghana.shtml Amdi Ghana]. 1 December 2006.</ref> The quality of radio and television broadcast media programming is low. With respect to newspapers, the ownership landscape of newspapers is politically polarized with most newspapers supporting either the government or opposition party lines.

London: Africana Publishing Company.</ref> After eight months of the AFRC regime, which had promised media reform but in the end did not materialise, power was returned to the democratically elected PNP with [[Hilla Limann]] on 24 September 1979. Limann was an advocate of liberal media reform, establishing a 12-member Press Commission on 25 July 1980.<ref name=Anokwa/> In a speech he said:\n\n{{quote|I shall, as elected President of Ghana, be forever prepared to submit to the acid test of public judgement the claims of those who may think that they represent the public more than me or any other political leader. Bluff, snobbery and arrogance on all sides must now cease, so that the Press Commission can function in a way that it has been envisaged by those who have never had any personal axe to grind. I have long been one of the protaganists myself. Since the functions of the Press Commission have clearly been spelt out in the Constitution, I can do no more than reassure its members and our journalists that my government will respect, uphold and defend the Constitution and thus do everything in our power to help the Press Commission discharge its obligation, in the overall interest of the public to which we are all to varying degrees accountable.<ref>''Democracy and Ghana: Selected Speeches of President Hilla Limann.'' London: [[Rex Collings]], 1983.</ref>}}\n\nThe Press Commission, as enshrined in law, were to investigate complaints about the press, uphold [[press freedom]] and provide necessary regulation and licensing to media outlets.<ref name=Anokwa/> During Limann's rule, he respected the new Constitution and accepted criticism from the media. This did not last long however, as [[John Rawlings]], citing \"corruption and maladministration\", once again seized power under the [[Provisional National Defence Council]] on 31 December 1981, and repealed the liberal media reforms instigated by Limann.<ref name=pr/> Under the new government, the Third Constitution, along with the Press Commission, was abolished. Through the state-owned ''Daily Graphic'' on 5 January 1982, he told the press to lead the \"Holy War\" and direct the revolution.<ref>''Daily Graphic'', 5 January 1982.</ref> Rawlings passed laws that prevented criticism of the government or its policies, dismissed editors critical of him and passed various laws such as the Preventive Custody Law and Newspaper Licensing Law which allowed indefinite detention without trial of journalists, and stifled private media development respectively.<ref name=Anokwa/> The PNDC Secretary of Information [[Joyce Aryee]] in 1983 defended direct government control:\n\n{{quote|I don't see the [[news media|press]] as lying outside the political institutions that we already have. This is where I feel people ought to realise that the press differs from country to country. In a situation like ours, where we need to [[conscientization|conscientize]] people, and where we have an illiteracy problem, you use institutions like the press to do the conscientization.<ref>''Africa Contemporary Record.'' Volume 16, 1983-1984. London: Africana Publishing Company.</ref>}}\n\nThe policies not only affected print media but also the [[Ghana Broadcasting Corporation]], with several dismissals or premature retirement.<ref name=Anokwa/> As a result, some media avoided all discussions of politics altogether and focused on other topics like sport or entertainment instead.<ref name=pr/>\n\n===1992-2000===\nIn 1992, Ghana promulgated a new constitution, and returned to democratic rule on 7 January 1993. Rawlings as part of the [[National Democratic Congress (Ghana)|National Democratic Congress]] (he retired a Flight Lieutenant of the Ghana Armed Forces) liberalised the media by repealing previous laws the PNDC signed in. The private media, which had previously been silenced under the regime for the past decade, used the new press freedom laws to voice criticism at Rawlings of the years of strict laws and published several accusations of violent [[authoritarianism]] and drug abuse.<ref name=pr/> The state media however, maintained a favourable image of Rawlings. Rawlings acknowledged the years of media repression, though he defended the military coup:\n\n{{quote|All that has happened during the last decade cannot be divorced from today's constitutional order. No one can fail to appreciate the significance of the 31st December Revolution in bringing Ghanaians to the threshold of the Fourth Republic, and in establishing firm principles of [[social justice]] which will make the constitution a living reality - to do so would mean distorting Ghana's history and putting aside those vital lessons which would indeed enrich this phase of Ghanaian experience.<ref>''[[West Africa (magazine)|West Africa]]'', 18\u201324 January 1993: 52.</ref>}}\n\nFurthermore, Rawlings had pledged to uphold Chapter 12 of the Constitution of Ghana, promoting press freedom, responsibility of both private and state outlets and these freedoms to be additional to [[human rights]].<ref name=gov>[http://www.ghana.gov.gh/ghana/constitution_republic_ghana.jsp Constitution of Ghana], ''Government of Ghana''.</ref> A new 15-member National Press Commission (later Ghanaian Media Commission) was created that was independent of government, which would uphold the aforementioned responsibilities. Despite these new reforms, President Rawlings and the NDC government remained critical of the private press, calling it \"politically irresponsible\" and motivated by profit.<ref name=pr/> One government official claimed the private media \"tested the limits of the government\", while others accused it of portraying Parliament as inferior.<ref name=Anokwa/> A group named Friends of Democracy claimed it had 1,000 signatories protesting against the private media.<ref>''West Africa''. 21\u201327 June 1994: 550.</ref> Editors from the ''Free Press'' and ''New Statesman'' had reported being sent death threats from the NDC for criticising the regime.<ref name=Anokwa/> Valerie Sackey who was an assistant to President Rawlings, noted that the private press had a duty to provide legitimate criticism of the government and to act responsibly, rather than simply portraying that the government was attempting to muzzle them.<ref name=Anokwa/>\n\n===2000-present===\nAfter the election in 2000 of [[John Kufuor]] the tensions between the private media and government decreased. Kufuor was a supporter of press freedom and repealed the criminal [[Defamation|libel]] law, though maintained that the media had to act responsibly.<ref name=pr/> The Ghanaian media has been described as \"one of the most unfettered\" in Africa, operating with little restriction on private media.

Journalists are not hindered during their work, and information is not censored into or out of the country.<ref name=pr/> The main news agency, ''[[Ghana News Agency]]'', was set up in 1957 by Nkrumah to provide balanced information on local and international news. [[Reuters]] helped provide the agency with guidance and technical assistance until 1961. The agency had subscriptions from over 140 organisations and six news agencies in 2000.<ref name=pr/>\n\n==Challenges to Ghanaian media==\nDespite its relative freedom, the media in Ghana does face some challenges. Journalists in Ghana are often poorly paid, under resourced, and often lack training. As a result, journalists in Ghana find themselves susceptible to bribery and self-censorship.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/trust/researchlearning/story/2006/12/061206_amdi_ghana.shtml Amdi Ghana]. 1 December 2006.</ref> The quality of radio and television broadcast media programming is low. With respect to newspapers, the ownership landscape of newspapers is politically polarized with most newspapers supporting either the government or opposition party lines.

Keown made his England debut in 1992 against [[France national football team|France]] and went on to win 43 caps for the national side over the next 10 years, gradually forming a respected defensive partnership with Arsenal teammate [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] at both club and international level. Keown represented England at four major international football finals including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cups.\n\nHe is now a part-time scout and coach for Arsenal, as well as a [[pundit]] for the [[BBC]] and [[BT Sport]]. He came out of retirement in 2012 and briefly played for [[Combined Counties League|Combined Counties League Premier Division]] side [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] in their [[FA Cup]] fixtures.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Arsenal===\nA [[Centre-half|centre back]] from [[Oxford]], Keown played for local sides and his local [[Gaelic football]] team as a boy, before joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a schoolboy contract in 1980, though he made his professional debut on loan at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 1984. His debut for Arsenal came on 23 November 1985, when [[Don Howe]] was still their manager, and they drew 0\u20130 with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]]. He played 22 league games that season, mostly alongside [[Tommy Caton]] or [[David O'Leary]], but when [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was appointed manager on 14 May 1986, he decided that Keown was not part of his plans to try and turn Arsenal into league title contenders and on 9 June 1986 he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for \u00a3200,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41357|title=Martin Keown profile - Arsenal FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nKeown signed for Villa after a season in which they had narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, a mere four years after being [[European Cup]] winners and five years since being league champions. Manager [[Graham Turner]] was under a lot of pressure, and after their dismal form continued into the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] season he was sacked on 14 September 1986 and succeeded by [[Billy McNeill]]. Keown appeared in 36 league games that season, but he was unable to save Villa from finishing bottom of the First Division and being relegated after 12 successive seasons in the top flight.\n\n[[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] then arrived at [[Villa Park]] to succeed the sacked McNeill, and Keown was very much part of his rebuilding plans as he missed just two league games and scored three goals as Villa finished second in the Second Division and won promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt. Keown helped the team secure its top flight status the following season, but was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 7 August 1989, just before the start of the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390 season]], for a fee of \u00a3750,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41358|title=Martin Keown profile - Aston Villa FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Everton===\nKeown had a fine start to his Everton career, and they topped the table for a while in late autumn and there was hope that they could win the league title, but their form ebbed away after Christmas and they managed only a sixth-place finish. Keown managed 20 league appearances that campaign and a slightly better 24 in [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]], when Harvey was replaced by [[Howard Kendall]] as manager in November. He missed just three league games in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], which brought another mid-table finish, and he played just 13 more league games for the Toffees before accepting a \u00a32&nbsp;million return to Arsenal in February 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41359|title=Martin Keown profile - Everton FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Arsenal===\nKeown did not feature in Arsenal's historic [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double of 1993 due to being [[cup-tied]]. However, he did manage 16 Premier League appearances, mostly at the expense of [[Steve Bould]], forming arguably the most intense battle for central defensive positions in the Premier League at the time. He and [[Andy Linighan]] were high quality defenders competing alongside Bould and captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] in the centre of one of the best English league defences of the 1990s.\n\nKeown also missed out on Arsenal's [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] Final win over [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] the following year<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1994 |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind=8192/newsid=3436.html |accessdate=7 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526180303/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind%3D8192/newsid%3D3436.html |archivedate=26 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (although he did play a part in the overall campaign after appearing in earlier rounds).<ref>{{cite web|title=Arsenal Appearances 1993/94|url=http://www.arseweb.com/history/stats/94.html|accessdate=7 January 2009}}</ref> However, he did start the final the following season when Arsenal were narrowly beaten by [[Real Zaragoza]] after extra time.\n\nHe rarely missed a game in his first four full seasons back at Highbury, though in the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] [[Double (association football)|double winning]] campaign, the 31-year-old Keown was selected just 18 times in the Premier League by manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] as he claimed the first two major trophies of his career after well over a decade of waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41361|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League]] tie against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] Keown memorably scored two goals in the last five minutes to help Arsenal come back from 2-1 down to win 3-2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown double hands Arsenal late win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/932484.stm|accessdate=21 July 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2000}}</ref>\n\nKeown later became an integral part of [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s double [[Double (association football)|Double]] winning sides of 1998 and 2002, remaining a first team regular until the end of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303 season]], when the Gunners won their ninth [[FA Cup]] but blew the chance of a unique fourth double due to a late loss of form in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41362|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 September 2003, during Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s match at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester United were awarded a late penalty, with the score at 0\u20130. [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] stepped up to take the penalty, and hit the bar with it. After the penalty, Keown and [[Ray Parlour]] confronted van Nistelrooy, and Keown hit him on the back of the head. Keown remained at Arsenal until 2004, winning another [[Premier League]] title, before being released on a free transfer.

Keown earned a recall from [[Glenn Hoddle]] in 1997, and went to the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], but did not play. Keown became a regular under [[Kevin Keegan]] (captaining the side against [[Finland national football team|Finland]]) and played in two of England's [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] matches.\n\nBy the time [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] became manager, Keown's age was starting to count against him, though he went to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], again as a non-playing squad member.

football|footballer]] who played as a [[defender (association football)|defender]] from 1984 to 2005, notably in the [[Premier League]] for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he made over 400 appearances for the club and won 10 honours.\n\nHe also played for [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]], [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]]. Keown made his England debut in 1992 against [[France national football team|France]] and went on to win 43 caps for the national side over the next 10 years, gradually forming a respected defensive partnership with Arsenal teammate [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] at both club and international level. Keown represented England at four major international football finals including the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] World Cups.\n\nHe is now a part-time scout and coach for Arsenal, as well as a [[pundit]] for the [[BBC]] and [[BT Sport]]. He came out of retirement in 2012 and briefly played for [[Combined Counties League|Combined Counties League Premier Division]] side [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] in their [[FA Cup]] fixtures.\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Arsenal===\nA [[Centre-half|centre back]] from [[Oxford]], Keown played for local sides and his local [[Gaelic football]] team as a boy, before joining [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on a schoolboy contract in 1980, though he made his professional debut on loan at [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton & Hove Albion]] in 1984. His debut for Arsenal came on 23 November 1985, when [[Don Howe]] was still their manager, and they drew 0\u20130 with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at [[The Hawthorns]]. He played 22 league games that season, mostly alongside [[Tommy Caton]] or [[David O'Leary]], but when [[George Graham (footballer)|George Graham]] was appointed manager on 14 May 1986, he decided that Keown was not part of his plans to try and turn Arsenal into league title contenders and on 9 June 1986 he joined [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] for \u00a3200,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41357|title=Martin Keown profile - Arsenal FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Aston Villa===\nKeown signed for Villa after a season in which they had narrowly avoided relegation to the Second Division, a mere four years after being [[European Cup]] winners and five years since being league champions. Manager [[Graham Turner]] was under a lot of pressure, and after their dismal form continued into the [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] season he was sacked on 14 September 1986 and succeeded by [[Billy McNeill]]. Keown appeared in 36 league games that season, but he was unable to save Villa from finishing bottom of the First Division and being relegated after 12 successive seasons in the top flight.\n\n[[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]] then arrived at [[Villa Park]] to succeed the sacked McNeill, and Keown was very much part of his rebuilding plans as he missed just two league games and scored three goals as Villa finished second in the Second Division and won promotion back to the top flight at the first attempt. Keown helped the team secure its top flight status the following season, but was sold to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] on 7 August 1989, just before the start of the [[1989\u201390 in English football|1989\u201390 season]], for a fee of \u00a3750,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41358|title=Martin Keown profile - Aston Villa FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Everton===\nKeown had a fine start to his Everton career, and they topped the table for a while in late autumn and there was hope that they could win the league title, but their form ebbed away after Christmas and they managed only a sixth-place finish. Keown managed 20 league appearances that campaign and a slightly better 24 in [[1990\u201391 in English football|1990\u201391]], when Harvey was replaced by [[Howard Kendall]] as manager in November. He missed just three league games in [[1991\u201392 in English football|1991\u201392]], which brought another mid-table finish, and he played just 13 more league games for the Toffees before accepting a \u00a32&nbsp;million return to Arsenal in February 1993.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41359|title=Martin Keown profile - Everton FC|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Return to Arsenal===\nKeown did not feature in Arsenal's historic [[FA Cup]] and [[Football League Cup|League Cup]] double of 1993 due to being [[cup-tied]]. However, he did manage 16 Premier League appearances, mostly at the expense of [[Steve Bould]], forming arguably the most intense battle for central defensive positions in the Premier League at the time. He and [[Andy Linighan]] were high quality defenders competing alongside Bould and captain [[Tony Adams (footballer)|Tony Adams]] in the centre of one of the best English league defences of the 1990s.\n\nKeown also missed out on Arsenal's [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|Cup Winners' Cup]] Final win over [[Parma F.C.|Parma]] the following year<ref>{{cite web|title=UEFA Cup Winners' Cup 1994 |url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind=8192/newsid=3436.html |accessdate=7 January 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526180303/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ecwc/news/kind%3D8192/newsid%3D3436.html |archivedate=26 May 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (although he did play a part in the overall campaign after appearing in earlier rounds).<ref>{{cite web|title=Arsenal Appearances 1993/94|url=http://www.arseweb.com/history/stats/94.html|accessdate=7 January 2009}}</ref> However, he did start the final the following season when Arsenal were narrowly beaten by [[Real Zaragoza]] after extra time.\n\nHe rarely missed a game in his first four full seasons back at Highbury, though in the [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]] [[Double (association football)|double winning]] campaign, the 31-year-old Keown was selected just 18 times in the Premier League by manager [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]] as he claimed the first two major trophies of his career after well over a decade of waiting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41361|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn a [[2000\u201301 UEFA Champions League]] tie against [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] Keown memorably scored two goals in the last five minutes to help Arsenal come back from 2-1 down to win 3-2.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown double hands Arsenal late win|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/champions_league/932484.stm|accessdate=21 July 2016|publisher=BBC Sport|date=20 September 2000}}</ref>\n\nKeown later became an integral part of [[Ars\u00e8ne Wenger]]'s double [[Double (association football)|Double]] winning sides of 1998 and 2002, remaining a first team regular until the end of the [[2002\u201303 in English football|2002\u201303 season]], when the Gunners won their ninth [[FA Cup]] but blew the chance of a unique fourth double due to a late loss of form in the league.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=41362|title=Martin Keown - Arsenal FC - Football-Heroes.net|publisher=Sporting-heroes.net|accessdate=24 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn 20 September 2003, during Arsenal and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]'s match at [[Old Trafford]], Manchester United were awarded a late penalty, with the score at 0\u20130. [[Ruud van Nistelrooy]] stepped up to take the penalty, and hit the bar with it. After the penalty, Keown and [[Ray Parlour]] confronted van Nistelrooy, and Keown hit him on the back of the head. Keown remained at Arsenal until 2004, winning another [[Premier League]] title, before being released on a free transfer. His final season brought 10 league appearances \u2013 the minimum to qualify for a title winner's medal.<ref>{{Soccerbase season|4149|2003|name=Martin Keown|access-date=17 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nHe signed for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], but left after less than six months and signed for [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in January 2005 until the end of the season, after which he retired.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown begins coaching education|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/4222404.stm|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 December 2013}}</ref> As part of a [[publicity stunt]] Keown, and a number of other former professional players, including [[Ray Parlour]], [[Danny Dichio]], [[Jaime Moreno (footballer, born 1974)|Jaime Moreno]], [[Graeme Le Saux]], [[Claudio Caniggia]] and [[Brian McBride]], joined non-league [[Wembley F.C.|Wembley]] in order to take part in their [[2012\u201313 FA Cup]] run.<ref>{{cite web|title=Terry Venables' Wembley FC recruit former stars for FA Cup|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18534739|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=22 June 2012|date=21 June 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Owen|title=Budweiser signs players for Wembley FC to play in FA Cup it sponsors|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jun/21/budweiser-wembley-fc-sponsorship|accessdate=13 October 2017|work=The Guardian}}</ref> Wembley were knocked out in a replay by [[Uxbridge F.C.|Uxbridge]] after beating [[Langford F.C.|Langford]] in the previous round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/News/2012/Aug/wembley-uxbridge-report-300812.aspx |title=The website for the English football association, The FA Cup and The England football team - The FA Cup |publisher=The FA |date= |accessdate=2014-02-09}}</ref>\n\n==International career==\nKeown played [[England national under-16 football team|U16]] and [[England national under-18 football team|U18]] for England.

With an injury to [[Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)|Mark Wright]] he was called up into England's squad for [[UEFA Euro 1992]], and played in all three of  England's matches.\n\nKeown's early ascension to the England team under [[Graham Taylor (football manager)|Graham Taylor]] did not continue under [[Terry Venables]], who ignored him completely. Keown earned a recall from [[Glenn Hoddle]] in 1997, and went to the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], but did not play. Keown became a regular under [[Kevin Keegan]] (captaining the side against [[Finland national football team|Finland]]) and played in two of England's [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]] matches.\n\nBy the time [[Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson]] became manager, Keown's age was starting to count against him, though he went to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], again as a non-playing squad member. Keown retired from international football the day after England's exit at the hands of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Keown calls time|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport3/worldcup2002/hi/team_pages/england/newsid_2059000/2059066.stm|publisher=BBC|work=BBC Sport|date=22 June 2002|accessdate=15 November 2011}}</ref> In all he played 43 times for England, scoring two goals.\n\n==Management and career outside football==\nKeown joined the coaching staff of [[A.F.C.

He has been identified by former Arsenal manager [[Terry Neill]] as a key figure behind the success of Arsenal's inexperienced \"new-look\" defence (which the team resorted to after ongoing injury problems in the 2005\u201306 season, notably setting a record for minutes played without conceding in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]).<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal's New Guard| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/a/arsenal/4771963.stm|accessdate=31 May 2006|work=BBC News|date=16 May 2006|first=Nathan|last=Mercer}}</ref> In 2007\u201308 Keown was also a coach for the [[Oxford University A.F.C.|Oxford University Blues Football team]] on a part-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blues lose out in tough season opener|url=http://www.ouafc.com/news/136|accessdate=6 November 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715022548/http://www.ouafc.com/news/136|archivedate=15 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nKeown regularly appears as a pundit on the [[BBC]]'s football coverage and ''[[Match of the Day]]'', as well as covering the Champions League for Irish broadcaster [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]].

PDFs are only produced by extreme shock compressions on the scale of meteor impacts. They are not found in [[volcanic]] environments.\n\n====Brazil twinning in quartz====\n\nThis form of [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] in quartz is relatively common but the occurrence of close-spaced Brazil twins parallel to the [[basal plane]], (0001), has only been reported from impact structures. Experimental formation of basal-orientated Brazil twins in quartz requires high stresses (about 8 [[GPa]]) and high strain rates, and it seems probable that such features in natural quartz can also be regarded as unique impact indicators.<ref name=\"French\" />\n\n===High-pressure polymorphs===\n\nThe very high pressures associated with impacts can lead to the formation of high-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of various minerals. Quartz may occur as either of its two high-pressure forms, [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]].

PDFs are only produced by extreme shock compressions on the scale of meteor impacts. They are not found in [[volcanic]] environments.\n\n====Brazil twinning in quartz====\n\nThis form of [[Crystal twinning|twinning]] in quartz is relatively common but the occurrence of close-spaced Brazil twins parallel to the [[basal plane]], (0001), has only been reported from impact structures. Experimental formation of basal-orientated Brazil twins in quartz requires high stresses (about 8 [[GPa]]) and high strain rates, and it seems probable that such features in natural quartz can also be regarded as unique impact indicators.<ref name=\"French\" />\n\n===High-pressure polymorphs===\n\nThe very high pressures associated with impacts can lead to the formation of high-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]s of various minerals. Quartz may occur as either of its two high-pressure forms, [[coesite]] and [[stishovite]]. Coesite occasionally occurs associated with [[eclogite]]s formed during very high pressure regional metamorphism but was first discovered in a meteorite crater in 1960.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = E.

Notably, all employees pay 7% of their monthly income to [[FONASA]], the funding branch of the Chilean Ministry of Health.\n\nThe current Minister of Health is [[Jaime Ma\u00f1alich]]. The minister has two adjunts: the [[Undersecretary]] of Public Health ({{lang-es|Subsecretaria de Salud P\u00fablica}}), currently Paula Daza, and the Undersecretary of Assistance Networks ({{lang-es|Subsecretaria de Redes Asistenciales}}), currently Arturo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fonasa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a FONASA sign. FONASA is the funding branch of the Ministry of Health.]]\nIn 1808, the Committee of Vaccines ({{lang-es|Junta de Vacunas}}) was founded, and then in 1832 the Board of Directors of Hospitals ({{lang-es|Junta Directiva de Hospitales}}) began operations. Both organizations were precursors of what would become the modern institutions of public health. In 1907, a division charged with the administration of public [[hygiene]] was created under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Ministry of the Interior]] ({{lang-es|Ministerio del Interior}}). Then on October 14, 1924, this division was made into the cabinet-level Ministry of Hygiene, Social Assistance and Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Higiene, Asistencia y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}), with the same function (Decree No. 44, 1924). In 1927 all the ministries underwent an important restructuring; with these change it became the Ministry of Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Bienestar Social}}), and was charged with, as well as the coordination of public health policies, the investigation of the application of laws relating to society, public welfare, and social security.\n\nIn 1932, it was once again renamed, becoming the Ministry of Public Health ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salubridad P\u00fablica}}), then the Ministry of Public Health, Social Assistance and Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salubridad P\u00fablica, Asistencia y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}) in 1936, and later the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}) in 1953.\n\nIn 1959, the ministry was divided into the Ministry of Public Health ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica}}), the modern form of the ministry, and, assuming the functions regulating the welfare of Chileans, the Ministry of Work and Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}).\n\nFinally, from 1973 to 1979, the internal structure of the ministry, now simply the Ministry of Health, was reorganized, creating services such as the National Health Fund ({{lang-es|Fondo Nacional de Salud}}), or FONASA.\n\n===Organization===\nCurrently under the Ministry are the following public institutions:\n* [[Fondo Nacional de Salud]] ({{lang-es|Fondo Nacional de Salud}}, [[FONASA]])\n* [[Public Health Institute of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Instituto de Salud P\u00fablica de Chile}}, ISP)\n* [[Center for Supply]] ({{lang-es|Central de Abastecimiento}}, CENABAST)\n* The Health Services in each [[Regions of Chile|region]] of the country are charges with the coordination, management, and development of the assistance networks and execution of the ministry's action.\n\n==Titulars==\n\n===Ministers of Hygiene, Social Assistance and Welfare===\n<center>\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

Notably, all employees pay 7% of their monthly income to [[FONASA]], the funding branch of the Chilean Ministry of Health.\n\nThe current Minister of Health is [[Jaime Ma\u00f1alich]]. The minister has two adjunts: the [[Undersecretary]] of Public Health ({{lang-es|Subsecretaria de Salud P\u00fablica}}), currently Paula Daza, and the Undersecretary of Assistance Networks ({{lang-es|Subsecretaria de Redes Asistenciales}}), currently Arturo Z\u00fa\u00f1iga.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Fonasa.jpg|thumb|right|200px|a FONASA sign. FONASA is the funding branch of the Ministry of Health.]]\nIn 1808, the Committee of Vaccines ({{lang-es|Junta de Vacunas}}) was founded, and then in 1832 the Board of Directors of Hospitals ({{lang-es|Junta Directiva de Hospitales}}) began operations. Both organizations were precursors of what would become the modern institutions of public health. In 1907, a division charged with the administration of public [[hygiene]] was created under the [[Ministry of the Interior (Chile)|Ministry of the Interior]] ({{lang-es|Ministerio del Interior}}). Then on October 14, 1924, this division was made into the cabinet-level Ministry of Hygiene, Social Assistance and Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Higiene, Asistencia y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}), with the same function (Decree No. 44, 1924). In 1927 all the ministries underwent an important restructuring; with these change it became the Ministry of Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Bienestar Social}}), and was charged with, as well as the coordination of public health policies, the investigation of the application of laws relating to society, public welfare, and social security.\n\nIn 1932, it was once again renamed, becoming the Ministry of Public Health ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salubridad P\u00fablica}}), then the Ministry of Public Health, Social Assistance and Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salubridad P\u00fablica, Asistencia y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}) in 1936, and later the Ministry of Public Health and Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}) in 1953. \n\nIn 1959, the ministry was divided into the Ministry of Public Health ({{lang-es|Ministerio de Salud P\u00fablica}}), the modern form of the ministry, and, assuming the functions regulating the welfare of Chileans, the Ministry of Work and Social Welfare ({{lang-es|Ministerio del Trabajo y Previsi\u00f3n Social}}). \n\nFinally, from 1973 to 1979, the internal structure of the ministry, now simply the Ministry of Health, was reorganized, creating services such as the National Health Fund ({{lang-es|Fondo Nacional de Salud}}), or FONASA.\n\n===Organization===\nCurrently under the Ministry are the following public institutions:\n* [[Fondo Nacional de Salud]] ({{lang-es|Fondo Nacional de Salud}}, [[FONASA]])\n* [[Public Health Institute of Chile]] ({{lang-es|Instituto de Salud P\u00fablica de Chile}}, ISP)\n* [[Center for Supply]] ({{lang-es|Central de Abastecimiento}}, CENABAST)\n* The Health Services in each [[Regions of Chile|region]] of the country are charges with the coordination, management, and development of the assistance networks and execution of the ministry's action.\n\n==Titulars==\n\n===Ministers of Hygiene, Social Assistance and Welfare===\n<center>\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0;

It is owned by a social trust. ''La Presse'' was a broadsheet daily published seven days a week. Its Sunday edition was discontinued in 2009, and the weekday edition in 2016. The weekend Saturday printed edition was discontinued on 31 December 2017, turning ''La Presse'' into an entirely digital newspaper marketed as La Presse+ (pronounced La Presse Plus). La Presse is also available on the web: lapresse.ca as well as on mobile: La Presse Mobile.\n\n==Description==\n''La Presse'' is a digital newspaper as well as a [[website]] and a mobile app, aimed at an educated, [[middle-class]] readership. Its main competitor is the daily [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al]]'', which aims at a more populist audience. ''La Presse'' comprises several sections, dealing individually with arts, sports, business and economy and other themes. Its Saturday print edition (now discontinued) contained over 10 sections.\n\nThe newspaper's website, '''''www.lapresse.ca''''', operates as a company-wide portal which publishes news and editorial content.\n\n==History==\n[[File:La Presse 2011.jpg|thumb|left|''La Presse'' offices in [[Old Montreal]]. The black plate to the right of the door shows the logo used from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. The logo over the door was used from the late 1980s until the 1990s.]]\nThe paper was founded on October 20, 1884 by William-Edmond Blumhart. [[Treffl\u00e9 Berthiaume]] took over in 1889. The fledgling newspaper's [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] would soon pass that of its main competitor of the time, ''[[La Patrie (Canadian newspaper)|La Patrie]]''.\n\nIn April 1901, the paper organized a [[Cruising (maritime)|cruise]] to [[Quebec City]] (''Croisi\u00e8re de La Presse''). It also organized a [[Charitable organization|charity]] to give [[Christmas]] gifts to poor children (''L'Oeuvre des \u00e9trennes aux enfants pauvres'').\n\nA front-page illustration on December 3, 1904 issue celebrated the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the [[dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. The practice of the time was to have an illustration on the front page, rather than a photograph.\n\nThe style and presentation have changed immensely during the course of the 20th century. It underwent a complete graphic remodelling in 1986, and again in 2003.\n\nFrom 1984 to 2014, ''La Presse'' every year honoured a \"Person of the Year,\" for example,    [[Julie Payette]], [[Daniel Langlois]] and [[Ga\u00e9tan Boucher]]. In 1984, it also published a commemorative book in order to celebrate its 100th anniversary. A similar book was published by ''[[\u00c9ditions La Presse]]'' to recap the major events of the 20th century.\n\nIn 2001, with the arrival of news editor [[Guy Crevier]], the newspaper began a radical remodelling.<ref name=paperwar>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/paper-war-spurs-lurid-reporting/article773121/ \"Paper war spurs lurid reporting\"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', October 17, 2003.</ref> The graphic design was modernized, new sections were created, international coverage was greatly increased,<ref name=paperwar/> and many new young, up-and-coming journalists were hired. These changes had a significant positive impact on quality and circulation, to the point that the paper is now considered a rival to ''[[Le Devoir]]'' for the title of Quebec's [[newspaper of record]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2008/10/10/f-electionquebecvoices.html |title=Endorsements, opinions flourish in Quebec|date=October 10, 2008|work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, ''La Presse'' was chosen as the flagship brand and leveraged on all media platforms. Cyberpresse.ca becomes LaPresse.ca.\n\nIn 2013, ''La Presse'' launched ''La Presse+'', an all-new free digital edition for iPad that redefined the way users get their information.\n\nThe newspaper announced in September 2015 that it would end its weekday print edition in 2016 and that thereafter the weekday paper would be available only in digital form.<ref>Filloux, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric [http://www.mondaynote.com/2016/01/11/inside-la-presse-decisive-and-final-move-to-digital/ Inside La Presse+ Decisive and Final Move to Digital] ''Monday Note''.

It is owned by a social trust. ''La Presse'' was a broadsheet daily published seven days a week. Its Sunday edition was discontinued in 2009, and the weekday edition in 2016. The weekend Saturday printed edition was discontinued on 31 December 2017, turning ''La Presse'' into an entirely digital newspaper marketed as La Presse+ (pronounced La Presse Plus). La Presse is also available on the web: lapresse.ca as well as on mobile: La Presse Mobile.\n\n==Description==\n''La Presse'' is a digital newspaper as well as a [[web site]] and a mobile app, aimed at an educated, [[middle-class]] readership. Its main competitor is the daily [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] ''[[Le Journal de Montr\u00e9al]]'', which aims at a more populist audience. ''La Presse'' comprises several sections, dealing individually with arts, sports, business and economy and other themes. Its Saturday print edition (now discontinued) contained over 10 sections.\n\nThe newspaper's website, '''''www.lapresse.ca''''', operates as a company-wide portal which publishes news and editorial content.\n\n==History==\n[[File:La Presse 2011.jpg|thumb|left|''La Presse'' offices in [[Old Montreal]]. The black plate to the right of the door shows the logo used from the 1960s until the mid-1980s. The logo over the door was used from the late 1980s until the 1990s.]]\nThe paper was founded on October 20, 1884 by William-Edmond Blumhart. [[Treffl\u00e9 Berthiaume]] took over in 1889. The fledgling newspaper's [[Newspaper circulation|circulation]] would soon pass that of its main competitor of the time, ''[[La Patrie (Canadian newspaper)|La Patrie]]''.\n\nIn April 1901, the paper organized a [[Cruising (maritime)|cruise]] to [[Quebec City]] (''Croisi\u00e8re de La Presse''). It also organized a [[Charitable organization|charity]] to give [[Christmas]] gifts to poor children (''L'Oeuvre des \u00e9trennes aux enfants pauvres'').\n\nA front-page illustration on December 3, 1904 issue celebrated the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of the [[dogma]] of the [[Immaculate Conception]]. The practice of the time was to have an illustration on the front page, rather than a photograph.\n\nThe style and presentation have changed immensely during the course of the 20th century. It underwent a complete graphic remodelling in 1986, and again in 2003.\n\nFrom 1984 to 2014, ''La Presse'' every year honoured a \"Person of the Year,\" for example,    [[Julie Payette]], [[Daniel Langlois]] and [[Ga\u00e9tan Boucher]]. In 1984, it also published a commemorative book in order to celebrate its 100th anniversary. A similar book was published by ''[[\u00c9ditions La Presse]]'' to recap the major events of the 20th century.\n\nIn 2001, with the arrival of news editor [[Guy Crevier]], the newspaper began a radical remodelling.<ref name=paperwar>[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/rob-commentary/paper-war-spurs-lurid-reporting/article773121/ \"Paper war spurs lurid reporting\"]. ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', October 17, 2003.</ref> The graphic design was modernized, new sections were created, international coverage was greatly increased,<ref name=paperwar/> and many new young, up-and-coming journalists were hired. These changes had a significant positive impact on quality and circulation, to the point that the paper is now considered a rival to ''[[Le Devoir]]'' for the title of Quebec's [[newspaper of record]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2008/10/10/f-electionquebecvoices.html |title=Endorsements, opinions flourish in Quebec|date=October 10, 2008|work=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2011, ''La Presse'' was chosen as the flagship brand and leveraged on all media platforms. Cyberpresse.ca becomes LaPresse.ca.\n\nIn 2013, ''La Presse'' launched ''La Presse+'', an all-new free digital edition for iPad that redefined the way users get their information.\n\nThe newspaper announced in September 2015 that it would end its weekday print edition in 2016 and that thereafter the weekday paper would be available only in digital form.<ref>Filloux, Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric [http://www.mondaynote.com/2016/01/11/inside-la-presse-decisive-and-final-move-to-digital/ Inside La Presse+ Decisive and Final Move to Digital] ''Monday Note''.
