Thus, while the Charity Lodge emerged the great majority of Castro Madriz's ministers, after the schism that arose in this Lodge and the emergence of Fraternal Union, the opposition to Castro Madriz consisted largely of members of the latter, many of whom supported his overthrowing. During the de facto government of [[Jes\u00fas Jim\u00e9nez Zamora]] that toppled Castro Madriz on November 1, 1868, anti-Masonic arguments were used to justify the defenestration, as for example, that was going to destroy the Cathedral and that would ban the [[catholic religion]].<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> Jim\u00e9nez persecuted freemasonry and during its brief mandate its activities would be prohibited. But as a liberal he did not repelled many of Castro's reforms, for example, the educational reform was maintained and even included in the [[Constitution of Costa Rica|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nJim\u00e9nez Zamora would be an ephemeral dictator, since he himself would be overthrown about a year after his coming to power and most of the coup leaders who took him from power were Masons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] takes power and calls a [[Constituent Assembly]] that drafts the Constitution of 1871. Among its members were Masons Manuel Aragon, [[Aniceto Esquivel]], [[Luis Diego S\u00e1enz Carazo|Luis Diego S\u00e1enz]], Cipriano Mu\u00f1oz, Andr\u00e9s S\u00e1enz, [[Alejandro Alvarado Garc\u00eda]] (members of the Charity Lodge) and Bernardino Alvarado (Pacific Flower Lodge).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> In general, during the controversial authoritarian government of Guardia there would be countless political struggles between liberal and Masonic factions. Just as in [[Guatemala]] there would be different liberal and secular factions, some more militant and anti-clerical (led by the Mason, General [[Justo Rufino Barrios]]), and others more civil and democratic (like that of the Mason [[Lorenzo Mont\u00fafar y Rivera|Lorenzo Mont\u00fafar]] exiled in Costa Rica). After the death of Guardia, his close associate [[Saturnino Lizano Guti\u00e9rrez|Saturnino Lizano]] (also a Mason)<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> took over for a couple of months. [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno|Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez]], a liberal soldier, of the Union Fraternal Lodge, obtains the presidency by electoral route and assumes it on August 10, 1882. With his government seems to end the bitter intra-Masonic struggles and gives a decided boost to the liberal and secular ideas and principles.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> He will continue his liberal work a young rebel student, and then his son-in-law, [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro|Bernardo Soto]]. The controversy over the liberal project is not long in coming, in front of the popular Germany-born Archbishop Monsignor Bernardo Augusto Thiel.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nFrom 1865 to 1870 of 31 deputies, 28 were Masons, 10 judges of the Supreme Court of Justice 9 belonged to Freemasonry, as well as 15 of 16 ministers and 6 presidents of the period were 5.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nThe number of freemasons in public office is decreasing with time, for the parliamentary period from 1864 to 1866 only 4 of 22 deputies would be Freemasons (18%). Between 1864 and 1900 the number of Freemasons in the Parliament would range between 14% (1866-1868 and 1872-1874) to 34% (1884-1886).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> These percentages seem to disprove the accusations made by Catholic publications of the time such as ''Eco Cat\u00f3lico'' where they affirmed that 90% of the deputies were freemasons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nWhere they did have much more space was in the Executive Power, from 1865 to 1906 presidents [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Madriz]], [[Bruno Carranza]], [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] (although he would retire later), [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pinto Castro]], [[Salvador Lara Zamora]], [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno]], [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] and [[Ascensi\u00f3n Esquivel Ibarra]] were Freemasons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> During their governments their cabinets would be made up of a number of freemasons that would range between 58% (Esquivel administration) to 86% (Guardia's).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> In any case, the situation would change from 1899 with the consecutive conservative governments of [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n]] (1890-1894) and his son-in-law [[Rafael Yglesias]] (1894-1902), under whose governments there seemed to be no influence of Freemasonry or important ministers belonging to it.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nDuring the historical period from 1865 to 1899, a series of [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Secularization|secularizing]] political reforms began in Costa Rica that promoted [[Liberalism|liberal ideas]] embraced by the social highclass of the time. Many of these liberal reforms that would shape the country were promoted by followers of Costa Rican Freemasonry.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nThis would cause that for the 20th century Freemasonry would be homologated with liberalism and they would be seen as consubstantial with one another.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> On this would say the archbishop of San Jos\u00e9 Monsignor V\u00edctor Manuel Sanabria Mart\u00ednez:\n\n{{quote|Freemasonry was among us the organized group of the liberaler\u00eda [sic], was the instrument of expression of liberalism, freemasonry was trumpet of liberalism, and also political body, Freemasonry is a purely [[capitalist]] instrument.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />}}\n\nHowever, during the nineteenth century relations between the Church and Masonry were always complex. The Costa Rican freemasons can not be identified as [[anticlerical]], in fact there is evidence that Catholic and Protestant priests were part of it and had good relations with the liberal clergy.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> However, it came into conflict with the local [[Catholic hierarchy]], led by Bishop Bernardo Augusto Thiel, who was an opponent of the [[Liberal State|liberal government]],<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> for which he was expelled from the country (along with the [[Jesuits]]) during the administration of Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez and his newspaper ''Eco Cat\u00f3lico'' closed.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> The expulsion of Thiel caused in turn the temporary separation of Calvo from his position as priest, as Calvo was considered co-conspirator with the government and guilty for the introduction of Freemasonry in Costa Rica, although Calvo himself had been retired from masonic activities for that moment for nine years.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n[[File:Brenes, Roberto.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Roberto Brenes Mes\u00e9n]], writer and poet, known Mason and Theosophist.]]\nAfter the death of Fernandez, his son-in-law, Bernardo Soto, nicknamed \"Great Protector of the Masonic Order\", came to power. Soto through the intercession of Calvo would allow the return of Thiel to the country who seemed to start making peace with Freemasonry.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> Naturally, under the government of Soto the freemasons would be part of his cabinet in large numbers.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nIn 1889 arose the conservative Catholic and [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] [[Catholic Union (Costa Rica)|Catholic Union Party]], which began a fierce anti-Masonic campaign homologoating the organization with [[Satanism]] and describing it as an [[anti-Christian]] cult.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> Catholic newspapers of the time also sought to associate Freemasonry with other hostile currents of thought to the Church, thus ''Eco Catolico'' associated it with [[atheism]] and [[materialism]], while the Catholic leadership linked it with [[Protestantism]] and affirmed that both had the same origin and the same goal; the destruction of the Church.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nAs in other nations, the association of Freemasonry with [[Judaism]] could not be absent. According to Ricardo Martinez,<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> in the official newspaper of the Catholic Union Party wrote:\n\n{{quote|... it has been organized and receives its entire address from the Jews, at least in its highest and most secret part. Freemasonry, as a writer says, is the flesh and bone of [[Talmud]]ism|(''La Uni\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica'', 22 February 1891)}}\n\nFor the [[1889 Costa Rican general election|1889 election]], the first in which political parties took part, Freemasons Bernardo Soto and Ascensi\u00f3n Esquivel form the historical [[Liberal Progressive Party (Costa Rica, 1889)|Liberal Progressive Party]] that faces the conservative [[Constitutional Party (Costa Rica)|Democratic Constitutional Party]] that postulates Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n who has support from the Church. The progressive liberals are defeated in that process and the Constitutional Party, whose only function was to prevent the triumph of Esquivel, is dissolved. For the subsequent [[1894 Costa Rican general election|elections of 1894]], Rodriguez had already broken his clerical ties and promoted the candidacy of his son-in-law Rafael Yglesias, who was facing the newly founded Catholic Union that nominated Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Trejos Guti\u00e9rrez and faced all kinds of obstacles from the government, including the arrest of your candidate. By this time also the Independent Democratic Party of the freemason [[Felix Arcadio Montero Monge]]<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> is founded.\n\nYglesias and Esquivel founded the [[National Union Party (Costa Rica)|National Union Party]] for the [[1902 Costa Rican general election|1902 election]], which was dubbed by the Catholic Union as the \"Masonic Party\"<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> despite the fact that Esquivel had already left Masonry by this time and there is no formal record that Yglesias ever was a Mason.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Povedano de Arcos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tom\u00e1s Povedano]], Spanish-born Costa Rican painter and Freemason.]]\nCosta Rican freemasonry would have an important weight in the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]] in Costa Rica in 1904.

During the presidency of Castro would carry out an important general education reform that included public education funded by the State from the primary education for both sexes and with academic freedom.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nThis promotion of liberal ideas that included the [[freedom of expression]], [[Freedom of conscience|of conscience]] and the [[Freedom of thought|free debate of ideas]] promoted during the government of Castro Madriz began to alarm the [[Catholic Church in Costa Rica|Catholic Church]], which is why the first Bishop of Costa Rica Monsignor Anselmo Llorente y la Fuente is compelled to issue several condemnations to Freemasonry based on the respective papal encyclicals and reaffirms the need of the Church to guide the consciences of the people to avoid [[Godlessness]].<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n[[File:Bernardo Soto Alfaro.JPG|thumb|left|[[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] [[president of Costa Rica]], liberal and mason, proclaimed \u00abGranf Protector of the Masonic Order in Costa Rica\u00bb.]]\n\nThe differences between lodges also seemed to have an impact on the creation of political factions. Thus, while the Charity Lodge emerged the great majority of Castro Madriz's ministers, after the schism that arose in this Lodge and the emergence of Fraternal Union, the opposition to Castro Madriz consisted largely of members of the latter, many of whom supported his overthrowing. During the de facto government of [[Jes\u00fas Jim\u00e9nez Zamora]] that toppled Castro Madriz on November 1, 1868, anti-Masonic arguments were used to justify the defenestration, as for example, that was going to destroy the Cathedral and that would ban the [[catholic religion]].<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> Jim\u00e9nez persecuted freemasonry and during its brief mandate its activities would be prohibited. But as a liberal he did not repelled many of Castro's reforms, for example, the educational reform was maintained and even included in the [[Constitution of Costa Rica|Constitution]].<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nJim\u00e9nez Zamora would be an ephemeral dictator, since he himself would be overthrown about a year after his coming to power and most of the coup leaders who took him from power were Masons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] takes power and calls a [[Constituent Assembly]] that drafts the Constitution of 1871. Among its members were Masons Manuel Aragon, [[Aniceto Esquivel]], [[Luis Diego S\u00e1enz Carazo|Luis Diego S\u00e1enz]], Cipriano Mu\u00f1oz, Andr\u00e9s S\u00e1enz, [[Alejandro Alvarado Garc\u00eda]] (members of the Charity Lodge) and Bernardino Alvarado (Pacific Flower Lodge).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> In general, during the controversial authoritarian government of Guardia there would be countless political struggles between liberal and Masonic factions. Just as in [[Guatemala]] there would be different liberal and secular factions, some more militant and anti-clerical (led by the Mason, General [[Justo Rufino Barrios]]), and others more civil and democratic (like that of the Mason [[Lorenzo Mont\u00fafar y Rivera|Lorenzo Mont\u00fafar]] exiled in Costa Rica). After the death of Guardia, his close associate [[Saturnino Lizano Guti\u00e9rrez|Saturnino Lizano]] (also a Mason)<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> took over for a couple of months. [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno|Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez]], a liberal soldier, of the Union Fraternal Lodge, obtains the presidency by electoral route and assumes it on August 10, 1882. With his government seems to end the bitter intra-Masonic struggles and gives a decided boost to the liberal and secular ideas and principles.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> He will continue his liberal work a young rebel student, and then his son-in-law, [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro|Bernardo Soto]]. The controversy over the liberal project is not long in coming, in front of the popular Germany-born Archbishop Monsignor Bernardo Augusto Thiel.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nFrom 1865 to 1870 of 31 deputies, 28 were Masons, 10 judges of the Supreme Court of Justice 9 belonged to Freemasonry, as well as 15 of 16 ministers and 6 presidents of the period were 5.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nThe number of freemasons in public office is decreasing with time, for the parliamentary period from 1864 to 1866 only 4 of 22 deputies would be Freemasons (18%). Between 1864 and 1900 the number of Freemasons in the Parliament would range between 14% (1866-1868 and 1872-1874) to 34% (1884-1886).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> These percentages seem to disprove the accusations made by Catholic publications of the time such as ''Eco Cat\u00f3lico'' where they affirmed that 90% of the deputies were freemasons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nWhere they did have much more space was in the Executive Power, from 1865 to 1906 presidents [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Castro Madriz]], [[Bruno Carranza]], [[Tom\u00e1s Guardia]] (although he would retire later), [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Pinto Castro]], [[Salvador Lara Zamora]], [[Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez Oreamuno]], [[Bernardo Soto Alfaro]] and [[Ascensi\u00f3n Esquivel Ibarra]] were Freemasons.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> During their governments their cabinets would be made up of a number of freemasons that would range between 58% (Esquivel administration) to 86% (Guardia's).<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> In any case, the situation would change from 1899 with the consecutive conservative governments of [[Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n]] (1890-1894) and his son-in-law [[Rafael Yglesias]] (1894-1902), under whose governments there seemed to be no influence of Freemasonry or important ministers belonging to it.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n\nDuring the historical period from 1865 to 1899, a series of [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Secularization|secularizing]] political reforms began in Costa Rica that promoted [[Liberalism|liberal ideas]] embraced by the social highclass of the time. Many of these liberal reforms that would shape the country were promoted by followers of Costa Rican Freemasonry.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nThis would cause that for the 20th century Freemasonry would be homologated with liberalism and they would be seen as consubstantial with one another.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> On this would say the archbishop of San Jos\u00e9 Monsignor V\u00edctor Manuel Sanabria Mart\u00ednez:\n\n{{quote|Freemasonry was among us the organized group of the liberaler\u00eda [sic], was the instrument of expression of liberalism, freemasonry was trumpet of liberalism, and also political body, Freemasonry is a purely [[capitalist]] instrument.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />}}\n\nHowever, during the nineteenth century relations between the Church and Masonry were always complex. The Costa Rican freemasons can not be identified as [[anticlerical]], in fact there is evidence that Catholic and Protestant priests were part of it and had good relations with the liberal clergy.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> However, it came into conflict with the local [[Catholic hierarchy]], led by Bishop Bernardo Augusto Thiel, who was an opponent of the [[Liberal State|liberal government]],<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> for which he was expelled from the country (along with the [[Jesuits]]) during the administration of Pr\u00f3spero Fern\u00e1ndez and his newspaper ''Eco Cat\u00f3lico'' closed.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> The expulsion of Thiel caused in turn the temporary separation of Calvo from his position as priest, as Calvo was considered co-conspirator with the government and guilty for the introduction of Freemasonry in Costa Rica, although Calvo himself had been retired from masonic activities for that moment for nine years.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n[[File:Brenes, Roberto.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Roberto Brenes Mes\u00e9n]], writer and poet, known Mason and Theosophist.]]\nAfter the death of Fernandez, his son-in-law, Bernardo Soto, nicknamed \"Great Protector of the Masonic Order\", came to power. Soto through the intercession of Calvo would allow the return of Thiel to the country who seemed to start making peace with Freemasonry.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> Naturally, under the government of Soto the freemasons would be part of his cabinet in large numbers.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nIn 1889 arose the conservative Catholic and [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] [[Catholic Union (Costa Rica)|Catholic Union Party]], which began a fierce anti-Masonic campaign homologoating the organization with [[Satanism]] and describing it as an [[anti-Christian]] cult.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" /> Catholic newspapers of the time also sought to associate Freemasonry with other hostile currents of thought to the Church, thus ''Eco Catolico'' associated it with [[atheism]] and [[materialism]], while the Catholic leadership linked it with [[Protestantism]] and affirmed that both had the same origin and the same goal; the destruction of the Church.<ref name=\"Martinez2\" />\n\nAs in other nations, the association of Freemasonry with [[Judaism]] could not be absent. According to Ricardo Martinez,<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> in the official newspaper of the Catholic Union Party wrote:\n\n{{quote|... it has been organized and receives its entire address from the Jews, at least in its highest and most secret part. Freemasonry, as a writer says, is the flesh and bone of [[Talmud]]ism|(''La Uni\u00f3n Cat\u00f3lica'', 22 February 1891)}}\n\nFor the [[1889 Costa Rican general election|1889 election]], the first in which political parties took part, Freemasons Bernardo Soto and Ascensi\u00f3n Esquivel form the historical [[Liberal Progressive Party (Costa Rica, 1889)|Liberal Progressive Party]] that faces the conservative [[Constitutional Party (Costa Rica)|Democratic Constitutional Party]] that postulates Jos\u00e9 Joaqu\u00edn Rodr\u00edguez Zeled\u00f3n who has support from the Church. The progressive liberals are defeated in that process and the Constitutional Party, whose only function was to prevent the triumph of Esquivel, is dissolved. For the subsequent [[1894 Costa Rican general election|elections of 1894]], Rodriguez had already broken his clerical ties and promoted the candidacy of his son-in-law Rafael Yglesias, who was facing the newly founded Catholic Union that nominated Jos\u00e9 Gregorio Trejos Guti\u00e9rrez and faced all kinds of obstacles from the government, including the arrest of your candidate. By this time also the Independent Democratic Party of the freemason [[Felix Arcadio Montero Monge]]<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> is founded.\n\nYglesias and Esquivel founded the [[National Union Party (Costa Rica)|National Union Party]] for the [[1902 Costa Rican general election|1902 election]], which was dubbed by the Catholic Union as the \"Masonic Party\"<ref name=\"Martinez1\" /> despite the fact that Esquivel had already left Masonry by this time and there is no formal record that Yglesias ever was a Mason.<ref name=\"Martinez1\" />\n[[File:Tom\u00e1s Povedano de Arcos.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tom\u00e1s Povedano]], Spansih-born Costa Rican painter and Freemason.]]\nCosta Rican freemasonry would have an important weight in the founding of the [[Theosophical Society]] in Costa Rica in 1904.
