Retrieved on 2012-08-24.</ref> In 1868, at the age of 20, he started his [[Law]] studies at the [[Leiden University]] in [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"branden\"/> Emants complied with his father's wish to study Law, until his father's death in 1871.<ref name=\"vanbork\"/>\n\nEmants did well at university, but his heart lay with the arts, not with legal matters. Initially he could not choose between music ([[cello]]), drawing, [[theatre]] and [[literature]]. He avoided the student scene in the Dutch university town of [[Leiden]], but founded a literary club, Quatuor, with a few friends from [[The Hague]]. His first publication would feature in the club\u2019s magazine.\n\nAfter his father\u2019s death, he became financially independent, broke off his studies and took to travelling the world. He seemed better at ease in the [[Alps]] than in the lowlands and as a result made yearly trips to the former. In Quatuor\u2019s successor, Spar en Hulst (Pine and Holly) he wrote an essay entitled ''Bergkristal van Oberammergau'' (''Mountain crystal of Oberammergua'') in 1872 about the [[Passion plays]] which he had attended there. He himself was a bit surprised about the attention which his text had attracted, but kept on travelling and developed a genre of \u2018travel account which is much more than a travel account.\u2019 (Busken Huet)\n\nAlthough he shared the ''Tachtigers''' vision of the arts' autonomy, Emants kept outside of their group, as he felt he could not participate in their elaborate use of language: \u2018I have always wanted to aspire to, if I was reading a book, noticing the words as little as possible.\u2019<ref>E. d'Oliveira: ''De mannen van '80 aan het woord. Een onderzoek naar enkele beginselen van de 'Nieuwe Gids'-school''. Amsterdam, 1920.</ref> Despite this ideal, he would still be called \u2018the [[Johannes Baptista]] of modern literature' by [[Willem Kloos]], who was one of the leading figures of the 1880s.<ref>''De Nieuwe Gids'', 1888</ref>\n\nEmants kept a sober style and a subject which was idealistically pessimistic. His examples were [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]], with the latter even keeping correspondence.\n\nHe was vice-president of the \u2018Vereniging tot vereenvoudiging van onze spelling\u2019 (Society for the Simplification of our Spelling) and wrote 'Een nagelaten bekentenis' (1894); English: ''[[A Posthumous Confession]]'' (English translation: [[J.M. Coetzee]], 1976; reissued 2011). He attended the state commission for the reform of Dutch spelling as well, which did not succeed in its set-up however. 11 long years after his death, though, Minister of Education Marchant would still implement the proposals made by this commission anyway.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Emants felt locked up within the Netherlands and when [[Armistice]] was finally there, he made preparations to go and establish himself in Switzerland. On 2 March 1920, he finally left The Hague forever and stayed in Switzerland alternatingly in [[hotels]], [[spa]] towns and [[sanatoria]]. Almost immediately he was struck by [[shingles]], followed by a few [[strokes]]. He died on 20 October 1923 in the Grand H\u00f4tel in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] and was interred in The Hague on the General Cemetery.\n\n===Family===\nMarcellus Emants was married three times. A first time to Christina Magdalena Prins, a distant cousin, in 1873. He was sadly widowed two years after the marriage, in 1875. Then he married Eva Vemiers van der Loef on 10 July 1880. She published a novel in 1887 under the pseudonym Nessuno: ''Beemsen Esquire'' and died in 1900. On 5 July 1904, he married the German actress Jenny K\u00fchn. Although the marriage was a disaster, they did have a daughter Eva Clara Jenny whom he adored and spoilt. She would later call herself Lillith after a work of his from 1879.\n\n==References==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n* F.

Retrieved on 2012-08-24.</ref> In 1868, at the age of 20, he started his [[Law]] studies at the [[Leiden University]] in [[Leiden]].<ref name=\"branden\"/> Emants complied with his father's wish to study Law, until his father's death in 1871.<ref name=\"vanbork\"/>\n\nEmants did well at university, but his heart lay with the arts, not with legal matters. Initially he could not choose between music ([[cello]]), drawing, [[theatre]] and [[literature]]. He avoided the student scene in the Dutch university town of [[Leiden]], but founded a literary club, Quatuor, with a few friends from [[The Hague]]. His first publication would feature in the club\u2019s magazine.\n\nAfter his father\u2019s death, he became financially independent, broke off his studies and took to travelling the world. He seemed better at ease in the [[Alps]] than in the lowlands and as a result made yearly trips to the former. In Quatuor\u2019s successor, Spar en Hulst (Pine and Holly) he wrote an essay entitled ''Bergkristal van Oberammergau'' (''Mountain crystal of Oberammergua'') in 1872 about the [[Passion plays]] which he had attended there. He himself was a bit surprised about the attention which his text had attracted, but kept on travelling and developed a genre of \u2018travel account which is much more than a travel account.\u2019 (Busken Huet)\n\nAlthough he shared the ''Tachtigers''' vision of the arts' autonomy, Emants kept outside of their group, as he felt he could not participate in their elaborate use of language: \u2018I have always wanted to aspire to, if I was reading a book, noticing the words as little as possible.\u2019<ref>E. d'Oliveira: ''De mannen van '80 aan het woord. Een onderzoek naar enkele beginselen van de 'Nieuwe Gids'-school''. Amsterdam, 1920.</ref> Despite this ideal, he would still be called \u2018the [[Johannes Baptista]] of modern literature' by [[Willem Kloos]], who was one of the leading figures of the 1880s.<ref>''De Nieuwe Gids'', 1888</ref>\n\nEmants kept a sober style and a subject which was idealistically pessimistic. His examples were [[\u00c9mile Zola]], [[Hippolyte Taine]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]], with the latter even keeping correspondence.\n\nHe was vice-president of the \u2018Vereniging tot vereenvoudiging van onze spelling\u2019 (Society for the Simplification of our Spelling) and wrote 'Een nagelaten bekentenis' (1894); English: ''[[A Posthumous Confession]]'' (English translation: [[J.M. Coetzee]], 1976; reissued 2011). He attended the state commission for the reform of Dutch spelling as well, which did not succeed in its set-up however. 11 long years after his death, though, Minister of Education Marchant would still implement the proposals made by this commission anyway.\n\nDuring the [[First World War]], Emants felt locked up within the Netherlands and when [[Armistice]] was finally there, he made preparations to go and establish himself in Switzerland. On 2 March 1920, he finally left The Hague forever and stayed in Switzerland alternatingly in [[hotels]], [[spa]] towns and [[sanatoria]]. Almost immediately he was struck by [[shingles]], followed by a few [[strokes]]. He died on 20 October 1923 in the Grand H\u00f4tel in [[Baden, Switzerland|Baden]] and was interred in The Hague on the General Cemetery.\n\n===Family===\nMarcellus Emants was married three times. A first time to Christina Magdalena Prins, a distant cousin, in 1873. He was sadly widowed two years after the marriage, in 1875. Then he married Eva Vemiers van der Loef on 10 July 1880. She published a novel in 1887 under the pseudonym Nessuno: ''Beemsen Esquire'' and died in 1900. On 5 July 1904, he married the German actress Jenny K\u00fchn. Although the marriage was a disaster, they did have a daughter Eva Clara Jenny whom he adored and spoilt. She would later call herself Lillith after a work of his from 1879.\n\n==References==\n<!--- See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes on how to create references using <ref></ref> tags which will then appear here automatically -->\n{{Reflist}}\n* F.

Originally a [[corporate lawyer]], Yang began working in various [[startups]] and [[venture capital financing|early stage growth companies]] as a founder or executive from 2000 to 2009. In 2011, he founded [[Venture for America]] (VFA), a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on creating jobs in cities struggling to recover from the [[Great Recession]]. He then ran as a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]]. \n\nThe son of immigrants from [[Taiwan]], Yang grew up in [[New York (state)|New York]]. He attended [[Brown University]] and then [[Columbia Law School]]. Dissatisfied with his work as an attorney, Yang began working for various startups during the [[dot-com bubble]] before spending a decade as an executive at [[test preparation]] company [[Manhattan Prep]], which was acquired in 2009. In 2011, Yang founded VFA, which recruits top college graduates into a two-year fellowship program at startups in developing cities across the United States. The [[Obama administration]] selected him in 2011 as a \"[[Champion of Change]]\" and in 2015 as a \"[[Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship]]\". Yang left VFA in 2017 to focus on his [[Andrew Yang 2020 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]]. In 2018, he authored ''[[The War on Normal People]]'', which outlines several of his campaign's central ideas.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) to run for President in the 2020 election. Yang's campaign largely focused on responding to the rapid development of [[automation]], which is increasingly leading to [[workforce]] challenges and economic instability in the [[United States]]. His signature policy is the \"[[Freedom Dividend]],\" a [[universal basic income]] (UBI) of $1,000 a month to every American adult, a response to [[technological unemployment|job displacement by automation]], one of the primary factors that he claims led to [[Donald Trump]]'s election in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].

Originally a [[corporate lawyer]], Yang began working in various [[startups]] and [[venture capital financing|early stage growth companies]] as a founder or executive from 2000 to 2009. In 2011, he founded [[Venture for America]] (VFA), a [[nonprofit organization]] focused on creating jobs in cities struggling to recover from the [[Great Recession]]. He then ran as a candidate in the [[2020 Democratic presidential primaries]]. \n\nThe son of immigrants from [[Taiwan]], Yang grew up in [[New York (state)|New York]]. He attended [[Brown University]] and then [[Columbia Law School]]. Dissatisfied with his work as an attorney, Yang began working for various startups during the [[dot-com bubble]] before spending a decade as an executive at [[test preparation]] company [[Manhattan Prep]], which was acquired in 2009. In 2011, Yang founded VFA, which recruits top college graduates into a two-year fellowship program at startups in developing cities across the United States. The [[Obama administration]] selected him in 2011 as a \"[[Champion of Change]]\" and in 2015 as a \"[[Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship]]\". Yang left VFA in 2017 to focus on his [[Andrew Yang 2020 presidential campaign|presidential campaign]]. In 2018, he authored ''[[The War on Normal People]]'', which outlines several of his campaign's central ideas.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, Yang filed with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) to run for President in the 2020 election. Yang's campaign largely focused on responding to the rapid development of [[automation]], which is increasingly leading to [[workforce]] challenges and economic instability in the [[United States]]. His signature policy is the \"[[Freedom Dividend]],\" a [[universal basic income]] (UBI) of $1,000 a month to every American adult, a response to [[technological unemployment|job displacement by automation]], one of the primary factors that he claims led to [[Donald Trump]]'s election in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. Considered a [[dark horse]] candidate throughout much of the primary, Yang received unanticipated national attention, as well as significant popularity online, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' calling him \"The Internet's Favorite Candidate\". Yang qualified for and participated in seven of the first eight [[2020 Democratic Party presidential debates|Democratic debates]], and has been credited with elevating discussions on UBI, automation, and [[Societal and cultural aspects of autism|autism]] to the national level,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inverse.com/innovation/why-basic-income-wont-die-with-andrew-yangs-campaign|title=Why Basic Income Won't Die With Yang's Campaign|last=Brown|first=Mike|date=February 12, 2020|website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]]|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/01/02/793142027/how-andrew-yangs-personal-experience-with-autism-is-shaping-his-policy-proposals|title=How Andrew Yang's Personal Experience With Autism Is Shaping His Policy Proposals|last=Kelly|first=Mary Louise|date=February 12, 2020|website=[[NPR]]|access-date=February 12, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/andrew-yang-drops-out-in-new-hampshire-his-ideas-survive.html|title=Yang Is Out.
