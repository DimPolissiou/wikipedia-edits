B. Grover) and artist [[Carlos Ezquerra]] for ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', a short-lived weekly science fiction comic, in [[1978 in comics|1978]]. When ''Starlord'' was cancelled, the series transferred to ''2000 AD''. In [[1980 in comics|1980]], Wagner was joined by co-writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series solo from [[1988 in comics|1988]] to [[1990 in comics|1990]]. After Ezquerra's death in October 2018 the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation.\n\n==Series background==\nThe premise of the series is that the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wiped out 70% of Britain's population and led to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout ([[strontium-90]]). The mutants faced a high degree of racism, similar to that faced by the Jewish population of Nazi Germany. Laws were passed forbidding mutants from owning businesses and segregating them into [[ghetto]]s such as a giant mutant settlement at Milton Keynes.\n\nFollowing the end of this storyline, in 2180, one of the few jobs left for mutants is that of [[bounty hunter]], a job considered too dangerous for normal humans. The strongest of mutants hunt down criminals throughout the galaxy for the Search/Destroy agency, whose distinctive SD badges give them the nickname Strontium Dogs. The SD agents operate from an orbiting space station known as ''The Doghouse''.\n\nThe mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|usual depiction]] of mutants in American comics, such as those published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], in that they are generally afflicted with severe physical deformities and only rarely granted with [[superhuman]] powers. Often this leads to humour and character names being puns, as Spider-Dan in the ''[[Middenface McNulty#Young Middenface|Young Middenface]]'' spin-off and skull-faced Welsh mutant Dai the Death in ''Strontium Dog: Traitor To His Kind''.\n\nEven by the standards of ''2000 AD'', ''Strontium Dog'' plotlines can be bizarre. In one story, Alpha travels to an alternate dimension that passes for [[Hell]]. In another, he is sent by time machine to 1945 to arrest [[Adolf Hitler]]. There is a bleak, minimalistic edge to the series at times reminiscent of [[spaghetti westerns]].\n\n===Earth===\n\nEarth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain \u2013 Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than ''[[Judge Dredd]]'s'' [[Brit-Cit]] by the same writers, but contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include [[Salisbury]] (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch & [[Bournemouth]] (now a combined [[conurbation]]), Cardiff, [[Isles of Scilly]], and [[Winchester]]. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. In the sequel series ''Strontium Dogs'', it was stated that Britain had a large empire of outer-space colonies.\n\nThe mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Later stories like ''Traitor To His Kind'' would reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter) are attempting to slowly improve the mutants' lot, but much of this goes unnoticed behind the scenes; many other figures in the government want to go back to greater oppression or attempted extermination.\n\nIn ''The Final Solution'', the government was usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first ''Strontium Dogs'' story had it that after the destruction of the New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. ''Crossroads'', in prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six \"minor wars\", and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government.\n\nIreland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the United States of America and Canada were both visited in ''The Mork Whisperer'' (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic was shown in ''The Final Solution''. Antarctica was the setting of part of ''Outlaw'', shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre was Antarctic City (also the name of a [[Mega-City One|megacity]] in Judge Dredd), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic [[Militia]].\n\n==Johnny Alpha==\nThe ''Strontium Dogs'' storyline focuses on John Alpha, whose mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing [[Adolf Hitler]] to the future to face trial. His legendary career and his assistance to mutants in trouble - such as donating a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in \"Mutie's Luck\" - have made him an icon to Earth's mutants. He is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter.\n\nA dogged bounty hunter, Johnny never gives up in the pursuit of his quarry. While he does work for money, he possesses a conscience and will often take a job, forego payment or sometimes drop a job entirely: in \"The Doc Quince Case\", he immediately relented and rescued a man he'd hunted down, and in \"The Slavers of Drule\" he took an assignment to track down a group of slavers because he felt it was the right  thing to do. He also can be extremely vengeful when angered, as shown by his actions towards Nelson Kreelman and Max Bubba.\n\nHe is the son of Nelson Bunker Kreelman, a bigoted politician who drafted the anti-mutant laws and gained power on the back of bigotry. Despised, abused and hidden away by his father, Johnny escaped at a young age and joined the Mutant Army, becoming one of its key leaders by age 17 and playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167. He never revealed the identity of his father, changing his name from Kreelman to Alpha.\n\nHe has a \"norm\" sister called Ruth, who is married and has a husband (Nigel) and daughter. She and her family have traditionally been friendly to Johnny; she even helped him escape and caused Nelson Kreelman's blackmail during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. However, after her daughter was abducted and almost killed by a criminal looking for revenge on Johnny, she forbade him from coming near her family again.\n\nAlpha has a norm half-brother, the son of Nelson Kreelman by an affair, called Nelson Culliver, who after the war became head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In \"Traitor to His Kind\", Culliver tried to have Alpha murdered, but was exposed and fired from his job. Alpha decided to assassinate him, but relented on meeting his children.\n\n===Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities===\nLike all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology including a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified [[brass knuckles]], a short-range [[Teleportation|teleporter]], a \"time [[drogue]]\" that can briefly \"rewind\" the last few minutes of time, and \"time bombs\" which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved along in its orbit, so that the victim reappears in empty space).\n\nOver the years, Johnny Alpha's white, incandescent eyes have provided him with several mutant abilities. Most frequently, the high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people's minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents, or to \"suggest\" illusions or hallucinations (e.g., while fighting the Necromagus, Sabbat, Johnny made Sabbat believe the Grim Reaper was behind him).\n\n===Supporting cast===\n\nJohnny's original partner is '''Wulf Sternhammer''', who is not a mutant but a normal human from [[Scandinavia]]; he became a Strontium Dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy \"safe for decent people\".<ref>Starlord #1</ref> A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf was far less prone to doubt and introspection and tried to bring his friend back in line when he had doubts. Ever since ''Starlord'' #5, Wulf wore the fur pelt of a '''Gronk''' that he'd befriended - the alien's custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acted a lot like a stereotypical [[Viking]] and it was eventually [[retconned]] that he ''was'' a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time.\n\nEarly strips included the Gronk, the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It was a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist [[Blas Gallego]]). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its \"poor heartses\", and in \"Outlaw\" showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that \"the Gronk\" was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for \"the Gronk\". In the ''Strontium Dogs'' spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier.\n\nKing Clarkie the Second, a thinly veiled parody of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] was the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning.\n\nTwo allies who gained their own solo spin-off series were [[Middenface McNulty]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] mutant raised in a ghetto/concentration camp called 'Shytehill' - presumably a reference to the [[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]] area of Glasgow - and whose head is covered with lumps; and [[Durham Red]], a female agent whose mutation resembles [[Vampire|vampirism]] and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants.\n\nFeral, introduced in \"The Final Solution\", was a young, savage mutant. He initially despised the Strontium Dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but was inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnessed Alpha's sacrifice in \"The Final Solution\", and in the original \"Strontium Dogs\" strips of the 1990s, he became first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\", this was ignored and he became a SD Agent soon after \"The Final Solution\" \u2013 due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and became an outlaw who tried to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he was executed for murder on an alien world.\n\nIn both the original series and the revival Alpha frequently encountered or worked alongside members of a mutant family known as the Stix Clan. All members male and female are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from a single town called Stixville on the planet Freedonia and are highly hostile to any outsiders. They often appear as antagonist to Alpha but at times have worked alongside him, however they usually double cross and betray him at some point showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan.\n\nThe revival would introduce Negus, the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who would both hire Johnny and act as his Upminster contact. Negus was pushing for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus' position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate.\n\nFlashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny's life would introduce Precious Matson, a reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia. A competent and dogged reporter, she became friends with Johnny and helped him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In \"Life and Death\", she began investigating the true events of Johnny's death and, with McNulty's aid, was able to resurrect him.\n\nIn 2018 \u201cThe Son\u201d revealed that Wulf had had a son, Kenton Sternhammer, who joined the Search/Destroy Agency.\n\n===Date===\nThe first ''Strontium Dog'' stories in ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' were set in the year 2180. Later, the story \"Max Bubba\" gave the date 2185 (just as in the ''Judge Dredd'' stories by the same writers, the date progresses in real time). However, although the stories \"The No-Go Job\" and \"The Final Solution\" were said to take place two years after the events in \"Max Bubba,\" the date was again given as 2180. This discrepancy was repeated in the story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\" (written by [[Garth Ennis]]), which gave the date 2178 even though it was set after the events in \"Max Bubba.\"\n\nOccasionally, some one-episode stories which appeared in annuals and summer specials were set outside the range of dates given above, being set in different points of Alpha's life.\n\n==Major stories==\n\n===Original run===\n\n\"Portrait of a Mutant\", a flashback story in [[1981 in comics|1981]], filled in the background of the series and Johnny's role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army's leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny's sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman's son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending \"Portrait\", Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever.\n\nIn the story \"Outlaw\", Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot.\n\nIn the 1986 story \"Max Bubba\", a lengthy story explaining Wulf's origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic \"Rage\", in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner's killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with [[Durham Red]] or Scottish mutant [[Middenface McNulty]].\n\nJohnny was killed off in [[1990 in comics|1990]], sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman's illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny's final adventures were illustrated by [[Simon Harrison (comics)|Simon Harrison]] and [[Colin MacNeil]]. [[John Wagner]] later admitted in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'''s [[Thrill Power Overload]] feature on the history of the comic that \"killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I'm doing my best to rectify.\"<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', volume 4, issue 17, p. 49</ref> He later described it as \"one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.\"<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #377, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Post-death and ''Strontium Dogs''===\n\nThe medium of [[time travel]] allowed him to make further appearances. In the [[1991 in comics|1991]] ''[[Judge Dredd]] Annual'' John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew \"Top Dogs\", in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping [[Judge Dredd]]. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in [[1992 in comics|1992]] in the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", written by [[Garth Ennis]] and drawn mainly by Ezquerra.\n\nThe supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip ''Strontium Dogs'' in the 1990s, written by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Peter Hogan]]. It was criticised by Ennis in the book ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]'' as being anti-climactic and that the lead, Feral, \"was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny\". The series was scrapped when [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became [[Tharg the Mighty|''2000 AD'''s editor]]. The first story, ''Monster'' starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort \"liberation\" taxes from mutants (an allegory for [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, Ennis' home).\n\nEnnis would bring back the Gronk in ''Return of the Gronk'', turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who'd killed Alpha in ''The Darkest Star''. In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed \u2013 including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives \u2013 including, at his friend's request, Alpha himself, who couldn't live on in such excruciating pain.\n\nFrom prog 897, [[Peter Hogan]] became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to \"clean their dirty laundry for them\".\n\n[[Durham Red]] was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later [[Dan Abnett]]. This series continued after ''Strontium Dogs'' was cancelled.\n\n===Revival===\n\nIn the ''Prog 2000'' holiday special, published at the end of [[1999 in comics|1999]], Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny's death.\n\nThe first story, \"The Kreeler Conspiracy\", was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted ''Strontium Dog'' TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were 'folklore' and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after \"Conspiracy\", with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run.\n\nA subsequent story in 2004, \"Traitor To His Kind\" (progs 1406\u20131415), introduced Johnny's half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King's murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind.\n\nThe 2009 story ''Blood Moon'' retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi's bombing and executed him there.\n\n===''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha''===\n\nIn prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' which took place following ''The Final Solution''. The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny's death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the \"true\" story of what happened, and diverged from ''The Final Solution'' when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny's body had been brought ''back'' by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind).<ref>''2000 AD'' prog 1689</ref> Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be \"apologists and mutie-lovers\", ignoring ''Strontium Dogs''.<ref>Prog 1690</ref>\n\nMiddenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny's death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life \u2013 but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live \u2013 the story ended with Johnny returning to life.\n\nThe story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction.\n\nAfter the conclusion of ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'', the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In ''The Son'' in 2018 a new character, Wulf Sternhammer's son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent.\n\n==Hiatus==\nSince the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of ''2000AD'', Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development.<ref>''2000AD'' prog 2115, Input section, \"Strontium Fallout\"</ref> A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 ''Villains Takeover Special''.\n\n==Crossover stories==\nJohnny Alpha has also appeared in three ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd's era. The first was ''Top Dogs'', written by John Wagner, which appeared in the ''Judge Dredd Annual 1991'' (published in 1990). The second was ''[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd)|Judgement Day]]'', a 20-episode story written by [[Garth Ennis]], which appeared in both ''2000 AD'' and in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' in 1992. The third was ''By Private Contract'' in issue 2000 of ''2000 AD'' in September 2016, also written by Wagner.\n\nHe also stars with Judge Dredd in the Big Finish audio book \"Pre-Emptive Revenge\", in their attempt to stop a nuclear dirty bomb from launching while trying to reach safety after a successful co-operative mission.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhIaWZZmIhc</ref>\n\n==Publication==\nIn [[1987 in comics|1987]], [[Titan Books]] produced the first [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]] of Strontium Dog stories and others have appeared piecemeal over the years. Starting in [[2007 in comics|2007]], [[Rebellion Developments]] released a complete run of collected Strontium Dog stories as the ''Search/Destroy Agency Files''.\nIn 2008 Rebellion also began reprinting the new series of stories. Most of the post-Final Solution 'Strontium Dogs' stories were collected in softback collections bagged with issues of the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]''.\n\nAll material from ''Max Quirxx'' to ''Journey into Hell'' written by John Wagner and illustrated by Carlos Ezquerra unless otherwise stated.

B. Grover) and artist [[Carlos Ezquerra]] for ''[[Starlord (comics)|Starlord]]'', a short-lived weekly science fiction comic, in [[1978 in comics|1978]]. When ''Starlord'' was cancelled, the series transferred to ''2000 AD''. In [[1980 in comics|1980]], Wagner was joined by co-writer [[Alan Grant (writer)|Alan Grant]], although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series solo from [[1988 in comics|1988]] to [[1990 in comics|1990]]. After Ezquerra's death in October 2018 the series was put in indefinite hiatus with no current plans for its continuation.\n\n==Series background==\nThe premise of the series is that the Great Nuclear War of 2150 wiped out 70% of Britain's population and led to a huge increase of mutant births due to exposure to nuclear fallout ([[strontium-90]]). The mutants faced a high degree of racism, similar to that faced by the Jewish population of Nazi Germany. Laws were passed forbidding mutants from owning businesses and segregating them into [[ghetto]]s such as a giant mutant settlement at Milton Keynes.\n\nFollowing the end of this storyline, in 2180, one of the few jobs left for mutants is that of [[bounty hunter]], a job considered too dangerous for normal humans. The strongest of mutants hunt down criminals throughout the galaxy for the Search/Destroy agency, whose distinctive SD badges give them the nickname Strontium Dogs. The SD agents operate from an orbiting space station known as ''The Doghouse''.\n\nThe mutants of Strontium Dog differ from the [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|usual depiction]] of mutants in American comics, such as those published by [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], in that they are generally afflicted with severe physical deformities and only rarely granted with [[superhuman]] powers. Often this leads to humour and character names being puns, as Spider-Dan in the ''[[Middenface McNulty#Young Middenface|Young Middenface]]'' spin-off and skull-faced Welsh mutant Dai the Death in ''Strontium Dog: Traitor To His Kind''.\n\nEven by the standards of ''2000 AD'', ''Strontium Dog'' plotlines can be bizarre. In one story, Alpha travels to an alternate dimension that passes for [[Hell]]. In another, he is sent by time machine to 1945 to arrest [[Adolf Hitler]]. There is a bleak, minimalistic edge to the series at times reminiscent of [[spaghetti westerns]].\n\n===Earth===\n\nEarth is rarely seen in the strip. When it is, the focus is often New Britain \u2013 Great Britain after a devastating nuclear war. It is much closer to modern-day Britain than ''[[Judge Dredd]]'s'' [[Brit-Cit]] by the same writers, but contains areas of nuclear devastation such as the Greater London Crater and Birmingham Gap; areas known to survive include [[Salisbury]] (now a major area and political centre), Glasgow, Newcastle, Dover, Christchurch & [[Bournemouth]] (now a combined [[conurbation]]), Cardiff, [[Isles of Scilly]], and [[Winchester]]. The flying building of Upminster contains both the parliament and the monarchy. In the sequel series ''Strontium Dogs'', it was stated that Britain had a large empire of outer-space colonies.\n\nThe mutants of New Britain live in ghettos, isolated from the human population and living in poverty. Later stories like ''Traitor To His Kind'' would reveal some figures in the government, such as the First Lord of the Military (himself having a mutant daughter) are attempting to slowly improve the mutants' lot, but much of this goes unnoticed behind the scenes; many other figures in the government want to go back to greater oppression or attempted extermination.\n\nIn ''The Final Solution'', the government was usurped by the New Church and the incumbent monarch killed; the first ''Strontium Dogs'' story had it that after the destruction of the New Church by the Strontium Dogs, a hastily assembled junta government exiled all mutants from Britain. ''Crossroads'', in prog 898, revealed that Earth was in a severe political mess, with twenty six \"minor wars\", and the rest of the galaxy was cutting ties. The later strip ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' ignored all of this, instead having post-Church New Britain ruled by a more liberal government.\n\nIreland is known to still exist, though little has been shown; the United States of America and Canada were both visited in ''The Mork Whisperer'' (2009); and the leader of a West African Mutant Republic was shown in ''The Final Solution''. Antarctica was the setting of part of ''Outlaw'', shown to have been turned into a tropical area with marshes and rainforests by the Rad Wars. The centre was Antarctic City (also the name of a [[Mega-City One|megacity]] in Judge Dredd), with military and police matters handled by the Antarctic [[Militia]].\n\n==Johnny Alpha==\nThe Strontium Dogs storyline focuses on John Alpha, whose mutated eyes allow him to see through walls and read minds. He is responsible for such legendary achievements as destroying the Wolrog homeworld, leading the mutant uprising on Earth, and bringing [[Adolf Hitler]] to the future to face trial. His legendary career and his assistance to mutants in trouble - such as donating a large sum of money to the Milton Keynes ghetto in \"Mutie's Luck\" - have made him an icon to Earth's mutants. He is a highly skilled and dangerous fighter.\n\nA dogged bounty hunter, Johnny never gives up in the pursuit of his quarry. While he does work for money, he possesses a conscience and will often take a job, forego payment or sometimes drop a job entirely: in \"The Doc Quince Case\", he immediately relented and rescued a man he'd hunted down, and in \"The Slavers of Drule\" he took an assignment to track down a group of slavers because he felt it was the right  thing to do. He also can be extremely vengeful when angered, as shown by his actions towards Nelson Kreelman and Max Bubba.\n\nHe is the son of Nelson Bunker Kreelman, a bigoted politician who drafted the anti-mutant laws and gained power on the back of bigotry. Despised, abused and hidden away by his father, Johnny escaped at a young age and joined the Mutant Army, becoming one of its key leaders by age 17 and playing a major part in the mutant uprising of 2167. He never revealed the identity of his father, changing his name from Kreelman to Alpha.\n\nHe has a \"norm\" sister called Ruth, who is married and has a husband (Nigel) and daughter. She and her family have traditionally been friendly to Johnny; she even helped him escape and caused Nelson Kreelman's blackmail during the Mutant Army uprising of 2167. However, after her daughter was abducted and almost killed by a criminal looking for revenge on Johnny, she forbade him from coming near her family again.\n\nAlpha has a norm half-brother, the son of Nelson Kreelman by an affair, called Nelson Culliver, who after the war became head of the Anti-Mutant Squad at Scotland Yard. In \"Traitor to His Kind\", Culliver tried to have Alpha murdered, but was exposed and fired from his job. Alpha decided to assassinate him, but relented on meeting his children.\n\n===Weapons/equipment and mutant abilities===\nLike all Search/Destroy agents, Alpha is armed with highly advanced technology including a variable-cartridge blaster, electrified [[brass knuckles]], a short-range [[Teleportation|teleporter]], a \"time [[drogue]]\" that can briefly \"rewind\" the last few minutes of time, and \"time bombs\" which can transport somebody minutes or hours forwards or backwards in time (by which time the planet has moved along in its orbit, so that the victim reappears in empty space).\n\nOver the years, Johnny Alpha's white, incandescent eyes have provided him with several mutant abilities. Most frequently, the high-level alpha radiation emitted from his eyes allows Johnny to see through walls and other solid objects, or to read people's minds. He has also used his piercing stare to inflict severe headaches on his opponents, or to \"suggest\" illusions or hallucinations (e.g., while fighting the Necromagus, Sabbat, Johnny made Sabbat believe the Grim Reaper was behind him).\n\n===Supporting cast===\n\nJohnny's original partner is '''Wulf Sternhammer''', who is not a mutant but a normal human from [[Scandinavia]]; he became a Strontium Dog out of a sense of camaraderie with Johnny, and, despite the indignities, he viewed it as good work as it kept the galaxy \"safe for decent people\".<ref>Starlord #1</ref> A blunt and straightforward brawler, Wulf was far less prone to doubt and introspection and tried to bring his friend back in line when he had doubts. Ever since ''Starlord'' #5, Wulf wore the fur pelt of a '''Gronk''' that he'd befriended - the alien's custom was for people dear to them to wear their skin, so part of them would live on. Wulf acted a lot like a stereotypical [[Viking]] and it was eventually [[retconned]] that he ''was'' a Viking, accidentally brought into the 22nd century when Johnny was pursuing a criminal gang through time.\n\nEarly strips included the Gronk, the brother of the Gronk that Wulf had met earlier. It was a timid, metal-eating alien from the planet Blas, in the Gallego system (a tribute to the fantasy artist [[Blas Gallego]]). The Gronk provided medical back-up and constantly worried about its \"poor heartses\", and in \"Outlaw\" showed it could survive multiple heart attacks. A gag showed that \"the Gronk\" was the name for most of its species, causing problems when mail arrives for \"the Gronk\". In the ''Strontium Dogs'' spinoff, the Gronk transformed into a gun-toting highly aggressive soldier.\n\nKing Clarkie the Second, a thinly veiled parody of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] was the monarch for much of the strip, being deposed late in the series for his pro-mutant views. While presented as a buffoon in several strips, he was also essentially harmless and well-meaning.\n\nTwo allies who gained their own solo spin-off series were [[Middenface McNulty]], a [[Scotland|Scottish]] mutant raised in a ghetto/concentration camp called 'Shytehill' - presumably a reference to the [[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]] area of Glasgow - and whose head is covered with lumps; and [[Durham Red]], a female agent whose mutation resembles [[Vampire|vampirism]] and who is thus feared and despised by other mutants.\n\nFeral, introduced in \"The Final Solution\", was a young, savage mutant. He initially despised the Strontium Dogs, who he saw as abandoning the mutants on Earth, but was inspired by the actions of Johnny Alpha. Feral witnessed Alpha's sacrifice in \"The Final Solution\", and in the original \"Strontium Dogs\" strips of the 1990s, he became first a rebel outlaw in the colony worlds and then a renowned SD Agent. In \"The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha\", this was ignored and he became a SD Agent soon after \"The Final Solution\" \u2013 due to his abrasive personality, he soon left and became an outlaw who tried to resurrect Alpha, only to give up. In this second timeline, he was executed for murder on an alien world.\n\nIn both the original series and the revival Alpha frequently encountered or worked alongside members of a mutant family known as the Stix Clan. All members male and female are identical in appearance, personality and dress sense. They all hail from a single town called Stixville on the planet Freedonia and are highly hostile to any outsiders. They often appear as antagonist to Alpha but at times have worked alongside him, however they usually double cross and betray him at some point showing only the slightest loyalty to other Stix. There is said to be only one good Stix, Father Phineas who is a Catholic priest, a genuinely good and kind person and thus unmentionable around the rest of the Clan.\n\nThe revival would introduce Negus, the First Lord of the Military, a stern-faced and middle-aged politician who would both hire Johnny and act as his Upminster contact. Negus was pushing for increased mutant rights, having a mutant daughter that he kept at home (something Johnny remarked as being a brave act for a man in Negus' position), though he still wanted to keep mutant and norm bloodlines separate.\n\nFlashbacks to the pre-Wulf days of Johnny's life would introduce Precious Matson, a reporter from the mutant colony of Freedonia. A competent and dogged reporter, she became friends with Johnny and helped him against the terrorist leader Blood Moon. In \"Life and Death\", she began investigating the true events of Johnny's death and, with McNulty's aid, was able to resurrect him.\n\nIn 2018 \u201cThe Son\u201d revealed that Wulf had had a son, Kenton Sternhammer, who joined the Search/Destroy Agency.\n\n===Date===\nThe first ''Strontium Dog'' stories in ''Starlord'' and ''2000 AD'' were set in the year 2180. Later, the story \"Max Bubba\" gave the date 2185 (just as in the ''Judge Dredd'' stories by the same writers, the date progresses in real time). However, although the stories \"The No-Go Job\" and \"The Final Solution\" were said to take place two years after the events in \"Max Bubba,\" the date was again given as 2180. This discrepancy was repeated in the story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\" (written by [[Garth Ennis]]), which gave the date 2178 even though it was set after the events in \"Max Bubba.\"\n\nOccasionally, some one-episode stories which appeared in annuals and summer specials were set outside the range of dates given above, being set in different points of Alpha's life.\n\n==Major stories==\n\n===Original run===\n\n\"Portrait of a Mutant\", a flashback story in [[1981 in comics|1981]], filled in the background of the series and Johnny's role in the Mutant Army; it introduced Kreelman and the Kreelers, his quasi-official anti-mutant police. Kreelman drafted laws stating mutants were not allowed to work or own businesses, leading to them being forced from their homes into slums and eventually into being forced into labour camps; the only option for many mutants was to join the nationwide guerilla Mutant Army. An attack was launched on Upminster in 2167 as part of a general uprising, but the Army's leaders were forced to surrender in the face of mass mutant executions. Kreelman used this as an opportunity to push forward the extermination of all mutants; Johnny Alpha and the other leaders escaped (thanks to Johnny's sister and mother) and led the Mutant Army in a second major uprising to prevent genocide. The Prime Minister and King agreed to draft into law a better deal for mutants, and - after hearing Alpha was Kreelman's son from Ruth - blackmailed Kreelman into resigning. The mutant leaders were pardoned on condition they go into exile in space, leading to the creation of the Search/Destroy agency; the Kreelers were disbanded and replaced with a new police force. This changeover was depicted by a panel showing Kreelers, which was then repeated but with a different uniform, showing that the same people and attitudes remained. In the present day, bookending \"Portrait\", Johnny tracked his father down and activated a time device, causing his father to relive his final moments: begging for his life, forever.\n\nIn the story \"Outlaw\", Kreelman was later freed, and, in disguise, had himself appointed head of the Search/Destroy agency. He used his position to frame Johnny and other Mutant Army veterans for murder. Johnny was soon made aware of the truth and had no qualms about dragging his own father before the deceived mutants who gunned him down on the spot.\n\nIn the 1986 story \"Max Bubba\", a lengthy story explaining Wulf's origins, Wulf was killed off at the hands of Max Bubba and his gang. This led to the epic \"Rage\", in which Johnny remorselessly hunted down his partner's killers. After that Johnny either worked solo, or with [[Durham Red]] or Scottish mutant [[Middenface McNulty]].\n\nJohnny was killed off in [[1990 in comics|1990]], sacrificing himself to save mutants from extermination at the hands of Kreelman's illegitimate son, Lord Sagan. Artist Carlos Ezquerra disagreed with the decision to kill him and refused to draw it, so Johnny's final adventures were illustrated by [[Simon Harrison (comics)|Simon Harrison]] and [[Colin MacNeil]]. [[John Wagner]] later admitted in ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'''s [[Thrill Power Overload]] feature on the history of the comic that \"killing off Johnny Alpha was a mistake [that] I'm doing my best to rectify.\"<ref>''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'', volume 4, issue 17, p. 49</ref> He later described it as \"one of the big regrets of my career, probably the biggest.\"<ref>''Judge Dredd Megazine'' #377, 2016.</ref>\n\n===Post-death and ''Strontium Dogs''===\n\nThe medium of [[time travel]] allowed him to make further appearances. In the [[1991 in comics|1991]] ''[[Judge Dredd]] Annual'' John Wagner wrote and Colin MacNeil drew \"Top Dogs\", in which Johnny and Wulf travel back in time to Mega-City One in pursuit of a criminal, whilst encountering and only narrowly escaping [[Judge Dredd]]. Johnny and Dredd renewed acquaintances in [[1992 in comics|1992]] in the ''Judge Dredd'' story \"[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd story)|Judgement Day]]\", written by [[Garth Ennis]] and drawn mainly by Ezquerra.\n\nThe supporting cast would gain their own spin-off strip ''Strontium Dogs'' in the 1990s, written by [[Garth Ennis]] and [[Peter Hogan]]. It was criticised by Ennis in the book ''[[Thrill Power Overload]]'' as being anti-climactic and that the lead, Feral, \"was nowhere near as interesting as Johnny\". The series was scrapped when [[David Bishop (writer)|David Bishop]] became [[Tharg the Mighty|''2000 AD'''s editor]]. The first story, ''Monster'' starring Feral, revealed the Search Destroy Agency no longer existed and mutants had been driven off Earth by a hastily assembled UK junta government; colony worlds were also shown to be under military occupation and severely ill-treating mutants, with the alleged mutant resistance merely using their organisation to extort \"liberation\" taxes from mutants (an allegory for [[The Troubles]] in Northern Ireland, Ennis' home).\n\nEnnis would bring back the Gronk in ''Return of the Gronk'', turning him into an aggressive berserker: learning that Johnny Alpha was dead caused a heart attack which awakened his aggressive side of this one. The Gronk and Feral were teamed up, and went out for revenge against the necromancers who'd killed Alpha in ''The Darkest Star''. In the process, Feral found out he was the son of the lead necromancer and both he and the Gronk discovered that the necromancers drew their power from torturing the people they had killed \u2013 including Johnny Alpha. To destroy the enemy, the Gronk killed the captives \u2013 including, at his friend's request, Alpha himself, who couldn't live on in such excruciating pain.\n\nFrom prog 897, [[Peter Hogan]] became the regular writer on the strip and in prog 898 he resurrected the Search Destroy Agency: an agent named Bullmoose revealed that the Galactic Crime Commission had cut ties with Earth (who had pressed for the Agency to be closed and mutants purged), moved to Ganymede, and recreated the agency as they needed mutants to \"clean their dirty laundry for them\".\n\n[[Durham Red]] was given her own solo series, written by Alan Grant, Peter Hogan and later [[Dan Abnett]]. This series continued after ''Strontium Dogs'' was cancelled.\n\n===Revival===\n\nIn the ''Prog 2000'' holiday special, published at the end of [[1999 in comics|1999]], Johnny Alpha was revived by his original creators, Wagner and Ezquerra. The new stories were set before Johnny's death.\n\nThe first story, \"The Kreeler Conspiracy\", was based on a treatment Wagner had written for an aborted ''Strontium Dog'' TV pilot, and featured Johnny working solo, but Wulf returned in subsequent stories. Wagner introduced the concept that all previous stories were 'folklore' and the current series was the truth, giving him free rein to alter a number of details (such as giving Johnny an AI computer assistant and Kreelman having been President of a unified Earth government). This concept was dropped after \"Conspiracy\", with the later stories directly harkening back to the original run.\n\nA subsequent story in 2004, \"Traitor To His Kind\" (progs 1406\u20131415), introduced Johnny's half-brother, head of a brutal police unit that dealt with mutant crimes. Hired by pro-mutant First Lord Negus, Johnny was sent to get a kidnapped King Clarkie back from mutant guerillas; loath though he was to do so, he knew elements within the government were trying to use this as an excuse to viciously crack down on mutants. Johnny and Wulf rescue the King, as well as uncovering a conspiracy in the Home Office to allow the kidnapping and subsequently fake the King's murder so as to provide a reason for mutant brutalisation. While this led to an improvement in the lives of mutants, all of it was behind the scenes and Johnny Alpha was branded a traitor by mutants for working against his kind.\n\nThe 2009 story ''Blood Moon'' retconned in a fanatical mutant rebel leader, William Blood Moon, who was responsible for civilian massacres and suicide bombings. Johnny had been seconded to him during the war, and swore vengeance for Moon having his friend Mardi killed as a suicide bomber; years later, before meeting Wulf, he and other former rebel leaders would hunt down Blood Moon to kill him for his continuing terrorist atrocities. Johnny would use a time bomb to take Moon back to the site of Mardi's bombing and executed him there.\n\n===''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha''===\n\nIn prog 1689, June 2010, Wagner and Ezquerra began a strip called ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'' which took place following ''The Final Solution''. The strip featured reporter Precious Matson trying to discover the true circumstances behind Johnny's death: the story explicitly stated itself to be a retcon and the \"true\" story of what happened, and diverged from ''The Final Solution'' when Precious revealed to Middenface McNulty that Johnny's body had been brought ''back'' by Feral (the original strip showed it destroyed and the remains left behind).<ref>''2000 AD'' prog 1689</ref> Mutants remain on Earth, the S/D Agency still exists and has a new Doghouse satellite, and the UK government is said to be \"apologists and mutie-lovers\", ignoring ''Strontium Dogs''.<ref>Prog 1690</ref>\n\nMiddenface and Precious went searching for the truth behind Johnny's death and the whereabouts of his body. In the process, they found out that Feral had taken the body on a quest for the Stone Wizards, immensely powerful entities that could bring Johnny back to life \u2013 but, as the cost would be his own life, he backed out and buried him instead. (Feral would end up executed during the story for unrelated crimes.) Precious and Middenface located the body and took it to the Stone Wizards, where McNulty offered to die so Johnny would live \u2013 the story ended with Johnny returning to life.\n\nThe story continued in three further installments from 2011 to 2014. Alpha discovered a conspiracy to secretly sterilise all mutants in New Britain. This revelation led to a new civil war, with Alpha leading the mutant faction.\n\nAfter the conclusion of ''The Life and Death of Johnny Alpha'', the series returned to its bounty-hunter premise. In ''The Son'' in 2018 a new character, Wulf Sternhammer's son Kenton, joined Johnny Alpha as a rookie Search/Destroy agent.\n\n==Hiatus==\nSince the death of artist Carlos Ezquerra in October 2018, the editor of ''2000AD'', Matt Smith, has said he is yet to decide whether the series should continue without Ezquerra. However he has said that spin off series set around popular supporting characters are in development.<ref>''2000AD'' prog 2115, Input section, \"Strontium Fallout\"</ref> A story starring the Stix Clan was later published in the May 2019 ''Villains Takeover Special''.\n\n==Crossover stories==\nJohnny Alpha has also appeared in three ''[[Judge Dredd]]'' stories, in which he travelled back in time to Dredd's era. The first was ''Top Dogs'', written by John Wagner, which appeared in the ''Judge Dredd Annual 1991'' (published in 1990). The second was ''[[Judgement Day (Judge Dredd)|Judgement Day]]'', a 20-episode story written by [[Garth Ennis]], which appeared in both ''2000 AD'' and in the ''[[Judge Dredd Megazine]]'' in 1992. The third was ''By Private Contract'' in issue 2000 of ''2000 AD'' in September 2016, also written by Wagner.\n\nHe also stars with Judge Dredd in the Big Finish audio book \"Pre-Emptive Revenge\", in their attempt to stop a nuclear dirty bomb from launching while trying to reach safety after a successful co-operative mission.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xhIaWZZmIhc</ref>\n\n==Publication==\nIn [[1987 in comics|1987]], [[Titan Books]] produced the first [[trade paperback (comics)|collected volume]] of Strontium Dog stories and others have appeared piecemeal over the years.

Esperema\". Although it was a full language, it may not have been created to be spoken. Many believe that as an [[Esperanto|Esperantist]], Colas created Adjuvilo to help create dissent in the then-growing [[Ido (language)|Ido]] movement. Colas himself called his language ''simplified [[Ido (language)|Ido]]'' and proposed several reforms to Ido.\n\nColas created a nearly complete grammar, but did not create a new vocabulary. Adjuvilo uses mainly the vocabulary of Ido with modifications according to the grammatical changes of Ido.

Example: ''la lando'' (the land) and ''las landos'' (the lands). Like Ido and Esperanto, Adjuvilo has no [[indefinite article]]\n* Adjuvilo does not have grammatical genders. Nouns for females are all derived from the masculine form by using the affix ''-in''. Example: ''filio'' (son) and ''filiino'' (daughter).\n* The [[genitive]] and the [[indirect object]] cases are expressed by prepositions. Example: ''Me donin la libro de la patro a mea filio'' (I gave my father's book to my son).\n* The [[adjective]] ends on -a, and also receives -s in the plural. It is placed before the noun. Example: un bona viro (a good man), belas juvenilos (beautiful girls), granda monto (a big mountain).\n:The [[comparative]] grade is formed by plu (more) and men (less). Example: ''El estan plu bela quam il''. (She is more beautiful than he).\n:The [[superlative]] grade is formed by la pley (most). Example: ''Adjuvilo estan la pley facila linguo ex omnas linguos.'' (Adjuvilo is the easiest language of all languages).\n\n* The [[adverb]] is formed from the adjective form by replacing the ending -a by -e. Adverbs are not changed in the plural. Example: ''Elas kantan bone.'' (They sing well).\n* The [[personal pronouns]] are\n:Singular ''me'' (I), ''tu'' (you), ''il'' (he), ''el'' (she), ''it'' (it), ''lo'' (third person gender not defined)\n:Plural ''nos'' (we), ''vos'' (you), ''ilos'' (they, masculine), ''elos'' (they, female), ''itos'' (they, neuter), ''los'' (they, unspecified gender)\n:Additional personal pronouns: ''on'' (one, impersonal form), ''su'' ([[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] form)\n* The [[possessive pronoun|possessive]] pronouns are formed by adding the adjective ending ''-a'' and in the plural the ''-s'' to the personal pronouns: ''mea'' (my), ''tua'' (your), ''ila'' (his), ''nosas'' (our), ''ilosas'' (their, masculine). The reflexive possessive pronoun ''sua'' (his/her/its) in the singular and ''suas'' in the plural is only used for the third person and can be only used when it refers to the subject of the sentence.\n* The [[demonstrative pronoun]]s are ''cia'' (this) and ''tia'' (that). Like other pronouns they also have plural forms. ''Cias floros estan bela ma tias arboros estan plu grandas'' (These flowers are beautiful but these trees are bigger.)\n* The [[relative pronoun]]s are ''qua'', ''quas'' (subject - who/which/that) and ''que'' (complement/accusative). \n* The [[interrogative pronouns]] include ''qua'' (who), ''quo'' (what), ''quale'' (how), ''quare'' (why).\n* [[Tag questions]] are formed with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''num''. ''Num il parolan Adjuvilo?'' (Does he speak Adjuvilo?).\n* [[Verbs]] are not conjugated according to singular/plural or person.\n:The [[infinitive]] ending is ''-i'' like in [[Esperanto]]: ''diri'' (to say), ''lerni'' (to learn).\n:The [[present tense]] is formed by replacing the infinitive ending by ''-an''. Example: ''Me kantan'' (I sing), ''tu kantan'' (you sing).\n:The [[past tense]] is formed by ''-in''. Example: Me vidin (I saw).\n:The [[future tense]] is formed by ''-on''. Example: Me vidon (I will see).\n:The [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]] is formed by adding ''-un''. Example: Me vidun (I would see).\n:The [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed by adding ''-en''. Example: ''Lekten la libro!'' (Read the book!)\n:The [[active participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-ant'' for the present tense, '''-int''' for the past tense and ''-ont'' for the future tense. Example: ''La ridanta homo'' (The laughing man).\n:The [[passive participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-at'' for the present tense, '''-it''' for the past tense and ''-ot'' for the future tense.\n:The [[passive voice]] is formed with the forms of the [[auxiliary verb]] '''esti''' (to be). Example: ''La libro estin skriptita de Shakespeare'' (The book was written by Shakespeare).\n\n* The [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] are: 1 \u2014 un, 2 \u2014 du, 3 \u2014 tri, 4 \u2014 quar, 5 \u2014 quin, 6 \u2014 sis, 7 \u2014 sep, 8 \u2014 ok, 9 \u2014 nov, 10 \u2014 dek. The [[ordinal numbers]] are formed with the suffix -esma: ''unesma'', ''duesma'', ''triesma''.\n\n==Comparison to Ido==\n* Adjuvilo completely eliminates a special ending for the [[accusative]] case, whereas in Ido it was still used in sentences beginning with the [[object (grammar)|object]].\n* Adjuvilo uses the [[plural]] ending also for [[adjective]]s, the definite article and all [[pronouns]].\n* Adjuvilo uses as plural ending ''-s'' and not ''-i'' as Ido.\n* Adjuvilo replaces the Ido [[infinitive]] ending -''ar'' by the [[Esperanto]] form ''-i''. The infinitive forms of the different tenses in Ido were completely abolished.\n* Adjuvilo completely abolishes the synthetic [[passive voice]] form of the verbs by a compound form of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" and the corresponding [[participle]].\n* Adjuvilo changes the Ido system of [[affixes]] by creating new affixes, omitting some and modifying some existing ones.\n* Adjuvilo changes many [[pronouns]] of Ido.\n* The accent in Adjuvilo is always on the penultimate syllable, as in Esperanto.\n* Colas also announced changes to the vocabulary without elaborating this completely.\n\nAll in all the changes to Ido were so great that Adjuvilo in fact is a new constructed language.\n\n==Sample==\nA sample of Adjuvilo, the often-translated ''[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]:''\n:Patro nosa, \n:qua estan en cielos, \n:santa esten tua nomo; \n:advenen tua regno; \n:esten tua volo, \n:quale en cielos, \n:tale anke sur la tero.\n:Nosa panon omnadaga donen a nos hodie;\n:nosas ofendos pardonen a nos;\n:quale nos pardonan a nosas ofendantos \n:e ne lasen nos fali en tento, \n:ma liberifen nos de malbono.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://eo.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Dosiero:AdjuviloFrancais.pdf&page=1 Claudius Colas, ''L'Adjuvilo''.

Esperema\". Although it was a full language, it may not have been created to be spoken. Many believe that as an [[Esperanto|Esperantist]], Colas created Adjuvilo to help create dissent in the then-growing [[Ido (language)|Ido]] movement. Colas himself called his language ''simplified [[Ido (language)|Ido]]'' and proposed several reforms to Ido.\n\nColas created a nearly complete grammar, but did not create a new vocabulary. Adjuvilo uses mainly the vocabulary of Ido with modifications according to the grammatical changes of Ido. Colas in some cases reestablishes the Esperanto forms of words and even constructed some new words like ''sulo'' for \"sun\" (Ido/Esperanto: ''suno'') and ''dago'' for \"day\" (Ido: ''dio'', Esperanto: ''tago'').\n\n==Phonology and orthography==\nLike Ido, Adjuvilo has five vowel [[phoneme]]s. The vowels {{IPAlink|e|}} and {{IPAlink|\u025b||}} are interchangeable depending on speaker preference, as are {{IPAlink|o||}} and {{IPAlink|\u0254||}}. The combinations /au/ and /eu/ become [[diphthong]]s in word roots but not when adding affixes.<ref name=\"KGD7\">{{cite web|url=http://ido-vivo.info/kgd.pdf#page=7 |title=Pronunco dil vokali |work=Kompleta Gramatiko detaloza di la linguo internaciona Ido |date=2004 |page=7 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150813213123/http://ido-vivo.info/kgd.pdf#page=7 |archive-date=13 August 2015 |url-status=live |first=Louis |last=De Beaufront |editor-first=Fernando |editor-last=Tej\u00f3n |language=io |publisher=Krayono |location=Ponferrada, Spain |orig-year=1st pub. 1925 |format=PDF }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|+ Adjuvilo vowels\n!\n! | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n!

(They sing well).\n* The [[personal pronouns]] are\n:Singular ''me'' (I), ''tu'' (you), ''il'' (he), ''el'' (she), ''it'' (it), ''lo'' (third person gender not defined)\n:Plural ''nos'' (we), ''vos'' (you), ''ilos'' (they, masculine), ''elos'' (they, female), ''itos'' (they, neuter), ''los'' (they, unspecified gender)\n:Additional personal pronouns: ''on'' (one, impersonal form), ''su'' ([[reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] form)\n* The [[possessive pronoun|possessive]] pronouns are formed by adding the adjective ending ''-a'' and in the plural the ''-s'' to the personal pronouns: ''mea'' (my), ''tua'' (your), ''ila'' (his), ''nosas'' (our), ''ilosas'' (their, masculine). The reflexive possessive pronoun ''sua'' (his/her/its) in the singular and ''suas'' in the plural is only used for the third person and can be only used when it refers to the subject of the sentence.\n* The [[demonstrative pronoun]]s are ''cia'' (this) and ''tia'' (that). Like other pronouns they also have plural forms. ''Cias floros estan bela ma tias arboros estan plu grandas'' (These flowers are beautiful but these trees are bigger.)\n* The [[relative pronoun]]s are ''qua'', ''quas'' (subject - who/which/that) and ''que'' (complement/accusative). \n* The [[interrogative pronouns]] include ''qua'' (who), ''quo'' (what), ''quale'' (how), ''quare'' (why).\n* [[Tag questions]] are formed with the [[Grammatical particle|particle]] ''num''. ''Num il parolan Adjuvilo?'' (Does he speak Adjuvilo?).\n* [[Verbs]] are not conjugated according to singular/plural or person.\n:The [[infinitive]] ending is ''-i'' like in [[Esperanto]]: ''diri'' (to say), ''lerni'' (to learn).\n:The [[present tense]] is formed by replacing the infinitive ending by ''-an''. Example: ''Me kantan'' (I sing), ''tu kantan'' (you sing).\n:The [[past tense]] is formed by ''-in''. Example: Me vidin (I saw).\n:The [[future tense]] is formed by ''-on''. Example: Me vidon (I will see).\n:The [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctive]] is formed by adding ''-un''. Example: Me vidun (I would see).\n:The [[imperative mood|imperative]] is formed by adding ''-en''. Example: ''Lekten la libro!'' (Read the book!)\n:The [[active participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-ant'' for the present tense, '''-int''' for the past tense and ''-ont'' for the future tense. Example: ''La ridanta homo'' (The laughing man).\n:The [[passive participle]]s are formed with the suffix ''-at'' for the present tense, '''-it''' for the past tense and ''-ot'' for the future tense.\n:The [[passive voice]] is formed with the forms of the [[auxiliary verb]] '''esti''' (to be). Example: ''La libro estin skriptita de Shakespeare'' (The book was written by Shakespeare).\n\n* The [[cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numbers]] are: 1 \u2014 un, 2 \u2014 du, 3 \u2014 tri, 4 \u2014 quar, 5 \u2014 quin, 6 \u2014 sis, 7 \u2014 sep, 8 \u2014 ok, 9 \u2014 nov, 10 \u2014 dek. The [[ordinal numbers]] are formed with the suffix -esma: ''unesma'', ''duesma'', ''triesma''.\n\n==Comparison to Ido==\n* Adjuvilo completely eliminates a special ending for the [[accusative]] case, whereas in Ido it was still used in sentences beginning with the [[object (grammar)|object]].\n* Adjuvilo uses the [[plural]] ending also for [[adjective]]s, the definite article and all [[pronouns]].\n* Adjuvilo uses as plural ending ''-s'' and not ''-i'' as Ido.\n* Adjuvilo replaces the Ido [[infinitive]] ending -''ar'' by the [[Esperanto]] form ''-i''. The infinitive forms of the different tenses in Ido were completely abolished.\n* Adjuvilo completely abolishes the synthetic [[passive voice]] form of the verbs by a compound form of the auxiliary verb \"to be\" and the corresponding [[participle]].\n* Adjuvilo changes the Ido system of [[affixes]] by creating new affixes, omitting some and modifying some existing ones.\n* Adjuvilo changes many [[pronouns]] of Ido.\n* The accent in Adjuvilo is always on the penultimate syllable, as in Esperanto.\n* Colas also announced changes to the vocabulary without elaborating this completely.\n\nAll in all the changes to Ido were so great that Adjuvilo in fact is a new constructed language.\n\n==Sample==\nA sample of Adjuvilo, the often-translated ''[[Lord's Prayer|Pater Noster]]:''\n:Patro nosa, \n:qua estan en cielos, \n:santa esten tua nomo; \n:advenen tua regno; \n:esten tua volo, \n:quale en cielos, \n:tale anke sur la tero.\n:Nosa panon omnadaga donen a nos hodie;\n:nosas ofendos pardonen a nos;\n:quale nos pardonan a nosas ofendantos \n:e ne lasen nos fali en tento, \n:ma liberifen nos de malbono.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [http://eo.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Dosiero:AdjuviloFrancais.pdf&page=1 Claudius Colas, ''L'Adjuvilo''.

It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Kansas City, Kansas]] (KCK), and the [[Kansas]] counties of [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] of the United States. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s \u2013 the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\n\nOn February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897.

Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s.

The [[Big 12 Women's Basketball Tournament|women's tournament]] is played at [[Municipal Auditorium (Kansas City)|Municipal Auditorium]].\n\nThe city has one [[NCAA Division I]] program, the [[Kansas City Roos]], representing the [[University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City]] (UMKC). The program, historically known as the UMKC Kangaroos, adopted its current branding after the 2018\u201319 school year.\n\nIn addition to serving as the home stadium of the Chiefs, [[Arrowhead Stadium]] serves as the venue for various intercollegiate football games. It has hosted the Big 12 Championship Game five times. On the last weekend in October, the [[Mid-America Intercollegiate Athletics Association|MIAA]] Fall Classic rivalry game between [[Northwest Missouri State Bearcats football|Northwest Missouri State University]] and [[Pittsburg State University]] took place at the stadium.\n\n===Professional rugby===\nKansas City is represented on the [[rugby union|rugby]] pitch by the [[Kansas City Blues RFC]], a former member of the [[Rugby Super League (United States)|Rugby Super League]] and a Division 1 club. The team works closely with Sporting Kansas City and splits home-games between Sporting's training pitch and [[Rockhurst University]]'s stadium.\n\n===Former teams===\nKansas City briefly had four short-term major league baseball teams between 1884 and 1915: the [[Kansas City Cowboys (Union Association)|Kansas City Unions]] of the short-lived [[Union Association]] in 1884, the [[Kansas City Cowboys (National League)|Kansas City Cowboys]] in the [[National League]] in 1886, a team of the [[Kansas City Cowboys (American Association)|same name]] in the then-major league [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] in 1888 and 1889, and the [[Kansas City Packers]] in the [[Federal League]] in 1914 and 1915.  The [[Kansas City Monarchs]] of the now-defunct [[Negro National League (1920\u201331)|Negro National]] and [[Negro American League|Negro American]] Leagues represented Kansas City from 1920 through 1955. The city also had a number of minor league baseball teams between 1885 and 1955. From 1903 through 1954, the [[Kansas City Blues (American Association)|Kansas City Blues]] played in the high-level [[American Association (20th Century)|American Association]] minor league. In 1955, Kansas City became a major league city when the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] baseball franchise relocated to the city in 1955. Following the 1967 season, the team relocated to [[Oakland, California]].\n\nKansas City was represented in the [[National Basketball Association]] by the [[Sacramento Kings|Kansas City Kings]] (called the Kansas City-Omaha Kings from 1972 to 1975), when the former Cincinnati Royals moved to the Midwest. The team left for [[Sacramento]] in 1985.\n\nIn 1974, the [[National Hockey League]] placed an expansion team in Kansas City called the [[Kansas City Scouts]]. The team moved to [[Denver]] in 1976, then to [[New Jersey]] in 1982 where they have remained ever since as the [[New Jersey Devils]].\n\n[[File:Penn Valley Park.jpg|thumb|View of downtown from [[Penn Valley Park]]]]\n[[File:Loose Park Rose Garden.jpg|thumb|The rose garden in [[Loose Park]], Kansas City's third largest public park.]]\n\n==Parks and boulevards==\n[[File:JC Nichols Fountain by Henri-L\u00e9on Gr\u00e9ber Kansas City.jpg|thumb|''J.C.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\n\n===Federal representation===\nKansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n*[[Missouri's 4th congressional district]] \u2013 the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by [[Vicky Hartzler]] (Republican)\n*[[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence; represented by [[Emanuel Cleaver]] (Democrat)\n*[[Missouri's 6th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper north of the [[Missouri River]] and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; represented by [[Sam Graves]] (Republican)\n\n[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during the early hours of New Years Day 2016.]]\n\n===Crime===\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.\n\n{{As of|November 2012}}, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city. [[Trans World Airlines]] (TWA) located its headquarters in the city, and had ambitious plans to turn the city into an air hub.\n\n===Highways===\n[[File:Alphamap.gif|thumb|Kansas City is a major meeting place for several of the nation's busiest highways.]]\nMissouri and Kansas were the first states to start building interstates with [[Interstate 70]]. [[Interstate 435]], which encircles the entire city, is the second longest beltway in the nation. ([[Interstate 275 (Ohio-Kentucky-Indiana)|Interstate 275]] around [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] is the longest.) The Kansas City metro area has more limited-access highway lane-miles per capita than any other large US metro area, over 27% more than the second-place [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], over 50% more than the average American metropolitan area. From 2013 to 2017 the average commuting time was 21.8 minutes. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/kansascitycitymissouri/PST045218|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Kansas City city, Missouri|website=www.census.gov}}</ref> The [[Sierra Club]] blames the extensive freeway network for excessive [[urban sprawl|sprawl]] and the decline of central Kansas City.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |title=1998 Sprawl Report- Sprawl \u2013 Sierra Club |publisher=Sierraclub.org |accessdate=May 5, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516193458/http://www.sierraclub.org/sprawl/report98/kansas_city.asp |archive-date=May 16, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the other hand, the relatively uncongested road network contributes significantly to Kansas City's position as one of America's largest [[logistics]] hubs.<ref>[http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf Kcsmartport.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325133930/http://www.kcsmartport.com/sec_news/media/documents/ShippingCentral.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:Kci.JPG|thumb|[[Kansas City International Airport]]]]\n\n[[Kansas City International Airport]], airport code MCI (Mid-Continent International Airport) was built to TWA's specifications to make a world hub.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://flykci.com/newsroom/press-kit/backgrounder/|title=Backgrounder|website=Kansas City International Airport}}</ref> Its original passenger-friendly design placed each of its gates \n{{convert|100|ft|m}} from the street. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]], it required a costly overhaul to conform to the tighter security protocols. [[Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport]] was TWA's original headquarters and houses the [[Airline History Museum]]. It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.\n\n===Public transportation===\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX). MAX links the River Market, Downtown, [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]], Crown Center and the Country Club Plaza.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max/ |title=Maps and Schedules |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420042341/http://www.kcata.org/maps_schedules/max |archive-date=April 20, 2010 |url-status=unfit }}</ref> MAX operates and is marketed more like a rail system than a local bus line. A unique identity was created for MAX, including 13 modern diesel buses and easily identifiable \"stations\". MAX features (real-time [[global positioning system|GPS]] tracking of buses, available at every station), and stoplights automatically change in their favor if buses are behind schedule. In 2010, a second MAX line was added on Troost Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |title=Light Rail and MAX |publisher=KCATA |accessdate=March 16, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100115112506/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/max_and_bus_rapid_transit/ |archive-date=January 15, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is planning another MAX line down Prospect Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|title=Prospect Ave. MAX {{!}} Light Rail and MAX {{!}} KCATA|last=Authority|first=Kansas City Area Transportation|website=www.kcata.org|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602120949/http://www.kcata.org/light_rail_max/prospect_ave_study|archive-date=June 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe Prospect MAX line launched in 2019 and Mayor [[Quinton Lucas]] announced the service would be fare-free indefinitely.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.masstransitmag.com/technology/fare-collection/news/21127532/mo-prospect-max-bus-service-will-be-farefree-indefinitely-for-riders|title=MO: Prospect MAX bus service will be fare-free indefinitely for riders|last=Rice|first=Glenn|date=February 28, 2020|website=Mass Transit Magazine|access-date=2020-03-01}}</ref>\n[[File:Streetcar 10main.jpg|thumb|upright|KC Streetcar departing the Library stop heading north to the River Market.]]\n\n=====RideKC Streetcar=====\nOn December 12, 2012, a ballot initiative to construct a $102 million, 2-mile (3200 m) modern streetcar line in downtown Kansas City was approved by local voters.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|title=Kansas City voters approve streetcar plan|newspaper=Kansas City Business Journal|accessdate=January 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730051350/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2012/12/12/kansas-city-voters-approve-streetcar.html|archive-date=July 30, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The streetcar route runs along Main Street from the [[River Market]] to [[Union Station (Kansas City, Missouri)|Union Station]]; it debuted on May 6, 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|title=Crowds jam streetcars in Kansas City return|website=kansascity|access-date=May 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507115829/http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article76034492.html|archive-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A new non-profit corporation made up of private sector stakeholders and city appointees \u2013 the [[Kansas City Streetcar Authority]] \u2013 operates and maintains the system.

The buses and other transit options will be branded as: RideKC Bus, RideKC MAX, RideKC Streetcar, and RideKC Bridj. RideKC Bridj is a micro transit service partnership between Ford Bridj and KCATA that began on March 7, 2016. Users download the Bridj app and use the service much like a taxi service.

It is the most populated municipality and historic core city of the [[Kansas City metropolitan area]], which straddles the [[Kansas]]\u2013[[Missouri]] state line and has a CSA population of 2,487,053. Most of the city lies within [[Jackson County, Missouri|Jackson County]], but portions spill into [[Clay County, Missouri|Clay]], [[Cass County, Missouri|Cass]], and [[Platte County, Missouri|Platte]] counties. The city borders [[Kansas City, Kansas]] (KCK), and the [[Kansas]] counties of [[Johnson County, Kansas|Johnson County]] and [[Wyandotte County, Kansas|Wyandotte County]]. Kansas City was founded in the 1830s as a [[Missouri River]] port at its confluence with the [[Kansas River]] coming in from the west. On June 1, 1850, the town of Kansas was incorporated; shortly after came the establishment of the [[Kansas Territory]]. Confusion between the two ensued, and the name Kansas City was assigned to distinguish them soon after. \n\nSitting on Missouri's western boundary with [[Kansas]], with [[Downtown Kansas City|Downtown]] near the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri Rivers, the city encompasses about {{convert|319.03|sqmi|km2}}, making it the [[List of United States cities by area|23rd largest city by total area]] in the United States. Along with [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], one of its major suburbs, it serves as one of the two county seats of Jackson County. Other major suburbs include the Missouri cities of [[Blue Springs, Missouri|Blue Springs]] and [[Lee's Summit, Missouri|Lee's Summit]] and the Kansas cities of [[Overland Park, Kansas|Overland Park]], [[Olathe, Kansas|Olathe]], and [[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]].\n\nThe city is composed of several neighborhoods, including the [[River Market, Kansas City|River Market District]] in the north, the 18th and Vine District in the east, and the [[Country Club Plaza]] in the south. Kansas City is known for its long tradition of [[jazz]] music and culture, especially theater \u2013 the city was the center of the [[Vaudevillian]] [[Orpheum circuit]] in the 1920s. It is also noted for its cuisine, including its distinctive [[Kansas City-style barbecue]], and its craft breweries.\n{{toclimit|3}}\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of Kansas City, Missouri|History of the Kansas City metropolitan area}}\nKansas City, Missouri, was incorporated as a town on June 1, 1850, and as a city on March 28, 1853. The [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|territory]], straddling the border between Missouri and Kansas at the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, was considered a good place to build settlements.\n\nThe [[Antioch Christian Church (Kansas City, Missouri)|Antioch Christian Church]], [[Dr. James Compton House]], and [[Woodneath]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a|dateform=mdy}}</ref>\n\n===Exploration and settlement===\n[[File:Westport Pioneers Statue.jpg|thumb|upright|Kansas City Pioneer Square monument in Westport features [[Pony Express]] founder [[Alexander Majors]], Westport/Kansas City founder [[John Calvin McCoy]], and Mountain-man [[Jim Bridger]] who owned Chouteau's Store.]]\n\nThe first documented European visitor to the eventual site of Kansas City was [[\u00c9tienne de Veniard, Sieur de Bourgmont]], who was also the first European to explore the lower Missouri River. Criticized for his response to the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] attack on [[Fort D\u00e9troit]], he had deserted his post as fort commander and was avoiding French authorities. Bourgmont lived with a Native American wife in a village about {{convert|90|mi|km}} east near [[Brunswick, Missouri]], where he illegally traded [[furs]].\n\nTo clear his name, he wrote ''Exact Description of Louisiana, of Its Harbors, Lands and Rivers, and Names of the Indian Tribes That Occupy It, and the Commerce and Advantages to Be Derived Therefrom for the Establishment of a Colony'' in 1713 followed in 1714 by ''The Route to Be Taken to Ascend the Missouri River''. In the documents, he describes the junction of the \"Grande Riv[i\u00e8re] des Cansez\" and Missouri River, making him the first to adopt those names. French cartographer [[Guillaume Delisle]] used the descriptions to make the area's first reasonably accurate map.\n\nThe Spanish took over the region in the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, but were not to play a major role other than taxing and licensing Missouri River ship traffic. The French continued their [[fur trade]] under Spanish license. The [[Chouteau]] family operated under Spanish license at [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], in the lower [[Missouri River Valley|Missouri Valley]] as early as 1765 and in 1821 the Chouteaus reached Kansas City, where [[Fran\u00e7ois Chouteau]] established Chouteau's Landing.\n\nAfter the 1804 [[Louisiana Purchase]], [[Lewis and Clark]] visited the confluence of the Kansas and Missouri rivers, noting it was a good place to build a fort. In 1831, a group of [[Mormons]] from New York settled in what would become the city. They built the first school within Kansas City's current boundaries, but were forced out by [[mob violence]] in 1833, and their settlement remained vacant.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilkinson |first=Ernest L. |title=Brigham Young University: The First 100 Years |location=Provo |publisher=BYU Press |year=1976 |volume=Vol. 1 |page=7 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1833 [[John Calvin McCoy|John McCoy]], son of [[Baptist]] missionary [[Isaac McCoy]], established [[Westport, Kansas City|West Port]] along the [[Santa Fe Trail]], {{convert|3|mi|km|abbr=off|adj=off|sp=us}} away from the river. In 1834 McCoy established [[Westport, Kansas City|Westport Landing]] on a bend in the Missouri to serve as a landing point for West Port. Soon after, the Kansas Town Company, a group of investors, began to settle the area, taking their name from an English spelling of \"Cansez.\" In 1850, the landing area was incorporated as the Town of Kansas.<ref>{{cite web | title=Why is Kansas City located in Missouri instead of Kansas? | url=http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | accessdate=January 2, 2010 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100716232838/http://www.kclibrary.org/kchistory/why-kansas-city-located-missouri-instead-kansas | archivedate=July 16, 2010 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nBy that time, the Town of Kansas, Westport, and nearby [[Independence, Missouri|Independence]], had become critical points in the [[Territorial acquisitions of the United States|westward expansion]] of the United States. Three major [[Historical roads and trails of the United States|trail]]s \u2013 the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[California Trail|California]], and [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]] \u2013 all passed through Jackson County.\n\nOn February 22, 1853, the City of Kansas was created with a newly elected mayor. It had an area of {{convert|0.70|sqmi|km2}} and a population of 2,500. The boundary lines at that time extended from the middle of the Missouri River south to what is now Ninth Street, and from Bluff Street on the west to a point between Holmes Road and Charlotte Street on the east.<ref>{{cite web | title=Early City Limits | url=http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 | accessdate =September 11, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927175946/http://images.kclibrary.org/localhistory/media.cfm?mediaID=95980 |archivedate = September 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n===American Civil War===\n\nDuring the Civil War, the city and its immediate surroundings were the focus of intense military activity. Although the [[First Battle of Independence]] in August 1862 resulted in a [[Confederate States Army]] victory, the Confederates were unable to leverage their win in any significant fashion, as Kansas City was occupied by Union troops and proved too heavily fortified to assault. The [[Second Battle of Independence]], which occurred on October 21\u201322, 1864, as part of [[Sterling Price]]'s [[Price's Raid|Missouri expedition of 1864]], also resulted in a Confederate triumph. Once again their victory proved hollow, as Price was decisively defeated in the pivotal [[Battle of Westport]] the next day, effectively ending Confederate efforts to regain Missouri.\n\nGeneral [[Thomas Ewing, Jr.|Thomas Ewing]], in response to a successful raid on nearby [[Lawrence, Kansas]], led by [[William Quantrill]], issued [[General Order No. 11 (1863)|General Order No. 11]], forcing the eviction of residents in four western Missouri counties \u2013 including Jackson \u2013 except those living in the city and nearby communities and those whose allegiance to the Union was certified by Ewing.\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nAfter the Civil War, Kansas City grew rapidly, largely losing its Southern identity. The selection of the city over [[Leavenworth, Kansas]], for the [[Hannibal & St. Joseph Railroad]] bridge over the Missouri River brought about significant growth. The population exploded after 1869, when the Hannibal Bridge, designed by [[Octave Chanute]], opened. The boom prompted a name change to Kansas City in 1889, and the city limits to be extended south and east. Westport became part of Kansas City on December 2, 1897. In 1900, Kansas City was the 22nd largest city in the country, with a population of 163,752 residents.<ref name=\"U.S. Census Bureau\">{{cite web|title=Missouri \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=December 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archivedate=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>\n[[File:Junction of Main and Delaware Streets, Kansas City, Mo (NYPL b12647398-68704).tiff|thumb|Junction of Main and Delaware Streets in 1898]]\nKansas City, guided by architect [[George Kessler]], became a forefront example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement, offering a network of boulevards and parks.<ref>{{cite web | title=Historic Sanborn Maps of Kansas City | url=http://digital.library.umsystem.edu/image/umcscsanic/title/kansas+city+missouri | publisher = [[University of Missouri]] Digital Library | accessdate =March 21, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe relocation of [[Kansas City Union Station|Union Station]] to its current location in 1914 and the opening of the [[Liberty Memorial]] in 1923 provided two of the city's most identifiable landmarks. [[Robert A. Long]], president of the Liberty Memorial Association, was a driving force in the funding for construction. Long was a longtime resident and wealthy businessman. He built the [[R.A. Long Building]] for the [[Long-Bell Lumber Company]], his home, [[Corinthian Hall]] (now the [[Kansas City Museum]]) and [[Longview Farm]].\n\nFurther spurring Kansas City's growth was the opening of the innovative [[Country Club Plaza]] development by [[Jesse Clyde Nichols|J.C. Nichols]] in 1925, as part of his [[Country Club District]] plan.\n\n====20th century streetcar system====\n[[Streetcars in Kansas City|The Kansas City streetcar system]] once had hundreds of miles of streetcars running through the city and was one of the largest systems in the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kcur.org/show/central-standard/2013-11-22/the-history-of-the-kansas-city-streetcar|title=The History Of The Kansas City Streetcar|website=KCUR 89.3 - NPR in Kansas City.

Several important buildings and structures were built during this time, including the [[Kansas City City Hall]] and the Jackson County Courthouse. The machine fell in 1939 when Pendergast, riddled with health problems, pleaded guilty to tax evasion after long federal investigations. His biographers have summed up Pendergast's uniqueness:\n<blockquote>Pendergast may bear comparison to various big-city bosses, but his open alliance with hardened criminals, his cynical subversion of the democratic process, his monarchistic style of living, his increasingly insatiable gambling habit, his grasping for a business empire, and his promotion of Kansas City as a wide-open town with every kind of vice imaginable, combined with his professed compassion for the poor and very real role as city builder, made him bigger than life, difficult to characterize.<ref>{{cite book|author=Lawrence H.

Hulston|title=Pendergast!|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=n-Qiu53FCOsC|page=11}}|year=2013|publisher=University of Missouri Press|page=xi}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Post\u2013World War II===\nKansas City's suburban development began with a streetcar system in the early decades of the 20th century.

Gates, opened Gates Bar-B-Q, later [[Gates and Sons Bar-B-Q]] when his son Ollie joined the family business. Bryant's and Gates are the two definitive Kansas City barbecue restaurants; native Kansas Citian and essayist Calvin Trillin famously called Bryant's \"the single best restaurant in the world\" in an essay he wrote for ''Playboy'' magazine in the 1960s. [[Fiorella's Jack Stack Barbecue]] is also well regarded. In 1977, [[Rich Davis]], a psychiatrist, test-marketed his own concoction called K.C. Soul Style Barbecue Sauce. He renamed it [[KC Masterpiece]], and in 1986, he sold the recipe to the [[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]] division of [[Clorox]]. Davis retained rights to operate restaurants using the name and sauce, whose recipe popularized the use of molasses as a sweetener in Kansas City-style barbecue sauces.

The city has a council/manager form of government. The role of [[city manager]] has diminished over the years. The non-elective office of city manager was created following excesses during the Pendergast days. The mayor is the head of the [[Kansas City, Missouri City Council|Kansas City City Council]], which has 12 members (one member for each district, plus one at large member per district). The mayor is the presiding member. Kansas City holds city elections in every fourth odd numbered year. The last citywide election was held in May 2015. The officials took office in August 2015 and will hold the position until 2019.\n\nPendergast was the most prominent leader during the machine politics days. The most nationally prominent Democrat associated with the machine was [[Harry S Truman]], who became a Senator, Vice President and then [[President of the United States]] from 1945 to 1953. Kansas City is the seat of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri]], one of two [[United States district courts|federal district courts]] in Missouri.  The [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]] is in St. Louis. It also is the seat of the Western District of the [[Missouri Court of Appeals]], one of three districts of that court (the Eastern District is in St. Louis and the Southern District is in [[Springfield, Missouri|Springfield]]).\n\nThe Mayor, City Council, and City Manager are listed below:<ref>https://www.kceb.org/useruploads/2019_mayorCC/Election_Summary_Official_6-19.pdf\n\nhttps://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190719152736/https://www.kcmo.gov/city-hall/city-officials/city-council-members |date=July 19, 2019 }}\n\n<br /></ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The urban core of Kansas City consistently votes Democratic in presidential elections; however, on the state and local level Republicans often find success, especially in the Northland and other suburban areas of Kansas City.\n\n===Federal representation===\nKansas City is represented by three members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:\n*[[Missouri's 4th congressional district]] \u2013 the Cass County portion of Kansas City; represented by [[Vicky Hartzler]] (Republican)\n*[[Missouri's 5th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper in Jackson County, plus Independence; represented by [[Emanuel Cleaver]] (Democrat)\n*[[Missouri's 6th congressional district]] \u2013 all of Kansas City proper north of the [[Missouri River]] and plus suburbs in eastern Jackson County beyond Independence; represented by [[Sam Graves]] (Republican)\n\n[[File:Police Respond to Shooting.jpg|thumb|Police respond to a shooting in the [[Crossroads, Kansas City|Crossroads]] area during the early hours of New Years Day 2016.]]\n\n===Crime===\nSome of the earliest organized violence in Kansas City erupted during the [[American Civil War]]. Shortly after the city's incorporation in 1850, so-called [[Bleeding Kansas]] erupted, affecting [[border ruffians]] and [[Jayhawkers]]. During the war, Union troops [[General Order \u2116 11 (1863)|burned all occupied dwellings]] in Jackson County south of Brush Creek and east of Blue Creek to Independence in an attempt to halt raids into Kansas. After the war, the ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' turned outlaw [[Jesse James]] into a folk hero via its coverage. James was born in the Kansas City metro area at [[Kearney, Missouri]], and notoriously robbed the Kansas City Fairgrounds at 12th Street and Campbell Avenue.\n\nIn the early 20th century under Pendergast, Kansas City became the country's \"most wide open town\". While this would give rise to [[Kansas City Jazz]], it also led to the rise of the [[Kansas City crime family|Kansas City mob]] (initially under [[Johnny Lazia]]), as well as the arrival of [[organized crime]]. In the 1970s, the Kansas City mob was involved in a gang war over control of the [[River Quay]] entertainment district, in which three buildings were bombed and several gangsters were killed. Police investigations gained after boss [[Nick Civella]] was recorded discussing gambling bets on [[Super Bowl IV]] (where the Kansas City Chiefs defeated the Minnesota Vikings). The war and investigation led to the end of mob control of the [[Stardust Casino]], which was the basis for the film ''[[Casino (film)|Casino]]'', though the production minimizes the Kansas City connections.\n\n{{As of|November 2012}}, Kansas City [[United States cities by crime rate|ranked 18th]] on the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI)'s annual survey of crime rates for cities with populations over 100,000.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |title=FBI: Violent crime drops in Kansas City for first half of 2012 \u2013 Kansas City Business Journal |website=Bizjournals.com |date=February 1, 2013 |accessdate=July 10, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730054734/http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/news/2013/02/01/fbi-violent-crime-drops-in-kansas.html |archive-date=July 30, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Much of the city's violent crime occurs on the city's lower income East Side.

The ''Star'' sold off the WDAF stations in 1957, following an [[antitrust]] investigation by the United States government (reportedly launched at Truman's behest, following a long-standing feud with the ''Star'') over the newspaper's ownership of television and radio stations.

Between 1931 and 1982 Kansas City was home to the [[Calvin Company]], a large movie production company that specialized in promotional and sales short films and commercials for corporations, as well as educational films for schools and the government. Calvin was an important venue for Kansas City arts, training local filmmakers who went on to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood careers]] and also employing local actors, most of whom earned their main income in fields such as radio and television announcing. Kansas City native [[Robert Altman]] directed movies at the Calvin Company, which led him to shoot his first feature film, ''[[The Delinquents (1957 film)|The Delinquents]]'', in Kansas City using many local players.\n\nThe 1983 television movie ''[[The Day After]]'' was filmed in Kansas City and Lawrence, Kansas. The 1990s film ''[[Truman (1995 film)|Truman]]'', starring [[Gary Sinise]], was filmed in the city. Other films shot in or around Kansas City include ''[[Article 99]]'', ''[[Mr. and Mrs. Bridge|Mr. & Mrs. Bridge]]'', ''[[Kansas City (film)|Kansas City]]'', ''[[Paper Moon (film)|Paper Moon]]'', ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]'', ''[[Ninth Street]]'', and ''[[Sometimes They Come Back (film)|Sometimes They Come Back]]'' (in and around nearby [[Liberty, Missouri]]). More recently, a scene in the controversial film ''[[Br\u00fcno]]'' was filmed in downtown Kansas City's historic Hotel Phillips.\n\nToday, Kansas City is home to an active independent film community. The [[Independent Filmmaker's Coalition]] is an organization dedicated to expanding and improving independent filmmaking in Kansas City. The city launched the KC Film Office in October 2014 with the goal of better marketing the city for prospective television shows and movies to be filmed there. The City Council passed several film tax incentives in February 2016 to take effect in May 2016; the KC Film Office is coordinating its efforts with the State of Missouri to reinstate film incentives on a statewide level.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|title=Tax breaks for films could bring cash to Kansas City|last=Monreal|first=Jane|date=April 2, 2016|website=KSHB|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417155354/http://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/tax-breaks-for-films-could-bring-cash-to-kc|archive-date=April 17, 2016|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Infrastructure==\n{{Main|Kansas City Metropolitan Area#Transportation|Kansas City Metropolitan Area}}\n\nOriginally, Kansas City was the launching point for travelers on the [[Santa Fe Trail|Santa Fe]], [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], and [[California Trail|California]] trails. Later, with the construction of the [[Hannibal Bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]], it became the junction of 11 trunk railroads. More rail tonnage passes through the city than through any other U.S. city.

It is still used for [[general aviation]] and airshows.\n\n===Public transportation===\nLike most American cities, Kansas City's mass transit system was originally rail-based. From 1870 to 1957, Kansas City's streetcar system was among the top in the country, with over {{convert|300|mi|km}} of track at its peak. The rapid sprawl in the following years led this private system to be shut down.\n\n====KCATA- RideKC====\nOn December 28, 1965, the [[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] (KCATA) was formed via a bi-state compact created by the Missouri and Kansas legislatures. The compact gave the KCATA responsibility for planning, construction, owning and operating passenger transportation systems and facilities within the seven-county area.\n\n=====RideKC Bus and MAX=====\n[[File:RideKC Bus.jpg|thumb|A newly branded RideKC Bus.]]\nIn July 2005, the KCATA launched Kansas City's first [[bus rapid transit]] line, the [[Metro Area Express]] (MAX).
