This parish belonged to the [[Tavira Municipality]] until 1876.\n\n==History==\nFuseta, dates back to 1572, when it was then referred to as ''Fozeta'', a name that is derived from the diminutive for ''foz'' (referring to ''river mouth''); the ''Rio Tronoco'' disgorges into the sea from this location. Initially, the area was just a collection of small shacks used by fishermen to store tools for their fishing boats. Gradually, it developed into a small settlement.\n\nFuseta first appeared on the books during the Portuguese [[Age of Discovery]], when many of the villages fishermen shipped aboard the [[caravel]]s to the spice routes and expeditions in the Far East. [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], a nobleman and resident of this area, claimed to have discovered the land now known as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1500, beginning many of the Portuguese ventures onto the Grand Banks in search of codfish.\n\nThe oldest religious place of worship in Fuseta, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (''Our Lady of Carmo'') existed by 1758.

This parish belonged to the [[Tavira Municipality]] until 1876.\n\n==History==\nFuseta, dates back to 1572, when it was then referred to as ''Fozeta'', a name that is derived from the diminutive for ''foz'' (referring to ''river mouth''); the ''Rio Tronoco'' disgorges into the sea from this location. Initially, the area was just a collection of small shacks used by fishermen to store tools for their fishing boats. Gradually, it developed into a small settlement.\n\nFuseta first appeared on the books during the Portuguese [[Age of Discovery]], when many of the villages fishermen shipped aboard the [[caravel]]s to the spice routes and expeditions in the Far East. [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], a nobleman and resident of this area, claimed to have discovered the land now known as [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] in 1500, beginning many of the Portuguese ventures onto the Grand Banks in search of codfish.\n\nThe oldest religious place of worship in Fuseta, the Chapel of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (''Our Lady of Carmo'') existed by 1758. As the population grew, the Bishop of the Algarve, D. Francisco Gomes de Avelar, was petitioned to grant the ecumenical independence of the parish, which had previously been included in [[Moncarapacho]].

It is located east of [[Lagoa, Azores|Lagoa]] and [[Ponta Delgada]], west of [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]] and southeast of [[Ribeira Grande, S\u00e3o Miguel|Ribeira Grande]].\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest references to Furnas came from the harvesting of trees in the valley of Furnas, in order to assist the construction of many of the homes destroyed by the [[Timeline of natural disasters in the Azores|1522 earthquakes and landslides]] in [[Vila Franca do Campo]]. This includes numerous trees used to rebuild the parochial church, a project begun by [[Captaincies of the Azores#History#Donatary-Captaincy of S\u00e3o Miguel|Donatary-Captain]] [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara II|Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara]]. In 1553, his predecessor [[Manuel da C\u00e2mara]], issued an edict to re-plant these trees after the area was nearly deforested, and roadways were expanded under his son, [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara III|Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara]], in order to develop the area, allowing cattle herding in the valley after 1577.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.4</ref>\n\nStill during the tenure of [[Manuel da C\u00e2mara]], a chapel was constructed to the invocation of ''Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o'' (''Our Lady of Consolation'') in 1613, and small residence built for the local priest (who was responsible for masses and the lighting of a lamp in the sacristy). More homes soon appeared in this area around 1615, and a small convent was constructed near the chapel. In 1630, as a consequence of a volcanic eruption in the valley, the area was abandoned. But, new settlers quickly returned to the Furnas valley (mostly from [[Ponta Gar\u00e7a]], [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[Vila Franca do Campo|Vila Franca]] and [[Maia (Ribeira Grande)|Maia]]) as the land became fertile and better able to sustain a larger population. New roads were constructed on orders between 1682\u201383, donated by the Baron of Larangeiras.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.6-7</ref>\n\nEven isolated in the interior, the village continued to be vulnerable to pirate attacks. In 1679, [[Algiers|Algerian]] pirates (from the [[Barbary coast]]) landed in the ''Portinho de Agri\u00e3o'', sacked the coastal village of [[Ribeira Quente]], and proceeded to the interior, where they robbed several [[Sheep|rams]] from the valley before returning to the coast. Jos\u00e9 Pereira Sodr\u00e9, a resident near Agri\u00e3o petitioned the governor of S\u00e3o Miguel for one of the cannons that existed at the city hall in Vila Franca; he intended that the armament would be used to defend the area from future attacks: it was rejected.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.7-8</ref>\n\nIn 1832, an unknown English settler purchased a large parcel around the crater lake to build a home, but abandoned it and sold it to the English Consul-General at Ponta Delgada, named Vines, in 1855. There Mr. Vines constructed a summer home, with garden, which he named ''Gren\u00e1'' in honour of his wife's familial relations: his spouse was the niece of [[Daniel O'Connell]] (who organized the Catholic movement in Ireland) and stayed at their Irish relatives' home, also called ''Gren\u00e1''. Upon Consul Vine's death, the home was used by a London surgeon named Hinton (who was a publisher of many works on hygiene and hearing), since Catherine Vine did not wish to return to Furnas. After Hinton's death in 1875, the home was used by Jorge Brown, who exploited the home as a hotel for summer tourists for several years. During this period many travellers stayed at the hotel, including Alice Baker (who wrote \"A Summer in the Azores with a Glimpse of Madeira\") and others who produced literary and scientific reviews of the region. In 1882, Gren\u00e1 was sold by Catherine Vine's son to Jorge Hayes, following the death of Jorge Brown in the same year. It was occupied by [[Jos\u00e9 do Canto]] while his home and chapel were being constructed on the other side of the lake.\n\nIn June 1840, the population of the valley of Furnas numbered 1320 inhabitants scattered in 334 homes throughout the basin.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa, 1924, p.1</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Furnas Caldeiras Vulc\u00e2nicas \u2014aerial.webm|thumb|left|Furnas Caldeiras; aerial video]]\n[[File:Caldeira, Vale das Furnas, Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o, ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|left|One of the many geysers, hot-springs and fumaroles scattered in the center of the village of Furnas]]\n{{Infobox mountain\n| name             = Furnas\n| other_name       = Vale das Furnas\n| photo            = Furnas sao miguel.jpg\n| photo_size       = 235\n| photo_alt        = \n| photo_caption    = Hot-springs in the central village of Furnas, S\u00e3o Miguel\n| elevation        = \n| elevation_m      = 198\n| elevation_ft     = \n| elevation_ref    = \n| range            = Volcanic Complex of Furnas\n| prominence       = \n| prominence_m     = 795\n| prominence_ft    = \n| prominence_ref   = \n| parent_peak      = \n| location         = [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], [[Azores]]\n| map              = \n| map_alt          = \n| map_caption      = \n| map_size         = \n| label            = \n| label_position   = \n| coordinates      = {{coord|37|46|21|N|25|18|14|W|type:mountain_region:PT_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline}}\n| range_coordinates = \n| coordinates_ref  = \n| topo             = \n| type             = [[Stratovolcano]]\n| volcanic_arc/belt= [[Volcanic arc]]\n| age              = 30000\n| last_eruption    = September to November 1630\n| first_ascent     = \n| easiest_route    = \n| grid_ref_UK      = \n| grid_ref_Ireland = \n| listing          = \n}}\nFurnas is located in the easternmost of three active [[trachytic]] [[volcanoes]] on the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], in the historically active '''Volcanic Complex of Furnas'''. With a complicated 100,000 year history, the central caldera of the Furnas Volcano is a naturally explosive trachyte structure composed of two main calderas, that through formation, collapse and explosion have marked the natural history of the massif.<ref name=\"EvMorfo\">J.L. Gaspar et al. (1995), p.999-1001</ref> The oldest caldera has a diameter of approximately 7*5.5&nbsp;km whose escarpment cuts the lava structures of the neighbouring Volcanic Complex of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o to the north and northeast and southeast to valley of [[Ribeira Quente]].<ref name=EvMorfo/> The second caldera (4.5*3.5&nbsp;km diameter) dates back 35000 years (the youngest caldera) and is geomorphologically identifiable by the 200 metre wall to the north and northwest.<ref name=EvMorfo/> Within the caldera are numerous [[pumice]] cones and [[maars]] resulting from [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]] and Phreto-plinian eruptions from 5000 years.<ref name=EvMorfo/>\n\nOwing to the existence of a population of several thousand people living within and around its caldera it is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in archipelago.<ref>R. Gertisser et al. (2007), p.A318</ref> Throughout its history, volcanic activity at Furnas has been essentially explosive but eruptive styles have varied from mild effusive activity to at least two caldera-forming eruptions 30,000 and 12,000-10,000 years ago. It is considered very active, since ten sub-[[Plinian eruptions]] have occurred within the past 5,000&nbsp;years, producing a total area of 0.9 kilometres square of fairly homogeneous trachytic magma. The first known historical eruption occurred in 1440, just after early settlers started populating the coasts of S\u00e3o Miguel. The latest eruption occurred after the settlement of the Azores archipelago in 1630 A.D., and caused the deaths of 200 people. Eruptions of the Upper Furnas Group were mainly characterised by alternating episodes of magmatic and [[phreatomagmatic]] activity producing deposits of inter-bedded [[volcanic ash]] and [[lapilli]] that overlie the widespread main deposits from the adjacent Fogo volcano. At least three of these eruptions were accompanied by trachyte dome extrusions in the final phases of the eruption.\n\nThe western of the two calderas is partially filled by a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]], '''''Lagoa das Furnas''''', at an elevation of {{convert|359|m|ft}} and populated by several [[fumarole]]s and mud pools are located at the northern part of the lake. In the central part of the village, springs and geysers are prevalent; thirty springs, each of differing temperatures and chemical compositions, including warm iron-rich streams and piped examples of mineral-rich warm and cold water.  The geysers are situated in several basins rich in [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[boron]], [[fluorine]] and traces of [[carbon dioxide]]. The local inhabitants cook corn-type dishes in the geysers.

It is located east of [[Lagoa, Azores|Lagoa]] and [[Ponta Delgada]], west of [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]] and southeast of [[Ribeira Grande, S\u00e3o Miguel|Ribeira Grande]].\n\n==History==\nOne of the earliest references to Furnas came from the harvesting of trees in the valley of Furnas, in order to assist the construction of many of the homes destroyed by the [[Timeline of natural disasters in the Azores|1522 earthquakes and landslides]] in [[Vila Franca do Campo]]. This includes numerous trees used to rebuild the parochial church, a project begun by [[Captaincies of the Azores#History#Donatary-Captaincy of S\u00e3o Miguel|Donatary-Captain]] [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara II|Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara]]. In 1553, his predecessor [[Manuel da C\u00e2mara]], issued an edict to re-plant these trees after the area was nearly deforested, and roadways were expanded under his son, [[Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara III|Rui Gon\u00e7alves da C\u00e2mara]], in order to develop the area, allowing cattle herding in the valley after 1577.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.4</ref>\n\nStill during the tenure of [[Manuel da C\u00e2mara]], a chapel was constructed to the invocation of ''Nossa Senhora da Consola\u00e7\u00e3o'' (''Our Lady of Consolation'') in 1613, and small residence built for the local priest (who was responsible for masses and the lighting of a lamp in the sacristy). More homes soon appeared in this area around 1615, and a small convent was constructed near the chapel. In 1630, as a consequence of a volcanic eruption in the valley, the area was abandoned. But, new settlers quickly returned to the Furnas valley (mostly from [[Ponta Gar\u00e7a]], [[Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o]], [[Vila Franca do Campo|Vila Franca]] and [[Maia (Ribeira Grande)|Maia]]) as the land became fertile and better able to sustain a larger population. New roads were constructed on orders between 1682\u201383, donated by the Baron of Larangeiras.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.6-7</ref>\n\nEven isolated in the interior, the village continued to be vulnerable to pirate attacks. In 1679, [[Algiers|Algerian]] pirates (from the [[Barbary coast]]) landed in the ''Portinho de Agri\u00e3o'', sacked the coastal village of [[Ribeira Quente]], and proceeded to the interior, where they robbed several [[Sheep|rams]] from the valley before returning to the coast. Jos\u00e9 Pereira Sodr\u00e9, a resident near Agri\u00e3o petitioned the governor of S\u00e3o Miguel for one of the cannons that existed at the city hall in Vila Franca; he intended that the armament would be used to defend the area from future attacks: it was rejected.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa (1924), p.7-8</ref>\n\nIn 1832, an unknown English settler purchased a large parcel around the crater lake to build a home, but abandoned it and sold it to the English Consul-General at Ponta Delgada, named Vines, in 1855. There Mr. Vines constructed a summer home, with garden, which he named ''Gren\u00e1'' in honour of his wife's familial relations: his spouse was the niece of [[Daniel O'Connell]] (who organized the Catholic movement in Ireland) and stayed at their Irish relatives' home, also called ''Gren\u00e1''. Upon Consul Vine's death, the home was used by a London surgeon named Hinton (who was a publisher of many works on hygiene and hearing), since Catherine Vine did not wish to return to Furnas. After Hinton's death in 1875, the home was used by Jorge Brown, who exploited the home as a hotel for summer tourists for several years. During this period many travellers stayed at the hotel, including Alice Baker (who wrote \"A Summer in the Azores with a Glimpse of Madeira\") and others who produced literary and scientific reviews of the region. In 1882, Gren\u00e1 was sold by Catherine Vine's son to Jorge Hayes, following the death of Jorge Brown in the same year. It was occupied by [[Jos\u00e9 do Canto]] while his home and chapel were being constructed on the other side of the lake.\n\nIn June 1840, the population of the valley of Furnas numbered 1320 inhabitants scattered in 334 homes throughout the basin.<ref>Marquez de Jacome Corr\u00eaa, 1924, p.1</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical geography===\n[[File:Furnas Caldeiras Vulc\u00e2nicas \u2014aerial.webm|thumb|left|Furnas Caldeiras; aerial video]]\n[[File:Caldeira, Vale das Furnas, Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o, ilha de S\u00e3o Miguel, A\u00e7ores.JPG|thumb|left|One of the many geysers, hot-springs and fumaroles scattered in the center of the village of Furnas]]\n{{Infobox mountain\n| name             = Furnas\n| other_name       = Vale das Furnas\n| photo            = Furnas sao miguel.jpg\n| photo_size       = 235\n| photo_alt        = \n| photo_caption    = Hot-springs in the central village of Furnas, S\u00e3o Miguel\n| elevation        = \n| elevation_m      = 198\n| elevation_ft     = \n| elevation_ref    = \n| range            = Volcanic Complex of Furnas\n| prominence       = \n| prominence_m     = 795\n| prominence_ft    = \n| prominence_ref   = \n| parent_peak      = \n| location         = [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], [[Azores]]\n| map              = \n| map_alt          = \n| map_caption      = \n| map_size         = \n| label            = \n| label_position   = \n| coordinates      = {{coord|37|46|21|N|25|18|14|W|type:mountain_region:PT_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline}}\n| range_coordinates = \n| coordinates_ref  = \n| topo             = \n| type             = [[Stratovolcano]]\n| volcanic_arc/belt= [[Volcanic arc]]\n| age              = 30000\n| last_eruption    = September to November 1630\n| first_ascent     = \n| easiest_route    = \n| grid_ref_UK      = \n| grid_ref_Ireland = \n| listing          = \n}}\nFurnas is located in the easternmost of three active [[trachytic]] [[volcanoes]] on the island of [[S\u00e3o Miguel Island|S\u00e3o Miguel]], in the historically active '''Volcanic Complex of Furnas'''. With a complicated 100,000 year history, the central caldera of the Furnas Volcano is a naturally explosive trachyte structure composed of two main calderas, that through formation, collapse and explosion have marked the natural history of the massif.<ref name=\"EvMorfo\">J.L. Gaspar et al. (1995), p.999-1001</ref> The oldest caldera has a diameter of approximately 7*5.5&nbsp;km whose escarpment cuts the lava structures of the neighbouring Volcanic Complex of Povoa\u00e7\u00e3o to the north and northeast and southeast to valley of [[Ribeira Quente]].<ref name=EvMorfo/> The second caldera (4.5*3.5&nbsp;km diameter) dates back 35000 years (the youngest caldera) and is geomorphologically identifiable by the 200 metre wall to the north and northwest.<ref name=EvMorfo/> Within the caldera are numerous [[pumice]] cones and [[maars]] resulting from [[Plinian eruption|Plinian]] and Phreto-plinian eruptions from 5000 years.<ref name=EvMorfo/>\n\nOwing to the existence of a population of several thousand people living within and around its caldera it is considered one of the most dangerous volcanoes in archipelago.<ref>R. Gertisser et al. (2007), p.A318</ref> Throughout its history, volcanic activity at Furnas has been essentially explosive but eruptive styles have varied from mild effusive activity to at least two caldera-forming eruptions 30,000 and 12,000-10,000 years ago. It is considered very active, since ten sub-[[Plinian eruptions]] have occurred within the past 5,000&nbsp;years, producing a total area of 0.9 kilometres square of fairly homogeneous trachytic magma. The first known historical eruption occurred in 1440, just after early settlers started populating the coasts of S\u00e3o Miguel. The latest eruption occurred after the settlement of the Azores archipelago in 1630 A.D., and caused the deaths of 200 people. Eruptions of the Upper Furnas Group were mainly characterised by alternating episodes of magmatic and [[phreatomagmatic]] activity producing deposits of inter-bedded [[volcanic ash]] and [[lapilli]] that overlie the widespread main deposits from the adjacent Fogo volcano. At least three of these eruptions were accompanied by trachyte dome extrusions in the final phases of the eruption.\n\nThe western of the two calderas is partially filled by a [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]], '''''Lagoa das Furnas''''', at an elevation of {{convert|359|m|ft}} and populated by several [[fumarole]]s and mud pools are located at the northern part of the lake. In the central part of the village, springs and geysers are prevalent; thirty springs, each of differing temperatures and chemical compositions, including warm iron-rich streams and piped examples of mineral-rich warm and cold water.  The geysers are situated in several basins rich in [[sodium bicarbonate]], [[boron]], [[fluorine]] and traces of [[carbon dioxide]]. The local inhabitants cook corn-type dishes in the geysers. The installations of [[hydrotherapy]] are in the park and were built in the 19th century.\n\n==Economy==\nHistorically, the principal economy in the valley was the production of honey and wax: Jesuit priests had introduced this activity originally, producing a [[barrel (volume)|barrel]] or one-and-a-half barrels annually.
