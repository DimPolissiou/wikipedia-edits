The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian diplomatic victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a preeminent military commander.\n\n==Context and causes==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg\u2013Prussia]] in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the latter war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian support in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia, where the bulk of the war was fought]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters and supply his army at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to defend Prussia's coast against Russia, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under [[Field Marshal]] [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in [[East Prussia]] to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in [[Farther Pomerania]]; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, in August 1756 he personally led the main Prussian army of around 60,000 into Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref>\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict. Decisive field battles were relatively rare, though they played a larger part in Frederick's theory of warfare than was typical among his contemporary rivals.<ref>{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=67\u201380}}</ref>\n\nThe Silesian Wars and most European wars of the eighteenth century were fought as so-called [[cabinet wars]] in which disciplined [[regular armies]] were equipped and supplied by the state to conduct warfare on behalf of the sovereign's interests. Occupied enemy territories were regularly taxed and extorted for funds, but large-scale atrocities against civilian populations were rare compared with conflicts in the previous century.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|p=209}}</ref> [[Military logistics]] was the decisive factor in many wars, as armies had grown too large to support themselves on prolonged campaigns by foraging and plunder alone. Military supplies were stored in centralised [[Supply depot|magazines]] and distributed by [[baggage train]]s that were highly vulnerable to enemy raids.<ref>{{Harvp|Creveld|1977|pp=26\u201328}}</ref> Armies were generally unable to sustain combat operations during winter and normally established [[Cantonment|winter quarters]] in the cold season, resuming their campaigns with the return of spring.<ref name=\"Black 38\"/>\n\n==Course==\n===1756===\n====Invasion of Saxony====\n[[File:Map for the Silesian and Seven Years Wars.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Central Europe with coloured territories|The Central European borders of Brandenburg\u2013Prussia (blue-green) and the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (red) in 1756, at the outbreak of the Third Silesian War|upright=1.2]]\nPrussian troops crossed the Saxon frontier on 29 August 1756.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=198\u2013199}}</ref> The Prussian army marched in three columns: on the right were about 15,000 men under the command of [[Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick-Wolfenb\u00fcttel|Prince Ferdinand of Brunswick]]; on the left were 18,000 men under the command of the [[Augustus William, Duke of Brunswick-Bevern|Duke of Brunswick-Bevern]]; in the centre was Frederick himself, with Field Marshal [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]] commanding a corps of 30,000 troops. Prince Ferdinand was to advance on the town of [[Chemnitz]] and proceed to [[Leipzig]], while Bevern was to traverse [[Lusatia]] to seize [[Bautzen]]. Meanwhile, Frederick and Keith would advance through [[Torgau]] to attack the Saxon capital at [[Dresden]].<ref name=\"Asprey 427\"/><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=317}}</ref> Saxony and Austria were unprepared for Frederick's preemptive strike, and their forces were scattered; as Prussians streamed into the Electorate, the main Saxon army fortified itself at [[Pirna]], and the Prussians occupied Dresden on 9 September against little resistance.<ref>{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=428}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=318\u2013319}}</ref>\n\nFrederick and the main Prussian army pressed on into northern Bohemia, looking to engage the Austrians under General [[Maximilian Ulysses Browne]] before they could join forces with the Saxons.

In February [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]], the new [[Leader of the House of Commons]] and a determined foe of France, persuaded the British Parliament to firmly and finally commit to the Prussian cause against Austria and France, after which Britain began delivering supplies and badly needed subsidies to Berlin. Parliament also approved the deployment of an [[army of observation]] to defend Hanover (and [[Brandenburg]]) against the coming [[Invasion of Hanover (1757)|French invasion]] from the west,<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=334\u2013336}}</ref> and Frederick again called for a British naval deployment in the Baltic to deter Russia and an increasingly unfriendly Sweden, though nothing came of it.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=333}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Prussia's aggressive attack on Saxony galvanised the Austrian coalition, and in particular increased France's commitment to offensive war against Prussia. The [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] met in January in [[Regensburg]], where Maria Theresa won enough German princes to her cause that the Holy Roman Empire [[Reichskrieg|declared war on Prussia]] on 17 January; the Diet called for a 40,000-man ''[[Reichsarmee]]'' to be assembled and put at Austria's disposal for the liberation of Saxony.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=331\u2013332}}</ref> In May 1757 the [[Second Treaty of Versailles]] strengthened the Franco-Austrian Alliance, with the French agreeing to contribute 129,000 soldiers to the fighting in Germany, along with subsidies of 12 million [[French livre|livres]] per year until Austria had recovered Silesia.<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=199\u2013200}}</ref>\n\nIn return, Austria promised that after the victory was won it would grant France control of the [[Austrian Netherlands]], a long-coveted prize for the French. Russia also committed 80,000 men to the conflict, hoping to seize East Prussia and then exchange that territory with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]] for control of [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia|Courland]]. Sweden also agreed to invade [[Province of Pomerania (1653\u20131815)|Prussian Pomerania]], looking to recovering the territories [[Treaties of Stockholm (Great Northern War)|lost to Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]]. In all, then, the Austrian coalition sought a total [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of the Kingdom of Prussia,<ref name=\"Clark 199-200\"/> all while portraying Frederick as the aggressor for making the first move to open war.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=311\u2013312}}</ref>\n\n====Bohemian campaign and Battle of Kol\u00edn====\n[[File:Johann Christoph Frisch - Death of Field Marshal Schwerin.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of Prussian Field Marshal Schwerin dying at the Battle of Prague|Prussian Field Marshal [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] dying of wounds at the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]], as depicted by [[Johann Christoph Frisch]]|upright=1.2]]\nAfter wintering in Saxony, Frederick decided to immediately invade Bohemia again, before French or Russian forces could reach the area and support the Austrians.<ref name=\"Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337}}</ref> On 18 April 1757 the main Prussian army advanced in multiple columns through the [[Ore Mountains]], seeking a decisive engagement with Browne's forces,<ref>{{Harvp|Marston|2001|p=37}}</ref> while the Silesian garrison under Schwerin advanced from [[K\u0142odzko|Glatz]] to join them.<ref name=\"Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=337\"/> On 21 April Bevern's column encountered an Austrian corps led by [[Christian Moritz Graf K\u00f6nigsegg und Rothenfels|Count K\u00f6nigsegg]] near [[Liberec|Reichenberg]]; the ensuing [[Battle of Reichenberg]] ended in a Prussian victory, and the Prussian forces continued to advance on [[Prague]].<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=340}}</ref>\n\nThe invading columns reunited north of Prague, while the retreating Austrians reformed under the command of [[Prince Charles Alexander of Lorraine|Prince Charles of Lorraine]] to the city's east, and on 6 May the two armies fought the [[Battle of Prague (1757)|Battle of Prague]].

The resulting [[Battle of Kol\u00edn]] on 18 June ended in a decisive Austrian victory; the Prussian position was ruined, and the invaders were forced to lift the siege and withdraw from Bohemia altogether, pursued by Daun's army, which was enlarged by the Prague garrison.

In October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the weakened town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea,<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=492}}</ref> and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland.

On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May [[Treaty of Hamburg (1762)|Treaty of Hamburg]], ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1 June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\" had occurred.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=457\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in [[French and Indian War|North America]] and [[Third Carnatic War|India]], and a lack of progress in the Rhineland.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=498}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 469\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=469}}</ref> After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands.

With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], in the forthcoming [[1764 Imperial election]].

Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars.

The war was fought mainly in Silesia, [[Bohemia]] and [[Upper Saxony]] and formed one [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] of the [[Seven Years' War]]. It was the last of three [[Silesian Wars]] fought between [[Frederick the Great]]'s Prussia and [[Maria Theresa]]'s Austria in the mid-18th century, all three of which ended in Prussian control of Silesia.\n\nThis conflict can be viewed as a continuation of the [[First Silesian War|First]] and [[Second Silesian War]]s of the previous decade. After the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] ended the [[War of the Austrian Succession]], Austria enacted broad reforms and [[Diplomatic Revolution|upended its traditional diplomatic policy]] to prepare for renewed war with Prussia. As with the previous Silesian Wars, no particular triggering event initiated the conflict; rather, Prussia struck opportunistically to disrupt its enemies' plans. The war's cost in blood and treasure was high on both sides, and it ended inconclusively when neither of the main belligerents could sustain the conflict any longer.\n\nThe war began with a Prussian invasion of [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxony]] in mid-1756, and it ended in a Prussian diplomatic victory with the 1763 [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], which confirmed Prussian control of Silesia. The treaty resulted in no territorial changes, but Austria agreed to recognise Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia in return for Prussia's support for the election of Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], as [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. The conflict formed part of the ongoing [[Austria\u2013Prussia rivalry]] that would shape German politics for more than a century. The war greatly enhanced the prestige of Prussia, which won general recognition as a major European power, and of Frederick, who cemented his reputation as a preeminent military commander.\n\n==Context and causes==\n{{Further|First Silesian War|Second Silesian War}}\n[[File:Europe 1748-1766 en.png|thumb|alt=Map of European political borders in 1756|Europe in the years after the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]], with [[Kingdom of Prussia|Brandenburg\u2013Prussia]] in violet and the Habsburg Monarchy in gold|upright=1.2]]\nWhile the [[Seven Years' War]] was a global conflict among many belligerents, its [[Central Europe]]an theatre turned on lingering grudges from the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (1741\u20131748). The [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], which had concluded the latter war, confirmed Prussian King [[Frederick the Great|Frederick II]]'s seizure of the region of [[Silesia]] from the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] through two [[Silesian Wars]].<ref name=\"Fraser 202\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=202}}</ref> The defeated Archduchess [[Maria Theresa]] of Austria nevertheless fully intended to retake the lost province and reassert Austria's hegemony in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; after peace was restored, she set about rebuilding her armed forces and seeking out new alliances.<ref>{{Harvp|Wilson|2016|pp=478\u2013479}}</ref>\n\n===Unresolved conflicts===\nThough [[Early modern France|France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] recognised Prussia's sovereignty in Silesia under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle, Austria ultimately refused to ratify the agreement, and Maria Theresa's husband, [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]], withheld the Holy Roman Empire's guarantee for Prussian control of the contested province. Prussia, in turn, still withheld its assent to the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1713|Pragmatic Sanction]], thus challenging Maria Theresa's legitimacy as head of the Habsburg Monarchy.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/> Despite dynastic links, British King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] viewed Prussia as an ally and proxy of the French, while Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia]] saw Frederick's kingdom as a rival for influence in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and feared that Prussia's growing power would obstruct the path of Russia's westward expansion.<ref name=\"Shennan 49\">{{Harvp|Shennan|2005|p=49}}</ref> The political and diplomatic conditions that had led to the previous Silesian Wars still held, and further conflict seemed likely.<ref name=\"Fraser 202\"/>\n\nIn 1746 Maria Theresa formed a defensive agreement with Elizabeth known as the [[Treaty of Two Empresses]], which aligned [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] against Prussia; a secret clause guaranteed Russia's support for Austria's claims in Silesia. In 1750 Britain joined the anti-Prussian compact in return for guarantees of Austrian and Russian support in the case of a Prussian attack on the [[Electorate of Hanover]], which George also ruled in [[personal union]].<ref name=\"Shennan 49\"/> At the same time, Maria Theresa, who had been disappointed with Britain's performance as [[Anglo-Austrian Alliance|her ally]] in the War of the Austrian Succession, followed the controversial advice of her Chancellor [[Wenzel Anton von Kaunitz]] by pursuing warmer relations with Austria's [[French\u2013Habsburg relations|longstanding rival]], the Kingdom of France.<ref>{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=197\u2013198}}</ref>\n\n===Diplomatic Revolution===\nBritain elevated tensions in 1755 by offering to finance the deployment of a Russian army that would stand ready to attack Prussia's eastern frontier. Alarmed by this encirclement, Frederick began working to separate Britain from the Austrian coalition by allaying King George's concern for Hanover. On 16 January 1756 Prussia and Britain agreed to the [[Convention of Westminster]], under which Prussia now undertook to guarantee Hanover against French attack, in return for Britain's withdrawal of its offer of military subsidies to Russia. This move created a new [[Anglo-Prussian alliance (1756)|Anglo-Prussian alliance]] and incensed the French court.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=297\u2013301}}</ref>\n\nAustria was now seeking warmer relations with France to ensure that the French would not take Prussia's side in a future conflict over Silesia. King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] responded to Prussia's realignment with Britain by accepting Maria Theresa's invitation to a new [[Franco-Austrian alliance]], formalised with the [[First Treaty of Versailles]] in May 1756. This series of political manoeuvres came to be known as the [[Diplomatic Revolution]].<ref>{{Harvp|Horn|1957|pp=449\u2013464}}</ref><ref>{{Harvp|Black|1990|pp=301\u2013323}}</ref> Russia, likewise upset by the withdrawal of Britain's promised subsidies, drew closer to Austria and France, agreeing to a more openly offensive anti-Prussian coalition in April 1756. As France turned against Prussia and Russia separated from Britain, Kaunitz's plan thus matured into a grand anti-Prussian alliance between Austria, Russia, various lesser German powers, and France.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=293\u2013294}}</ref>\n\n===Preparations for war===\n[[File:Crown of Bohemia 1648.png|thumb|alt=Map of political borders in Central Europe in the early 1700s|Map of the [[Central Europe]]an region, prior to Prussia's seizure of Silesia, where the bulk of the war was fought]]\nAs Austria and Russia made open preparations for renewed war, Frederick became convinced that Prussia would be attacked in early 1757. Rather than wait for his enemies to move at a time of their choosing, he resolved instead to act preemptively, beginning with an attack against the neighbouring [[Electorate of Saxony]], which he correctly believed was a secret party to the coalition against him.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=310}}</ref> Frederick's broad strategy had three parts. First, he meant to occupy Saxony, gaining [[strategic depth]] and using the Saxon army and treasury to bolster the Prussian war effort. Second, he would advance from Saxony into [[Bohemia]], where he might set up winter quarters and supply his army at Austria's expense. Third, he would invade [[Moravia]] from Silesia, seize the fortress at [[Olm\u00fctz]], and advance on [[Vienna]] to force an end to the war.<ref name=\"Asprey 427\">{{Harvp|Asprey|1986|p=427}}</ref> He hoped to receive financial support from the British, who had also promised to send a naval squadron into the [[Baltic Sea]] to defend Prussia's coast against Russia, if necessary.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=308}}</ref>\n\nTo begin, Frederick divided Prussia's armies in three. He placed a force of 20,000 under [[Field Marshal]] [[Hans von Lehwaldt]] in [[East Prussia]] to guard against any Russian invasion from the east, with a reserve of 8,000 standing in [[Farther Pomerania]]; Russia should have been able to bring irresistible force to bear against East Prussia, but the King trusted to the slowness and disorganisation of the Russian army to defend his north-eastern flank. He also stationed Field Marshal Count [[Kurt Christoph Graf von Schwerin|Kurt von Schwerin]] in Silesia with 25,000 men to deter incursions from Moravia and Hungary. Finally, in August 1756 he personally led the main Prussian army of around 60,000 into Saxony, beginning the Third Silesian War.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=317\u2013318}}</ref>\n\n===Methods and technologies===\n{{Further|Early modern warfare}}\nEuropean warfare in the [[early modern period]] was characterised by the widespread adoption of [[firearm]]s in combination with more traditional [[bladed weapons]]. Eighteenth-century European armies were built around units of massed [[infantry]] armed with [[smoothbore]] [[flintlock musket]]s and [[bayonet]]s. [[Cavalry]] units of various weights armed with [[sabre]]s and [[pistol]]s were used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[shock tactics]]. Smoothbore [[artillery]] provided [[fire support]] and played the leading role in [[siege warfare]].<ref name=\"Black 38\">{{Harvp|Black|1994|pp=38\u201352}}</ref> Strategic warfare in this period centred around control of key [[fortification]]s positioned so as to command the surrounding regions and roads, with lengthy sieges a common feature of armed conflict.

Prussia could field only 104,000 troops, many of them raw recruits, and there were shortages of even basic supplies like muskets for the infantry. The Prussian army was no longer fit for the sort of aggressive manoeuvers that had previously characterised Frederick's tactics,<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=427\u2013428}}</ref> and the kingdom's situation was desperate.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=491}}</ref> Daun, the chief Austrian commander, also ruled out major offensives for the year and made no plans to even attempt to reconquer Silesia, preferring to concentrate his efforts in Saxony against Prince Henry. Austria's finances were in a state of chaos, and its economy was choked by heavy war taxes. Cooperation between Russian and Austrian forces was breaking down, as the two allied powers grew less willing to pursue each other's goals in the field.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|pp=429\u2013431}}</ref>\n\n====Russian advances====\n[[File:Fall of Kolberg in 1761.jpg|thumb|alt=Painting of ragged Prussian soldiers retreating through a winter landscape after abandoning Kolberg|Defeated Prussians withdrawing as Russians [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|take control of Kolberg]], as depicted by Alexander von Kotzebue|upright=1.2]]\nRussian Marshal [[Alexander Buturlin]], the new commander of Russia's forces in the theatre, coordinated with Laudon's Austrians to begin an advance in southern Silesia in April.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=435}}</ref> The Prussian garrison under General [[Karl Christoph von der Goltz]] dug in around Schweidnitz, while field armies under Frederick, Laudon and Buturlin engaged in a prolonged campaign of manoeuver with no major engagements. The allies ended the campaign with a modest victory by storming the fortress at Schweidnitz on 1 October, after which the Prussians fell back to winter quarters in northern Silesia and Brandenburg.<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=452}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, Russian forces under [[Zakhar Chernyshev]] and [[Pyotr Rumyantsev]] had [[Siege of Kolberg (1761)|besieged and blockaded]] the Prussian Pomeranian port of [[Kolberg]] beginning on 22 August. The town was strongly defended and held out well, but several Prussian attempts to break the siege were unsuccessful. In October Frederick ordered much of the garrison to withdraw to Berlin and defend Brandenburg; the weakened town finally capitulated on 16 December. The fall of Kolberg cost Prussia its last port on the Baltic Sea,<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=492}}</ref> and it gave Russia a way to supply its armies in Central Europe by sea, rather than overland through Poland.

A total Prussian collapse seemed imminent; the British now threatened to withdraw their subsidies if Prussia did not offer concessions to secure peace, a threat that was made good later that year by the new British prime minister, [[John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute|Lord Bute]].<ref>{{Harvp|Redman|2014|p=472}}</ref> Then, on 5 January 1762 the ailing Russian Empress Elizabeth died. Her nephew and successor, Tsar [[Peter III of Russia|Peter III]], was an ardent admirer of Frederick's, and he at once reversed Elizabeth's foreign policy and ordered a [[ceasefire]] with Prussia.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\">{{Harvp|Clark|2006|pp=204\u2013205}}</ref>\n\nPeter agreed to an [[armistice]] with Prussia in March and lifted the Russian occupation of East Prussia and Pomerania, redirecting his armies to [[Mecklenburg]] to threaten [[Denmark\u2013Norway|Denmark]] with war over his claims on the [[Duchy of Holstein-Gottorp]]. On 15 May Russia and Prussia formally ended their war with the [[Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1762)|Treaty of Saint Petersburg]], confirming Prussia's pre-war borders in the north and east. Peter went on to mediate the 22 May [[Treaty of Hamburg (1762)|Treaty of Hamburg]], ending the Pomeranian War between Prussia and Sweden, with all of Prussia's Pomeranian territory preserved. After signing a new alliance with Prussia on 1 June, he even placed Chernyshev's corps of 18,000 Russian troops under Frederick's command; a second \"Miracle of the House of Brandenburg\" had occurred.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|pp=457\u2013460}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, French morale had been sapped by prolonged British blockades, defeats in [[French and Indian War|North America]] and [[Third Carnatic War|India]], and a lack of progress in the Rhineland.<ref>{{Harvp|Anderson|2000|p=498}}</ref><ref name=\"Fraser 469\">{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=469}}</ref> After Russia's about-face and Sweden's withdrawal, King Louis realised that France was unlikely to gain its promised reward of the Austrian Netherlands. Austria was virtually bankrupt, and without French subsidies Maria Theresa could not afford a new invasion of Silesia; with France similarly exhausted, Louis was no longer willing to finance his ally's war. Since France had never formally declared war on Prussia, he agreed to a ceasefire with Frederick and evacuated Prussia's territories in the Rhineland, ending France's involvement in the war in Germany.<ref>{{Harvp|Mitford|Schillinger|2013|pp=242\u2013243}}</ref>\n\n====Final campaigns====\n[[File:Sachse 1750 bis 1850 pg63 Die Freiberger Schlacht am 29.

The Prussian army, swollen by forces recalled from the north and soon to be augmented by Chernyshev's Russians, could once again match the Austrians' strength in the field, and in June the Prussians marched again to contest Silesia.<ref>{{Harvp|Fraser|2000|p=461}}</ref> However, on 9 July Peter was deposed and replaced by his wife, Empress Catherine II (later to be known as [[Catherine the Great]]); Catherine immediately withdrew from the alliance her husband had formed with Prussia, but she did not rejoin the war on the Austrian side.<ref name=\"Clark 204-5\"/>\n\nDespite the loss of their Russian auxiliaries, the Prussians engaged Daun's army on 21 July near [[Burkersdorf]], north-east of Schweidnitz.

The warring parties eventually agreed to simply restore their respective conquests to each other: Austria would withdraw from Glatz, restoring full Prussian control of Silesia, in exchange for Prussia's evacuation of Saxony, which would be returned to Frederick Augustus, who would receive no other reparations from Prussia. With these swaps, the borders in the region arrived precisely back at the ''[[status quo ante bellum]]''.<ref name=\"Schweizer 250\"/> Austria made a further concession by formally renouncing its claim to Silesia; in return, Prussia committed to support Maria Theresa's son, [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Joseph]], in the forthcoming [[1764 Imperial election]]. With that, the belligerents agreed to end the Third Silesian War with the [[Treaty of Hubertusburg]], signed 15 February 1763.<ref name=\"Carlyle XX-XIII\"/>\n\n==Outcomes==\n[[File:Johann Esaias Nilson Hubertusburger Frieden ubs G 0335 II.jpg|thumb|alt=Engraving of the faces of the monarchs who participated in the Third Silesian War set against an allegorical scene representing the return of peace|Contemporary engraving celebrating the restoration of peace in Germany, by [[Johannes Esaias Nilson]]|upright=1.2]]\nThe return to territorial ''status quo ante'' meant that none of the belligerents in the Silesian War gained the prizes they had aimed at: Prussia was unable to keep any part of Saxony, while Austria failed to recover its lost province of Silesia. Nonetheless, the outcome of the war has generally been considered a diplomatic victory for Prussia,<ref>{{Harvp|Browning|2005|p=530}}</ref> which not only retained Silesia, but also compelled Austria to acknowledge its sovereignty in the province, forestalling any further Silesian Wars.

In 2009, Peterson played third on her junior rink, [[Skip (curling)|skipped]] by [[Alexandra Carlson]]. After winning the U.S. junior title, the team would represent the United States at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]]. The team finished the round robin with a 4-5 record, finishing 5th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/Details/304|title=World Junior Curling Championships 2009: Tournament details|website=results.worldcurling.org|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 2010, the Carlson rink won another U.S. junior title, sending the team to the [[2010 World Junior Curling Championships]]. At the 2010 World Juniors, the team finished the round robin in a tie for third place with a 6-3 record. The team won their first playoff match against Switzerland's [[Manuela Siegrist]], before losing in the semi-final to Sweden's [[Anna Hasselborg]]. That demoted the team to the bronze medal game where they defeated Switzerland again to finish third overall.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/Details/375|title=World Junior Curling Championships 2010: Tournament details|website=results.worldcurling.org|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref>\n\n=== 2010-2014 ===\nAfter her junior career ended in 2010, Peterson joined the [[Allison Pottinger]] rink at [[Lead (curling)|lead]] position. In their first year together, the team lost in the final of the [[2011 United States Women's Curling Championship]] to [[Patti Lank]]. The following season, they avenged this loss by beating [[Cassandra Johnson]]'s rink to win the [[2012 United States Women's Curling Championship]]. This sent the Pottinger team to the [[2012 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]] to represent the U.S. The team finished the round robin at the 2012 Worlds in a tie with Canada's [[Heather Nedohin]] for fourth place and a 7-4 record.

The team found more success in the 2013-14 season. They won one [[World Curling Tour]] (WCT) event over the season, the 2013 [[Kamloops Crown of Curling]]. Their success on the World Curling Tour gave them enough points to qualify for the [[2014 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]], following new rules made by the [[United States Curling Association]] which based World Championship qualifying on Order of Merit points rather than winning the U.S. Championship.

In 2009, Peterson played third on her junior rink, [[Skip (curling)|skipped]] by [[Alexandra Carlson]]. After winning the U.S. junior title, the team would represent the United States at the [[2009 World Junior Curling Championships]]. The team finished the round robin with a 4-5 record, finishing 5th.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://results.worldcurling.org/Championship/Details/304|title=World Junior Curling Championships 2009: Tournament details|website=results.worldcurling.org|access-date=2019-06-06}}</ref> In 2010, the Carlson rink won another U.S. junior title, sending the team to the [[2010 World Junior Curling Championships]].

The following season, they avenged this loss by beating [[Cassandra Johnson]]'s rink to win the [[2012 United States Women's Curling Championship]]. This sent the Pottinger team to the [[2012 Ford World Women's Curling Championship]] to represent the U.S. The team finished the round robin at the 2012 Worlds in a tie with Canada's [[Heather Nedohin]] for fourth place and a 7-4 record.
