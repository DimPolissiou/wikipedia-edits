After working in the [[Conservative Research Department]] from 1968 to 1976 he was elected as an [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]]. He became a prominent backbench MP and was appointed to the position of Minister of Higher Education in April 1992. In December 1992 he resigned from this post \"for personal reasons\".\n\nHe lost his seat in Parliament in the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]] and subsequently worked as a lecturer, writer and instructor. He was married to Susan Forman in 1971 and the couple had no children.<ref>'Junior Education Minister resigns', Times article 12 December 1992</ref>\n\n==Early career==\nForman was born in [[Simla]], India where his father served as a brigadier in the Indian Army. Forman was educated at the  [[Dragon School]] and [[Shrewsbury School]], then afterwards went to [[New College, Oxford]], [[College of Europe]] (Bruges), [[Harvard University]] and [[Sussex University]]. He obtained various degrees from these institutions including a [[Master of Public Administration]] from Harvard, a [[Certificate of Advanced European Studies]] (equivalent to a master's degree) from the College of Europe (class of 1965-1966) and a [[Ph.D]] from [[Sussex University]]. In his Times obituary he was described as \"something of a perpetual student\". His first significant job was from 1967 to 1968 as an information officer at the [[Confederation of British Industry]].\n\nIn 1968 he joined the Conservative Research Department ('CRD' - the research operation of the Conservative Party) and began the quest to find himself a seat in Parliament.<ref>BBC Parliamentary profiles :[https://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/candidates/292.htm Nigel Forman]</ref> He progressed rapidly in the CRD, acting as \u2018external affairs adviser\u2019 to [[Edward Heath]] while the latter was leader of the opposition. He served [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the same capacity from 1975 to 1976. He achieved the rank of assistant director with special responsibility for European affairs,\n\nHe contested the [[Coventry North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North East constituency]] for the Conservatives in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] but was not elected.<ref>February 1974 general election results :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74a/i06.htm Coventry North East]</ref> After the elevation of [[Robert Carr]] MP to the peerage in 1976, Forman was adopted as the Conservative candidate for the parliamentary seat (Carshalton) that Carr was vacating.\n\n==Backbench MP, 1976 to 1992==\nForman was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Carshalton (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton, Carshalton]] at a [[by-election]] on 11 March 1976. He took the seat with a 10,000 majority over Labour, compared with Carr's 4,000 majority in October 1974. When constituency boundaries were revised for the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 election]], his seat was renamed [[Carshalton and Wallington (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton and Wallington]].\n\nHis Carshalton parliamentary seat was part of the [[London Borough of Sutton]] and was very mixed in character. It contained large estates of Council housing and areas with expensive detached houses. All three major parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal) had significant support in the seat and Forman's position was therefore always potentially vulnerable to [[tactical voting]].  His constituency Conservative party and the Conservative leaders of Sutton Borough Council soon showed themselves to be resistant to concepts of modernisation that Forman sought to promote. Sutton was one of the few remaining councils in the UK that had retained [[selective education]] and council meetings were unusual in that Conservative councillors wore ceremonial robes in order to \"give dignity\" to the proceedings.\n\nForman soon established himself as a bright and enthusiastic MP. During his first three months in the House he asked 64 formal questions of Ministers in the Labour government. His particular areas of interest were nuclear power, [[incomes policy]], education policy and ministerial patronage. After the Conservatives returned to government in 1979, it was widely expected that Forman would soon obtain ministerial office. He served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) first to [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] in the Foreign Office and later to [[Douglas Hurd]] in the Home Office. However, promotion beyond that was slow in coming.\n\nForman soon became known as a left-wing Conservative MP who differed with the policy of the Thatcher government on a number of key issues. In 1980 he spoke in favour of substantially increasing child benefits, he opposed reduction in the time limit for abortions, opposed [[capital punishment]] and spoke in favour of [[James Prior]]\u2019s attempt to secure compulsory ballots in trade union votes through voluntary agreement with unions. He also expressed alarm at the manner in which unemployment was spiralling upwards as a result of the government\u2019s economic policies. He frequently used the code word \"one nation\" in his speeches and writings \u2013 indicating disapproval of government policies which were perceived to be divisive. He favoured closer integration of Britain with the [[European Union]].\n\nIn February 1981, Labour MPs cheered him in the House when he asked Chancellor Howe to act in order to halt the rise in unemployment. Forman advocated employment and economic policies which were broadly consistent with those pursued by the previous Labour government. He acquired the image of being a Conservative opponent of [[Thatcherism]]. All this raised his profile in the House but it did not enhance his promotion prospects. In a 1983 Times article, the senior Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] noted that Forman had been overlooked for promotion and that his obvious abilities were not being used.\n\nIn 1984 Forman stood for the Chairmanship of the Conservative backbench finance committee as a left-wing \"one nation\" Tory \u2013 against  incumbent right-winger Sir William Clark. Forman lost but had become clearly identified with \"wets\" and the [[One Nation Conservatism|one-nation]] group of Conservative MPs. In 1985, Forman published a pamphlet titled ''\u201cWork to be done : employment policy for 1985 and beyond\u201d''. This was deeply critical of current government policy and advocated a package of measures to stimulate employment.\n\nForman's progressive views did not endear him to the leadership of his constituency Conservatives in Carshalton. Many of them regarded him as disloyal to Margaret Thatcher and a traitor. There were repeated attempts to deselect him. Matters came to a head in 1986 after the Liberal SDP Alliance took control of Sutton Borough Council from the Conservatives. Forman publicly attributed this to the shortcomings of the local Conservative leadership.  \n  \nThe matter is described in the following extract from an article in the Times dated 21 May 1987:<blockquote>''\u201cThe Carshalton Conservative Association suffers from bigots and zealots who indulge in internecine warfare. Not Labour smear tactics, nor Alliance innuendo, but the words of its Conservative MP, Mr Nigel Forman. Several attempts to deselect Mr Forman failed. But when the election was called last week, five of the seven senior officers took their revenge on the beleaguered MP by resigning.\u201d'' \u2013 ''The Times'', May 1987.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Forman comfortably held his seat in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]]. His radical image tended to prevent Labour and Liberal supporters indulging in tactical voting (that is, jointly backing his strongest opponent) in order to turn him out. Forman appeared to be more popular in Carshalton than was the local Conservative party and his political fortunes seemed to be in the ascendant.<blockquote>''\u201cHas Chancellor Nigel Lawson gone soft? Yesterday he appointed as his PPS a Tory so wet he drips. As recently as last year, Nigel Forman, vice-chairman of the party's backbench finance committee, was publicly calling on the Chancellor to 'give top priority to the unemployment challenge'. The year before, in Mastering British Politics, he wrote: 'Occasionally, in the course of its long history, the Conservative party has been swept along on the wave of some particular ideology, but such periods have not usually lasted or brought enduring political success'.\u201d'' \u2013 \"Rising Damp\", ''The Times'', June 1987.</blockquote>\n\nThe ideology Forman referred to was the then fashionable combination of [[supply side economics]], [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]] known in the 1980s as [[Thatcherism]].  After Mrs Thatcher was forced from office in late 1990 it was considered only a matter of time before Forman would be promoted.<ref>Times 5 July 2017 [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nigel-forman-wtqlj290z obituary]</ref>\n\n==Minister of Higher Education, April 1992 to December 1992==\n<blockquote>''\u201cThe omission of Nigel Forman, from successive ministerial reshuffles over the past few years has surprised many at Westminster when several apparently less talented politicians have secured top posts. But after 16 years in the Commons, he has become an under-secretary at the education department\u201d''<ref>''The Times'', 15 April 1992.</ref></blockquote>\n\nImmediately after the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election in April 1992]] Forman was appointed Under Secretary of State for Education (with the job title Minister of Higher and Further Education) under Education Secretary [[John Patten, Baron Patten|John Patten]]. During his tenure of office, Forman dealt with high-profile issues such as the financing of student unions, student loans and the quality assurance of degrees issued by the new universities. Forman unexpectedly resigned from his ministerial post on 11 December 1992 for \"personal reasons\". The nature of those personal reasons was never disclosed. Colleagues commented that Forman was \"a very private man\" and nobody claimed to know why he had resigned.\n\nThereafter, Forman's political career went into decline. His political interests appeared to become more theoretical in nature. In January 1996 the [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos 'think tank']] published a paper written by him on reform of the income tax system. Demos was generally considered to be closely associated with [[New Labour]].<ref>[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/singleratetax Forman research paper], demos.co.uk; accessed 12 October 2015.</ref> At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Forman lost his seat to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate [[Tom Brake]].<ref>1997 general election result:[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/constit/070.htm Carshalton & Wallington]</ref> Forman's 10,000 vote majority in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was converted into a 2,000 vote Liberal Democrat majority with a 12% swing from Conservative to Lib Dem.\n\n==After Parliament==\nForman initially developed a portfolio of lecturing and writing work. In 1999 he joined the faculty of [[Wroxton Abbey|Wroxton College]], the UK (Oxfordshire) campus of [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] (FDU).<ref>:[http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=328 Dr Nigel Forman profile  deadlink], fdu.edu; accessed 12 October 2015.</ref>\n\nForman delivered courses for \u2018Westminster Explained\u2019, Parliament's own in-house training facility which provides courses to members of both Houses and the wider public service. His later publications included \"Constitutional Change in the UK\" (Routledge, 2004 \u2013 a study of recent change introduced by New Labour) and \"Mastering British Politics\", (4th edition, update of a standard text, Macmillan, 1999). He was a visiting lecturer at [[Essex University]] and an honorary research fellow at [[University College London]].\n\nForman died of dementia-related issues on 11 May 2017. In the last year of his life he was reported to have been dismayed by the result of the 2016 [[Brexit referendum]] and to have stated that the UK had become a country he hardly knew. However, obituarists drew attention to his comment (quoted above) published thirty years earlier concerning the tendency of the Conservative party to be occasionally swept along in particular ideologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2017/05/31/nigel-forman-conservative-mp-obituary/|title=Nigel Forman, Conservative MP \u2013 obituary|date=31 May 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Robert Carr]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Carshalton (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton]]\n  | years  = [[1976 Carshalton by-election|1976]]\u2013[[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = constituency abolished }}\n{{s-new | constituency }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Carshalton and Wallington (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton and Wallington]]\n  | years  = [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\u2013[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after = [[Tom Brake]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forman, Nigel}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing]]\n[[Category:College of Europe alumni]]\n[[Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Fairleigh Dickinson University faculty]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Sussex]]\n[[Category:John F.

He obtained various degrees from these institutions including a [[Master of Public Administration]] from Harvard, a [[Certificate of Advanced European Studies]] (equivalent to a master's degree) from the College of Europe (class of 1965-1966) and a [[Ph.D]] from [[Sussex University]]. In his Times obituary he was described as \"something of a perpetual student\". His first significant job was from 1967 to 1968 as an information officer at the [[Confederation of British Industry]].\n\nIn 1968 he joined the Conservative Research Department ('CRD' - the research operation of the Conservative Party) and began the quest to find himself a seat in Parliament.<ref>BBC Parliamentary profiles :[https://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/candidates/292.htm Nigel Forman]</ref> He progressed rapidly in the CRD, acting as \u2018external affairs adviser\u2019 to [[Edward Heath]] while the latter was leader of the opposition. He served [[Margaret Thatcher]] in the same capacity from 1975 to 1976. He achieved the rank of assistant director with special responsibility for European affairs,\n\nHe contested the [[Coventry North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Coventry North East constituency]] for the Conservatives in the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]] but was not elected.<ref>February 1974 general election results :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74a/i06.htm Coventry North East]</ref> After the elevation of [[Robert Carr]] MP to the peerage in 1976, Forman was adopted as the Conservative candidate for the parliamentary seat (Carshalton) that Carr was vacating.\n\n==Backbench MP, 1976 to 1992==\nForman was elected to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] as [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Carshalton (UK Parliament constituency)|Sutton, Carshalton]] at a [[by-election]] on 11 March 1976. He took the seat with a 10,000 majority over Labour, compared with Carr\u2019s 4,000 majority in October 1974. When constituency boundaries were revised for the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 election]], his seat was renamed [[Carshalton and Wallington (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton and Wallington]].\n\nHis Carshalton parliamentary seat was part of the [[London Borough of Sutton]] and was very mixed in character. It contained large estates of Council housing and areas with expensive detached houses. All three major parties (Conservative, Labour and Liberal) had significant support in the seat and Forman\u2019s position was therefore always potentially vulnerable to [[tactical voting]].  His constituency Conservative party and the Conservative leaders of Sutton Borough Council soon showed themselves to be resistant to concepts of modernisation that Forman sought to promote. Sutton was one of the few remaining councils in the UK that had retained [[selective education]] and council meetings were unusual in that Conservative councillors wore ceremonial robes in order to \"give dignity\" to the proceedings.\n\nForman soon established himself as a bright and enthusiastic MP. During his first three months in the House he asked 64 formal questions of Ministers in the Labour government. His particular areas of interest were nuclear power, [[incomes policy]], education policy and ministerial patronage. After the Conservatives returned to government in 1979, it was widely expected that Forman would soon obtain ministerial office. He served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) first to [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]] in the Foreign Office and later to [[Douglas Hurd]] in the Home Office. However, promotion beyond that was slow in coming.\n\nForman soon became known as a left-wing Conservative MP who differed with the policy of the Thatcher government on a number of key issues. In 1980 he spoke in favour of substantially increasing child benefits, he opposed reduction in the time limit for abortions, opposed [[capital punishment]] and spoke in favour of [[James Prior]]\u2019s attempt to secure compulsory ballots in trade union votes through voluntary agreement with unions. He also expressed alarm at the manner in which unemployment was spiralling upwards as a result of the government\u2019s economic policies. He frequently used the code word \"one nation\" in his speeches and writings \u2013 indicating disapproval of government policies which were perceived to be divisive. He favoured closer integration of Britain with the [[European Union]].\n\nIn February 1981, Labour MPs cheered him in the House when he asked Chancellor Howe to act in order to halt the rise in unemployment. Forman advocated employment and economic policies which were broadly consistent with those pursued by the previous Labour government. He acquired the image of being a Conservative opponent of [[Thatcherism]]. All this raised his profile in the House but it did not enhance his promotion prospects. In a 1983 Times article, the senior Labour MP [[Gerald Kaufman]] noted that Forman had been overlooked for promotion and that his obvious abilities were not being used.\n\nIn 1984 Forman stood for the Chairmanship of the Conservative backbench finance committee as a left-wing \"one nation\" Tory \u2013 against  incumbent right-winger Sir William Clark. Forman lost but had become clearly identified with \"wets\" and the [[One Nation Conservatism|one-nation]] group of Conservative MPs. In 1985, Forman published a pamphlet titled ''\u201cWork to be done : employment policy for 1985 and beyond\u201d''. This was deeply critical of current government policy and advocated a package of measures to stimulate employment.\n\nForman\u2019s progressive views did not endear him to the leadership of his constituency Conservatives in Carshalton. Many of them regarded him as disloyal to Margaret Thatcher and a traitor. There were repeated attempts to deselect him. Matters came to a head in 1986 after the Liberal SDP Alliance took control of Sutton Borough Council from the Conservatives. Forman publicly attributed this to the shortcomings of the local Conservative leadership.  \n  \nThe matter is described in the following extract from an article in the Times dated 21 May 1987:<blockquote>''\u201cThe Carshalton Conservative Association suffers from bigots and zealots who indulge in internecine warfare. Not Labour smear tactics, nor Alliance innuendo, but the words of its Conservative MP, Mr Nigel Forman. Several attempts to deselect Mr Forman failed. But when the election was called last week, five of the seven senior officers took their revenge on the beleaguered MP by resigning.\u201d'' \u2013 ''The Times'', May 1987.</blockquote>\n\nHowever, Forman comfortably held his seat in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election|1987 general election]]. His radical image tended to prevent Labour and Liberal supporters indulging in tactical voting (that is, jointly backing his strongest opponent) in order to turn him out. Forman appeared to be more popular in Carshalton than was the local Conservative party and his political fortunes seemed to be in the ascendant.<blockquote>''\u201cHas Chancellor Nigel Lawson gone soft? Yesterday he appointed as his PPS a Tory so wet he drips. As recently as last year, Nigel Forman, vice-chairman of the party's backbench finance committee, was publicly calling on the Chancellor to 'give top priority to the unemployment challenge'. The year before, in Mastering British Politics, he wrote: 'Occasionally, in the course of its long history, the Conservative party has been swept along on the wave of some particular ideology, but such periods have not usually lasted or brought enduring political success'.\u201d'' \u2013 \"Rising Damp\", ''The Times'', June 1987.</blockquote>\n\nThe ideology Forman referred to was the then fashionable combination of [[supply side economics]], [[monetarism]], [[deregulation]] and [[privatisation]] known in the 1980s as [[Thatcherism]].  After Mrs Thatcher was forced from office in late 1990 it was considered only a matter of time before Forman would be promoted.<ref>Times 5 July 2017 [https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/nigel-forman-wtqlj290z obituary]</ref>\n\n==Minister of Higher Education, April 1992 to December 1992==\n<blockquote>''\u201cThe omission of Nigel Forman, from successive ministerial reshuffles over the past few years has surprised many at Westminster when several apparently less talented politicians have secured top posts. But after 16 years in the Commons, he has become an under-secretary at the education department\u201d''<ref>''The Times'', 15 April 1992.</ref></blockquote>\n\nImmediately after the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|general election in April 1992]] Forman was appointed Under Secretary of State for Education (with the job title Minister of Higher and Further Education) under Education Secretary [[John Patten, Baron Patten|John Patten]]. During his tenure of office, Forman dealt with high-profile issues such as the financing of student unions, student loans and the quality assurance of degrees issued by the new universities. Forman unexpectedly resigned from his ministerial post on 11 December 1992 for \"personal reasons\". The nature of those personal reasons was never disclosed. Colleagues commented that Forman was \"a very private man\" and nobody claimed to know why he had resigned.\n\nThereafter, Forman\u2019s political career went into decline. His political interests appeared to become more theoretical in nature. In January 1996 the [[Demos (UK think tank)|Demos 'think tank']] published a paper written by him on reform of the income tax system. Demos was generally considered to be closely associated with [[New Labour]].<ref>[http://www.demos.co.uk/publications/singleratetax Forman research paper], demos.co.uk; accessed 12 October 2015.</ref> At the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997 general election]], Forman lost his seat to the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] candidate [[Tom Brake]].<ref>1997 general election result:[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/constit/070.htm Carshalton & Wallington]</ref> Forman's 10,000 vote majority in the [[1992 United Kingdom general election|1992 general election]] was converted into a 2,000 vote Liberal Democrat majority with a 12% swing from Conservative to Lib Dem.\n\n==After Parliament==\nForman initially developed a portfolio of lecturing and writing work. In 1999 he joined the faculty of [[Wroxton Abbey|Wroxton College]], the UK (Oxfordshire) campus of [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]] (FDU).<ref>:[http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=328 Dr Nigel Forman profile  deadlink], fdu.edu; accessed 12 October 2015.</ref>\n\nForman delivered courses for \u2018Westminster Explained\u2019, Parliament\u2019s own in-house training facility which provides courses to members of both Houses and the wider public service. His later publications included \"Constitutional Change in the UK\" (Routledge, 2004 \u2013 a study of recent change introduced by New Labour) and \"Mastering British Politics\", (4th edition, update of a standard text, Macmillan, 1999). He was a visiting lecturer at [[Essex University]] and an honorary research fellow at [[University College London]].\n\nForman died of dementia-related issues on 11 May 2017. In the last year of his life he was reported to have been dismayed by the result of the 2016 [[Brexit referendum]] and to have stated that the UK had become a country he hardly knew. However, obituarists drew attention to his comment (quoted above) published thirty years earlier concerning the tendency of the Conservative party to be occasionally swept along in particular ideologies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/obituaries/2017/05/31/nigel-forman-conservative-mp-obituary/|title=Nigel Forman, Conservative MP \u2013 obituary|date=31 May 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{s-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Robert Carr]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Carshalton (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton]]\n  | years  = [[1976 Carshalton by-election|1976]]\u2013[[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = constituency abolished }}\n{{s-new | constituency }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] for [[Carshalton and Wallington (UK Parliament constituency)|Carshalton and Wallington]]\n  | years  = [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\u2013[[1997 United Kingdom general election|1997]]\n}}\n{{s-aft | after = [[Tom Brake]] }}\n{{s-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Forman, Nigel}}\n[[Category:1943 births]]\n[[Category:2017 deaths]]\n[[Category:Place of birth missing]]\n[[Category:College of Europe alumni]]\n[[Category:Alumni of New College, Oxford]]\n[[Category:Fairleigh Dickinson University faculty]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1983\u20131987]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1987\u20131992]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1992\u20131997]]\n[[Category:Alumni of the University of Sussex]]\n[[Category:John F.

A [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], he had a promising Parliamentary career and has worked as a Parliamentary consultant since his former constituency in Lincolnshire was abolished in boundary changes in 1983.\n\n==Royal Navy career==\nThe son of a brewer, and brought up in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, Brotherton went to [[Prior Park College]]. He enlisted in the [[Royal Navy]] and continued his education at the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College]] in [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]], qualifying as an Observer in 1955. He served in [[Cyprus]] in 1957 during a flare-up in communal conflicts and was [[mentioned in despatches]] for distinguished conduct. Brotherton left the Navy after achieving the rank of Lieutenant-Commander in 1964.\n\n==Early political activity==\nRetraining as an advertising executive, Brotherton joined [[The Times|Times Newspapers]] in 1967. He also became politically active in the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], speaking at the Party conference of 1966 in support of building an aircraft carrier for the Navy, and was Chairman of [[Beckenham]] Conservative Political Centre for the year 1967\u20131968. At the [[1970 United Kingdom general election|1970 general election]], he was Conservative candidate in [[Deptford (UK Parliament constituency)|Deptford]].\n\n==October 1974 election==\nFailing to find a seat for the [[February 1974 United Kingdom general election|February 1974 general election]], Brotherton became more prominent during the short interval between elections that year. He attacked the Labour government's decision to write off the debt of the [[National Coal Board]]. When [[Jeffrey Archer]] suddenly announced his decision to stand down from Parliament due to financial problems, Brotherton was selected as candidate for [[Louth (Lincolnshire) (UK Parliament constituency)|Louth]] in the [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|October 1974 general election]]. Brotherton won the seat but, in terms of [[Swing (politics)|swing]], the result was one of the worst for the Conservatives in the election, attributed to the circumstances in which Archer left and the short time Brotherton had to make himself known.\n\n==Policy positions==\nOnce in Parliament, Brotherton used the platform it gave him to express his views in somewhat forceful terms. During the [[1975 United Kingdom European Communities membership referendum|Common Market referendum]] of 1975, Brotherton strongly attacked [[Edward du Cann]] who made a last minute anti-Market speech; Brotherton declared that du Cann \"requires either psychiatric treatment or lessons in simple arithmetic\".\n\nBrotherton demanded that the Royal Navy escort the British fishing fleet to defend it from [[Iceland]]ic attacks during the [[Cod War]]. Early in January 1976 he challenged [[James Callaghan]], then Foreign Secretary, to substantiate [[Sheila Cassidy]]'s claim that she had been tortured in [[Chile]] before making any protest to the Chilean government. In March 1976 he pressed the issue of a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] catering staff who had been found to be a supporter of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]], calling for stricter vetting.\n\nA strong supporter of [[Margaret Thatcher]], Brotherton urged [[Edward Heath]] not to make public criticisms of her. In 1977 he successfully moved a private member's motion that declared the House would not welcome [[Idi Amin]]'s presence at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference. He was also a supporter of [[Ian Smith]] in [[Rhodesia]] and urged the government not to make a deal with the \"terrorists\" including [[Robert Mugabe]].\n\n==Under the Thatcher government==\nBrotherton supported the call for a boycott of the 1980 Moscow Olympics. He voted against a rise in petrol duty which was proposed by [[Geoffrey Howe]] in the 1981 budget. He was placed on the Select Committee on the Contempt of Court Bill in 1981 as one of the few non-lawyers; he supported an amendment to allow unrestricted tape-recording of court proceedings, against government advice. He also opposed the 1981 Defence Review with its proposed reductions in the Royal Navy. In March 1982, when the [[Adam Smith Institute]] rated MPs according to their tendency to vote for individual freedom, Brotherton and his Parliamentary neighbour [[Michael Brown (UK politician)|Michael Brown]] topped the list.\n\nIn December 1982, Brotherton (a strong opponent of wasteful spending) was embarrassed when he missed a rail connection and then asked three police cars to drive him from [[Newark-on-Trent]] to a charity event in [[Grimsby]]. The local Labour controlled police authority questioned why it was so urgent for him to get there when he was not expected to attend (his wife was the guest of honour), and asked him to reimburse the cost. He was also twice convicted of driving offences in the early 1980s.\n\n==1983 election==\nAt the [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983 general election]], boundary changes merged most of his seat with [[Brigg and Scunthorpe (UK Parliament constituency)|Brigg and Scunthorpe]] to form a new [[Brigg and Cleethorpes (UK Parliament constituency)|Brigg and Cleethorpes]]; this pitched Brotherton into a contest with Michael Brown for the nomination, which Brown won in March 1983. The remainder of the area became part of the East Lindsey constituency, which adopted sitting Horncastle MP [[Peter Tapsell (British politician)|Sir Peter Tapsell]]. Brotherton then tried to find another constituency, but was unsuccessful.\n\n==Later career==\nHe kept up contacts in his old constituency and continued living in [[Lincolnshire]]. In 1986, Brotherton formed Michael Brotherton Associates, a company of Parliamentary consultants. He kept up his correspondence to newspapers, and was critical of the [[John Major]] government for giving concessions in European Union negotiations. In January 2007, he announced that he had joined the [[United Kingdom Independence Party]], declaring that \"the only political party in the UK that now reflects the true values of Conservatism is the UK Independence Party\".\n\n==References==\n{{No footnotes|date=April 2008}}\n*''Times Guide to the House of Commons 1979''\n*{{Rayment-hc|date=March 2012}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{hansard-contribs | mr-michael-brotherton | Michael Brotherton }}\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|uk}}\n{{s-bef | before = [[Jeffrey Archer]] }}\n{{s-ttl\n  | title  = [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Louth, Lincolnshire (UK Parliament constituency)|Louth]]\n  | years  = [[October 1974 United Kingdom general election|Oct 1974]]\u2013[[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n}}\n{{s-non | reason = Constituency abolished }}\n{{S-end}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Brotherton, Michael}}\n[[Category:1931 births]]\n[[Category:Conservative Party (UK) MPs for English constituencies]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Royal Navy officers]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1974\u20131979]]\n[[Category:UK MPs 1979\u20131983]]\n[[Category:UK Independence Party people]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|British journalist and politician|bot=PearBOT 5}}\n{{about||the American astronomer and science fiction writer|Mike Brotherton|the retired Anglican priest|Michael Brotherton (priest)}}\n\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2012}}\n'''Michael Lewis Brotherton''' (born 26 May 1931) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] journalist and politician.
