Her attempts to adjust to the new town are crushed when five of her classmates, Adam Conant ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), Diana Meade ([[Shelley Hennig]]), Faye Chamberlain ([[Phoebe Tonkin]]), Melissa Glaser ([[Jessica Parker Kennedy]]), and Nick Armstrong ([[Louis Hunter]]), reveal to Cassie that she comes from a long line of witches and is the final member of their coven; with her they are able to unlock the full extent of their powers. Initially Cassie refuses to believe that she is a witch, even after Adam helps her to unlock her powers. It is only after she discovers an old leather-bound book of spells left to her by her late mother, Amelia, that Cassie begins to accept her power. Inside the book is a message to Cassie explaining that she kept their real family history and her powers a secret in order to keep her safe; as the circle soon finds out, their powers attract dark and dangerous forces that constantly puts them in harm's way.\n\n==Main cast==\n===Circle members===\n* Cassie Blake (played by [[Britt Robertson]]) is a newly discovered witch who, since the death of her mother, Amelia, has resided in the town of Chance Harbor, Washington. While Cassie initially dislikes the idea of being a witch, she later begins to accept her destiny and her family's heritage of magic. Her mother's side goes all the way back to the beginning of witchcraft, while her father, John Blackwell, comes from a long line of dark witches. She is Diana's older half-sister through John Blackwell.\n* Adam Conant (played by [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]) is a natural born witch and one of the two male members of the Circle. Adam is instantly attracted to Cassie Blake, despite his relationship with Diana Meade. It is Adam who helps Cassie unlock her powers and encourages her to join the Circle. The attraction that he and Cassie share causes a strain in his relationship with Diana.\n* Faye Chamberlain (played by [[Phoebe Tonkin]]) is an eccentric and free-spirited witch who uses her powers recklessly and selfishly. Frequently brash and irresponsible, Faye often challenges authority. She is best friends with Melissa Glaser. She does not believe that Diana Meade deserves to be the leader of the Circle and resents the fact that Diana has found her family's Book of Shadows while she has not found hers.\n* Diana Meade (played by [[Shelley Hennig]]) is a witch and the responsible, but strict leader of the Circle. Diana is good friends with Cassie Blake, despite the attraction between Cassie and Diana's long-term boyfriend, Adam Conant.

She is also Cassie's younger half-sister through their father, John Blackwell. She also has dark magic and Balcoin blood.\n* Melissa Glaser (played by [[Jessica Parker Kennedy]]) is the fourth female witch of the Circle. She is Faye Chamberlain's closest friend and the former girlfriend of Nick Armstrong. In contrast to her counterparts, Melissa is more quiet and keeps to herself, but she is responsible and loyal to the Circle.\n* Nick Armstrong (played by [[Louis Hunter]]; regular in episodes 1\u20135 and 20-21) is the second male member of the Circle. Prior to the start of the show, he and Melissa Glaser developed a sexual relationship. He showed reluctance to make it anything more than just about sex. After being threatened by Faye Chamberlain, however, he began to act nicer to Melissa and their relationship deepened.\n* Jake Armstrong (played by [[Chris Zylka]]; guest episodes 6-13, regular 14-22) is Nick's older brother. He used to work for a group of witch hunters, thinking that witchcraft was responsible for the death of his family, before finding out that his parents were dead because the witch hunters killed them. He has an interest in Cassie Blake but a sexual relationship with Faye Chamberlain throughout the show.\n\n===Others===\n* Charles Meade (played by [[Gale Harold]]) is Diana's father, he is a member of the previous generation of the Circle. Following the fire at the Boat Yard, Charles' powers are stripped from him, along with the other surviving members of his Circle. In episode 1, he kills Cassie's mother with magic he got from the crystal.\n* Jane Blake (portrayed by [[Ashley Crow]]) is the grandmother of Cassie Blake and mother of Amelia. While initially she acts as though she does not know about the Circle, Cassie eventually realizes that they need her help and tells her the truth.\n* Dawn Chamberlain (played by [[Natasha Henstridge]]) is Faye Chamberlain's mother, the principal of Chance Harbor High School, and a member of the previous generation of the Circle. While she and Charles act as a team, she is the more sadistic of the two. However, she also prefers to have Charles do the work, including murdering Amelia Blake.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* Sally Matthews (played by [[Logan Browning]]) is a sweet girl who befriends Cassie. She often butts heads with Faye, who accidentally kills her when her power was out of control. Dawn manages to revive her with a crystal, leaving her with a broken arm. Sally then becomes suspicious of Cassie, Adam, Diana, Nick, Melissa and Faye, especially after they left the hallway a mess from using their powers, but still tries to be friends with Cassie. She does not appear after \"Loner\".\n* Luke (played by [[Zachary Abel]]) is a boy who is friends with Adam and is attracted to Cassie when she first arrives in Chance Harbor. Through Adam, he asks her to the school dance in \"Loner\" but amicably leaves her after she ditches him. In \"Masked\" he is asked to attend a party at Cassie's house on Halloween organized by Faye, and is revealed to be a witch hunter.\n* Ethan Conant (played by [[Adam J. Harrington|Adam Harrington]]) is Adam's father. He is an alcoholic, and owns the Boathouse Bar and Grill where Adam works. Like Charles and Dawn, he was stripped of his powers sixteen years prior to the series' beginning. He continually complains about how he never was with Amelia Blake, despite the fact that they were \"written in the stars\" and misses her more than Adam's mother. He eventually tells Diana that Adam is destined to be with Cassie, resulting in their breakup. Later he recovers from his alcoholism, realizing he needs to be a better father. He has a rivalry with Charles Meade, mentioning multiple times that he has always been a bully. He also hates John Blackwell, at one point trying to kill him. He does not appear after \"Lucky\".\n* Amelia Blake (played by [[Emily Holmes]] in her first appearance, Andrea Brooks in her second) is Cassie's mother. At the beginning of the series she is killed by Charles Meade to bring Cassie back to Chance Harbor, but is mentioned many times throughout the series. She was John Blackwell's girlfriend, and let him into the Circle, but left him after realizing who he was. She stopped the demons Blackwell summoned at the boatyard fire, and was stripped of her powers along with Charles, Dawn and Ethan. In a flashback, it is revealed she also knew Blackwell was the father of Diana.\n* Isaac (played by [[JR Bourne]]) is a high-ranking member of the witch hunters. He is the one who Jake reports to regularly, and even after leaving the witch hunters, Jake still seems to have some respect for him. He arrives in Chance Harbor in \"Wake\" and leaves in \"Balcoin\", but later returns to get Balcoin's medallion from Jake, showing that he also respects Jake as a person. His faction of the witch hunters is called the \"True Believers\".\n* Ian (played by [[Richard Harmon]]) is a witch hunter. He first appears in \"Masked\" trying to kill the Circle. He later appears in \"Traitor\" having returned to Chance Harbor in Isaac's place (though only out of respect for Isaac) to warn the Circle about a witch who gave power to the witch hunters.\n* Eben (played by Sammi Rotibi) is the leader of the witch hunters who will do anything to kill them, especially John Blackwell. Sixteen years prior he used Ethan Conant's power to try to kill Blackwell, but it failed. He also killed Jake and Nick's parents personally on that day. After Blackwell returns, Eben summons demons into himself to protect him and aid him in killing witches, which causes a rift with Isaac and other witch hunters.\n* Lucy Gibbons (played by Nina Kiri in her first appearance, [[Lauren Stamile]] in her second) was John Blackwell's psychic sixteen years prior, who was at the boatyard the night of the \"accident\". After seeing Cassie in the memory, she goes to meet her to warn her about the witch hunters, but is later revealed to be working for the witch hunters, as she was sixteen years ago.\n* Henry Chamberlain (played by [[Tom Butler (actor)|Tom Butler]]) is Dawn's father-in-law, Faye's grandfather, and an elder. He comes to Chance Harbor after being called by Ethan Conant, to determine whether or not the next generation is practicing. Dawn kills him after he says he will alert the elders. Charles hides his body twice at his house, but it is eventually found.\n* Kate Meade (played by [[Stepfanie Kramer]]) is Charles' mother, Diana's grandmother, and an elder. She is suspicious when Diana tells her Charles and Dawn are dating, and confronts Dawn. Dawn later puts on a facade, where she may have attempted to poison her, causing a rift with Charles. She tries to kill Cassie to destroy her dark magic but fails, and informs Charles that she knows what he has done. She returns in \"Family\", where she gives Charles and Dawn her power to save the children.\n* Calvin Wilson (played by [[Hiro Kanagawa]]) is the owner of Chance Harbor's antique store. He is a witch from another Circle. He realizes Cassie has dark magic and tries to warn her, but is stopped by Jake. He later appears as a hallucination to Jake when he is sick.\n* John Blackwell (played by [[Joe Lando]]) is Cassie's father, and a witch with dark magic. He returns to Chance Harbor after Cassie contacts him with his medallion. He is later revealed to be Diana's biological father due to an affair when Charles and his wife were separated. It is unclear what his intentions are until the final episodes, where it is revealed he fathered Cassie and Diana and caused all other female members of the Circle to get pregnant by their boyfriends, and then go to the boatyard, which he knew was a trap, to make their children orphans he could easily manipulate to form his own circle of dark magic. His plans are ultimately stopped by Cassie and Diana. He also had an affair with Dawn, but it did not work because when it started Dawn was already pregnant with Faye.\n* Lee LaBeque (played by [[Grey Damon]]) is a practitioner of voodoo magic. Faye tracks him down in an attempt to get her solo magic back. He does a few things, but they all have consequences Faye dislikes, and she believes he is using her. He is using her magic to revive his girlfriend who is in a coma, but he and Faye also develop feelings for each other.\n* Eva (played by [[Alexia Fast]]) is Lee's girlfriend, who is in a coma. She later awakens and gains some of Faye's power due to voodoo.\n* Callum (played by [[Michael Graziadei]]) is one of Lee's friends. He is also a drug dealer who sells Devil's Spirit. He later realizes that Faye and Melissa are witches after a party and an argument with Lee. In \"Crystal\" he attempts to steal one of the crystals, but the Circle stops him and \"marks\" him, ordering him to never return to Chance Harbor.\n* Grant (played by Tim Phillipps) is an Australian boy who came to Chance Harbor on a boat. He and Diana develop an instant attraction to each other, but problems arise because he lied to her about owning the boat (he just works on it), and she is a witch. He later offers her to leave Chance Harbor with him.\n\n===Guest cast===\n* Zachary Larson (played by Dave Baez) is a former friend of Amelia Blake who knew about the Circle. After the fire at the boat yard, he blamed Amelia and the Circle for what happened to his girlfriend, Heather. He later became a fisherman who returned to Chance Harbor occasionally. After he discovers Cassie has returned to town, he attempts to stop the Circle by killing one of its members. The Circle defeat him, and Charles and Dawn mark him and force him to stay away from the children.\n* Heather Barnes (played by [[Camille Sullivan]]) is a former friend of Amelia Blake and Zachary Larson's ex-girlfriend. Following the fire at the boatyard, she was paralyzed by Amelia, to prevent a demon possessing her from causing harm. When the Circle finds out about her, Cassie and Faye try to help her.\n* Wade Barnes (played by [[Ben Cotton]]) is Heather's brother. He takes care of her while she is paralyzed.\n* Kyle (played by Brett Dier) is the captain of the hockey team at Chance Harbor High School.

She died sixteen years prior to the series' beginning, but appears in a flashback of the boatyard fire.\n* Royce Armstrong (played by [[John de Lancie]]) is Richard's father, Jake and Nick's grandfather, and an elder. He is a conspiracy theorist who lives alone and is considered crazy. When Cassie, Faye and Jake try to find his crystal, he tells them where it is, and reveals a theory that Blackwell actually wanted children from the Circle, and caused all their births, backed up by the fact that the members (except Jake) were born one month apart. He later sends Jake a bottle with beads in it and a message that the Circles are coming together and his fight is not over, though it is unknown why, or what it means. Despite his lack of sociability, his theories turn out to be true, and he appears to be a very powerful witch, to the point of being able to spell places against dark magic.\n* James Conant (played by [[Chad Willett]]) is Ethan's father, Adam's grandfather, and an elder. He died prior to the events of the series, but appears in a flashback of the night of the boatyard fire, where it is shown that he gave Amelia his family's crystal to protect herself. She told him the truth about John, gave the crystal back to him and asked him to tell Ethan that she didn't love him anymore, though both knew she was lying. He had an affinity for cloaking spells, which Adam inherited.\n* Elizabeth Meade (played by Elise Gatien) is Charles' wife, and Diana's mother. She died sixteen years prior to the series' beginning, but appears in a flashback of the night of the boatyard fire. Though she was married to Charles, she and John had an affair while she and her husband were separated, and she knew John was Diana's biological father. After seeing John for what he was, she returned to Charles, but never told him the truth about Diana.

Her attempts to adjust to the new town are crushed when five of her classmates, Adam Conant ([[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]), Diana Meade ([[Shelley Hennig]]), Faye Chamberlain ([[Phoebe Tonkin]]), Melissa Glaser ([[Jessica Parker Kennedy]]), and Nick Armstrong ([[Louis Hunter]]), reveal to Cassie that she comes from a long line of witches and is the final member of their coven; with her they are able to unlock the full extent of their powers. Initially Cassie refuses to believe that she is a witch, even after Adam helps her to unlock her powers. It is only after she discovers an old leather-bound book of spells left to her by her late mother, Amelia, that Cassie begins to accept her power. Inside the book is a message to Cassie explaining that she kept their real family history and her powers a secret in order to keep her safe; as the circle soon finds out, their powers attract dark and dangerous forces that constantly puts them in harm's way.\n\n==Main cast==\n===Circle members===\n* Cassie Blake (played by [[Britt Robertson]]) is a newly discovered witch who, since the death of her mother, Amelia, has resided in the town of Chance Harbor, Washington. While Cassie initially dislikes the idea of being a witch, she later begins to accept her destiny and her family's heritage of magic. Her mother's side goes all the way back to the beginning of witchcraft, while her father, John Blackwell, comes from a long line of dark witches. She is Diana's older half-sister through John Blackwell.\n* Adam Conant (played by [[Thomas Dekker (actor)|Thomas Dekker]]) is a natural born witch and one of the two male members of the Circle. Adam is instantly attracted to Cassie Blake, despite his relationship with Diana Meade. It is Adam who helps Cassie unlock her powers and encourages her to join the Circle. The attraction that he and Cassie share causes a strain in his relationship with Diana.\n* Faye Chamberlain (played by [[Phoebe Tonkin]]) is an eccentric and free-spirited witch who uses her powers recklessly and selfishly. Frequently brash and irresponsible, Faye often challenges authority. She is best friends with Melissa Glaser. She does not believe that Diana Meade deserves to be the leader of the Circle and resents the fact that Diana has found her family's Book of Shadows while she has not found hers.\n* Diana Meade (played by [[Shelley Hennig]]) is a witch and the responsible, but strict leader of the Circle. Diana is good friends with Cassie Blake, despite the attraction between Cassie and Diana's long-term boyfriend, Adam Conant. Diana is the first member of the Circle to discover witchcraft and, as of the series' start, the only member to have found her family's Book of Shadows before Cassie found hers. She is also Cassie's younger half-sister through their father, John Blackwell. She also has dark magic and Balcoin blood.\n* Melissa Glaser (played by [[Jessica Parker Kennedy]]) is the fourth female witch of the Circle. She is Faye Chamberlain's closest friend and the former girlfriend of Nick Armstrong. In contrast to her counterparts, Melissa is more quiet and keeps to herself, but she is responsible and loyal to the Circle.\n* Nick Armstrong (played by [[Louis Hunter]]; regular in episodes 1\u20135 and 20-21) is the second male member of the Circle. Prior to the start of the show, he and Melissa Glaser developed a sexual relationship. He showed reluctance to make it anything more than just about sex. After being threatened by Faye Chamberlain, however, he began to act nicer to Melissa and their relationship deepened.\n* Jake Armstrong (played by [[Chris Zylka]]; guest episodes 6-13, regular 14-22) is Nick's older brother. He used to work for a group of witch hunters, thinking that witchcraft was responsible for the death of his family, before finding out that his parents were dead because the witch hunters killed them. He has an interest in Cassie Blake but a sexual relationship with Faye Chamberlain throughout the show.\n\n===Others===\n* Charles Meade (played by [[Gale Harold]]) is Diana's father, he is a member of the previous generation of the Circle. Following the fire at the Boat Yard, Charles' powers are stripped from him, along with the other surviving members of his Circle. In episode 1, he kills Cassie's mother with magic he got from the crystal.\n* Jane Blake (portrayed by [[Ashley Crow]]) is the grandmother of Cassie Blake and mother of Amelia. While initially she acts as though she does not know about the Circle, Cassie eventually realizes that they need her help and tells her the truth.\n* Dawn Chamberlain (played by [[Natasha Henstridge]]) is Faye Chamberlain's mother, the principal of Chance Harbor High School, and a member of the previous generation of the Circle. While she and Charles act as a team, she is the more sadistic of the two. However, she also prefers to have Charles do the work, including murdering Amelia Blake.\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* Sally Matthews (played by [[Logan Browning]]) is a sweet girl who befriends Cassie. She often butts heads with Faye, who accidentally kills her when her power was out of control. Dawn manages to revive her with a crystal, leaving her with a broken arm. Sally then becomes suspicious of Cassie, Adam, Diana, Nick, Melissa and Faye, especially after they left the hallway a mess from using their powers, but still tries to be friends with Cassie. She does not appear after \"Loner\".\n* Luke (played by [[Zachary Abel]]) is a boy who is friends with Adam and is attracted to Cassie when she first arrives in Chance Harbor. Through Adam, he asks her to the school dance in \"Loner\" but amicably leaves her after she ditches him. In \"Masked\" he is asked to attend a party at Cassie's house on Halloween organized by Faye, and is revealed to be a witch hunter.\n* Ethan Conant (played by [[Adam J. Harrington|Adam Harrington]]) is Adam's father. He is an alcoholic, and owns the Boathouse Bar and Grill where Adam works. Like Charles and Dawn, he was stripped of his powers sixteen years prior to the series' beginning. He continually complains about how he never was with Amelia Blake, despite the fact that they were \"written in the stars\" and misses her more than Adam's mother. He eventually tells Diana that Adam is destined to be with Cassie, resulting in their breakup. Later he recovers from his alcoholism, realizing he needs to be a better father. He has a rivalry with Charles Meade, mentioning multiple times that he has always been a bully. He also hates John Blackwell, at one point trying to kill him. He does not appear after \"Lucky\".\n* Amelia Blake (played by [[Emily Holmes]] in her first appearance, Andrea Brooks in her second) is Cassie's mother. At the beginning of the series she is killed by Charles Meade to bring Cassie back to Chance Harbor, but is mentioned many times throughout the series. She was John Blackwell's girlfriend, and let him into the Circle, but left him after realizing who he was. She stopped the demons Blackwell summoned at the boatyard fire, and was stripped of her powers along with Charles, Dawn and Ethan. In a flashback, it is revealed she also knew Blackwell was the father of Diana.\n* Isaac (played by [[JR Bourne]]) is a high-ranking member of the witch hunters. He is the one who Jake reports to regularly, and even after leaving the witch hunters, Jake still seems to have some respect for him. He arrives in Chance Harbor in \"Wake\" and leaves in \"Balcoin\", but later returns to get Balcoin's medallion from Jake, showing that he also respects Jake as a person. His faction of the witch hunters is called the \"True Believers\".\n* Ian (played by [[Richard Harmon]]) is a witch hunter. He first appears in \"Masked\" trying to kill the Circle. He later appears in \"Traitor\" having returned to Chance Harbor in Isaac's place (though only out of respect for Isaac) to warn the Circle about a witch who gave power to the witch hunters.\n* Eben (played by Sammi Rotibi) is the leader of the witch hunters who will do anything to kill them, especially John Blackwell. Sixteen years prior he used Ethan Conant's power to try to kill Blackwell, but it failed. He also killed Jake and Nick's parents personally on that day. After Blackwell returns, Eben summons demons into himself to protect him and aid him in killing witches, which causes a rift with Isaac and other witch hunters.\n* Lucy Gibbons (played by Nina Kiri in her first appearance, [[Lauren Stamile]] in her second) was John Blackwell's psychic sixteen years prior, who was at the boatyard the night of the \"accident\". After seeing Cassie in the memory, she goes to meet her to warn her about the witch hunters, but is later revealed to be working for the witch hunters, as she was sixteen years ago.\n* Henry Chamberlain (played by [[Tom Butler (actor)|Tom Butler]]) is Dawn's father-in-law, Faye's grandfather, and an elder. He comes to Chance Harbor after being called by Ethan Conant, to determine whether or not the next generation is practicing. Dawn kills him after he says he will alert the elders. Charles hides his body twice at his house, but it is eventually found.\n* Kate Meade (played by [[Stepfanie Kramer]]) is Charles' mother, Diana's grandmother, and an elder. She is suspicious when Diana tells her Charles and Dawn are dating, and confronts Dawn. Dawn later puts on a facade, where she may have attempted to poison her, causing a rift with Charles. She tries to kill Cassie to destroy her dark magic but fails, and informs Charles that she knows what he has done. She returns in \"Family\", where she gives Charles and Dawn her power to save the children.\n* Calvin Wilson (played by [[Hiro Kanagawa]]) is the owner of Chance Harbor's antique store. He is a witch from another Circle. He realizes Cassie has dark magic and tries to warn her, but is stopped by Jake. He later appears as a hallucination to Jake when he is sick.\n* John Blackwell (played by [[Joe Lando]]) is Cassie's father, and a witch with dark magic. He returns to Chance Harbor after Cassie contacts him with his medallion. He is later revealed to be Diana's biological father due to an affair when Charles and his wife were separated. It is unclear what his intentions are until the final episodes, where it is revealed he fathered Cassie and Diana and caused all other female members of the Circle to get pregnant by their boyfriends, and then go to the boatyard, which he knew was a trap, to make their children orphans he could easily manipulate to form his own circle of dark magic. His plans are ultimately stopped by Cassie and Diana. He also had an affair with Dawn, but it did not work because when it started Dawn was already pregnant with Faye.\n* Lee LaBeque (played by [[Grey Damon]]) is a practitioner of voodoo magic. Faye tracks him down in an attempt to get her solo magic back. He does a few things, but they all have consequences Faye dislikes, and she believes he is using her. He is using her magic to revive his girlfriend who is in a coma, but he and Faye also develop feelings for each other.\n* Eva (played by [[Alexia Fast]]) is Lee's girlfriend, who is in a coma. She later awakens and gains some of Faye's power due to voodoo.\n* Callum (played by [[Michael Graziadei]]) is one of Lee's friends. He is also a drug dealer who sells Devil's Spirit. He later realizes that Faye and Melissa are witches after a party and an argument with Lee. In \"Crystal\" he attempts to steal one of the crystals, but the Circle stops him and \"marks\" him, ordering him to never return to Chance Harbor.\n* Grant (played by Tim Phillipps) is an Australian boy who came to Chance Harbor on a boat. He and Diana develop an instant attraction to each other, but problems arise because he lied to her about owning the boat (he just works on it), and she is a witch. He later offers her to leave Chance Harbor with him.\n\n===Guest cast===\n* Zachary Larson (played by Dave Baez) is a former friend of Amelia Blake who knew about the Circle. After the fire at the boat yard, he blamed Amelia and the Circle for what happened to his girlfriend, Heather. He later became a fisherman who returned to Chance Harbor occasionally. After he discovers Cassie has returned to town, he attempts to stop the Circle by killing one of its members. The Circle defeat him, and Charles and Dawn mark him and force him to stay away from the children.\n* Heather Barnes (played by [[Camille Sullivan]]) is a former friend of Amelia Blake and Zachary Larson's ex-girlfriend. Following the fire at the boatyard, she was paralyzed by Amelia, to prevent a demon possessing her from causing harm. When the Circle finds out about her, Cassie and Faye try to help her.\n* Wade Barnes (played by [[Ben Cotton]]) is Heather's brother. He takes care of her while she is paralyzed.\n* Kyle (played by Brett Dier) is the captain of the hockey team at Chance Harbor High School.

He died sixteen years prior to the series' beginning, but appears in a flashback of the boatyard fire.\n* Sara Armstrong (played by [[Cindy Busby]]) is Jake and Nick's mother, and Richard's wife. She died sixteen years prior to the series' beginning, but appears in a flashback of the boatyard fire.\n* Royce Armstrong (played by [[John de Lancie]]) is Richard's father, Jake and Nick's grandfather, and an elder. He is a conspiracy theorist who lives alone and is considered crazy. When Cassie, Faye and Jake try to find his crystal, he tells them where it is, and reveals a theory that Blackwell actually wanted children from the Circle, and caused all their births, backed up by the fact that the members (except Jake) were born one month apart. He later sends Jake a bottle with beads in it and a message that the Circles are coming together and his fight is not over, though it is unknown why, or what it means. Despite his lack of sociability, his theories turn out to be true, and he appears to be a very powerful witch, to the point of being able to spell places against dark magic.\n* James Conant (played by [[Chad Willett]]) is Ethan's father, Adam's grandfather, and an elder. He died prior to the events of the series, but appears in a flashback of the night of the boatyard fire, where it is shown that he gave Amelia his family's crystal to protect herself. She told him the truth about John, gave the crystal back to him and asked him to tell Ethan that she didn't love him anymore, though both knew she was lying. He had an affinity for cloaking spells, which Adam inherited.\n* Elizabeth Meade (played by Elise Gatien) is Charles' wife, and Diana's mother. She died sixteen years prior to the series' beginning, but appears in a flashback of the night of the boatyard fire. Though she was married to Charles, she and John had an affair while she and her husband were separated, and she knew John was Diana's biological father. After seeing John for what he was, she returned to Charles, but never told him the truth about Diana. When Amelia tried to persuade her not to go to the boatyard, she refused, blaming Amelia for bringing John into the Circle.\n* Holden (played by [[Arlen Escarpeta]]) is Melissa's cousin, and possibly a witch. Diana once had a crush on him.\n* Simone (played by Luisa D'Oliveira) is a witch hunter who comes to Chance Harbor along with Jake and Isaac to destroy the Circle.

{"title_page": "Legislature", "text_new": "{{short description|Deliberative assembly that makes laws}}\n{{Legislature}}\n{{Politics sidebar|Organs}}\n\nA '''legislature''' is a [[deliberative assembly]] with the [[authority]] to make [[Law|laws]] for a [[Polity|political entity]] such as a [[Sovereign state|country]] or [[city]]. Legislatures form important parts of most [[Government|governments]]; in the [[separation of powers]] model, they are often contrasted with the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of government.\n\nLaws enacted by legislatures are usually known as [[primary legislation]]. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the [[budget]] involved. \n\nThe members of a legislature are called [[legislator]]s. In a [[democracy]], legislators are most commonly popularly [[Election|elected]], although [[indirect election]] and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures featuring an [[upper chamber]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Legislation Terminology Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Map showing the terminology for each country's national legislature]]\nThe name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.  \n\nCommon names include:\n\n* Assembly (from ''to assemble'')\n* Congress (from ''to congregate'')\n* Diet\n* Duma (from Russian ''d\u00fama'' 'thought')\n*Parliament (from French ''parlez'' 'to speak')\n\nThough the specific rules for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.\n\n== History ==\nAmong the earliest recognised legislatures was the [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].''<ref name=\":0\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.<ref name=\":0\" /> These were often named [[The Estates]]. The oldest surviving legislature is the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[Althing]], founded in 930 CE.\n\n== Functions ==\nDemocratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=128\u2013130|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Representation ===\nThere exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;\n* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;\n* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legilsature matches the demographics of the wider society;\n* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;\n* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.\n\n=== Deliberation ===\nOne of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, like [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature.<ref name=\":0\" /> Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the [[United States Congress]], the deliberation takes place in closed committees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Legislation ===\nWhile legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in [[continental Europe]] and those in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]] of the [[Americas]] have more independence in drafting and amending bills.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=130\u2013131|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Authorizing expenditure ===\nThe origins of the [[power of the purse]] which legislatures typically have in passing or denying [[Government budget|government budgets]] goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the [[Monarch|monarchs]] would have to consult before raising taxes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=131\u2013132|oclc=961119208}}</ref> For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Making governments ===\nThe power of the legislature over the government is stronger in [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], where the former can remove the latter, but weaker in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], where there is a [[separation of powers]] between the two.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Oversight ===\nThere are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including [[Question time|questioning]], [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellations]], and [[Motion of no confidence|votes of confidence]].\n\n=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===\nIn contrast to [[Democracy|democratic]] systems, legislatures under [[authoritarianism]] are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n* Providing legitimacy;\n* Incorporating opponents into the system;\n* Providing some representation of outside interests;\n* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;\n* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.\n\n== Internal organization ==\nEach chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of [[parliamentary procedure]] to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a [[quorum]].\n\nSome of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to [[committee]]s made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).\n\nThe members of a legislature usually represent different [[Political party|political parties]]; the members from each party generally meet as a [[caucus]] to organize their internal affairs.\n\n==Relation to other branches of government==\nLegislatures vary widely in the amount of [[Politics|political]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] they wield, compared to other political players such as [[Judiciary|judiciaries]], [[Military|militaries]], and [[Executive (government)|executives]]. In 2009, political scientists [[Steven Fish|M. Steven Fish]] and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German [[Bundestag]], the [[Italian Parliament]], and the Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] and Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Assembly]] (since replaced by the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]) tied for least powerful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The handbook of national legislatures: a global survey|last=Fish|first=M. Steven|last2=Kroenig|first2=Matthew|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-521-51466-8|location=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nSome political systems follow the principle of [[legislative supremacy]], which holds that the legislature is the supreme branch of government and cannot be bound by other institutions, such as the judicial branch or a written [[constitution]]. Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.\n\nIn [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems of [[government]], the [[Executive branch|executive]] is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]. On the other hand, according to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, the legislature in a [[presidential system]] is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the [[Judicial branch|judiciary]] and the executive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Systems and Executive-Legislative Relations (Presidential, Parliamentary and Hybrid Systems) |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |accessdate=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164441/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |archivedate=2008-10-17 }}</ref> Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the [[impeachment]] of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.\n\nLegislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to [[Administrative agency|administrative]] or [[Executive agency|executive agencies]].<ref name=\"Schoenbrod\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117\u201318 |quote=|ref= }} </ref>\n\n==Members==\nLegislatures are made up of individual members, known as [[Legislator|legislators]], who [[Voting|vote]] on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"[[safe seat]]\" and \"[[marginal seat]]\".\n\nAfter election, the members may be protected by [[parliamentary immunity]] or [[Parliamentary privilege|parliamentary privilige]], either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.\n\n==Chambers==\n[[File:Vista panor\u00e1mica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]\n\nA legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].\n[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]\nIn bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[Administrative division|administrative divisions]] rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], the upper house has equal or even greater power. \n[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]\n\nIn [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states. This is also the case with the supranational legislature of the [[European Union]].

Legislatures form important parts of most [[Government|governments]]; in the [[separation of powers]] model, they are often contrasted with the [[Executive (government)|executive]] and [[Judiciary|judicial]] branches of government.\n\nLaws enacted by legislatures are usually known as [[primary legislation]]. In addition, legislatures may observe and steer governing actions, with authority to amend the [[budget]] involved. \n\nThe members of a legislature are called [[legislator]]s. In a [[democracy]], legislators are most commonly popularly [[Election|elected]], although [[indirect election]] and appointment by the executive are also used, particularly for [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislatures featuring an [[upper chamber]].\n\n==Terminology==\n[[File:Legislation Terminology Map.png|thumb|upright=1.8|right|Map showing the terminology for each country's national legislature]]\nThe name used to refer to a legislative body varies by country.  \n\nCommon names include:\n\n* Assembly (from ''to assemble'')\n* Congress (from ''to congregate'')\n* Diet\n* Duma (from Russian ''d\u00fama'' 'thought')\n*Parliament (from French ''parlez'' 'to speak')\n\nThough the and specific rules for each legislature differ by location, they all aim to serve the same purpose of appointing officials to represent their citizens to determine appropriate legislation for the country.\n\n== History ==\nAmong the earliest recognised legislatures was the [[Athens|Athenian]] ''[[Ecclesia (ancient Athens)|Ecclesia]].''<ref name=\":0\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], European monarchs would host assemblies of the nobility, which would later develop into predecessors of modern legislatures.<ref name=\":0\" /> These were often named [[The Estates]]. The oldest surviving legislature is the [[Iceland|Icelandic]] [[Althing]], founded in 930 CE.\n\n== Functions ==\nDemocratic legislatures have six major functions: representation, deliberation, legislation, authorizing expenditure, making governments, and oversight.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=128\u2013130|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Representation ===\nThere exist five ways that representation can be achieved in a legislature:<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* Formalistically: how the rules of the legislature ensure representation of constituents;\n* Symbolically: how the constituents perceive their representatives;\n* Descriptively: how well the composition of the legilsature matches the demographics of the wider society;\n* Substantively: how well representatives actually respond to the needs of their constituents;\n* Collectively: how well the representatives represent the interests of the society as a whole.\n\n=== Deliberation ===\nOne of the major functions of a legislature is to discuss and debate issues of major importance to society.<ref name=\":0\" /> This can take place in two forms. In debating legislatures, like [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], there is lively debate on the floor of the legislature.<ref name=\":0\" /> Contrastingly, in committee-based legislatures like the [[United States Congress]], the deliberation takes place in closed committees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Legislation ===\nWhile legislatures have nominally the sole power to create laws, the substantive extent of this power depends on details of the political system. In [[Westminster system|Westminster-style]] legislatures the executive (composed of the cabinet) can essentially pass any laws it wants, as it usually has a majority of legislators behind it, kept in check by the party whip, while committee-based legislatures in [[continental Europe]] and those in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]] of the [[Americas]] have more independence in drafting and amending bills.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=130\u2013131|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n=== Authorizing expenditure ===\nThe origins of the [[power of the purse]] which legislatures typically have in passing or denying [[Government budget|government budgets]] goes back to the European assemblies of nobility which the [[Monarch|monarchs]] would have to consult before raising taxes.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|publisher=|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|location=|pages=131\u2013132|oclc=961119208}}</ref> For this power to be actually effective, the legislature should be able to amend the budget, have an effective committee system, enough time for consideration, as well as access to relevant background information.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Making governments ===\nThe power of the legislature over the government is stronger in [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], where the former can remove the latter, but weaker in [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], where there is a [[separation of powers]] between the two.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Oversight ===\nThere are several ways in which the legislature can hold the government accountable, including [[Question time|questioning]], [[Interpellation (politics)|interpellations]], and [[Motion of no confidence|votes of confidence]].\n\n=== Function in authoritarian regimes ===\nIn contrast to [[Democracy|democratic]] systems, legislatures under [[authoritarianism]] are used to ensure the stability of the power structure by co-opting potential competing interests within the elites, which they achieve by:<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hague, Rod, author.|title=Political science : a comparative introduction|date=14 October 2017|isbn=978-1-137-60123-0|oclc=961119208}}</ref>\n\n* Providing legitimacy;\n* Incorporating opponents into the system;\n* Providing some representation of outside interests;\n* Offering a way to recruit new members to the ruling clique;\n* Being a channel through which limited grievances and concessions can be passed.\n\n== Internal organization ==\nEach chamber of the legislature consists of a number of legislators who use some form of [[parliamentary procedure]] to debate political issues and vote on proposed legislation. There must be a certain number of legislators present to carry out these activities; this is called a [[quorum]].\n\nSome of the responsibilities of a legislature, such as giving first consideration to newly proposed legislation, are usually delegated to [[committee]]s made up of a few of the members of the chamber(s).\n\nThe members of a legislature usually represent different [[Political party|political parties]]; the members from each party generally meet as a [[caucus]] to organize their internal affairs.\n\n==Relation to other branches of government==\nLegislatures vary widely in the amount of [[Politics|political]] [[Power (social and political)|power]] they wield, compared to other political players such as [[Judiciary|judiciaries]], [[Military|militaries]], and [[Executive (government)|executives]]. In 2009, political scientists [[Steven Fish|M. Steven Fish]] and Matthew Kroenig constructed a Parliamentary Powers Index in an attempt to quantify the different degrees of power among national legislatures. The German [[Bundestag]], the [[Italian Parliament]], and the Mongolian [[State Great Khural]] tied for most powerful, while Myanmar's [[House of Representatives (Myanmar)|House of Representatives]] and Somalia's [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Assembly]] (since replaced by the [[Federal Parliament of Somalia]]) tied for least powerful.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The handbook of national legislatures: a global survey|last=Fish|first=M.

Such a system renders the legislature more powerful.\n\nIn [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and [[semi-presidential system|semi-presidential]] systems of [[government]], the [[Executive branch|executive]] is responsible to the legislature, which may remove it with a [[Motion of no confidence|vote of no confidence]]. On the other hand, according to the [[separation of powers]] doctrine, the legislature in a [[presidential system]] is considered an independent and coequal branch of government along with both the [[Judicial branch|judiciary]] and the executive.<ref>{{cite web|title=Governing Systems and Executive-Legislative Relations (Presidential, Parliamentary and Hybrid Systems) |publisher=United Nations Development Programme |url=http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |accessdate=2008-10-16 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017164441/http://www.undp.org/governance/docs/Parl-Pub-govern.htm |archivedate=2008-10-17 }}</ref> Nevertheless, many presidential systems provide for the [[impeachment]] of the executive for criminal or unconstitutional behaviour.\n\nLegislatures will sometimes delegate their legislative power to [[Administrative agency|administrative]] or [[Executive agency|executive agencies]].<ref name=\"Schoenbrod\">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Schoenbrod |first= David | editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter= Delegation  |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC  |accessdate= |edition= |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n74 |isbn= 978-1-4129-6580-4 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages= 117\u201318 |quote=|ref= }} </ref>\n\n==Members==\nLegislatures are made up of individual members, known as [[Legislator|legislators]], who [[Voting|vote]] on proposed laws. A legislature usually contains a fixed number of legislators; because legislatures usually meet in a specific room filled with seats for the legislators, this is often described as the number of \"seats\" it contains. For example, a legislature that has 100 \"seats\" has 100 members. By extension, an [[electoral district]] that elects a single legislator can also be described as a \"seat\", as, for, example, in the phrases \"[[safe seat]]\" and \"[[marginal seat]]\".\n\nAfter election, the members may be protected by [[parliamentary immunity]] or [[Parliamentary privilege|parliamentary privilige]], either for all actions the duration of their entire term, or for just those related to their legislative duties.\n\n==Chambers==\n[[File:Vista panor\u00e1mica del Hemiciclo de sesiones del Congreso del Peru.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Congress of the Republic of Peru]], the country's national legislature, meets in the [[Legislative Palace (Peru)|Legislative Palace]] in 2010]]\n\nA legislature may [[debate]] and [[vote]] upon [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]]s as a single unit, or it may be composed of multiple separate [[Deliberative assembly|assemblies]], called by various names including [[Chambers of parliament|''legislative chambers'']], [[Debate chamber|''debate chambers'']], and ''houses'', which debate and vote separately and have distinct powers. A legislature which operates as a single unit is [[Unicameralism|unicameral]], one divided into two chambers is [[Bicameralism|bicameral]], and one divided into three chambers is [[Tricameralism|tricameral]].\n[[File:House of Commons Chamber 1.png|thumb|left|The [[United Kingdom|British]] [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], its lower house]]\nIn bicameral legislatures, one chamber is usually considered the [[upper house]], while the other is considered the [[lower house]]. The two types are not rigidly different, but members of upper houses tend to be indirectly elected or appointed rather than directly elected, tend to be allocated by [[Administrative division|administrative divisions]] rather than by population, and tend to have longer terms than members of the lower house. In some systems, particularly [[Parliamentary system|parliamentary systems]], the upper house has less power and tends to have a more advisory role, but in others, particularly [[Federation|federal]] [[Presidential system|presidential systems]], the upper house has equal or even greater power. \n[[File:Deutscher Bundestag Plenarsaal Seitenansicht.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Germany|German]] [[Bundestag]], its theoretical lower house]]\n\nIn [[federation]]s, the upper house typically represents the federation's component states.

In colloquial usage, the term ''billiards'' may be used colloquially to refer to [[pocket billiards]] games, such as [[pocket billiards|pool]], [[snooker]], or [[Russian pyramid]].\n\nThere are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:\n*[[Carom billiards]], referring to games played on tables without {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}}, typically 10 feet in length, including [[balkline and straight rail]], [[cushion caroms]], [[carom billiards#Three-cushion billiards|three-cushion billiards]], [[artistic billiards]] and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]]\n*[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], covering numerous pocket billiards games generally played on six-pocket tables of 7-, 8-, or 9-foot length, including among others [[eight-ball]] (the world's most widely played cue sport), [[nine-ball]] (the dominant professional game), [[ten-ball]], [[straight pool]] (the formerly dominant pro game), [[one-pocket]], and [[bank pool]]\n*[[Snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[Russian pyramid]], games played on a billiards table with six pockets called a [[snooker table]] (which has dimensions just under 12&nbsp;ft by 6&nbsp;ft), all of which are classified entirely separately from pool based on a separate historical development, as well as a separate culture and terminology that characterize their play.\n\nThere are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.\n\nBilliards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<!--Michael Phelan's 1850 book has an entire chapter devoted to mentions in Shakespeare works; which might be useful.--> including the famous line \"let's to billiards\" in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1606\u201307), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Napoleon]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mark Twain]], [[George Washington]], French president [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[W.

''Cue'' itself came from ''queue'', the French word for a [[tail]]. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a {{Cuegloss|Cushion|rail cushion}}.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n[[File:Caban\u00e8s, \u00c9ducation de Princes031 Les trois fils du Grand Dauphin, jouant au Jeu des Fortifications.jpg|thumb|left|The sons of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]] playing the ''royal game of fortifications'', early form of obstacle billiard]]  \nA recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King [[Louis XI of France]] (1461\u20131483) had the first known indoor billiard table.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among the French nobility.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], claimed that her \"table de billiard\" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners (and who covered her body with the table's cloth).<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nBy 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nInitially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nThe demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by [[John Thurston (inventor)|John Thurston]] and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and [[clay]], but the rich preferred to use [[ivory]].<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nEarly billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the \"arch\" (related to the croquet hoop), \"port\" (a different hoop) and \"king\" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\n[[Image:Studenten Billard.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Illustration of a three-ball [[pocket billiards]] game in early 19th century [[T\u00fcbingen]], Germany, using a table much longer than the modern type]]\nThe early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the '''[[carom billiards|carom or carambole billiards]]''' category \u2013 what most non-[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and non-US speakers mean by the word ''billiards''. These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} with a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}, then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include [[three-cushion]], [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail and the balkline variants]], [[cushion caroms]], [[five-pins]], and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]], among others.\n\nOver time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of [[Billiards table#Pocket billiards tables|pockets]], or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of [[pocket billiards]], including \"pool\" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and [[one-pocket]]; [[Russian pyramid]]; [[snooker]]; [[English billiards]] and others.\n\nIn the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. Players in annual championships began to receive their own [[cigarette card]]s. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 when the film \"The Hustler\" came out that sparked a new interest in the game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |title=Pool History |publisher=The Pool Shop |access-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111119012508/http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |archive-date=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|There are few more cheerful sights, when the evenings are long, and the weather dull, than a handsome, well-lighted billiard room, with the smooth, green surface of the billiard table; the ivory balls flying noiselessly here and there, or clicking musically together.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Charles, Jr. |last=Dickens |date=April 13, 1889 |title=Billiards |journal=All the Year Round |publisher=Charles Dickens and Evans, Crystal Palace Press |location=London |volume=64 |page=349 |oclc=1479125}}</ref>|Charles Dickens Jr., (1889)}}\n\n==As a sport==\nThe games with regulated international professional competition, if not others, have been referred to as \"sports\" or \"sporting\" events, not simply \"games\", since 1893 at the latest.<ref name=\"NYTBig\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/10/archives/meeting-of-the-champions-the-big-billiard-tournament-to-begin.html \"Meeting of the Champions; The Big Billiard Tournament to Begin To-morrow \u2013 What Ives, Schaefer, and Slosson Have Been Doing in Practice \u2013 The Older Players Not Afraid of the Big Runs Made by Ives \u2013 Something About the Rise and Progress of the Young 'Napoleon' of the Billiard World\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316051135/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40613FF3A5F1A738DDDA90994DA415B8385F0D3 |date=2014-03-16 }}, no byline, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1893-12-10, p. 10; [[The New York Times Company]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], USA.</ref> Quite a variety of particular games (i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.\n\nSnooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool, pyramid and other such games.<!-- There are other places where we need to \"respect\" snooker as a separate sport; it's really a global tour-de-force and had a WikiProject before \"WikiProject Cue sports\", so let's see how we can help them and not step on their toes but also remain historically/logically accurate. -SMcCandlish-->\n\nA \"Billiards\" category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 [[World Games]], held in [[Duisburg]], Germany, and the 2006 [[Asian Games]] also saw the [[Cue sports at the 2006 Asian Games|introduction of a \"Cue sports\" category]].\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Maincat|Cue sports equipment}}\n<!-- Much of this entire section needs to be pared down, with details moving to more specific pages like [[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], [[Snooker]], and [[Carom billiards]]. -->\n\n===Billiard balls===\n{{Main|Billiard ball}}\n[[File:Billiard ball comparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{Cuegloss|Cue ball|Cue balls}} from (left to right): {{unordered list\n| [[Russian pyramid|Russian pool]] and [[Kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]]\u201468&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|11|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Carom billiards|Carom]]\u201461.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|7|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| American-style [[Pocket billiards|pool]]\u201457&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Blackball (pool)|British-style]] pool (largish) \u201456&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|3|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Snooker]]\u201452.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|15}}&nbsp;in)\n| Scaled-down pool\u201451&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) for children's smaller tables\n}}\nNot shown: half-scale children's miniature pool\u2014approximately 28.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|1|8}}&nbsp;in).]]\nBilliard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity.\n\n[[Russian pyramid]] and [[Kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] have a size of 68&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|11|16}}&nbsp;in).

The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was [[celluloid]], invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.<ref name=\"IEOB\">{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons & Burford | location = [[New York City|New York, NY]] | isbn = 1-55821-219-1 | nopp = true | url = https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000sham }}</ref><ref>The New York Times Company (September 16, 1875).

Generally, tables are [[rectangle]]s twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side.  Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} long on the longest side. [[Pool hall]]s tend to have {{convert|9|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables and cater to the serious pool player. [[Public house|Pubs]] will typically use {{convert|7|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.\n\nThe length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|sing=on}} table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a {{cuegloss|bed}} made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets).{{clear}}\n\n===Cloth===\n{{Main|Baize}}\n[[Image:Early-1880s-billiards-ladies-JMBB.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Women playing on an elaborately decorated green-covered table in an early 1880s advertising poster.]]\nAll types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called \"felt\", but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called [[baize]]). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century.\n\nBar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use \"slower\", more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale [[pool halls|pool (and snooker) halls]] and home [[billiard room]]s is \"faster\" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100% [[worsted|worsted wool]]. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.\n\nThe cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.<ref name=\"Shamos 1991\">{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1991 | title = Pool | publisher = Hotho & Co., June 1991 | isbn = 99938-704-3-9 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> Television broadcasting of pool as well as 3 Cushion billiards prefers a blue colored cloth which was chosen for better visibility and contrast against colored balls.\n\nThe cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were determined that the cloth should not be ripped \u2013 women were made to continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.\n\n===Rack===\n{{main|Rack (billiards)}}\n[[Image:Billiard Rack.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Aluminium billiard rack that is used for 8-ball, 9-ball, and straight pool.]]\n\nA [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball.\n\nThere are several other types of less common rack types that are also used, based on a \"template\" to hold the billiard balls tightly together.  Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack.  The rack is used to set up the \"break\" and removed before the \"break shot\" occurs.\n\n===Cues===\n{{main|Cue stick}}\nBilliards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.\n\nThe {{Cuegloss|Butt|butt}} end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The {{Cuegloss|Shaft|shaft}} of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an {{convert|0.4|to|0.55|in|mm}} terminus called a {{Cuegloss|Ferrule|ferrule}} (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather {{Cuegloss|Tip|tip}} is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart [[Cue sports techniques#Sidespin (english)|spin]] to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.\n\nCheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of [[Gonystylus|ramin]], which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}}.\n\n===Mechanical bridge===\n<span id=\"The mechanical bridge\" ></span><!--Orig. section name; may be linked-to somewhere.-->The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a \"rake\", \"crutch\", \"bridge stick\" or simply \"bridge\", and in the UK a \"rest\", is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires.\n\nSome players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.\n\nBridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.\n\nIn Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.\n\nFor snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12&nbsp;cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15&nbsp;cm with the groove.\n\n===Chalk===\n[[Image:Billiard Chalk and Cue.jpg|thumb|240px|Billiard chalk is applied to the tip of the cue.]]Chalk is applied to the [https://billiardguides.com/best-pool-cue-tips/ tip of the cue stick], ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no {{Cuegloss|Miscue|miscue}} (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Chalk is an important element to make good shots in pool or [[snooker]]. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as \"[[chalk]]\" (generally [[calcium carbonate]]), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a [[silicate]] base. It was around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly introduced to the American players and is how the term \"putting English on the ball\" came to be. \"Chalk\" may also refer to a cone of fine, white {{Cuegloss|Hand chalk|hand chalk}}; like [[talc]] (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.\n\nCue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro [[William A.

All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball.  Others of multinational interest are [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]] and [[five-pins]].\n\nThe most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are [[pool (cue sports)|Pool]] and [[snooker]]. A third, [[English billiards]], has some features of carom billiards. English billiards used to be one of the two most-competitive cue sports along with the carom game balkline, at the turn of the 20th century and is still enjoyed today in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Another pocket game, [[Russian pyramid]] and its variants like [[kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] are popular in the former [[Eastern bloc]].\n[[Image:Cue and mace.jpg|thumb|Man playing billiards with a cue and a woman with mace, from an illustration appearing in [[Michael Phelan (billiards)|Michael Phelan]]'s 1859 book, ''The Game of Billiards''.]]\n\n===Games played on a carom billiards table===\n{{Main|Carom billiards}}\n\n====Straight rail or straight billiards====\n{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}\nIn straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.\n\nAlthough a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to {{Cuegloss|Gather shot|gather}} the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of {{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse shots}} to score a seemingly limitless number of points.\n\nThe first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.]] scored 690 points in a single turn<ref name=\"Shamos 1991\"/>{{Page needed|date=September 2011}} (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless \"nursing\", there was little for the fans to watch<!--, though the matches were popular anyway and the subject of major press coverage **Dig up some good NYTimes 1800s articles and cite them here first.** -->.\n\n====Balkline====\n{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}\nIn light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A {{Cuegloss|Balkline|balkline}} (not to be confused with {{Cuegloss|Baulk line|baulk line}}, which pertains to the game of [[English billiards]]) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the ''games'' of balkline \u2013 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced \"eighteen-point-two\") balkline, among other more obscure variations \u2013 the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at {{convert|18|in|mm}} from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.\n\n====Three-cushion billiards====\n{{main|Three-cushion billiards}}\nA more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table ''and'' contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.\nThis is sometimes described as \"hardest to learn\" and \"require most skill\" of all billiards. Even quite good Pool or Snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point, without even managing an accidental score.\n\n===Games played on a pool table===\n{{Main|Pool (cue sports)}}\n\nThere are many variations of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include [[eight-ball]], [[nine-ball]], [[straight pool]] and [[one-pocket]]. Even within games types (e.g. [[eight-ball]]), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules.  A few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below.\n\nIn eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]]ous \"{{Cuegloss|Money ball|money ball}}\". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u22ef&nbsp;+&nbsp;15&nbsp;=&nbsp;120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket}}, or all by {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|bank shots}}. In snooker, players score points by alternately potting {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red balls}} and various special \"{{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour balls}}\".\n\n====Two-player or -team games====\n*[[Eight-ball]]: The goal is to {{cuegloss|pocket}} ({{cuegloss|pot}}) all of one's designated {{cuegloss|group}} of balls (either {{cuegloss|stripes}} vs. {{cuegloss|solids}}, or {{cuegloss|red ball|reds}} vs. {{cuegloss|yellow ball|yellows}}, depending upon the equipment), and then pocket the {{cuegloss|8 ball}} in a {{cuegloss|call shot|called}} pocket.\n*[[Nine-ball]]: The goal is to pocket the 9 ball; the initial contact of the {{cuegloss|cue ball}} each turn must be with the lowest-numbered {{cuegloss|object ball}} remaining on the table; there are numerous variants such as [[seven-ball]], [[six-ball]], and the older forms of three-ball and ten-ball, that simply use a different number of balls and have a different {{cuegloss|money ball}}.\n*[[Straight pool]] (a.k.a. 14.1 continuous pool): The goal is to reach a predetermined number of {{cuegloss|point|points}} (e.g. 100); a point is earned by pocketing any called ball into a designated pocket; game play is by {{cuegloss|rack|racks}} of 15 balls, and the last object ball of a rack is not pocketed, but left on the table with the opponent re-racking the remaining 14 before game play continues.\n*[[Bank pool]]: The goal is to reach a predetermined number of points; a point is earned by pocketing any called ball by {{cuegloss|bank shot|banking}} it into a designated pocket using one or more {{cuegloss|cushion}}.\n\n====Speed pool====\n[[Speed pool]] is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament. The [[International Speed Pool Challenge]] has been held annually since 2006.\n\n===Games played on a snooker table ===\n\n====English billiards====\n{{Main|English billiards}}\nDating to approximately 1800, English billiards, called simply billiards<ref name=\"Everton 1986 other\">{{cite book|last = Everton|first = Clive|authorlink = Clive Everton|title = The History of Snooker and Billiards|year=1986|location=[[Haywards Heath|Haywards Heath, UK]]|publisher=[[Transworld (company)|Partridge Pr]]|isbn=1-85225-013-5|edition=rev. ver. of ''The Story of Billiards and Snooker'', 1979}}</ref> in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|former British colonies]] and in the UK where it originated, was originally called the ''winning and losing carambole game'', folding in the names of three predecessor games, ''the winning game'', ''the losing game'' and ''the carambole game'' (an early form of [[straight rail]]), that combined to form it.<ref name=\"Shamos 1999\">{{Shamos 1999|46, 61\u201362, 89, 244}}</ref> The game features both {{Cuegloss|cannon|cannons}} (caroms) and the pocketing of balls as objects of play.

The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to \"{{Cuegloss|Snooker|snooker}}\" the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major national pastime along with association football and [[cricket]]. It is played in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate, and Latin America and [[Continental Europe]], where carom games dominate. The first [[World Snooker Championship]] was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the [[International Billiards and Snooker Federation]] (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.\n\n==List of cue sports and games==\n{{Anchor|List of cue sports|List of cue games|List of cue games and sports}}\n\n===Carom games===\n{{anchor|Carom billiards games}}\n{{Main|Carom billiards}}\n{{Maincat|Carom billiards}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Artistic billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Balkline and straight rail|Balkline]] games (18.1, 18.2, etc.)\n*[[Four-ball billiards|Four-ball]] ({{transl|ja|''yotsudama''}}, {{transl|ko|''sagu''}})\n*[[Balkline and straight rail|Straight-rail]]\n*'''[[Three-cushion billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*{{crossref|See also \"Hybrid games\", below.}}\n\n====Target carom games====\n{{anchor|Target carom billiards games}}\n*'''[[Five-pin billiards]]''' (a major international cue sport)\n*''{{lang|it|[[Goriziana]]}}'' (or nine-pin billiards)\n}}\n\n===Pocket games===\n{{anchor|Pocket billiards games}}\n{{Main|Pocket billiards}}\n\n====Pool games====\n{{anchor|Pool billiards games|Pool pocket billiards games}}\n{{Maincat|Pool (cue sports)}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[American rotation]]\n*[[Artistic pool]] (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Bank pool]]\n*[[Baseball pocket billiards]]\n*[[Bowlliards]]\n*[[Chicago (pool)|Chicago]]\n*[[Cribbage (pool)|Cribbage]]\n*[[Cutthroat (pool)|Cutthroat]]\n*'''[[Eight-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport; informally a.k.a. stripes & solids, or highs & lows)\n**[[Blackball (pool)|Blackball]] (a.k.a. eightball pool, British-style eight-ball)\n**[[Chinese eight-ball|\"Chinese\" eight-ball]]\n*[[Equal offense]]\n*[[Fifteen-ball pool|Fifteen-ball]]\n*[[Honolulu (pool)|Honolulu]]\n*[[Kelly pool]]\n*[[Killer (pool)|Killer]]\n*'''[[Nine-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*'''[[One-pocket]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Rotation (pool)|Rotation]] (a.k.a. 61)\n*[[Seven-ball]]\n*[[Speed pool]]\n*'''[[Straight pool]]''' (a major world cue sport; a.k.a. 14.1 continuous)\n*'''[[Ten-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Three-ball]]\n}}\n\n====Non-pool pocket games====\n{{anchor|Non-pool games|Non-pool pocket billiards games}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Golf (billiards)|Golf billiards]] (and its variant, around-the-world)\n*'''[[Russian pyramid]]''' (a major cue sport in Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR)\n*{{crossref|See also \"Snooker games\" and \"Hybrid games\", below.}}\n}}\n\n===Snooker games===\n{{Anchor|Snooker}}\n{{Maincat|Snooker}}\nTechnically a form of pocket billiards, snooker has its own worldwide sporting community separate from that of pool.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Snooker]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Six-red snooker]]\n*[[American snooker]]\n*[[Brazilian snooker]]\n*[[Volunteer snooker]]\n*[[Snooker plus]]\n*[[Power Snooker]]\n* {{crossref|See also golf billiards, above.}}\n}}\n\n===Hybrid carom and pocket games===\n{{anchor|Hybrid games|Hybrid billiards games|Hybrid carom and pocket billiards games}}\nThese combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards, and are played on tables with pockets (often as {{cuegloss|hazard}}s not targets).\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bottle pool]]\n*[[Cowboy pool]]\n*'''[[English billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Five-pin billiards]], historically\n*[[Poker pool]]\n*[[Kaisa (billiards)|Kaisa]]\n}}\n\n===Obstacle and target games===\n{{anchor|Obstacle and target billiards games}}\n{{maincat|Obstacle billiards}}<!--Update that after cat. rename.-->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bagatelle]] (obsolete)\n*[[Bar billiards]]\n*[[Bumper pool]]\n*[[Danish pin billiards]] and other [[pin billiards (disambiguation)|pin billiards]] games\n*[[Devil's pool (billiards)|Devil's pool]] and [[victory billiards]]\n*[[Bottle pool]], skittle pool (pin pool), and Italian [[five-pin billiards]] and [[goriziana]] are vestigially classifiable here as well\n}}\n\n===Disk games===\n{{anchor|Disk billiards games|Disc games|Disc billiards games}}\nThese are variations using small disks instead of balls, and light-weight cue sticks.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Carrom]] (some variants of this table-top game use miniature cues; mostly played with the hands)\n*[[Crokinole]] (some variants of this combination of carrom and shuffleboard use miniature cues)\n*[[Novuss]] (uses full-length cues)\n}}\n\n===Ground games===\n{{anchor|Ground billiards games}}\n{{maincat|Ground billiards}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\nOutdoor games played on a lawn, field or court, played with varying equipment that may include hoops, pins, holes or other targets or obstacles, and clubs, curved-head sticks, or mallets.

While that familiar name is still employed by some as a generic label for all such games, the word's usage has splintered into more exclusive competing meanings in various parts of the world. For example, in [[British English|British]] and [[Australian English]], ''billiards'' usually refers exclusively to the game of [[English billiards]], while in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]] it is sometimes used to refer to a particular game or class of games, or to all cue games in general, depending upon [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect]] and context. In colloquial usage, the term ''billiards'' may be used colloquially to refer to [[pocket billiards]] games, such as [[pocket billiards|pool]], [[snooker]], or [[Russian pyramid]].\n\nThere are 3 major subdivisions of games within cue sports:\n*[[Carom billiards]], referring to games played on tables without {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pockets}}, typically 10 feet in length, including [[balkline and straight rail]], [[cushion caroms]], [[carom billiards#Three-cushion billiards|three-cushion billiards]], [[artistic billiards]] and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]]\n*[[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], covering numerous pocket billiards games generally played on six-pocket tables of 7-, 8-, or 9-foot length, including among others [[eight-ball]] (the world's most widely played cue sport), [[nine-ball]] (the dominant professional game), [[ten-ball]], [[straight pool]] (the formerly dominant pro game), [[one-pocket]], and [[bank pool]]\n*[[Snooker]], [[English billiards]] and [[Russian pyramid]], games played on a billiards table with six pockets called a [[snooker table]] (which has dimensions just under 12&nbsp;ft by 6&nbsp;ft), all of which are classified entirely separately from pool based on a separate historical development, as well as a separate culture and terminology that characterize their play.\n\nThere are other variants that make use of obstacles and targets, and table-top games played with disks instead of balls.\n\nBilliards has a long and rich history stretching from its inception in the 15th century, to the wrapping of the body of [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], in her billiard table cover in 1586, through its many mentions in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<!--Michael Phelan's 1850 book has an entire chapter devoted to mentions in Shakespeare works; which might be useful.--> including the famous line \"let's to billiards\" in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (1606\u201307), and through the many famous enthusiasts of the sport such as: [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], [[Louis XIV of France]], [[Marie Antoinette]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Napoleon]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[Mark Twain]], [[George Washington]], French president [[Jules Gr\u00e9vy]], [[Charles Dickens]], [[George Armstrong Custer]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Lewis Carroll]], [[W.

''Cue'' itself came from ''queue'', the French word for a [[tail]]. This refers to the early practice of using the tail of the mace to strike the ball when it lay against a {{Cuegloss|Cushion|rail cushion}}.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n[[File:Caban\u00e8s, \u00c9ducation de Princes031 Les trois fils du Grand Dauphin, jouant au Jeu des Fortifications.jpg|thumb|left|The sons of [[Louis, Grand Dauphin]] playing the ''royal game of fortifications'', early form of obstacle billiard]]  \nA recognizable form of billiards was played outdoors in the 1340s, and was reminiscent of croquet. King [[Louis XI of France]] (1461\u20131483) had the first known indoor billiard table.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] further refined and popularized the game, and it swiftly spread among the French nobility.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> While the game had long been played on the ground, this version appears to have died out in the 17th century, in favor of croquet, golf and bowling games, while table billiards had grown in popularity as an indoor activity.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], claimed that her \"table de billiard\" had been taken away by those who eventually became her executioners (and who covered her body with the table's cloth).<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> Billiards grew to the extent that by 1727, it was being played in almost every Paris caf\u00e9.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" /> In England, the game was developing into a very popular activity for members of the gentry.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nBy 1670, the thin butt end of the mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was originally only there as a preventative method to stop balls from rolling off), but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue as it is known today was finally developed by about 1800.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nInitially, the mace was used to push the balls, rather than strike them. The newly developed striking cue provided a new challenge. Cushions began to be stuffed with substances to allow the balls to rebound, in order to enhance the appeal of the game. After a transitional period where only the better players would use cues, the cue came to be the first choice of equipment.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nThe demand for tables and other equipment was initially met in Europe by [[John Thurston (inventor)|John Thurston]] and other furniture makers of the era. The early balls were made from wood and [[clay]], but the rich preferred to use [[ivory]].<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\nEarly billiard games involved various pieces of additional equipment, including the \"arch\" (related to the croquet hoop), \"port\" (a different hoop) and \"king\" (a pin or skittle near the arch) in the 1770s, but other game variants, relying on the cushions (and eventually on pockets cut into them), were being formed that would go on to play fundamental roles in the development of modern billiards.<ref name=\"Everton 1986\" />\n\n[[Image:Studenten Billard.JPG|thumb|left|280px|Illustration of a three-ball [[pocket billiards]] game in early 19th century [[T\u00fcbingen]], Germany, using a table much longer than the modern type]]\nThe early croquet-like games eventually led to the development of the '''[[carom billiards|carom or carambole billiards]]''' category \u2013 what most non-[[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] and non-US speakers mean by the word ''billiards''. These games, which once completely dominated the cue sports world but have declined markedly in many areas over the last few generations, are games played with three or sometimes four balls, on a table without holes (and without obstructions or targets in most cases), in which the goal is generally to strike one {{Cuegloss|Object ball|object ball}} with a {{Cuegloss|Cue ball|cue ball}}, then have the cue ball rebound off of one or more of the cushions and strike a second object ball. Variations include [[three-cushion]], [[Balkline and straight rail|straight rail and the balkline variants]], [[cushion caroms]], [[five-pins]], and [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]], among others.\n\nOver time, a type of obstacle returned, originally as a hazard and later as a target, in the form of [[Billiards table#Pocket billiards tables|pockets]], or holes partly cut into the table bed and partly into the cushions, leading to the rise of [[pocket billiards]], including \"pool\" games such as eight-ball, nine-ball, straight pool and [[one-pocket]]; [[Russian pyramid]]; [[snooker]]; [[English billiards]] and others.\n\nIn the United States pool and billiards had died out for a bit, but between 1878 and 1956 pool and billiards became very popular. Players in annual championships began to receive their own [[cigarette card]]s. This was mainly due to the fact that it was a popular pastime for troops to take their minds off from battle. However, by the end of World War II pool and billiards began to die down once again. It was not until 1961 when the film \"The Hustler\" came out that sparked a new interest in the game. Now the game is generally a well-known game and has many players of all different skill levels.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |title=Pool History |publisher=The Pool Shop |access-date=1 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111119012508/http://www.thebilliardshop.com/poolhistory.php |archive-date=November 19, 2011}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|There are few more cheerful sights, when the evenings are long, and the weather dull, than a handsome, well-lighted billiard room, with the smooth, green surface of the billiard table; the ivory balls flying noiselessly here and there, or clicking musically together.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Charles, Jr. |last=Dickens |date=April 13, 1889 |title=Billiards |journal=All the Year Round |publisher=Charles Dickens and Evans, Crystal Palace Press |location=London |volume=64 |page=349 |oclc=1479125}}</ref>|Charles Dickens Jr., (1889)}}\n\n==As a sport==\nThe games with regulated international professional competition, if not others, have been referred to as \"sports\" or \"sporting\" events, not simply \"games\", since 1893 at the latest.<ref name=\"NYTBig\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1893/12/10/archives/meeting-of-the-champions-the-big-billiard-tournament-to-begin.html \"Meeting of the Champions; The Big Billiard Tournament to Begin To-morrow \u2013 What Ives, Schaefer, and Slosson Have Been Doing in Practice \u2013 The Older Players Not Afraid of the Big Runs Made by Ives \u2013 Something About the Rise and Progress of the Young 'Napoleon' of the Billiard World\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140316051135/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40613FF3A5F1A738DDDA90994DA415B8385F0D3 |date=2014-03-16 }}, no byline, ''[[The New York Times]]'', 1893-12-10, p. 10; [[The New York Times Company]], [[New York City|New York, NY]], USA.</ref> Quite a variety of particular games (i.e., sets of rules and equipment) are the subject of present-day competition, including many of those already mentioned, with competition being especially broad in nine-ball, snooker, three-cushion and eight-ball.\n\nSnooker, though technically a pocket billiards variant and closely related in its equipment and origin to the game of English billiards, is a professional sport organized at the international level, and its rules bear little resemblance to those of modern pool, pyramid and other such games.<!-- There are other places where we need to \"respect\" snooker as a separate sport; it's really a global tour-de-force and had a WikiProject before \"WikiProject Cue sports\", so let's see how we can help them and not step on their toes but also remain historically/logically accurate. -SMcCandlish-->\n\nA \"Billiards\" category encompassing pool, snooker and carom was featured in the 2005 [[World Games]], held in [[Duisburg]], Germany, and the 2006 [[Asian Games]] also saw the [[Cue sports at the 2006 Asian Games|introduction of a \"Cue sports\" category]].\n\n==Equipment==\n{{Maincat|Cue sports equipment}}\n<!-- Much of this entire section needs to be pared down, with details moving to more specific pages like [[Pool (cue sports)|Pool]], [[Snooker]], and [[Carom billiards]]. -->\n\n===Billiard balls===\n{{Main|Billiard ball}}\n[[File:Billiard ball comparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|{{Cuegloss|Cue ball|Cue balls}} from (left to right): {{unordered list\n| [[Russian pyramid|Russian pool]] and [[Kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]]\u201468&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|11|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Carom billiards|Carom]]\u201461.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|7|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| American-style [[Pocket billiards|pool]]\u201457&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|4}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Blackball (pool)|British-style]] pool (largish) \u201456&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|3|16}}&nbsp;in)\n| [[Snooker]]\u201452.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|1|15}}&nbsp;in)\n| Scaled-down pool\u201451&nbsp;mm (2&nbsp;in) for children's smaller tables\n}}\nNot shown: half-scale children's miniature pool\u2014approximately 28.5&nbsp;mm ({{frac|1|1|8}}&nbsp;in).]]\nBilliard balls vary from game to game, in size, design and quantity.\n\n[[Russian pyramid]] and [[Kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] have a size of 68&nbsp;mm ({{frac|2|11|16}}&nbsp;in).

The dominant material from 1627 until the early 20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York billiard table manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was [[celluloid]], invented by [[John Wesley Hyatt]] in 1868, but the material was volatile, sometimes exploding during manufacture and was highly flammable.<ref name=\"IEOB\">{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1993 | title = The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Billiards | publisher = Lyons & Burford | location = [[New York City|New York, NY]] | isbn = 1-55821-219-1 | nopp = true | url = https://archive.org/details/illustratedencyc0000sham }}</ref><ref>The New York Times Company (September 16, 1875).

Retrieved January 2, 2007.</ref>\n\n===Tables===\n{{main|Billiard table}}\n[[Image:PoolTablewithEquipment-non.jpg|left|thumb|265px|Pool table with equipment.]]\nThere are many sizes and styles of pool and [[billiards table|billiard table]]s. Generally, tables are [[rectangle]]s twice as long as they are wide. Most pool tables are known as 7-, 8-, or 9-footers, referring to the length of the table's long side.  Full-size snooker and English billiard tables are {{convert|12|ft|m|1}} long on the longest side. [[Pool hall]]s tend to have {{convert|9|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables and cater to the serious pool player. [[Public house|Pubs]] will typically use {{convert|7|ft|m|1|sing=on}} tables which are often coin-operated. Formerly, {{convert|10|ft|m|0|sing=on}} tables were common, but such tables are now considered antique collectors items; a few, usually from the late 19th century, can be found in pool halls from time to time. Ten-foot tables remain the standard size for carom billiard games. The slates on modern carom tables are usually heated to stave off moisture and provide a consistent playing surface.\n\nThe length of the pool table will typically be a function of space, with many homeowners purchasing an {{convert|8|ft|m|1|sing=on}} table as a compromise. Full-size pool tables are 4.5 by {{convert|9|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} (interior dimensions). High-quality tables have a {{cuegloss|bed}} made of thick slate, in three pieces to prevent warping and changes due to temperature and humidity. Smaller bar tables are most commonly made with a single piece of slate. Pocket billiards tables of all types normally have six pockets, three on each side (four corner pockets, and two side or middle pockets).{{clear}}\n\n===Cloth===\n{{Main|Baize}}\n[[Image:Early-1880s-billiards-ladies-JMBB.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Women playing on an elaborately decorated green-covered table in an early 1880s advertising poster.]]\nAll types of tables are covered with billiard cloth (often called \"felt\", but actually a woven wool or wool/nylon blend called [[baize]]). Cloth has been used to cover billiards tables since the 15th century.\n\nBar or tavern tables, which get a lot of play, use \"slower\", more durable cloth. The cloth used in upscale [[pool halls|pool (and snooker) halls]] and home [[billiard room]]s is \"faster\" (i.e., provides less friction, allowing the balls to roll farther across the table {{Cuegloss|Bed|bed}}), and competition-quality pool cloth is made from 100% [[worsted|worsted wool]]. Snooker cloth traditionally has a nap (consistent fiber directionality) and balls behave differently when rolling against versus along with the nap.\n\nThe cloth of the billiard table has traditionally been green, reflecting its origin (originally the grass of ancestral lawn games), and has been so colored since the 16th century, but it is also produced in other colors such as red and blue.<ref name=\"Shamos 1991\">{{cite book | last = Shamos | first = Michael Ian | year = 1991 | title = Pool | publisher = Hotho & Co., June 1991 | isbn = 99938-704-3-9 }}{{Page needed|date=September 2011}}</ref> Television broadcasting of pool as well as 3 Cushion billiards prefers a blue colored cloth which was chosen for better visibility and contrast against colored balls.\n\nThe cloth was earlier said to be the most important part of the game, most likely because of the reflection of the game's origin. The players were determined that the cloth should not be ripped \u2013 women were made to continue to use maces after cues were invented, for fear that they would rip the cloth with the sharper cues.\n\n===Rack===\n{{main|Rack (billiards)}}\n[[Image:Billiard Rack.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Aluminium billiard rack that is used for 8-ball, 9-ball, and straight pool.]]\n\nA [[Rack (billiards)|rack]] is the name given to a frame (usually wood, plastic or aluminium) used to organize billiard balls at the beginning of a game. This is traditionally triangular in shape, but varies with the type of billiards played. There are two main types of racks; the more common triangular shape which is used for eight-ball and straight pool and the diamond-shaped rack used for nine-ball.\n\nThere are several other types of less common rack types that are also used, based on a \"template\" to hold the billiard balls tightly together.  Most commonly it is a thin plastic sheet with diamond-shaped cut-outs that hold the balls that is placed on the table with the balls set on top of the rack.  The rack is used to set up the \"break\" and removed before the \"break shot\" occurs.\n\n===Cues===\n{{main|Cue stick}}\nBilliards games are mostly played with a stick known as a cue. A cue is usually either a one piece tapered stick or a two piece stick divided in the middle by a joint of metal or phenolic resin. High quality cues are generally two pieces and are made of a hardwood, generally maple for billiards and ash for snooker.\n\nThe {{Cuegloss|Butt|butt}} end of the cue is of larger circumference and is intended to be gripped by a player's hand. The {{Cuegloss|Shaft|shaft}} of the cue is of smaller circumference, usually tapering to an {{convert|0.4|to|0.55|in|mm}} terminus called a {{Cuegloss|Ferrule|ferrule}} (usually made of fiberglass or brass in better cues), where a rounded leather {{Cuegloss|Tip|tip}} is affixed, flush with the ferrule, to make final contact with balls. The tip, in conjunction with chalk, can be used to impart [[Cue sports techniques#Sidespin (english)|spin]] to the cue ball when it is not hit in its center.\n\nCheap cues are generally made of pine, low-grade maple (and formerly often of [[Gonystylus|ramin]], which is now endangered), or other low-quality wood, with inferior plastic ferrules. A quality cue can be expensive and may be made of exotic woods and other expensive materials which are artfully inlaid in decorative patterns. Many modern cues are also made, like [[Golf club (equipment)|golf club]]s, with high-tech materials such as woven graphite. Skilled players may use more than one cue during a game, including a separate generally lighter cue for the opening break shot (because of cue speed gained from a lighter stick) and another, shorter cue with a special tip for {{Cuegloss|Jump shot|jump shots}}.\n\n===Mechanical bridge===\n<span id=\"The mechanical bridge\" ></span><!--Orig. section name; may be linked-to somewhere.-->The mechanical bridge, sometimes called a \"rake\", \"crutch\", \"bridge stick\" or simply \"bridge\", and in the UK a \"rest\", is used to extend a player's reach on a shot where the cue ball is too far away for normal hand bridging. It consists of a stick with a grooved metal or plastic head which the cue slides on. Many amateurs refuse to use the mechanical bridge based on the perception that to do so is unmanly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}} However, many aficionados and most professionals employ the bridge whenever the intended shot so requires.\n\nSome players, especially current or former snooker players, use a screw-on cue butt extension instead of or in addition to the mechanical bridge.\n\nBridge head design is varied, and not all designs (especially those with cue shaft-enclosing rings, or wheels on the bottom of the head), are broadly tournament-approved.\n\nIn Italy a longer, thicker cue is typically available for this kind of tricky shot.\n\nFor snooker they are normally available in three forms, their use depending on how the player is hampered; the standard rest is a simple cross, the 'spider' has a raised arch around 12&nbsp;cm with three grooves to rest the cue in and for the most awkward of shots, the 'giraffe' (or 'swan' in England) which has a raised arch much like the 'spider' but with a slender arm reaching out around 15&nbsp;cm with the groove.\n\n===Chalk===\n[[Image:Billiard Chalk and Cue.jpg|thumb|240px|Billiard chalk is applied to the tip of the cue.]]Chalk is applied to the tip of the cue stick, ideally before every shot, to increase the tip's friction coefficient so that when it impacts the cue ball on a non-center hit, no {{Cuegloss|Miscue|miscue}} (unintentional slippage between the cue tip and the struck ball) occurs. Cue tip chalk is not actually the substance typically referred to as \"[[chalk]]\" (generally [[calcium carbonate]]), but any of several proprietary compounds, with a [[silicate]] base. It was around the time of the Industrial Revolution that newer compounds formed that provided better grip for the ball. This is when the English began to experiment with side spin or applying curl to the ball. This was shortly introduced to the American players and is how the term \"putting English on the ball\" came to be. \"Chalk\" may also refer to a cone of fine, white {{Cuegloss|Hand chalk|hand chalk}}; like [[talc]] (talcum powder) it can be used to reduce friction between the cue and bridge hand during shooting, for a smoother stroke. Some brands of hand chalk actually are made of compressed talc. (Tip chalk is not used for this purpose because it is abrasive, hand-staining and difficult to apply.) Many players prefer a slick pool glove over hand chalk or talc because of the messiness of these powders; buildup of particles on the cloth will affect ball behavior and necessitate more-frequent cloth cleaning.\n\nCue tip chalk (invented in its modern form by straight rail billiard pro [[William A. Spinks]] and chemist [[William Hoskins (inventor)|William Hoskins]] in 1897)<ref name=\"Clark1\">[http://www.toaster.org/hoskins_tragic.html \"The World's Most Tragic Man Is the One Who Never Starts\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825063214/http://www.toaster.org/hoskins_tragic.html |date=August 25, 2006 }}, Clark, Neil M.; originally published in ''The American'' magazine, May 1927; republished in ''hotwire: The Newsletter of the Toaster Museum Foundation'', vol. 3, no. 3, online edition.

All are played on a pocketless table with three balls; two cue balls and one object ball. In all, players shoot a cue ball so that it makes contact with the opponent's cue ball as well as the object ball.  Others of multinational interest are [[Four-ball billiards|four-ball]] and [[five-pins]].\n\nThe most globally popular of the large variety of pocket games are [[pool (cue sports)|Pool]] and [[snooker]]. A third, [[English billiards]], has some features of carom billiards. English billiards used to be one of the two most-competitive cue sports along with the carom game balkline, at the turn of the 20th century and is still enjoyed today in [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries. Another pocket game, [[Russian pyramid]] and its variants like [[kaisa (billiards)|kaisa]] are popular in the former [[Eastern bloc]].\n[[Image:Cue and mace.jpg|thumb|Man playing billiards with a cue and a woman with mace, from an illustration appearing in [[Michael Phelan (billiards)|Michael Phelan]]'s 1859 book, ''The Game of Billiards''.]]\n\n===Games played on a carom billiards table===\n{{Main|Carom billiards}}\n\n====Straight rail or straight billiards====\n{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}\nIn straight rail, a player scores a point and may continue shooting each time his cue ball makes contact with both other balls.\n\nAlthough a difficult and subtle game, some of the best players of straight billiards developed the skill to {{Cuegloss|Gather shot|gather}} the balls in a corner or along the same rail for the purpose of playing a series of {{Cuegloss|Nurse|nurse shots}} to score a seemingly limitless number of points.\n\nThe first straight rail professional tournament was held in 1879 where [[Jacob Schaefer, Sr.]] scored 690 points in a single turn<ref name=\"Shamos 1991\"/>{{Page needed|date=September 2011}} (that is, 690 separate strokes without a miss). With the balls repetitively hit and barely moving in endless \"nursing\", there was little for the fans to watch<!--, though the matches were popular anyway and the subject of major press coverage **Dig up some good NYTimes 1800s articles and cite them here first.** -->.\n\n====Balkline====\n{{Main|Balkline and straight rail}}\nIn light of these phenomenal skill developments in straight rail, the game of balkline soon developed to make it impossible for a player to keep the balls gathered in one part of the table for long, greatly limiting the effectiveness of nurse shots. A {{Cuegloss|Balkline|balkline}} (not to be confused with {{Cuegloss|Baulk line|baulk line}}, which pertains to the game of [[English billiards]]) is a line parallel to one end of a billiards table. In the ''games'' of balkline \u2013 18.1 and 18.2 (pronounced \"eighteen-point-two\") balkline, among other more obscure variations \u2013 the players have to drive at least one object ball past a balkline set at {{convert|18|in|mm}} from each rail, after one or two points have been scored, respectively.\n\n====Three-cushion billiards====\n{{main|Three-cushion billiards}}\nA more elegant solution was three-cushion billiards, which requires a player to make contact with the other two balls on the table ''and'' contact three rail cushions in the process. This is difficult enough that even the best players can only manage to average one to two points per turn.\nThis is sometimes described as \"hardest to learn\" and \"require most skill\" of all billiards. Even quite good Pool or Snooker players may attempt an hour or more to score a single three cushion point, without even managing an accidental score.\n\n===Games played on a pool table===\n{{Main|Pool (cue sports)}}\n\nThere are many variations of games played on a standard pool table. Popular pool games include [[eight-ball]], [[nine-ball]], [[straight pool]] and [[one-pocket]]. Even within games types (e.g. [[eight-ball]]), there may be variations, and people may play recreationally using relaxed or local rules.  A few of the more popular examples of pool games are given below.\n\nIn eight-ball and nine-ball, the object is to sink object balls until one can legally pocket the winning [[:wikt:eponym|eponym]]ous \"{{Cuegloss|Money ball|money ball}}\". Well-known but waning in popularity is straight pool, in which players seek to continue sinking balls, rack after rack if they can, to reach a pre-determined winning score (typically 150). Related to nine-ball, another well-known game is [[Rotation (pool)|rotation]], where the lowest-numbered object ball on the table must be struck first, although any object ball may be pocketed (i.e., combination shot). Each pocketed ball is worth its number, and the player with the highest score at the end of the rack is the winner. Since there are only 120 points available (1&nbsp;+&nbsp;2&nbsp;+&nbsp;3&nbsp;\u22ef&nbsp;+&nbsp;15&nbsp;=&nbsp;120), scoring 61 points leaves no opportunity for the opponent to catch up. In both one-pocket and bank pool, the players must sink a set number of balls; respectively, all in a particular {{Cuegloss|Pocket|pocket}}, or all by {{Cuegloss|Bank shot|bank shots}}. In snooker, players score points by alternately potting {{Cuegloss|Red ball|red balls}} and various special \"{{Cuegloss|Colour ball|colour balls}}\".\n\n====Two-player or -team games====\n*[[Eight-ball]]: The goal is to {{cuegloss|pocket}} ({{cuegloss|pot}}) all of one's designated {{cuegloss|group}} of balls (either {{cuegloss|stripes}} vs. {{cuegloss|solids}}, or {{cuegloss|red ball|reds}} vs. {{cuegloss|yellow ball|yellows}}, depending upon the equipment), and then pocket the {{cuegloss|8 ball}} in a {{cuegloss|call shot|called}} pocket.\n*[[Nine-ball]]: The goal is to pocket the 9 ball; the initial contact of the {{cuegloss|cue ball}} each turn must be with the lowest-numbered {{cuegloss|object ball}} remaining on the table; there are numerous variants such as [[seven-ball]], [[six-ball]], and the older forms of three-ball and ten-ball, that simply use a different number of balls and have a different {{cuegloss|money ball}}.\n*[[Straight pool]] (a.k.a. 14.1 continuous pool): The goal is to reach a predetermined number of {{cuegloss|point|points}} (e.g. 100); a point is earned by pocketing any called ball into a designated pocket; game play is by {{cuegloss|rack|racks}} of 15 balls, and the last object ball of a rack is not pocketed, but left on the table with the opponent re-racking the remaining 14 before game play continues.\n*[[Bank pool]]: The goal is to reach a predetermined number of points; a point is earned by pocketing any called ball by {{cuegloss|bank shot|banking}} it into a designated pocket using one or more {{cuegloss|cushion}}.\n\n====Speed pool====\n[[Speed pool]] is a standard billiards game where the balls must be pocketed in as little time as possible. Rules vary greatly from tournament to tournament.

The name of the game became generalized to also describe one of its prime strategies: to \"{{Cuegloss|Snooker|snooker}}\" the opposing player by causing that player to foul or leave an opening to be exploited.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, snooker is by far the most popular cue sport at the competitive level, and major national pastime along with association football and [[cricket]]. It is played in many [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries as well, especially in Asia. Snooker is uncommon in North America, where pool games such as eight-ball and nine-ball dominate, and Latin America and [[Continental Europe]], where carom games dominate. The first [[World Snooker Championship]] was held in 1927, and it has been held annually since then with few exceptions. The [[World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association]] (WPBSA) was established in 1968 to regulate the professional game, while the [[International Billiards and Snooker Federation]] (IBSF) regulates the amateur games.\n\n==List of cue sports and games==\n{{Anchor|List of cue sports|List of cue games|List of cue games and sports}}\n\n===Carom games===\n{{anchor|Carom billiards games}}\n{{Main|Carom billiards}}\n{{Maincat|Carom billiards}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Artistic billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Balkline and straight rail|Balkline]] games (18.1, 18.2, etc.)\n*[[Four-ball billiards|Four-ball]] ({{transl|ja|''yotsudama''}}, {{transl|ko|''sagu''}})\n*[[Balkline and straight rail|Straight-rail]]\n*'''[[Three-cushion billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*{{crossref|See also \"Hybrid games\", below.}}\n\n====Target carom games====\n{{anchor|Target carom billiards games}}\n*'''[[Five-pin billiards]]''' (a major international cue sport)\n*''{{lang|it|[[Goriziana]]}}'' (or nine-pin billiards)\n}}\n\n===Pocket games===\n{{anchor|Pocket billiards games}}\n{{Main|Pocket billiards}}\n\n====Pool games====\n{{anchor|Pool billiards games|Pool pocket billiards games}}\n{{Maincat|Pool (cue sports)}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[American rotation]]\n*[[Artistic pool]] (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Bank pool]]\n*[[Baseball pocket billiards]]\n*[[Bowlliards]]\n*[[Chicago (pool)|Chicago]]\n*[[Cribbage (pool)|Cribbage]]\n*[[Cutthroat (pool)|Cutthroat]]\n*'''[[Eight-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport; informally a.k.a. stripes & solids, or highs & lows)\n**[[Blackball (pool)|Blackball]] (a.k.a. eightball pool, British-style eight-ball)\n**[[Chinese eight-ball|\"Chinese\" eight-ball]]\n*[[Equal offense]]\n*[[Fifteen-ball pool|Fifteen-ball]]\n*[[Honolulu (pool)|Honolulu]]\n*[[Kelly pool]]\n*[[Killer (pool)|Killer]]\n*'''[[Nine-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*'''[[One-pocket]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Rotation (pool)|Rotation]] (a.k.a. 61)\n*[[Seven-ball]]\n*[[Speed pool]]\n*'''[[Straight pool]]''' (a major world cue sport; a.k.a. 14.1 continuous)\n*'''[[Ten-ball]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Three-ball]]\n}}\n\n====Non-pool pocket games====\n{{anchor|Non-pool games|Non-pool pocket billiards games}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Golf (billiards)|Golf billiards]] (and its variant, around-the-world)\n*'''[[Russian pyramid]]''' (a major cue sport in Eastern Europe and countries of the former USSR)\n*{{crossref|See also \"Snooker games\" and \"Hybrid games\", below.}}\n}}\n\n===Snooker games===\n{{Anchor|Snooker}}\n{{Maincat|Snooker}}\nTechnically a form of pocket billiards, snooker has its own worldwide sporting community separate from that of pool.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*'''[[Snooker]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Six-red snooker]]\n*[[American snooker]]\n*[[Brazilian snooker]]\n*[[Volunteer snooker]]\n*[[Snooker plus]]\n*[[Power Snooker]]\n* {{crossref|See also golf billiards, above.}}\n}}\n\n===Hybrid carom and pocket games===\n{{anchor|Hybrid games|Hybrid billiards games|Hybrid carom and pocket billiards games}}\nThese combine aspects of carom and pocket billiards, and are played on tables with pockets (often as {{cuegloss|hazard}}s not targets).\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bottle pool]]\n*[[Cowboy pool]]\n*'''[[English billiards]]''' (a major world cue sport)\n*[[Five-pin billiards]], historically\n*[[Poker pool]]\n*[[Kaisa (billiards)|Kaisa]]\n}}\n\n===Obstacle and target games===\n{{anchor|Obstacle and target billiards games}}\n{{maincat|Obstacle billiards}}<!--Update that after cat. rename.-->\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Bagatelle]] (obsolete)\n*[[Bar billiards]]\n*[[Bumper pool]]\n*[[Danish pin billiards]] and other [[pin billiards (disambiguation)|pin billiards]] games\n*[[Devil's pool (billiards)|Devil's pool]] and [[victory billiards]]\n*[[Bottle pool]], skittle pool (pin pool), and Italian [[five-pin billiards]] and [[goriziana]] are vestigially classifiable here as well\n}}\n\n===Disk games===\n{{anchor|Disk billiards games|Disc games|Disc billiards games}}\nThese are variations using small disks instead of balls, and light-weight cue sticks.\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n*[[Carrom]] (some variants of this table-top game use miniature cues; mostly played with the hands)\n*[[Crokinole]] (some variants of this combination of carrom and shuffleboard use miniature cues)\n*[[Novuss]] (uses full-length cues)\n}}\n\n===Ground games===\n{{anchor|Ground billiards games}}\n{{maincat|Ground billiards}}\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\nOutdoor games played on a lawn, field or court, played with varying equipment that may include hoops, pins, holes or other targets or obstacles, and clubs, curved-head sticks, or mallets.

Soon after, her husband was summoned to [[London]] and then ordered to [[Brussels]].\n\n== Waterloo ==\nHer husband was appointed [[Quartermaster general#United Kingdom|deputy quartermaster-general]]  in the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] army. On 8 June 1815, Magdalene and her husband arrived in Brussels where they were billeted in the house of the [[Comte de Lannoy]] at the [[Impasse du Parc]]. They expected to \"remain quietly there for a month at least\" and agreed that \"upon the commencement of hostilities [Magdalene] should go to [[Antwerp]], and there remain till the end of the campaign.\"  She witnessed the flurry of activity as an aide de camp arrived in Brussels on 15 June and her husband husband galloping to the Duke of Wellington's house where he found the Duke \"standing looking over a map with a Prussian general, who was in full-dress uniform\u2014with orders and crosses, etc.\u2014the Duke was in his chemise and slippers, preparing to dress for the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]].\"\n\nShe continues, \"The reveille was sounded all night, and the troops actively prepared for their march. I stood with my husband at a window of the house , which overlooked a gate of the city, and saw the whole army go out. Regiment after regiment passed through and melted away in the mist of the morning.

She writes about the confusion and rumours in Antwerp and hearing the noise of the cannon, which shook the house.\n\nOn the battlefield, about 3 P.M. on Sunday 18 June, when talking to the Duke of Wellington, a cannonball struck William and he fell to the ground. Wounded, he was moved to a cottage. Magdalene learned on Monday morning that he was alive; a few hours later that he was wounded. The route to find her husband was \"entangled in a crowd of wagons, carts, horses, wounded men, deserters or runaways, and all the rabble and confusion, the consequence of several battles\". Encountering Mr. William Hay of [[Duns Castle]], she was told William had died, but he following morning she was told his wounds were being attended by surgeons. A carriage took her to Brussels and then it took three hours to cover the nine miles from Brussels to the cottage where William was lying at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont St. Jean.]]\n\nThe road to [[Nivelles]] fronted the cottage, \"and every waggon going to and from the army, and all the wounded and prisoners, passed along that road.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nShe nursed William for six days, rarely sleeping, tearing her petticoat to provide dressings, applying leeches to his wounds and \"sat down to watch the melancholy progress of the water in his chest, which I saw would soon be fatal\".<ref name=\":1\" /> His funeral took place on 28 June. On 4 July, 3 months after her wedding, Magdalene visited her husband's grave and then departed for England.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== A Week in Waterloo ===\nAt her brother's request, Magdalene wrote a serial narrative account of her, \"A Week in Waterloo\", in June 1815. Her brother lent the narrative to [[Walter Scott|Sir Walter Scott]], [[Charles Dickens]] and others. A condensed account was found amongst the papers of her nephew, [[General De Lancey Lowe]], after his death in 1880. His widow published it in 1888.<ref>''[[Illustrated Naval and Military Magazine]]'' (1888), p. 414</ref> Her account was published in full with an explanatory preface in 1906.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nSir Walter Scott wrote on 13 October 1825 that he considered the narrative \"as one of the most valuable and important documents which could be published all illustrative of the woes of war ...

Soon after, her husband was summoned to [[London]] and then ordered to [[Brussels]].\n\n== Waterloo ==\nHer husband was appointed [[Quartermaster general#United Kingdom|deputy quartermaster-general]]  in the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington's]] army. On 8 June 1815, Magdalene and her husband arrived in Brussels where they were billeted in the house of the [[Comte de Lannoy]] at the [[Impasse du Parc]]. They expected to \"remain quietly there for a month at least\" and agreed that \"upon the commencement of hostilities [Magdalene] should go to [[Antwerp]], and there remain till the end of the campaign.\"  She witnessed the flurry of activity as an aide de camp arrived in Brussels on 15 June and her husband husband galloping to the Duke of Wellington's house where he found the Duke \"standing looking over a map with a Prussian general, who was in full-dress uniform\u2014with orders and crosses, etc.\u2014the Duke was in his chemise and slippers, preparing to dress for the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]].\"\n\nShe continues, \"The reveille was sounded all night, and the troops actively prepared for their march.

She writes about the confusion and rumours in Antwerp and hearing the noise of the cannon, which shook the house.\n\nOn the battlefield, about 3 P.M. on Sunday 18 June, when talking to the Duke of Wellington, a cannonball struck William and he fell to the ground. Wounded, he was moved to a cottage. Magdalene learned on Monday morning that he was alive; a few hours later that he was wounded. The route to find her husband was \"entangled in a crowd of wagons, carts, horses, wounded men, deserters or runaways, and all the rabble and confusion, the consequence of several battles\". Encountering Mr. William Hay of [[Duns Castle]], she was told William had died, but he following morning she was told his wounds were being attended by surgeons. A carriage took her to Brussels and then it took three hours to cover the nine miles from Brussels to the cottage where William was lying at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont St. Jean.]]\n\nThe road to [[Nivelles]] fronted the cottage, \"and every waggon going to and from the army, and all the wounded and prisoners, passed along that road.\"<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nShe nursed William for six days, rarely sleeping, tearing her petticoat to provide dressings, applying leeches to his wounds and \"sat down to watch the melancholy progress of the water in his chest, which I saw would soon be fatal\".<ref name=\":1\" /> His funeral took place on 28 June.

Riedle, who was a minor convicted of molesting a younger child, told his parents he'd learned his behavior from the family priest. Riedle claimed he had been sexually abused by Rev. Thomas Adamson while serving as an altar boy at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church of St. Paul Park. The Riedles informed their bishop of their son's allegations. Finding the bishop's response inadequate, the Riedles approached Anderson. Anderson launched a lawsuit against the Catholic Church after conducting an investigation that convinced him there had been a cover-up \"all the way to the archbishop.\" In 1984, after church officials denied in depositions that they knew about the priest's history of sexual abuse, the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul reportedly offered over $1 million to settle the case out of public view. Anderson, who was troubled by the church's insistence on confidentiality, talked Riedle out of the offer, instead filing suit and calling the press.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.superlawyers.com/minnesota/article/the-crusader/be1c58bb-484c-4059-a283-51176e3cc307.html|title=Jeff Anderson on law school, legal tactics and his ultimate goal\u2014deposing Pope Benedict XVI|last=DeSmith|first=Christy|date=July 6, 2011|website=SuperLawyers|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAnderson's firm represented 14 more alleged victims of sexual abuse soon after Riedle's case went public. Most of those cases were eventually settled out of court. Anderson made national headlines,\u00a0however, when the jury in a trial against the Diocese of Winona found for the plaintiff and set punitive damages at $2.7 million and compensatory damages at $883,000.\n\nThroughout the '80s and '90s, Anderson filed over 200 suits against religious organizations, a majority of them sex-abuse complaints against the Catholic Church. The most notorious of these cases involved James Porter, an alleged repeat offender across multiple states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Legal Strategies (Objectives) ==\nAnderson\u2019s settlements tend toward the creative, routinely exposing abusers to the media. In a settlement with Saint John\u2019s Abbey in Collegeville, Minnesota, Anderson stipulated the names of 17 monks with \u201ccredible allegations of sexual abuse,\u201d be released in addition to an undisclosed dollar amount on behalf of nine plaintiffs.<ref name=\":2\" /> A decade after he started representing victims of childhood sexual abuse, it was widely reported in the media that an increasing number of victims were bringing suit based on \"recovered memories\" dredged up during therapy, under hypnosis or with the encouragement of a sympathetic listener. Anderson says only a \"very small percentage\" of cases were actually brought based on recovered memories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout his career, Anderson has taken on cases in Australia, Brussels, Belgium and Mexico (Mexican immigration officials expelled Anderson in 2006).

They suppress sexuality. Sexuality can't be suppressed. It creeps out. And those most accessible when it does are boys, nuns, and housekeepers--in that order. It's a matter of opportunity and access.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== In the Media & Published Works ==\nAnderson has been featured in several books including ''Mortal Sins'' by [[Michael D'Antonio|Michael D\u2019Antonio]] and ''Our Fathers'' by [[David France]].

Anderson is married to Julie Aronson Anderson.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Education ==\nAfter graduating magna cum laude from the University of Minnesota, Anderson obtained his Juris Doctor from William Mitchell College of Law (now [[Mitchell Hamline School of Law]]) in 1975.\u00a0 He is licensed to practice law in Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, Colorado, New York, Pennsylvania, before the U.S. Supreme Court, and in several U.S. District Courts and U.S. Courts of Appeals.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://profiles.superlawyers.com/minnesota/st-paul/lawyer/jeffrey-r-anderson/5cde79a0-d141-48cf-a3b6-ada807390b48.html|title=Top Rated St. Paul, MN Personal Injury Attorney {{!}} Jeffrey Anderson|website=Super Lawyers|language=en|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\n== Early Career ==\nIn 1983, Anderson was brought on as a defense attorney by the family of Greg Riedle. Riedle, who was a minor convicted of molesting a younger child, told his parents he'd learned his behavior from the family priest. Reidle claimed he had been sexually abused by Rev. Thomas Adamson while serving as an altar boy at St. Thomas Aquinas Catholic Church of St. Paul Park. The Riedles informed their bishop of their son's allegations. Finding the bishop's response inadequate, the Riedles approached Anderson. Anderson launched a lawsuit against the Catholic Church after conducting an investigation that convinced him there had been a cover-up \"all the way to the archbishop.\" In 1984, after church officials denied in depositions that they knew about the priest's history of sexual abuse, the Archdiocese of Minneapolis and St. Paul reportedly offered over $1 million to settle the case out of public view. Anderson, who was troubled by the church's insistence on confidentiality, talked Riedle out of the offer, instead filing suit and calling the press.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.superlawyers.com/minnesota/article/the-crusader/be1c58bb-484c-4059-a283-51176e3cc307.html|title=Jeff Anderson on law school, legal tactics and his ultimate goal\u2014deposing Pope Benedict XVI|last=DeSmith|first=Christy|date=July 6, 2011|website=SuperLawyers|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAnderson's firm represented 14 more alleged victims of sexual abuse soon after Riedle's case went public. Most of those cases were eventually settled out of court. Anderson made national headlines,\u00a0however, when the jury in a trial against the Archdiocese of Winona found for the plaintiff and set punitive damages at $2.7 million and compensatory damages at $883,000.\n\nThroughout the '80s and '90s, Anderson filed over 200 suits against religious organizations, a majority of them sex-abuse complaints against the Catholic Church. The most notorious of these cases involved James Porter, an alleged repeat offender across multiple states.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Legal Strategies (Objectives) ==\nAnderson\u2019s settlements tend toward the creative, routinely exposing abusers to the media. In a settlement with Saint John\u2019s Abbey in Collegeville, Anderson stipulated the names of 17 monks with \u201ccredible allegations of sexual abuse,\u201d be released in addition to an undisclosed dollar amount on behalf of nine plaintiffs.<ref name=\":2\" /> A decade after he started representing victims of childhood sexual abuse, it was widely reported in the media that an increasing number of victims were bringing suit based on \"recovered memories\" dredged up during therapy, under hypnosis or with the encouragement of a sympathetic listener. Anderson says only a \"very small percentage\" of cases were actually brought based on recovered memories.<ref name=\":0\" /> Throughout his career, Anderson has taken on cases in Australia, Brussels, Belgium and Mexico (Mexican immigration officials expelled Anderson in 2006). His lawfirm, Anderson & Associates, recently opened an office in London and hired a barrister in Ireland.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Philosophical Views ==\nThe agnostic attorney is quoted as finding his work fulfilling\u2014\"it nourishes my spirit.\u201d<ref name=\":2\" /> In a 2010 interview with the ''New York Times''<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite news|last=Davey|first=Monica|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/28/us/28lawyer.html|title=A Frenzied Pace for Lawyer Behind Vatican Suits|date=2010-04-27|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-01|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>, Anderson said he considers what he does as part of \"the child civil rights movement.\" He has also taken aim against the Catholic Church's framework on gender and sexuality, stating: \"Within that culture, they say that men are superior and priests are celibate. They suppress sexuality. Sexuality can't be suppressed. It creeps out. And those most accessible when it does are boys, nuns, and housekeepers--in that order. It's a matter of opportunity and access.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== In the Media & Published Works ==\nAnderson has been featured in several books including ''Mortal Sins'' by [[Michael D'Antonio|Michael D\u2019Antonio]] and ''Our Fathers'' by [[David France]]. He has also made appearances in the documentary ''[[Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God|Mea Maxima Culpa]]'' and the [[Frontline (American TV program)|PBS Frontline]] documentary ''Hand of God.''\n\n== Honors, Decorations, Awards and Distinctions\u00a0 \u00a0 ==\nThroughout his career, Anderson has been recognized for his commitment to victims of childhood sexual abuse. Awards include:\n\n* The Frank Carrington Champion of Civil Justice Award, \n\n* The Warren E. Burger Distinguished Alumni Award, \n\n* The American Association for Justice's (American Association for Justice) Steven J. Sharp Public Service Award. \n\nIn addition, Anderson has been named one of the Top 100 Trial Lawyers in America, and was voted \"Attorney of the Year\" by Minnesota Lawyer magazine in 2003.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n== Criticism\u00a0 \u00a0 ==\nCritics have called Anderson a headline chaser and a self-promoter. He has been accused of baiting the media with the heartbreaking stories of his clients. Some in the legal community refer to his role as co-counsel in so many abuse cases around the country as \"the Jeff Anderson franchise system.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> ''\"''Rather than settle out of court and seal the record, Jeff has learned the church is impervious to all but the most intense pressure,\" writes [[Anson D. Shupe]], a sociologist at Indiana University-Purdue University, who wrote the book ''Rogue Clerics: The Social Problem of Clergy Deviance''. In 2002, ''the Washington Post'' wrote that Anderson himself estimated that total recoveries amounted to $60 million.<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n== References ==\n<!-- Inline citations added to your article will automatically display here.
