While most novels by Edith Wharton dealt with New York's upper-class society, this is one of two novels by Wharton that were set in [[New England]].  Its themes include social class, the role of women in society, destructive relationships, sexual awakening and the desire of its protagonist, named Charity Royall. The novel was rather controversial for its time and is one of the less famous among her novels because of its subject matter.<span class=\"Z3988\" title=\"ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Abook&rft.genre=book&rft.btitle=Summer&rft.author=%5B%5BEdith+Wharton%5D%5D&rft.date=1917&rft.pub=%5B%5BCharles+Scribner%27s+Sons%5D%5D&rft.pages=194\"></span>\n\n== Plot summary ==\nAt the start of the novel, young Charity Royall is bored with her life in the small town of North Dormer. She was born to poor parents from \"up the Mountain\" who gave her up to the town's learned person, Lawyer Royall, but she still dreams of an even better and more exciting life outside of the town. She secures a job at North Dormer's library in an attempt to save up money so she can eventually leave the town and Mr. Royall's care. The widowed Mr. Royall makes an inappropriate advance toward Charity one night that she rebuffs but it irrevocably sours their relationship\n\nWhen she is 17, that exciting life finds her in the form of a visiting architect named Lucius Harney. Her first encounter with the charming young man is at the library and there is immediate chemistry between them.  Soon, he finds himself boarding at Mr. Royall's house when his own living arrangements fall through.\n\nCharity Royall finds herself attracted to Lucius and decides to become his companion as he explores the town.  He is putting together a book on colonial houses and the two of them go around town together so he can inspect and sketch the houses as a part of his research for the book. Mr. Royall, who holds onto the idea of marrying Charity, notices the two of them growing close and immediately evicts Lucius from his house. Lucius leaves town and relocates to a nearby village.\n\nLater on, Charity and Lucius visit Nettleton for the Fourth of July, where they kiss for the first time and Lucius gives Charity a brooch. Before they are finished with their outing, they run into Mr. Royall, who seems really drunk. Mr. Royall verbally attacks Charity, which causes her to feel intense shame and hence falls into Lucius's arms. After the day's events, Charity and Lucius grow even closer and have sex for the first time.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Edith Wharton.

Charity develops fear when she sees Lucius with Annabel Balch, a local society girl, at a social event. Lucius promises to meet Charity at their usual place but when she goes there, she meets Mr. Royall who confronts her. Lucius promises to marry Charity but excuses himself to move out of town for a while. Later, a person comes to tell Charity that Lucius went out of town with Annabel Balch, a local society girl.

A doctor confirms that she is pregnant. Charity does not have any money to pay for the check-up and therefore, she gives the doctor the brooch Lucius gave her as collateral.

From the experience she has in the Mountain, she vows she will do everything to ensure that her child does not grow in poverty. She therefore returns home, intending to become a prostitute to support her child. However, along the way, she meets again with Mr. Royall. Mr. Royall offers her a ride and they decide to marry.  In the end, she writes a letter to Lucius telling him about her marriage and finally returns home to stay with her husband in North Dormer.\n\n== Major characters ==\n* '''Charity Royall''': She is the major character in the story.

After this, his heavy drinking helps to tear down the wall securing his growing lust and desire for sexual satisfaction. He keeps his distance away from Charity, hires workers to be in the house and assists her to achieve her desire for independence; however, he is very much pained by these experiences. When Charity's lover abandons her while she is pregnant, her guardian comes in to rescue the situation by marrying her.\n* '''Lucius Harney''': Lucius is a young New York architect who enters the life of Charity and entices with the promise of being everything to her life. On the other hand, Charity strongly feels attracted to Lucius and envious of him too. Lucius is hence more than just her summer lover.

Given the initial charter of CIS to support the local defence requirements, the main defence customer of ST Kinetics remains as the [[Singapore Armed Forces]] (SAF).\n\nBesides manufacturing [[small arms]] and [[munitions]], some of STELS' key military products include the [[SAR 21]] assault rifle, the [[Bionix AFV]], the [[Bronco All Terrain Tracked Carrier]] and the [[Terrex ICV|Terrex APC]].

Several other companies were formed under CIS over the span of the next 2 decades, with the expansion of the defence business, such as Unicorn International (UI) in 1971, Ordnance & Development Engineering (ODE) in 1973, Singapore Test Services (STS) in 1980 and Chartered Chemicals (CCI) in 1982.\n\nShortly after the formation of CIS, the Defence Minister, Dr [[Goh Keng Swee]], went on to set up several other government-linked defence industries to provide indigenous support for the SAF. One of them was Singapore Automotive Engineering (SAE).

The CIS engineers learnt from the lesson of the unsuccessful American \"Dover Devil GPHMG\" programme, to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. They succeeded and in 1988, CIS introduced the new machine gun and simply named it as the \"CIS 50MG\". The SAF used the 50MG in its infantry regiments and as a mounted weapon on armoured vehicles and naval craft. The STK 50MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon. It has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a carrying handle. The gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed on either side of the barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The STK 50MG utilizes the same \"constant recoil\" system used in the Ultimax 100. A unique feature of the 50MG is its dual belt-feed system that allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball to armor-piercing [[Saboted light armor penetrator|Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP)]]. Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons.<ref name=\"JGRG2008-3\">Richard J (2008), page 398.</ref><ref name=\"JIDR1989-10\">Andrew C (October 1989).</ref><ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[ST Engineering]]|access-date=12 April 2012|title=50MG Product Brochure|url=http://www.stengg.com/upload/1875jm6dmc40oAKikM8.pdf||url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219082615/http://www.stengg.com/upload/1875jm6dmc40oAKikM8.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===120 mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS)===\nThe 120SRAMS is developed specifically for rapid and close range requirements of the battlefield.

Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It is designed to be air-portable by [[C-130]]s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent [[double wishbone suspension]], which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external [[V-hull]] that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]]. Two water jets mounted on either side at the back of the hull propel the vehicle through water at 10&nbsp;km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. [[Brigade combat team|Interim Brigade Combat Team]] (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging [[Cadillac Gage Commando|V-200]] armoured vehicles.

Several other companies were formed under CIS over the span of the next 2 decades, with the expansion of the defence business, such as Unicorn International (UI) in 1971, Ordnance & Development Engineering (ODE) in 1973, Singapore Test Services (STS) in 1980 and Chartered Chemicals (CCI) in 1982.\n\nShortly after the formation of CIS, the Defence Minister, Dr [[Goh Keng Swee]], went on to set up several other government-linked defence industries to provide indigenous support for the SAF. One of them was Singapore Automotive Engineering (SAE).

The CIS engineers learnt from the lesson of the unsuccessful American \"Dover Devil GPHMG\" programme, to create a modular weapon suited for modern tactical doctrines and production techniques. They succeeded and in 1988, CIS introduced the new machine gun and simply named it as the \"CIS 50MG\". The SAF used the 50MG in its infantry regiments and as a mounted weapon on armoured vehicles and naval craft. The STK 50MG is a gas-operated, air-cooled, belt-fed weapon. It has a quick-detachable barrel equipped with a carrying handle. The gun is operated using dual gas pistons, located in two gas tubes placed on either side of the barrel. The barrel is locked by means of a rotary bolt with multiple radial lugs that engages the barrel extension, eliminating the need for headspace adjustments. The STK 50MG utilizes the same \"constant recoil\" system used in the Ultimax 100. A unique feature of the 50MG is its dual belt-feed system that allows for fast and easy switching of ammunition from standard ball to armor-piercing [[Saboted light armor penetrator|Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP)]]. Such systems are more commonly used in modern automatic cannons.<ref name=\"JGRG2008-3\">Richard J (2008), page 398.</ref><ref name=\"JIDR1989-10\">Andrew C (October 1989).</ref><ref>{{Cite web|publisher=[[ST Engineering]]|access-date=12 April 2012|title=50MG Product Brochure|url=http://www.stengg.com/upload/1875jm6dmc40oAKikM8.pdf||url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219082615/http://www.stengg.com/upload/1875jm6dmc40oAKikM8.pdf|archive-date=19 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n===120 mm Super Rapid Advanced Mortar System (SRAMS)===\nThe 120SRAMS is developed specifically for rapid and close range requirements of the battlefield.

Multiple weapon platforms are supported, including both the remote and overhead weapons stations. The Terrex's modular design allows for different level of armour protection and weapon systems. It is designed to be air-portable by [[C-130]]s or equivalent cargo aircraft. The Terrex uses a patented independent [[double wishbone suspension]], which greatly improves ground mobility and comfort during rides over rough terrains. The use of automatic traction control and the capacity for large footprint off-road tyres enables the Terrex to reach high speed on soft ground. The vehicle has a double hull with an external [[V-hull]] that improves mine blast survivability. Add-on armour provides further protection for troops. It is also capable of providing full chemical, biological and nuclear protection in extreme operational conditions. The baseline configuration is fully [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious]]. Two water jets mounted on either side at the back of the hull propel the vehicle through water at 10&nbsp;km/h. Initially developed for export sales from the number of emerging wheeled armoured vehicle requirements including U.S. [[Brigade combat team|Interim Brigade Combat Team]] (IBCT) concept, which calls for the need of wheeled armoured fighting vehicles (AFV) as opposed to tracked AFVs. In 2006, the SAF decided to purchase 135 units to replace their aging [[Cadillac Gage Commando|V-200]] armoured vehicles.

Their 54\u201328 record matched a franchise record, and their 27\u201314 start was also a franchise record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had gotten 50 wins in back-to-back seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and gaining the number two seed in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team had ever been seeded for the playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the [[2007\u201308 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]] in 5 games, which included a record-equaling 58-point margin-of-victory. Billups also set a Nuggets franchise record with the most 3 pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 3-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series. In his first year with the Nuggets, Billups led them back to the [[NBA Conference Finals]] for the first time since 1985. They would play the Lakers for the second straight year (the Lakers had swept them in the first round the year before). The Nuggets would ultimately lose the series 4-2. This was Billups' 7th straight conference finals. He joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Cooper]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and [[Kurt Rambis]] as the only players to accomplish this feat since the [[Boston Celtics]] of the 1950s and 1960s led by [[Bill Russell]].

Their 54\u201328 record matched a franchise record, and their 27\u201314 start was also a franchise record for wins in the first half of a season. This also marked the first time in the franchise's history the team had gotten 50 wins in back-to-back seasons. They led the Northwest division for much of the season, eventually winning the division and gaining the number two seed in the Western Conference, matching the highest the team had ever been seeded for the playoffs. In the first round, they defeated the [[2007\u201308 New Orleans Hornets season|New Orleans Hornets]] in 5 games, which included a record-equaling 58-point margin-of-victory. Billups also set a Nuggets franchise record with the most 3 pointers in a playoff game with 8, and his 19 3-pointers in total is also a Nuggets record for threes made in a playoff series. In his first year with the Nuggets, Billups led them back to the [[NBA Conference Finals]] for the first time since 1985. They would play the Lakers for the second straight year (the Lakers had swept them in the first round the year before). The Nuggets would ultimately lose the series 4-2. This was Billups' 7th straight conference finals. He joined [[Magic Johnson]], [[Michael Cooper]], [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]], and [[Kurt Rambis]] as the only players to accomplish this feat since the [[Boston Celtics]] of the 1950s and 1960s led by [[Bill Russell]].

The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $419 million worldwide, currently making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Unable to kill his father, Armando steps back, and Isabel, while aiming for Mike, inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel several times, sending Isabel falling into the flames below. Marcus then begins to fall into the flames, but is saved by both Mike and Armando. Carrying Armando outside, Mike tells his son that things will not be so good for him due to the crimes he committed, but that he would always be there for him.\n\nReturning to Miami, Rita has been promoted to police captain, and the team celebrates her promotion. Mike arranges for Marcus and Theresa to go on a retreat while he takes care of their grandchild. Sometime later, Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, and Armando tells Mike that he is atoning for his sins. Mike then enlists his help for a mission, informing him that it would be a chance to pay back some of his debt, and Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael

and [[Joe Carnahan]]. The sequel to ''[[Bad Boys II]]'' (2003), it is the third installment in the [[Bad Boys (franchise)|''Bad Boys'' franchise]] and is based on a story by Craig and Carnahan. The film stars [[Will Smith]], [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Alexander Ludwig]], [[Charles Melton (actor)|Charles Melton]], [[Paola N\u00fa\u00f1ez]], [[Kate del Castillo]], [[Nicky Jam]], and [[Joe Pantoliano]]. Smith co-produced the film with [[Jerry Bruckheimer]] and [[Doug Belgrad]]. In ''Bad Boys for Life'', [[Miami]] detectives Mike Lowrey and Marcus Burnett investigate a string of murders tied to Lowrey's troubled past.\n\nA third ''Bad Boys'' film was discussed after the success of the second, with [[Michael Bay]] stating he would be interested in returning to direct, but budgetary constraints made going ahead difficult. The film went through several attempts to enter production over the course of a decade, with a variety of writers and directors attached. The project was eventually finalized and green-lit in October 2018, and filming began the following year, lasting from January to June 2019. [[Principal photography]] took place in [[Atlanta]], [[Miami]] and [[Mexico City]].\n\n''Bad Boys for Life'' was theatrically released in the United States on January 17, 2020, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]], through [[Columbia Pictures]]. The film received mostly positive reviews from critics,<ref name=\"obenson\" /> and has grossed $419 million worldwide, currently making it the [[2020 in film|highest-grossing film of 2020]]. It is also the highest-grossing installment of the series and the biggest January release of all time.\n\n==Plot==\nIsabel Aretas, widow of cartel kingpin Benito, escapes from a Mexican prison with the aid of her son Armando. Isabel sends Armando to Miami, tasking him with recovering a substantial stash of money his father Benito had hidden, as well as assassinating the people responsible for his father's arrest and eventual death in prison. Isabel demands that Armando kill Miami detective Mike Lowrey last.\n\nIn Miami, Mike accompanies his partner Marcus Burnett to the birth of his first grandson. Desiring to spend more time with his family, the aging Marcus tells Mike he intends to retire, to Mike's chagrin. During a party celebrating Marcus' grandson, Mike is shot by Armando and left in a coma for months. Chastised by Isabel for targeting Mike first, Armando continues to assassinate other targets on his list during Mike's convalescence.\n\nFollowing Mike's recovery, he is determined to seek revenge and unsuccessfully attempts to recruit the now-retired Marcus, causing a fall out between them. Mike violently obtains the identity of arms dealer Booker Grassie from an informant. Realizing that Mike will not heed orders to stay away from the investigation, Captain Howard reluctantly allows him to work with the tech-driven team in charge, the Advanced Miami Metro Operations (AMMO), led by Mike's ex-girlfriend Rita. While the team surveils Grassie at an arms deal, Mike determines that the buyers intend to kill Grassie and intervenes, but fails to save him. Later, Marcus is called by Carver Remy, an old informant who believes the assassin is after him. Marcus contacts Mike and the pair travel to Carver, but are too late to save him. Armando escapes after a fistfight with Mike.\n\nCaptain Howard later reveals his intentions to retire as well, offering advice to Mike that he needs to find a path forward in life. He is abruptly assassinated by Armando moments later. The captain's death pulls Marcus out of retirement, but he intends to work as a team with AMMO. They track down Grassie's accountant, who leads them to Lorenzo \"Zway-Lo\" Rodriguez. They infiltrate Zway-Lo's birthday party leading to a destructive car chase. Armando arrives in a helicopter to rescue Zway-Lo but kills him when he blocks Armando's ability to shoot the pursuing Mike. As he lines up a shot, Armando tells Mike \"Hasta el fuego\". Gunfire from Marcus creates cover for Mike, who falls into the river below.\n\nAMMO is shut down because of the failed operation. In private, Mike reveals to Marcus that Armando may be his son. Before partnering with Marcus, Mike worked as an undercover officer in the Aretas cartel where he met Isabel. They fell in love and intended to run away together, using \"Hasta el fuego\" as a secret catchphrase. Mike ultimately remained loyal to the police, realizing how dangerous Isabel had become. Despite Mike's opposition, Marcus and AMMO join him in Mexico City to confront her.\n\nAt the Hidalgo Palace, Mike meets Isabel and scolds her for concealing the truth from him. A shootout quickly ensues between AMMO and Isabel's men. Marcus shoots the pilot of Isabel's support helicopter, causing it to crash into the central lobby and starting a fire. Marcus confronts Isabel, while Mike tries to explain the truth to Armando. Armando begins to beat up Mike, but he refuses to retaliate. Demanding the truth from his mother, Isabel confirms to Armando that Mike is his father. Unable to kill his father, Armando steps back, and Isabel, while aiming for Mike, inadvertently shoots Armando in the chest. Enraged, she attempts to finish Mike, but Rita intervenes and shoots Isabel several times, sending Isabel falling into the flames below. Marcus then begins to fall into the flames, but is saved by both Mike and Armando. Carrying Armando outside, Mike tells his son that things will not be so good for him due to the crimes he committed, but that he would always be there for him.\n\nReturning to Miami, Rita has been promoted to police captain, and the team celebrates her promotion. Mike arranges for Marcus and Theresa to go on a retreat while he takes care of their grandchild. Sometime later, Mike visits a remorseful Armando in prison, and Armando tells Mike that he is atoning for his sins. Mike then enlists his help for a mission, informing him that it would be a chance to pay back some of his debt, and Armando accepts.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Will Smith]] as Detective Lieutenant Michael
