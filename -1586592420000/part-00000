It began with a small guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' (\"Hall Security\") made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, [[Heinrich Himmler]] joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929\u20131945) it grew from a small paramilitary formation during the [[Weimar Republic]] to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.\n\nThe two main constituent groups were the ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' (General SS) and [[Waffen-SS]] (Armed SS). The ''Allgemeine SS'' was responsible for enforcing the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV), ran the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the [[Gestapo]] and the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to [[Nazi ideology]], and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.\n\nThe SS was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of [[Holocaust victims|an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims]] during [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Members of all of its branches committed [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] during World War II (1939\u201345). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the [[International Military Tribunal]] at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Forerunner of the SS===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[NSDAP]] supporters and stormtroopers in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], 1923]]\n\nBy 1923, the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) led by [[Adolf Hitler]] had created a small volunteer guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' (Hall Security) to provide security at their meetings in [[Munich]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}}{{sfn|Michael|Doerr|2002|p=356}} The same year, Hitler ordered the formation of a small bodyguard unit dedicated to his personal service. He wished it to be separate from the \"suspect mass\" of the party, including the paramilitary ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA), which he did not trust.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} The new formation was designated the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard).{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14}} Originally the unit was composed of eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]], and was modeled after the [[Erhardt Naval Brigade]], a ''[[Freikorps]]'' of the time. The unit was renamed [[Sto\u00dftrupp-Hitler|''Sto\u00dftrupp'']] (Shock Troops) in May 1923.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nThe ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' was abolished after the failed 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by the NSDAP to seize power in Munich.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=10}} In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (Protection Command).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=26}} It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the ''Schutzkommando'' was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the ''Sturmstaffel'' (Storm Squadron), and finally the ''Schutzstaffel'' (Protection Squad; SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26\u201329}} Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch).{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=34}} The new SS protected NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}}\n\n===Early commanders===\nSchreck, a founding member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=604}} On 15 April 1926, [[Joseph Berchtold]] succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' (Reich Leader-SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=30}} Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}} This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, [[Erhard Heiden]], on 1 March 1927.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=12}} Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}}\n\nBetween 1925 and 1929, the SS was considered to be a small ''Gruppe'' (battalion) of the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201346}} Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=32\u201333}} As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, [[Heinrich Himmler]] became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201346}} The SS established [[List of Gauleiters|a number]] of [[Gau (territory)|''Gau'']]s (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of ''SS-Gau Berlin'', ''SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg'', ''SS-Gau Franken'', ''SS-Gau Niederbayern'', ''SS-Gau Rheinland-S\u00fcd'', and ''SS-Gau Sachsen''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===Himmler appointed===\n[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-054-53A, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Himmler]] (with glasses, to the left of [[Adolf Hitler]]) was an early supporter of the NSDAP.]]\nWith Hitler's approval, Himmler assumed the position of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' in January 1929.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}} There are differing accounts of the reason for Heiden's dismissal from his position as head of the SS. The party announced that it was for \"family reasons.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=113}} Under Himmler, the SS expanded and gained a larger foothold. He considered the SS an elite, ideologically driven National Socialist organization, a \"conflation of [[Teutonic knights]], the [[Jesuits]], and [[Japanese Samurai]]\".{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272\u2013273}} His ultimate aim was to turn the SS into the most powerful organization in Germany and most influential branch of the party.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201347, 300\u2013305}} He expanded the SS to 3,000 members in his first year as its leader.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nIn 1929, the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]'' (main SS office) was expanded and reorganized into five main offices dealing with general administration, personnel, finance, security, and race matters. At the same time, the SS-Gaue were expanded into three ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereiche'' areas, namely the ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich Ost'', ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich West'', and ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich S\u00fcd''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=2\u20133}} The lower levels of the SS remained largely unchanged. Although officially still considered a sub-organization of the SA and answerable to the ''[[Stabschef]]'' (SA Chief of Staff), it was also during this time that Himmler began to establish the independence of the SS from the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308\u2013314}} The SS grew in size and power due to its exclusive loyalty to Hitler, as opposed to the SA, which was seen as semi-independent and a threat to Hitler's hegemony over the party, mainly because they demanded a \"second revolution\" beyond the one that brought the NSDAP to power.{{sfn|Baranowski|2010|pp=196\u2013197}} By the end of 1933, the membership of the SS reached 209,000.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=901}} Under Himmler's leadership, the SS continued to gather greater power as more and more state and party functions were assigned to its jurisdiction. Over time the SS became answerable only to Hitler, a development typical of the organizational structure of the entire Nazi regime, where legal norms were replaced by actions undertaken under the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' (leader principle), where Hitler's will was considered to be above the law.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=903}}\n\nIn the latter half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the creation of ''[[SS-Junkerschule]]'', institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=606}} The first schools were established at [[Bad T\u00f6lz]] and [[Braunschweig]], with additional schools opening at [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Prague]] during the war.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=112}}\n\n===Ideology===\n{{Main|Ideology of the SS}}\nThe SS was regarded as the NSDAP's elite unit.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=146, 147}} In keeping with the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], in the early days all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan ancestry]] back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2002|p=116}} Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the [[Nuremberg Laws]].{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Other requirements were complete obedience to the F\u00fchrer and a commitment to the German people and nation.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=62\u201367}} Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=63\u201365}} Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Gruft der Wewelsburg (10573265394).jpg|thumb|The crypt at [[Wewelsburg]] was repurposed by Himmler as a place to memorialize dead SS members.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=115}} Artwork commemorating the Holocaust hangs on the walls. ]]\n\nCommitment to SS ideology was emphasized throughout the recruitment, membership process, and training.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=148\u2013149}} Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and were taught that it was necessary to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=65\u201366}} [[Esoteric]] rituals and the awarding of regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a [[Christmas in Nazi Germany|solstice celebration]].{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=93}} Church weddings were replaced with SS ''Ehewein'', a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=94}} These pseudo-religious rites and ceremonies often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=608}} In 1933, Himmler bought [[Wewelsburg]], a castle in [[Westphalia]]. He initially intended it to be used as an SS training center, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=111\u2013113}}\n\nThe SS ideology included the application of brutality and terror as a solution to military and political problems.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=21}} The SS stressed total loyalty and obedience to orders unto death. Hitler used this as a powerful tool to further his aims and those of the NSDAP. The SS was entrusted with the commission of atrocities, illegal activities, and war crimes. Himmler once wrote that an SS man \"hesitates not for a single instant, but executes unquestioningly&nbsp;...\" any ''F\u00fchrer-Befehl'' (F\u00fchrer order).{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=134}} Their official motto was ''\"[[Meine Ehre hei\u00dft Treue]]\"'' (My Honour is Loyalty).{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nAs part of its race-centric functions during World War II, the SS oversaw the isolation and displacement of [[Jews]] from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing their assets and deporting them to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[Ghettos#Jewish ghettos|ghettos]], where they were used as [[slave labor]] or immediately killed.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Chosen to implement the [[Final Solution]] ordered by Hitler, the SS were the main group responsible for the institutional killing and [[democide]] of more than 20 million people during [[the Holocaust]], including approximately 5.2 million{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} to 6 million{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Jews and 10.5 million [[Slavs]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic groups such as the 258,000 [[Romani people|Romani]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} The SS was involved in killing people viewed as threats to [[Nazi eugenics|race hygiene]] or Nazi ideology, including the mentally or physically handicapped, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the NSDAP government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Communism|Communists]], and [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] members.{{sfn|Rummel|1992|p=12}} According to the judgments rendered at the [[Nuremberg trials]], as well as many [[war crime]]s investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organization which carried out the Holocaust.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}\n\n==Pre-war Germany==\nAfter Hitler and the NSDAP came to power on 30 January 1933, the SS were considered a state organization and a branch of the government.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became [[de facto]] government agencies.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}}\n\n[[File: HimmlerAndHeydrich 1938.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]] (right) was Himmler's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a leading SS figure until his assassination in 1942.]]\n\nThe SS established a [[police state]] within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=66\u201371}} In his role as [[Minister President of Prussia]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] had in 1933 created a Prussian [[secret police]] force, the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' or [[Gestapo]], and appointed [[Rudolf Diels]] as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, G\u00f6ring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Reinhard Heydrich]] chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD; security service).{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}}\n\nThe Gestapo's transfer to Himmler was a prelude to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], in which most of the SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=13\u201314}} The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' now became his actual rank&nbsp;\u2013 and the highest rank in the SS, equivalent to the rank of [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] in the army (his previous rank was ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'').{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=313, 316}} As Himmler's position and authority grew, so in effect did his rank.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17, 26\u201327, 30, 46\u201347}}\n\nOn 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united under the purview of Himmler and the SS.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}} Himmler and Heydrich thus became two of the most powerful men in the country's administration.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=90}} Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo; regular uniformed police).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=814\u2013815}} In his capacity as police chief, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]]. In practice, since the SS answered only to Hitler, the de facto merger of the SS and the police made the police independent of Frick's control.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}}{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=204}} In September 1939, the security and police agencies, including the ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' (SiPo; security police) and SD (but not the Orpo), were consolidated into the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA), headed by Heydrich.{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=470}} This further increased the collective authority of the SS.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=70\u201371}}\n\nIn September 1939, the authority of the SS expanded further when the senior SS officer in each military district also became its chief of police.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|p=61}} Most of these [[SS and police leader]]s held the rank of SS-''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]'' or above, and answered directly to Himmler in all SS matters within their district. Their role was to police the population and oversee the activities of the SS men within their district.{{sfn|Koehl|2004|pp=144, 148, 169, 176\u2013177}} By declaring an emergency, they could bypass the district administrative offices for the SS, SD, SiPo, ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV; concentration camp guards), and Orpo, thereby gaining direct operational control of these groups.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=165}}\n\nDuring ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' (9\u201310 November 1938), SS security services clandestinely coordinated violence against Jews as the SS, Gestapo, SD, Kripo, SiPo, and regular police did what they could to ensure that while Jewish synagogues and community centers were destroyed, Jewish-owned businesses and housing remained intact so that they could later be seized.{{sfn|Read|2005|pp=512\u2013514}} In the end, thousands of Jewish businesses, homes, and graveyards were vandalized and looted, particularly by members of the SA. Some 500 to 1,000 synagogues were destroyed, mostly by arson.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=584}} On 11 November, Heydrich reported a death toll of 36 people, but later assessments put the number of deaths at up to two thousand.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=515}}{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=590}} On Hitler's orders, around 30,000 Jewish men were arrested and sent to concentration camps by 16 November.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=591}} As many as 2,500 of these people died in the following months.{{sfn|Read|2005|p=515}} It was at this point that the SS state began in earnest its campaign of terror against political and religious opponents, who they imprisoned without trial or judicial oversight for the sake of \"security, re-education, or prevention\".{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=61\u201362}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=85}}\n\n===Hitler's personal bodyguards===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's bodyguard}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H15390, Berlin, Kaserne der LSSAH, Vergatterung.jpg|thumb|Troop inspection in Berlin of ''[[Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler]]'', 1938]]\n\nAs the SS grew in size and importance, so too did Hitler's personal protection forces.{{sfn|Spielvogel|1992|pp=102\u2013108}} Three main SS groups were assigned to protect Hitler.

The LSSAH guarded Hitler's private residences and offices, providing an outer ring of protection for the F\u00fchrer and his visitors.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=9, 12, 17\u201319}} LSSAH men manned sentry posts at the entrances to the old [[Reich Chancellery]] and the new Reich Chancellery.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=157, 160, 165}} The number of LSSAH guards was increased during special events.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|p=166}} At the [[Berghof (residence)|Berghof]], Hitler's residence in the [[Obersalzberg]], a large contingent of the LSSAH patrolled an extensive cordoned security zone.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=181\u2013186}}\n\nFrom 1941, forward, the ''Leibstandarte'' became four distinct entities, the Waffen-SS division (unconnected to Hitler's protection but a formation of the Waffen-SS), the Berlin Chancellory Guard, the SS security regiment assigned to the Obersalzberg, and a Munich-based bodyguard unit which protected Hitler when he visited his apartment and the [[Brown House, Munich|Brown House]] NSDAP headquarters in Munich.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17\u201319}}{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=157, 160, 165, 166, 181\u2013186}} Although the unit was nominally under Himmler, Dietrich was the real commander and handled day-to-day administration.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=19, 33}}\n\nTwo other SS units composed the inner ring of Hitler's protection. The ''[[SS-Begleitkommando des F\u00fchrers]]'' (Escort Command of the F\u00fchrer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort while he was traveling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=32, 48, 57}} Later the ''SS-Begleitkommando'' was expanded and became known as the ''F\u00fchrerbegleitkommando'' (F\u00fchrer Escort Command; FBK).

Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles.{{sfn|Felton|2014|pp=32\u201333}} By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS.{{sfn|Hoffmann|2000|pp=36, 48}} The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on the lower left sleeve.{{sfn|Felton|2014|p=18}}\n\n===Concentration camps founded===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H26996, KZ Dachau, Verbrennungsofen.jpg|thumb|Crematorium at [[Dachau concentration camp]], May 1945]]\nThe SS was closely associated with Nazi Germany's concentration camp system.

It began with a small guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' (\"Hall Security\") made up of NSDAP volunteers to provide security for party meetings in Munich. In 1925, [[Heinrich Himmler]] joined the unit, which had by then been reformed and given its final name. Under his direction (1929\u20131945) it grew from a small paramilitary formation during the [[Weimar Republic]] to one of the most powerful organizations in Nazi Germany. From 1929 until the regime's collapse in 1945, the SS was the foremost agency of security, surveillance, and terror within Germany and German-occupied Europe.\n\nThe two main constituent groups were the ''[[Allgemeine SS]]'' (General SS) and [[Waffen-SS]] (Armed SS). The ''Allgemeine SS'' was responsible for enforcing the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]] and general policing, whereas the Waffen-SS consisted of combat units within Nazi Germany's military. A third component of the SS, the ''[[SS-Totenkopfverb\u00e4nde]]'' (SS-TV), ran the [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. Additional subdivisions of the SS included the [[Gestapo]] and the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD) organizations. They were tasked with the detection of actual or potential enemies of the Nazi state, the neutralization of any opposition, policing the German people for their commitment to [[Nazi ideology]], and providing domestic and foreign intelligence.\n\nThe SS was the organization most responsible for the genocidal killing of [[Holocaust victims|an estimated 5.5 to 6 million Jews and millions of other victims]] during [[the Holocaust]].{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Members of all of its branches committed [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]] during World War II (1939\u201345). The SS was also involved in commercial enterprises and exploited concentration camp inmates as slave labor. After Nazi Germany's defeat, the SS and the NSDAP were judged by the [[International Military Tribunal]] at Nuremberg to be criminal organizations. [[Ernst Kaltenbrunner]], the highest-ranking surviving SS main department chief, was found guilty of crimes against humanity at the Nuremberg trials and hanged in 1946.\n\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==Origins==\n\n===Forerunner of the SS===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-1486, Hitler-Putsch, M\u00fcnchen, Marienplatz.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[NSDAP]] supporters and stormtroopers in Munich during the [[Beer Hall Putsch]], 1923]]\n\nBy 1923, the [[Nazi Party]] (NSDAP) led by [[Adolf Hitler]] had created a small volunteer guard unit known as the ''Saal-Schutz'' (Hall Security) to provide security at their meetings in [[Munich]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=228}}{{sfn|Michael|Doerr|2002|p=356}} The same year, Hitler ordered the formation of a small bodyguard unit dedicated to his personal service. He wished it to be separate from the \"suspect mass\" of the party, including the paramilitary ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (\"Storm Battalion\"; SA), which he did not trust.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=14, 16}} The new formation was designated the ''Stabswache'' (Staff Guard).{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14}} Originally the unit was composed of eight men, commanded by [[Julius Schreck]] and [[Joseph Berchtold]], and was modeled after the [[Erhardt Naval Brigade]], a ''[[Freikorps]]'' of the time. The unit was renamed [[Sto\u00dftrupp-Hitler|''Sto\u00dftrupp'']] (Shock Troops) in May 1923.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=16}}\n\nThe ''Sto\u00dftrupp'' was abolished after the failed 1923 [[Beer Hall Putsch]], an attempt by the NSDAP to seize power in Munich.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=10}} In 1925, Hitler ordered Schreck to organize a new bodyguard unit, the ''Schutzkommando'' (Protection Command).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=26}} It was tasked with providing personal protection for Hitler at NSDAP functions and events. That same year, the ''Schutzkommando'' was expanded to a national organization and renamed successively the ''Sturmstaffel'' (Storm Squadron), and finally the ''Schutzstaffel'' (Protection Squad; SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=26\u201329}} Officially, the SS marked its foundation on 9 November 1925 (the second anniversary of the Beer Hall Putsch).{{sfn|Koehl|2004|p=34}} The new SS protected NSDAP leaders throughout Germany. Hitler's personal SS protection unit was later enlarged to include combat units.{{sfn|Cook|Bender|1994|pp=17, 19}}\n\n===Early commanders===\nSchreck, a founding member of the SA and a close confidant of Hitler, became the first SS chief in March 1925.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=604}} On 15 April 1926, [[Joseph Berchtold]] succeeded him as chief of the SS. Berchtold changed the title of the office to ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' (Reich Leader-SS).{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=30}} Berchtold was considered more dynamic than his predecessor, but became increasingly frustrated by the authority the SA had over the SS.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}} This led to him transferring leadership of the SS to his deputy, [[Erhard Heiden]], on 1 March 1927.{{sfn|Hein|2015|p=12}} Under Heiden's leadership, a stricter code of discipline was enforced than would have been tolerated in the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=32}}\n\nBetween 1925 and 1929, the SS was considered to be a small ''Gruppe'' (battalion) of the SA.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201346}} Except in the Munich area, the SS was unable to maintain any momentum in its membership numbers, which declined from 1,000 to 280 as the SA continued its rapid growth.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=32\u201333}} As Heiden attempted to keep the SS from dissolving, [[Heinrich Himmler]] became his deputy in September 1927. Himmler displayed good organizational abilities compared to Heiden.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201346}} The SS established [[List of Gauleiters|a number]] of [[Gau (territory)|''Gau'']]s (regions or provinces). The SS-Gaus consisted of ''SS-Gau Berlin'', ''SS-Gau Berlin Brandenburg'', ''SS-Gau Franken'', ''SS-Gau Niederbayern'', ''SS-Gau Rheinland-S\u00fcd'', and ''SS-Gau Sachsen''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=1\u20132}}\n\n===Himmler appointed===\n[[File: Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1969-054-53A, N\u00fcrnberg, Reichsparteitag.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Himmler]] (with glasses, to the left of [[Adolf Hitler]]) was an early supporter of the NSDAP.]]\nWith Hitler's approval, Himmler assumed the position of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' in January 1929.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=18}}{{sfn|Weale|2010|p=47}} There are differing accounts of the reason for Heiden's dismissal from his position as head of the SS. The party announced that it was for \"family reasons.\"{{sfn|Longerich|2012|p=113}} Under Himmler, the SS expanded and gained a larger foothold. He considered the SS an elite, ideologically driven National Socialist organization, a \"conflation of [[Teutonic knights]], the [[Jesuits]], and [[Japanese Samurai]]\".{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272\u2013273}} His ultimate aim was to turn the SS into the most powerful organization in Germany and most influential branch of the party.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=45\u201347, 300\u2013305}} He expanded the SS to 3,000 members in his first year as its leader.{{sfn|Burleigh|Wippermann|1991|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nIn 1929, the ''[[SS-Hauptamt]]'' (main SS office) was expanded and reorganized into five main offices dealing with general administration, personnel, finance, security, and race matters. At the same time, the SS-Gaue were expanded into three ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereiche'' areas, namely the ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich Ost'', ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich West'', and ''SS-Oberf\u00fchrerbereich S\u00fcd''.{{sfn|Miller|Schulz|2012|pp=2\u20133}} The lower levels of the SS remained largely unchanged. Although officially still considered a sub-organization of the SA and answerable to the ''[[Stabschef]]'' (SA Chief of Staff), it was also during this time that Himmler began to establish the independence of the SS from the SA.{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=308\u2013314}} The SS grew in size and power due to its exclusive loyalty to Hitler, as opposed to the SA, which was seen as semi-independent and a threat to Hitler's hegemony over the party, mainly because they demanded a \"second revolution\" beyond the one that brought the NSDAP to power.{{sfn|Baranowski|2010|pp=196\u2013197}} By the end of 1933, the membership of the SS reached 209,000.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=901}} Under Himmler's leadership, the SS continued to gather greater power as more and more state and party functions were assigned to its jurisdiction. Over time the SS became answerable only to Hitler, a development typical of the organizational structure of the entire Nazi regime, where legal norms were replaced by actions undertaken under the ''[[F\u00fchrerprinzip]]'' (leader principle), where Hitler's will was considered to be above the law.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=903}}\n\nIn the latter half of 1934, Himmler oversaw the creation of ''[[SS-Junkerschule]]'', institutions where SS officer candidates received leadership training, political and ideological indoctrination, and military instruction. The training stressed ruthlessness and toughness as part of the SS value system, which helped foster a sense of superiority among the men and taught them self-confidence.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=606}} The first schools were established at [[Bad T\u00f6lz]] and [[Braunschweig]], with additional schools opening at [[Klagenfurt]] and [[Prague]] during the war.{{sfn|Allen|2002|p=112}}\n\n===Ideology===\n{{Main|Ideology of the SS}}\nThe SS was regarded as the NSDAP's elite unit.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=146, 147}} In keeping with the [[racial policy of Nazi Germany]], in the early days all SS officer candidates had to provide proof of [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan ancestry]] back to 1750 and for other ranks to 1800.{{sfn|Stackelberg|2002|p=116}} Once the war started and it became more difficult to confirm ancestry, the regulation was amended to just proving the candidate's grandparents were Aryan, as spelled out in the [[Nuremberg Laws]].{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Other requirements were complete obedience to the F\u00fchrer and a commitment to the German people and nation.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=62\u201367}} Himmler also tried to institute physical criteria based on appearance and height, but these requirements were only loosely enforced, and over half the SS men did not meet the criteria.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=63\u201365}} Inducements such as higher salaries and larger homes were provided to members of the SS since they were expected to produce more children than the average German family as part of their commitment to NSDAP doctrine.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=19}}\n\n[[File:Gruft der Wewelsburg (10573265394).jpg|thumb|The crypt at [[Wewelsburg]] was repurposed by Himmler as a place to memorialize dead SS members.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=115}} Artwork commemorating the Holocaust hangs on the walls. ]]\n\nCommitment to SS ideology was emphasized throughout the recruitment, membership process, and training.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=148\u2013149}} Members of the SS were indoctrinated in the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and were taught that it was necessary to remove from Germany people deemed by that policy as inferior.{{sfn|Weale|2010|pp=65\u201366}} [[Esoteric]] rituals and the awarding of regalia and insignia for milestones in the SS man's career suffused SS members even further with Nazi ideology.{{sfn|H\u00f6hne|2001|pp=150\u2013151}} Members were expected to renounce their Christian faith, and Christmas was replaced with a [[Christmas in Nazi Germany|solstice celebration]].{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=93}} Church weddings were replaced with SS ''Ehewein'', a pagan ceremony invented by Himmler.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=94}} These pseudo-religious rites and ceremonies often took place near SS-dedicated monuments or in special SS-designated places.{{sfn|Laqueur|Baumel|2001|p=608}} In 1933, Himmler bought [[Wewelsburg]], a castle in [[Westphalia]]. He initially intended it to be used as an SS training center, but its role came to include hosting SS dinners and neo-pagan rituals.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=111\u2013113}}\n\nThe SS ideology included the application of brutality and terror as a solution to military and political problems.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=21}} The SS stressed total loyalty and obedience to orders unto death. Hitler used this as a powerful tool to further his aims and those of the NSDAP. The SS was entrusted with the commission of atrocities, illegal activities, and war crimes. Himmler once wrote that an SS man \"hesitates not for a single instant, but executes unquestioningly&nbsp;...\" any ''F\u00fchrer-Befehl'' (F\u00fchrer order).{{sfn|Himmler|1936|p=134}} Their official motto was ''\"[[Meine Ehre hei\u00dft Treue]]\"'' (My Honour is Loyalty).{{sfn|Weale|2012|pp=60\u201361}}\n\nAs part of its race-centric functions during World War II, the SS oversaw the isolation and displacement of [[Jews]] from the populations of the conquered territories, seizing their assets and deporting them to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] and [[Ghettos#Jewish ghettos|ghettos]], where they were used as [[slave labor]] or immediately killed.{{sfn|Jacobsen|1999|pp=82, 93}} Chosen to implement the [[Final Solution]] ordered by Hitler, the SS were the main group responsible for the institutional killing and [[democide]] of more than 20 million people during [[the Holocaust]], including approximately 5.2 million{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} to 6 million{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=318}} Jews and 10.5 million [[Slavs]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} A significant number of victims were members of other racial or ethnic groups such as the 258,000 [[Romani people|Romani]].{{sfn|Rummel|1992|pp=12\u201313}} The SS was involved in killing people viewed as threats to [[Nazi eugenics|race hygiene]] or Nazi ideology, including the mentally or physically handicapped, homosexuals, and political dissidents. Members of trade unions and those perceived to be affiliated with groups that opposed the regime (religious, political, social, and otherwise), or those whose views were contradictory to the goals of the NSDAP government, were rounded up in large numbers; these included clergy of all faiths, [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], [[Communism|Communists]], and [[Rotary International|Rotary Club]] members.{{sfn|Rummel|1992|p=12}} According to the judgments rendered at the [[Nuremberg trials]], as well as many [[war crime]]s investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organization which carried out the Holocaust.{{sfn|International Military Tribunal|1946}}\n\n==Pre-war Germany==\nAfter Hitler and the NSDAP came to power on 30 January 1933, the SS were considered a state organization and a branch of the government.{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=77}} Law enforcement gradually became the purview of the SS, and many SS organizations became [[de facto]] government agencies.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}}\n\n[[File: HimmlerAndHeydrich 1938.jpeg|thumb|upright|[[Reinhard Heydrich]] (right) was Himmler's prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and a leading SS figure until his assassination in 1942.]]\n\nThe SS established a [[police state]] within Nazi Germany, using the secret state police and security forces under Himmler's control to suppress resistance to Hitler.{{sfn|Hein|2015|pp=66\u201371}} In his role as [[Minister President of Prussia]], [[Hermann G\u00f6ring]] had in 1933 created a Prussian [[secret police]] force, the ''Geheime Staatspolizei'' or [[Gestapo]], and appointed [[Rudolf Diels]] as its head. Concerned that Diels was not ruthless enough to use the Gestapo effectively to counteract the power of the SA, G\u00f6ring handed over its control to Himmler on 20 April 1934.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=54}} Also on that date, in a departure from long-standing German practice that law enforcement was a state and local matter, Hitler appointed Himmler chief of all German police outside Prussia. Himmler named his deputy and prot\u00e9g\u00e9 [[Reinhard Heydrich]] chief of the Gestapo on 22 April 1934. Heydrich also continued as head of the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]'' (SD; security service).{{sfn|Williams|2001|p=61}}\n\nThe Gestapo's transfer to Himmler was a prelude to the [[Night of the Long Knives]], in which most of the SA leadership were arrested and subsequently executed.{{sfn|Hildebrand|1984|pp=13\u201314}} The SS and Gestapo carried out most of the killings. On 20 July 1934, Hitler detached the SS from the SA, which was no longer an influential force after the purge. The SS became an elite corps of the NSDAP, answerable only to Hitler. Himmler's title of ''Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS'' now became his actual rank&nbsp;\u2013 and the highest rank in the SS, equivalent to the rank of [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] in the army (his previous rank was ''[[Obergruppenf\u00fchrer]]'').{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|pp=313, 316}} As Himmler's position and authority grew, so in effect did his rank.{{sfn|McNab|2009|pp=9, 17, 26\u201327, 30, 46\u201347}}\n\nOn 17 June 1936, all police forces throughout Germany were united under the purview of Himmler and the SS.{{sfn|Buchheim|1968|p=157}} Himmler and Heydrich thus became two of the most powerful men in the country's administration.{{sfn|Reitlinger|1989|p=90}} Police and intelligence forces brought under their administrative control included the SD, Gestapo, ''[[Kriminalpolizei]]'' (Kripo; criminal investigative police), and ''[[Ordnungspolizei]]'' (Orpo; regular uniformed police).{{sfn|Dear|Foot|1995|pp=814\u2013815}} In his capacity as police chief, Himmler was nominally subordinate to Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]].

In contrast to SS members from other countries, who were grouped into either the Germanic-SS or the Foreign Legions of the Waffen-SS, Austrian SS members were regular SS personnel. It was technically under the command of the SS in Germany but often acted independently concerning Austrian affairs. The Austrian SS was founded in 1930 and by 1934 was acting as a covert force to bring about the ''[[Anschluss]]'' with Germany, which occurred in March 1938. Early Austrian SS leaders were Kaltenbrunner and [[Arthur Seyss-Inquart]].{{sfn|Browder|1996|pp=205\u2013206}} Austrian SS members served in every branch of the SS. Political scientist David Art of [[Tufts University]] notes that Austrians constituted 8 percent of the Third Reich's population and 13 percent of the SS; he states that 40 percent of the staff and 75 percent of commanders at death camps were Austrian.{{sfn|Art|2006|p=43}}\n\nAfter the ''Anschluss'', the Austrian SS was folded into ''[[SS-Oberabschnitt Donau]]''. The third regiment of the ''SS-Verf\u00fcgungstruppe'' (''Der F\u00fchrer'') and the fourth ''Totenkopf'' regiment (''Ostmark'') were recruited in Austria shortly thereafter.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.

It is a moderately common resident of the coolest parts of south-eastern Australia, including [[Tasmania]]. Like the other two red-breasted ''Petroica'' robins&mdash;the [[scarlet robin]] and the [[red-capped robin]]&mdash;it is often simply called the ''robin redbreast''. Like many brightly coloured robins of the [[Petroicidae]], it is [[Sexual dimorphism|sexually dimorphic]]. Measuring {{convert|12|\u2013|14|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the flame robin has dark brown eyes and a small thin black bill. The male has a brilliant orange-red chest and throat, and a white patch on the forehead above the bill. Its upper parts are iron-grey with white bars, and its tail black with white tips. The female is a nondescript grey-brown. Its song has been described as the most musical of its genus.\n\nThe position of the flame robin and its Australian relatives on the passerine family tree is unclear; the Petroicidae are not closely related to either the [[European robin|European]] or [[American robin]]s, but appear to be an early offshoot of the [[Passerida]] group of [[songbird]]s. The flame robin is predominantly [[insectivore|insectivorous]], pouncing on prey from a perch in a tree, or foraging on the ground. A [[territory (animal)|territorial]] bird, the flame robin employs song and plumage displays to mark out and defend its territory. Classified by [[BirdLife International]] as ''[[Near Threatened]]'', the species has suffered a marked decline in the past 25 years.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe flame robin was first [[Species description|described]] by the French [[natural history|naturalist]]s, [[Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant Quoy]] and [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]], in 1830 as ''Muscicapa chrysoptera''.<ref>Quoy, Jean Ren\u00e9 Constant; Gaimard, Joseph Paul in Dumont-d'Urville, J.
