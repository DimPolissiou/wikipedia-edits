Wujcik''' (January 26, 1951 \u2013 June 7, 2008) was an American designer of both [[Tabletop role-playing game|pen-and-paper]] and [[Role-playing video game|computer]] [[role-playing game]]s, and co-founder of [[Palladium Books]].\n\n== Gaming career ==\nWujcik started off as head of the gaming society at [[Wayne State University]], The Warriors and Warlocks of the Wayne Weregamers Society,  also known as the Wayne State Weregamers, where he met and befriended [[Kevin Siembieda]].<ref name=\"designers\">{{Cite book|author=Shannon Appelcline|title=Designers & Dragons|publisher=Mongoose Publishing|year=2011| isbn= 978-1-907702-58-7}}</ref>{{rp|155}} By 1980 the Wayne Weregamers became known as the Detroit Gaming Center, when  Wujcik, the CDM (Congress of Dungeon Masters) and Siembieda moved the group from the Monteith House, scheduled for demolition, to an off-campus building run by a non-profit; Siembieda became Assistant Director for the Center with Wujcik as Director.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|155}} Wujcik published the science-fiction adventure ''Sector 57'' (1980) under the Detroit Gaming Center banner.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}} Wujcik worked as a computer columnist for ''[[The Detroit News]]'' where he wrote their weekly \"Computer Column\" from 1979 to 1981. That served to be a springboard for him to co-found Palladium Books with [[Kevin Siembieda]] and to work on developing numerous role-playing games and supplements for such [[Campaign setting|settings]] as ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness]]'', ''[[After the Bomb (game)|After the Bomb]]'', ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'', and many others, including ''[[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game]]'' and ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]''.\n\nSiembieda obtained the rights to produce a licensed roleplaying game based on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comic book, but he did not approve of the freelancer's final product so he had Wujcik redesign the game, which was done in five weeks, and it was published as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|158}}  Wujcik designed ''Revised Recon'' (1987), a role-playing game revision of the miniatures warfare game ''[[Recon (role-playing game)|Recon]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|159}} Wujcik also designed the ''[[Ninjas & Superspies]]'' role-playing game in 1988, which built on his long-term interest in Japan and involved extensive research on his part.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|159}} Wujcik also wrote the RPG ''[[After the Bomb (game)|After the Bomb]]'' for Palladium.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}} He also freelanced for [[West End Games]], and wrote one of the early adventures for the ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'' roleplaying game, ''Clones in Space'' (1986) and contributed to the ''Acute Paranoia'' supplement (1986).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}}\n\nWhile working at West End Games, Wujcik discovered that the company held a license for [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Amber|Amber]]'' novels, which were among Wujcik's favorites, and he offered to design an ''Amber'' RPG game even through West End would not guarantee to publish it.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}} While playtesting the game, Wujcik found that it worked better without dice, but West End did not agree, so he acquired the RPG rights to ''Amber''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}}  He began developing the game for [[R. Talsorian Games]] in the early 1990s, but encountered creative differences there as well.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|210}} Siembieda encouraged Wujcik to set up his own company to publish the game, and Wujcik founded [[Phage Press]], hiring his cousins Lisa  and Ron Seymour to deal with the business side of the company.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}} ''[[Amber Diceless Roleplaying]]''  was finally published in November 1991 by Phage Press.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}} Wujcik did not like the manuscripts submitted for the game's supplement ''[[Shadow Knight]]'' (1993), so he rewrote the book himself.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}} [[James Wallis (games designer)|James Wallis]] brought his ''Bugtown'' game to Phage to be produced, but creative differences with Wujcik led Wallis to pull out of Phage in 1994 and start [[Hogshead Publishing]]. In 1996, Wujcik convinced [[Matt Howarth]] to re-license the ''Bugtown'' rights to him, although Wujcik never actually published a game based on the comic.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}} Wujcik wrote the book ''[[Mystic China]]'' for Palladium in 1995.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|270}}\n\nWujcik was also the founder of the [[gaming convention]] known as Ambercon.<ref name=\"EW\">{{cite web | url=http://erickwujcik.com/2008/06/ | title=Erick Wujcik - Archive for June 2008 | publisher=Palladium Books | accessdate=19 November 2015}}</ref> In 1997 he went to work for [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra Studios]] and was lead game designer on the game ''[[Return to Krondor]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|270}} He also served as a game designer at Outrage Entertainment for the game ''[[Alter Echo]]''.\n\nWujcik served as chief editor of ''[[Amberzine]]'', a [[fanzine]] for the ''Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game'', publishing the work of such notables as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Henry Kuttner]], and [[Roger Zelazny]].

That served to be a springboard for him to co-found Palladium Books with [[Kevin Siembieda]] and to work on developing numerous role-playing games and supplements for such [[Campaign setting|settings]] as ''[[Palladium Fantasy Role-Playing Game]]'', ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness]]'', ''[[After the Bomb (game)|After the Bomb]]'', ''[[Rifts (role-playing game)|Rifts]]'', and many others, including ''[[Amber Diceless Roleplaying Game]]'' and ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]''.\n\nSiembieda obtained the rights to produce a licensed roleplaying game based on the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (Mirage Studios)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' comic book, but he did not approve of the freelancer's final product so he had Wujcik redesign the game, which was done in five weeks, and it was published as ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles & Other Strangeness]]'' (1985).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|158}}  Wujcik designed ''Revised Recon'' (1987), a role-playing game revision of the miniatures warfare game ''[[Recon (role-playing game)|Recon]]'' (1982).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|159}} Wujcik also designed the ''[[Ninjas & Superspies]]'' role-playing game in 1988, which built on his long-term interest in Japan and involved extensive research on his part.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|159}} Wujcik also wrote the RPG ''[[After the Bomb (game)|After the Bomb]]'' for Palladium.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}} He also freelanced for [[West End Games]], and wrote one of the early adventures for the ''[[Paranoia (role-playing game)|Paranoia]]'' roleplaying game, ''Clones in Space'' (1986) and contributed to the ''Acute Paranoia'' supplement (1986).<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}}\n\nWhile working at West End Games, Wujcik discovered that the company held a license for [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Amber|Amber]]'' novels, which were among Wujcik's favorites, and he offered to design an ''Amber'' RPG game even through West End would not guarantee to publish it.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|268}} While playtesting the game, Wujcik found that it worked better without dice, but West End did not agree, so he acquired the RPG rights to ''Amber''.<ref name=\"designers\"/>{{rp|269}}  He began developing the game for [[R.

Healy barges into March's house and breaks his arm before leaving.\n\nHealy is interrogated by two thugs, \u201cBlueface\u201d<!-- single word in closing credits -->\u2009\u2014\u2009so named after he sets off a [[dye pack]] while searching Healy's apartment\u2009\u2014\u2009and Older Guy, about Amelia's whereabouts. Healy wards them off with a shotgun, and teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia first.\n\nMarch and Healy question Amelia's anti-pollution protest group and meet Chet, who brings them to the burnt-down house of Amelia's boyfriend Dean, who died in the fire. They learn that Amelia and Dean were working with Misty on an \"experimental film\"\u2009\u2014\u2009combining pornography and [[investigative journalism]]\u2009\u2014\u2009called ''How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?'' The two infiltrate a party in search of the film's financier, Sid Shattuck. Healy discovers the film is missing, while a drunken March finds Shattuck dead, and unknowingly crosses paths with Amelia. March's daughter Holly, having snuck along to the party, manages to stop Blueface from killing Amelia. Blueface is struck in a hit-and-run, and Amelia flees. Healy subdues Older Guy and finds Blueface dying, who tells Healy his boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill Amelia, March, and all other witnesses. Healy discreetly strangles Blueface to death. \n\nMarch and Healy are met by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner, a high-ranking official in the [[United States Department of Justice]], who claims Amelia is delusional and believes Judith wants her dead. Judith hires the duo to find her daughter.\n\nMarch and Healy make their way to an airport hotel where Amelia is meeting with distributors for the film. John Boy has arrived ahead of them; they witness the businessmen being slaughtered and hastily retreat, only for Amelia to land on their car and shoot at them, knocking herself unconscious. They take her to March's house, where she reveals that her mother is in the pocket of a cabal of [[Detroit]] automakers. After uncovering evidence that they suppressed the [[catalytic converter]], which regulates exhaust emissions, Amelia created the film to expose their collusion, and her mother has had everyone connected to the film killed.\n\nJudith has her assistant Tally arrange for March and Healy to deliver a briefcase of $100,000; March tells her they have found Amelia. When March falls asleep while driving and crashes the car, the briefcase flies open to reveal shredded magazines; the delivery was a diversion to leave Amelia unprotected. John Boy arrives at March's house disguised as a family doctor, attacking Holly and engaging in a shootout with March and Healy before evading the police. Amelia flees the house only to be killed by John Boy when she unwittingly flags down his car.\n\nMarch and Healy try to bring the matter to court but have no evidence. At Misty's house, they discover the nearsighted Mrs. Glenn only saw projected footage of her niece\u2009\u2014\u2009the missing film. They realize that Chet is the projectionist for the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] and will try to screen the film. At the auto show, Healy and March are intercepted at gunpoint by Tally, who is distracted by Holly and knocked unconscious. Healy finds Chet, who has spliced the film into the auto show presentation. The film plays to the entire auto show, implicating the auto executives. On the roof, March struggles with Older Guy, who falls to his death while March lands in the pool. Holly stops Tally from reaching the film. Healy overpowers John Boy, but spares his life at Holly's behest, and March secures the film from thugs sent by the auto executives. \n\nJudith is arrested, but insists she did not want Amelia killed and that \"[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|what is good for Detroit is good for America]]\", while Healy and March continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency \"The Nice Guys\".\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- per opening credits order --->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Jackson Healy\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Holland March \n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Holly March\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as John Boy\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as Amelia Kuttner\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Tally\n* [[Keith David]] as Older Guy (Eddie Harris)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL5RsUCuC90|title=Keith David at 'THE NICE GUYS' premiere in Hollywood on Fabulous TV|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Blueface<!--- single word in closing credits --->\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Glenn\n* [[Murielle Telio]] as Misty Mountains\n* [[Gil Gerard]] as Bergen Paulsen\n* [[Daisy Tahan]] as Jessica\n* [[Jack Kilmer]] as Chet\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Judith Kuttner\n* Lance Valentine Butler as Kid on Bike\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Bobby \n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Bumble\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Sid Shattuck (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/robert-downey-non-marvel-movies-2010s/|title=Robert Downey Jr Has Only Done 5 Non-Marvel Movies In The Last Decade|date=October 20, 2019|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nLike Black's previously directed film ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', ''The Nice Guys'' takes inspiration from [[Brett Halliday]], namely his novel ''Blue Murder''.<ref name=from>{{cite book|title=The Nice Guys: From Script to Screen|first=Shane|last=Black|pages=7\u201310|year=2016|publisher=Rizzoli|ISBN=978-0-8478-4981-9}}</ref> Black initially wrote a version of the script along with Anthony Bagarozzi in 2001 which established the characters but otherwise was vastly different.<ref name=\"Slashurbanwestern\">{{cite web|last1=Giroux|first1=Jack|title=Interview: 'The Nice Guys' Director Shane Black Discuses His Latest Urban Western|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-nice-guys-shane-black-interview/|website=Slashfilm|accessdate=16 June 2016|page=1}}</ref> According to Black, each would start with one detective, he with March and Bagarozzi with Healy.

Down-on-his-luck private eye Holland March is hired by Misty's aunt, who claims to have seen her niece still alive. March\u2019s investigation leads him to Amelia Kuttner, an associate of Misty's who later pays enforcer Jackson Healy to scare March away. Healy barges into March's house and breaks his arm before leaving.\n\nHealy is interrogated by two thugs, \u201cBlueface\u201d<!-- single word in closing credits -->\u2009\u2014\u2009so named after he sets off a [[dye pack]] while searching Healy\u2019s apartment\u2009\u2014\u2009and Older Guy, about Amelia's whereabouts. Healy wards them off with a shotgun, and teams up with a reluctant March to find Amelia first.\n\nMarch and Healy question Amelia\u2019s anti-pollution protest group and meet Chet, who brings them to the burnt-down house of Amelia's boyfriend Dean, who died in the fire. They learn that Amelia and Dean were working with Misty on an \"experimental film\"\u2009\u2014\u2009combining pornography and [[investigative journalism]]\u2009\u2014\u2009called ''How Do You Like My Car, Big Boy?'' The two infiltrate a party in search of the film's financier, Sid Shattuck. Healy discovers the film is missing, while a drunken March finds Shattuck dead, and unknowingly crosses paths with Amelia. March\u2019s daughter Holly, having snuck along to the party, manages to stop Blueface from killing Amelia. Blueface is struck in a hit-and-run, and Amelia flees. Healy subdues Older Guy and finds Blueface dying, who tells Healy his boss has dispatched a hit man named John Boy to kill Amelia, March, and all other witnesses. Healy discreetly strangles Blueface to death. \n\nMarch and Healy are met by Amelia's mother, Judith Kuttner, a high-ranking official in the [[United States Department of Justice]], who claims Amelia is delusional and believes Judith wants her dead. Judith hires the duo to find her daughter.\n\nMarch and Healy make their way to an airport hotel where Amelia is meeting with distributors for the film. John Boy has arrived ahead of them; they witness the businessmen being slaughtered and hastily retreat, only for Amelia to land on their car and shoot at them, knocking herself unconscious. They take her to March's house, where she reveals that her mother is in the pocket of a cabal of [[Detroit]] automakers. After uncovering evidence that they suppressed the [[catalytic converter]], which regulates exhaust emissions, Amelia created the film to expose their collusion, and her mother has had everyone connected to the film killed.\n\nJudith has her assistant Tally arrange for March and Healy to deliver a briefcase of $100,000; March tells her they have found Amelia. When March falls asleep while driving and crashes the car, the briefcase flies open to reveal shredded magazines; the delivery was a diversion to leave Amelia unprotected. John Boy arrives at March\u2019s house disguised as a family doctor, attacking Holly and engaging in a shootout with March and Healy before evading the police. Amelia flees the house only to be killed by John Boy when she unwittingly flags down his car.\n\nMarch and Healy try to bring the matter to court but have no evidence. At Misty\u2019s house, they discover the nearsighted Mrs. Glenn only saw projected footage of her niece\u2009\u2014\u2009the missing film. They realize that Chet is the projectionist for the [[LA Auto Show|Los Angeles Auto Show]] and will try to screen the film. At the auto show, Healy and March are intercepted at gunpoint by Tally, who is distracted by Holly and knocked unconscious. Healy finds Chet, who has spliced the film into the auto show presentation. The film plays to the entire auto show, implicating the auto executives. On the roof, March struggles with Older Guy, who falls to his death while March lands in the pool. Holly stops Tally from reaching the film. Healy overpowers John Boy, but spares his life at Holly's behest, and March secures the film from thugs sent by the auto executives. \n\nJudith is arrested, but insists she did not want Amelia killed and that \"[[Charles Erwin Wilson#Secretary of Defense|what is good for Detroit is good for America]]\", while Healy and March continue working together as private eyes, naming their agency \"The Nice Guys\".\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--- per opening credits order --->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Russell Crowe]] as Jackson Healy\n* [[Ryan Gosling]] as Holland March \n* [[Angourie Rice]] as Holly March\n* [[Matt Bomer]] as John Boy\n* [[Margaret Qualley]] as Amelia Kuttner\n* [[Yaya DaCosta]] as Tally\n* [[Keith David]] as Older Guy (Eddie Harris)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cL5RsUCuC90|title=Keith David at 'THE NICE GUYS' premiere in Hollywood on Fabulous TV|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n* [[Beau Knapp]] as Blueface<!--- single word in closing credits --->\n* [[Lois Smith]] as Mrs. Glenn\n* [[Murielle Telio]] as Misty Mountains\n* [[Gil Gerard]] as Bergen Paulsen\n* [[Daisy Tahan]] as Jessica\n* [[Jack Kilmer]] as Chet\n* [[Kim Basinger]] as Judith Kuttner\n* Lance Valentine Butler as Kid on Bike\n* [[Ty Simpkins]] as Bobby \n* [[Hannibal Buress]] as Bumble\n* [[Robert Downey Jr.]] as Sid Shattuck (uncredited)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/robert-downey-non-marvel-movies-2010s/|title=Robert Downey Jr Has Only Done 5 Non-Marvel Movies In The Last Decade|date=October 20, 2019|website=ScreenRant}}</ref>{{div col end}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Development===\nLike Black's previously directed film ''[[Kiss Kiss Bang Bang]]'', ''The Nice Guys'' takes inspiration from [[Brett Halliday]], namely his novel ''Blue Murder''.<ref name=from>{{cite book|title=The Nice Guys: From Script to Screen|first=Shane|last=Black|pages=7\u201310|year=2016|publisher=Rizzoli|ISBN=978-0-8478-4981-9}}</ref> Black initially wrote a version of the script along with Anthony Bagarozzi in 2001 which established the characters but otherwise was vastly different.<ref name=\"Slashurbanwestern\">{{cite web|last1=Giroux|first1=Jack|title=Interview: 'The Nice Guys' Director Shane Black Discuses His Latest Urban Western|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/the-nice-guys-shane-black-interview/|website=Slashfilm|accessdate=16 June 2016|page=1}}</ref> According to Black, each would start with one detective, he with March and Bagarozzi with Healy. Along the way, they swapped characters and eventually wrote a first draft. This version of the script failed to attract any buyers, and then Black reworked it into a 64-page version that would serve for a [[television pilot]].

Eventually, most [[Final Four]]s were awarded only to host cities with domed stadiums. Starting with the [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1997 tournament]], only domed stadiums have hosted the Final Four.<ref>{{cite news|last=Littlefield|first=Bill|title=The Final Four's Complicated History With Domes|date=April 2, 2016|website=WBUR.org|url=https://www.wbur.org/onlyagame/2016/04/02/ncaa-astrodome-final-four|accessdate=January 20, 2020}}</ref>\n\nUCLA and Houston played again in 1969 at [[Pauley Pavilion]] for the regular-season rematch.

The \"Game of the Century\" proved that a national audience would watch college basketball games during the regular season. Furthermore, it was telecast not by a Big Three Network but rather by the independent TVS Television Network.  In 1969, NBC became the first major network to broadcast the championship game, at a cost of more than $500,000. In 2008, the NCAA deal with CBS to televise the entire tournament was worth $545 million.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/1999/11/18/news/ncaa/ | work=CNN | title=CBS renews NCAA B'ball | date=November 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>Al Carter - [http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/basketball/college/stories/MYSA012008.uhucla.en.29b85c5.html College Basketball: UH and UCLA, under the big top]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}.
