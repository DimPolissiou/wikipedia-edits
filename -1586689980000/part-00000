He remarried [[bigamy|bigamously]], but during the mid-1920s he wrote to Bridget asking her to send William to Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] for a visit.

Later, William worked at an [[Opel]] [[automobile]] factory, and later still as a car salesman.

He was born to Adolf Hitler's half brother [[Hitler family|Alois Hitler Jr.]] and his Irish wife [[Bridget Dowling]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Lancashire]], England. William Hitler later relocated to Germany, but subsequently immigrated to the United States, where he served in the [[United States Navy]] in [[World War II]]. He eventually received American citizenship.\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Patrick Hitler was born in Britain in the [[Toxteth|Toxteth Park]] district of [[Liverpool]], the son of [[Hitler family#1910s|Alois Hitler, Jr.]] and  [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[Bridget Dowling]]. The couple had met in [[Dublin]] when Alois was living there during 1909; in 1910, they married in [[Marylebone]] in [[London]] and relocated back north to Liverpool, where William Patrick was born in 1911.<ref name=freebmd>{{Cite web |url=http://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/information.pl?cite=5HACR3d%2BtCjGfEqD%2FmZnrg&scan=1 |title= Index entry |access-date=9 February 2017 |work= FreeBMD |publisher=ONS}}</ref> The family lived in a flat at 102 Upper Stanhope Street, which was destroyed during the last German air raid of the [[Liverpool Blitz]] on 10 January 1942. Dowling wrote a manuscript titled ''My Brother-in-Law Adolf'', in which she claimed Adolf Hitler had lived in Liverpool with her, remaining from November 1912 to April 1913, in order to avoid [[conscription]] in Austria. The book is largely considered by Hitler's biographers to be a work of fiction.<ref>McCarthy (1992)</ref> At the time, Adolf was residing in the [[Meldemannstra\u00dfe dormitory]].<ref name=\"Kershaw2000\">{{cite book |author= Ian Kershaw |title= Hitler, 1889-1936: Hubris |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=nV-N10gyoFwC |year=2000 |publisher=W.W.

Unable to rejoin them due to the outbreak of [[World War I]], Alois abandoned the family, leaving William to be brought up by his mother. He remarried [[bigamy|bigamously]], but during the mid-1920s he wrote to Bridget asking her to send William to Germany's [[Weimar Republic]] for a visit. She finally agreed in 1929, when William was 18. Alois had had another son, [[Heinz Hitler]], by his German wife. Heinz, in contrast to William, became a committed [[Nazi]] and in 1942 died in [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] captivity.\n\n==In Nazi Germany==\nIn 1933, William Patrick Hitler returned to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] in an attempt to benefit from his uncle's acquisition of power. His uncle, by now Chancellor, found him a job at the ''Reichskreditbank'' in Berlin, a job he had for much of the 1930s. Later, William worked at an [[Opel]] [[automobile]] factory, and later still as a car salesman. Dissatisfied with these jobs, William persisted in asking his uncle for a better job, writing to him with [[blackmail]] threats that he would sell embarrassing stories about the family to the newspapers unless his \"personal circumstances\" improved.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nIn 1938, Adolf asked William to relinquish his British citizenship in exchange for a high-ranking job. Expecting a trap, William fled Nazi Germany; he again tried to blackmail his uncle with threats. This time, William threatened to tell the press that Hitler's [[Alois Hitler#Biological father|alleged paternal grandfather]] was actually a [[Jews|Jewish]] merchant. Returning to London he wrote an article for ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' magazine titled \"Why I Hate my Uncle.\"<ref name=independent>Brown et al (2006)</ref> William allegedly did return, briefly, to Germany in 1938.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} It is unknown what exactly William's role in late-1930s Germany was.\n\n==Immigration to the United States==\nIn January 1939 the newspaper magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] brought him and his mother to the United States{{why|date=April 2020}} for a lecture tour.<ref>[https://www.focus.de/politik/ausland/hitlers-erben_aid_108295.html \u201eF\u00fchrer\u201c-Stammbaum ohne \u00c4ste]</ref> He and his mother were stranded when [[World War II]] began. After making a special request to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], William was eventually approved to join the United States Navy in 1944; he relocated to [[Sunnyside, Queens|Sunnyside]], [[Queens]] in [[New York (state)|New York]].\n\nWilliam Patrick Hitler was drafted into the United States Navy during [[World War II]] as a Pharmacist's Mate (a designation later changed to [[United States Navy Hospital Corpsman#Noteworthy Corpsmen|Hospital Corpsman]]) until he was discharged in 1947. On reporting for duty, the induction officer asked his name. \"Hitler,\" he replied. \"Glad to see you, Hitler,\" the officer replied, thinking Hitler was joking. \"My name's [[Rudolf_Hess|Hess]]\".  He was wounded in action during the war and awarded the [[Purple Heart]].<ref name=\"independent\" />\n\n==Later life==\nAfter being discharged from the Navy, William Hitler changed his surname to \"Stuart-Houston,\" a reference to [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]] who had been one of Adolf Hitler's role models.\n\nIn 1947, Stuart-Houston married Phyllis Jean-Jacques, who had been born in Germany in the mid-1920s.<ref name=bitte>[http://www.infobitte.de/free/lex/wpdeLex0/online/h/hi/Hitler-_William_Patrick.htm Infobitte.de] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120703030241/http://www.infobitte.de/free/lex/wpdeLex0/online/h/hi/Hitler-_William_Patrick.htm |date=2012-07-03 }}</ref> After their relationship began, William and Phyllis, along with Bridget, tried to live a life of anonymity in the United States.

After a one year break that saw the league being broadcast nationally on the ABC network (and in Brisbane by then TVQ-0), the league returned to the network wherein its television success began, the [[Seven Network]].\n\n==Night series==\n[[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]] 10.10 (70) defeated [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] 9.13 (67) in the Night Series, which for the first time was played entirely as a pre-season competition, rather than a concurrent competition to the Premiership season.\n\n==Premiership season==\n\n===Round 1===\n{{S-start}}\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n| '''Home team'''\n| '''Home team score'''\n| '''Away team'''\n| '''Away team score'''\n| '''Venue'''\n| '''Crowd'''\n| '''Date'''\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Gee}}\n| 11.17 (83)\n| '''{{AFL WC}}'''\n| '''14.20 (104)'''\n| [[Kardinia Park (stadium)|Kardinia Park]]\n| 20,981\n| 2 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Ess}}'''\n| '''25.14 (164)'''\n| {{AFL Nor}}\n| 12.10 (82)\n| [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]]\n| 18,390\n| 2 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Car}}'''\n| '''18.18 (126)'''\n| {{AFL Haw}}\n| 15.21 (111)\n| [[Princes Park Football Ground|Princes Park]]\n| 28,141\n| 2 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL BB}}\n| 10.15 (75)\n| '''{{AFL Col}}'''\n| '''11.17 (83)'''\n| [[Carrara Stadium]]\n| 11,306\n| 3 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Fit}}'''\n| '''20.20 (140)'''\n| {{AFL StK}}\n| 17.16 (118)\n| [[Princes Park Football Ground|Princes Park]]\n| 18,774\n| 4 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Ric}}\n| 16.12 (108)\n| '''{{AFL Mel}}'''\n| '''23.16 (154)'''\n| [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n| 34,824\n| 4 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Foo}}'''\n| '''16.6 (102)'''\n| {{AFL Syd}}\n| 11.10 (76)\n| [[VFL Park]]\n| 18,980\n| 4 April 1988\n{{S-end}}\n\n===Round 2===\n{{S-start}}\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n| '''Home team'''\n| '''Home team score'''\n| '''Away team'''\n| '''Away team score'''\n| '''Venue'''\n| '''Crowd'''\n| '''Date'''\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL WC}}'''\n| '''26.19 (175)'''\n| {{AFL Ess}}\n| 11.10 (76)\n| [[WACA Ground]]\n| 24,886\n| 8 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Foo}}\n| 9.12 (66)\n| '''{{AFL Mel}}'''\n| '''13.8 (86)'''\n| [[Western Oval]]\n| 15,693\n| 9 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Col}}'''\n| '''15.12 (102)'''\n| {{AFL Fit}}\n| 9.16 (70)\n| [[Victoria Park, Melbourne|Victoria Park]]\n| 26,158\n| 9 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Nor}}\n| 20.7 (127)\n| '''{{AFL Gee}}'''\n| '''21.16 (142)'''\n| [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n| 15,233\n| 9 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Car}}'''\n| '''19.15 (129)'''\n| {{AFL BB}}\n| 7.19 (61)\n| [[Princes Park Football Ground|Princes Park]]\n| 16,891\n| 9 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Haw}}'''\n| '''26.15 (171)'''\n| {{AFL Ric}}\n| 12.14 (86)\n| [[VFL Park]]\n| 18,082\n| 9 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Syd}}'''\n| '''9.12 (66)'''\n| {{AFL StK}}\n| 7.13 (55)\n| [[Sydney Cricket Ground|SCG]]\n| 9,000\n| 10 April 1988\n{{S-end}}\n\n===Round 3===\n{{S-start}}\n|- style=\"background:#ccf;\"\n| '''Home team'''\n| '''Home team score'''\n| '''Away team'''\n| '''Away team score'''\n| '''Venue'''\n| '''Crowd'''\n| '''Date'''\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Haw}}'''\n| '''17.12 (114)'''\n| {{AFL Syd}}\n| 13.15 (93)\n| [[Princes Park Football Ground|Princes Park]]\n| 9,921\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL StK}}'''\n| '''17.6 (108)'''\n| {{AFL Nor}}\n| 11.16 (82)\n| [[Moorabbin Oval]]\n| 16,573\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Mel}}'''\n| '''9.18 (72)'''\n| {{AFL Gee}}\n| 9.10 (64)\n| [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]\n| 30,870\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| '''{{AFL Foo}}'''\n| '''16.12 (108)'''\n| {{AFL Fit}}\n| 7.15 (57)\n| [[Western Oval]]\n| 12,683\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Ess}}\n| 11.13 (79)\n| '''{{AFL Car}}'''\n| '''23.13 (151)'''\n| [[Windy Hill, Essendon|Windy Hill]]\n| 21,311\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL Ric}}\n| 12.8 (80)\n| '''{{AFL Col}}'''\n| '''23.12 (150)'''\n| [[VFL Park]]\n| 34,444\n| 16 April 1988\n|- style=\"background:#fff;\"\n| {{AFL BB}}<!--            NOTE: This game is recognized as a Brisbane home game, despite being played in Perth.

If the player played on by handpass, the ball would be returned for a [[ball-up]]; the penalty for playing on was originally a free kick to the opposition, but this was commuted to a ball up after proving unpopular during pre-season trials.\n**The full-back was required to kick the ball over a distance of at least two metres when kicking in after a behind.\n*The VFL banned lace-up guernseys starting from this season after [[Robert Flower]] and [[Brian Wilson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Wilson]] both suffered broken fingers when they became tangled in the laces during tackles.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=80|date=12 June 1987|title=Lace-ups get the boot}}</ref> A handful of players had been wearing the tight-fitting guernseys which were laced up in the front in recent years.\n*{{AFL BB}} played two matches in Perth during the season.

If the player played on by handpass, the ball would be returned for a [[ball-up]]; the penalty for playing on was originally a free kick to the opposition, but this was commuted to a ball up after proving unpopular during pre-season trials.\n**The full-back was required to kick the ball over a distance of at least two metres when kicking in after a behind.\n*The VFL banned lace-up guernseys starting from this season after [[Robert Flower]] and [[Brian Wilson (Australian rules footballer)|Brian Wilson]] both suffered broken fingers when they became tangled in the laces during tackles.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|page=80|date=12 June 1987|title=Lace-ups get the boot}}</ref> A handful of players had been wearing the tight-fitting guernseys which were laced up in the front in recent years.\n*{{AFL BB}} played two matches in Perth during the season.

Brisbane had expected the clubs' Round 16 match to be moved from Perth to the Gold Coast in return, only to discover that the league considered the Round 3 match a Brisbane home game, meaning that Brisbane would be required to travel for the Round 16 match in Perth as well.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sun News-Pictorial|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|author=Paul Cunningham|page=82|date=13 April 1988|title=Ground bugbear}}</ref> The VFL later changed its rules to prevent a repeat of this situation. \n*The VFL took over the operation of the financially crippled [[Sydney Swans]] during the year until its parent company, Powerplay, could find a buyer for the franchise.

Other dances referred to in English Renaissance plays such as the galliard, pavane, and volta are described in French and Italian dancing manuals by [[Thoinot Arbeau]] and [[Fabritio Caroso]] among others. Some of the country dances Shakespeare mentions appear in John Playford's ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' (1651), but Playford's choreographies probably differ from the versions performed on the Shakespearean stage.\n\n[[Jig]]s often followed performances of plays in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England, but we know very little about the actual steps of this dance (see Baskerville).\n\n==Dances mentioned in Shakespeare plays==\n[[File:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|thumb|[[William Kempe|Will Kemp]], the Elizabethan Clown, dancing a Jig]]\n* [[Lavolta|Volta]] &ndash; ''Troilus and Cressida'' (Act IV, scene 4), Henry V (Act III, scene 5)\n* [[Courante|Coranto]] &ndash; ''All's Well That Ends Well'' (Act II, scene 3), Twelfth Night (Act I, scene 3)\n* [[Galliard]], cinquepace, or sinkapace \u2013 ''Twelfth Night'' (Act I, scene 3), Much Ado About Nothing (Act II, scene 1), Henry V (Act I, scene 2)\n* Measure, measures, or [[old measures]] &ndash; ''As You Like It'' (Act V, scene 4), Richard II (Act III, scene 4), Richard)\n* [[Jig]] &ndash; ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (Act III, scene 1)\n* [[Country footing]] \u2013 ''The Tempest'' (Act IV, scene 1)\n* [[Canary dance|Canario]] \u2013 ''All's Well That Ends Well'' (Act II, scene 1)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early dance]]\n* [[Elizabethan theatre]]\n* [[English Renaissance]]\n* [[Historical dance]]\n* [[History of dance]]\n* [[Renaissance dance]]\n* [[Renaissance music]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Baskerville, Charles Read.

Terms like 'measure' and 'foot it' can also refer to dancing, and dance is often woven into the plot as part of a [[masque]] or [[masquerade ball]], especially in plays by [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]].\n\n==Primary sources==\nThere is no known dancing instruction manual for English dances of Shakespeare's time, but there are descriptions of almains and the measures in the [[Inns of Court]] manuscripts (see Payne), mentions of [[Morris dance]] in church court and civic records (see Forrest), and large sections of dancing in court [[masque]]s (see Ravelhofer and Welsford). Other dances referred to in English Renaissance plays such as the galliard, pavane, and volta are described in French and Italian dancing manuals by [[Thoinot Arbeau]] and [[Fabritio Caroso]] among others. Some of the country dances Shakespeare mentions appear in John Playford's ''[[The English Dancing Master]]'' (1651), but Playford's choreographies probably differ from the versions performed on the Shakespearean stage.\n\n[[Jig]]s often followed performances of plays in late sixteenth- and early seventeenth-century England, but we know very little about the actual steps of this dance (see Baskerville).\n\n==Dances mentioned in Shakespeare plays==\n[[File:Will Kemp Elizabethan Clown Jig.jpg|thumb|[[William Kempe|Will Kemp]], the Elizabethan Clown, dancing a Jig]]\n* [[Lavolta|Volta]] &ndash; ''Troilus and Cressida'' (Act IV, scene 4), Henry V (Act III, scene 5)\n* [[Courante|Coranto]] &ndash; ''All's Well That Ends Well'' (Act II, scene 3), Twelfth Night (Act I, scene 3)\n* [[Galliard]], cinquepace, or sinkapace \u2013 ''Twelfth Night'' (Act I, scene 3), Much Ado About Nothing (Act II, scene 1), Henry V (Act I, scene 2)\n* Measure, measures, or [[old measures]] &ndash; ''As You Like It'' (Act V, scene 4), Richard II (Act III, scene 4), Richard)\n* [[Jig]] &ndash; ''Love's Labour's Lost'' (Act III, scene 1)\n* [[Country footing]] \u2013 ''The Tempest'' (Act IV, scene 1)\n* [[Canary dance|Canario]] \u2013 ''All's Well That Ends Well'' (Act II, scene 1)\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early dance]]\n* [[Elizabethan theatre]]\n* [[English Renaissance]]\n* [[Historical dance]]\n* [[History of dance]]\n* [[Renaissance dance]]\n* [[Renaissance music]]\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Baskerville, Charles Read.

Those are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, [[probucol]] and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin mainly acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol biosynthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1527-3466.1998.tb00357.x | volume=16 | issue=3 | title=Cerivastatin (BAY w 6228): A Novel HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor | year=1998 | journal=Cardiovascular Drug Reviews | pages=236\u2013263 | vauthors=Kuhlmann J, M\u00fcck W, Bischoff H, Keutz E, Llewellyn M}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jlr.org/content/33/11/1569.full.pdf+html], 10.

This also means that the rates subsequent biosynthesis is reduced, since less starting material is available.  Eventually, this will lead to lower cholesterol levels.\n\nThe location of cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibition of HMG-CoA is of significance, since most circulating cholesterol originates from internal production, rather than the diet. If the liver cannot produce more cholesterol, the cholesterol levels in the blood will decrease. Also, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors cause secondary up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with increased LDL-cholesterol clearance and reduction of both total and LDL cholesterol in the serum.\n\n== Metabolism ==\nCerivastatin is metabolized via the hepatic pathway.<ref>Porter, K.E.; Turner, N.A.; Statins and myocardial remodeling: cell and molecular pathways; expert reviews in molecular medicine, 2011, 13 (22): pp.1-18</ref> ''In vitro'' studies with human liver cells showed that two metabolic pathways are equally important; demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent.<ref>[http://www.jlr.org/content/23/3/466.full.pdf+html], Miettinen TA (1982). \"Diurnal variation of cholesterol precursors squalene and methyl sterols in human plasma lipoproteins\" ''The Journal of Lipid Research'' 23: 466-473</ref><ref>[http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/dmd/25/3/321.full.pdf], Boberg M, Angerbauer R, Fey P, Kanhai WK, Karl W, Kern A, Ploschke J, Radtke M (1996). \"Metabolism of cerivastatin by human liver microsomes in vitro\". ''Drug Metabolism and Dispersion'', 25 (3): 321-331</ref> Demethylation is catalysed by the enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which generates a metabolite that is known as M-1 in the cerivastatin metabolite pathway. Hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C8, which generates the major active metabolite, M-23.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00439 | title=Cerivastatin}}</ref> M-1 and M-23 are, like cerivastatin, pharmacologically active, with comparable potencies. Combination of the latter leads to another minor metabolite, that is not detectable in plasma, which is also known as M-24. Following a 0.8&nbsp;mg dose of cerivastatin, the mean steady state [[Cmax]] values for cerivastatin, M-1 and M-23 were 12.7, 0.55 and 1.4 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effect is mostly due to the cerivastatin itself.\n\n== Efficacy, toxicity and side effects ==\n=== Efficacy and toxicity ===\nThe inhibitory activity of cerivastatin was compared to that of other statins, specifically lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This comparison was made by determining the IC50 values of each compound. These values were 77 nM, 66 nM and 176 nM for these statins, respectively, while the value for cerivastatin was found to be 1.1 nM.\nUsing Dixon plots, the inhibitory constant of cerivastatin was found to be 1.3 x 10-9 M, which is over 100 times lower than the inhibitory constant of [[lovastatin]], known to be 150 x 10-9 M.\nTo compare cerivastatin activity to that of other statins, its IC25 value was also determined for various types of human smooth muscle cells: cells from the left internal mammary artery (HSMC), cornea fibroblasts (HCF), myoblasts from striated muscle (HM) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The activity in these groups of muscle cells was compared to the activity of the statins listed above, as well as atorvastatin and [[fluvastatin]].\n\nThe pharmacological results from cerivastatin show that it is the most active HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor among reported statins. Due to its high enzyme affinity, it would seem to offer ultra-low dose therapy in the microgram range. However, due to its relatively severe adverse effects in comparison to other statins, its market use was discontinued.\n\nThe strengths of the available cerivastatin medicine ranged from 0.2 - 0.8&nbsp;mg, resulting in an actual dose of 1.9 - 13.1 \u03bcg/kg body weight for which rhabdomyolysis has been reported.<ref>Kalaria, D.; Wassenaar, W.; \"Rhabdomyolysis and cerivastatin: Was it a problem of dose?\" ''CMAJ'' 167 (7), 2002, p. 737</ref> Although the mechanism of the cerivastatin induced myopathy is not exactly known,<ref>Mo\u00dfhammer, D.; Schaeffeler, E.; Schwab, M.; M\u00f6rike, K.; Mechanisms and assessment of statin-related muscular adverse effects ''British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology'' 78(3), 2014, pp. 454\u2013466</ref> the risk increases with statin dose.<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 15572720}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Staffa JA, Chang J, Green L | year = 2002 | title = Cerivastatin and Reports of Fatal Rhabdomyolysis | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = | pages = 539\u2013540 }}</ref><ref>Kalaria, D.; Wassenaar, W.; \"Rhabdomyolysis and cerivastatin: Was it a problem of dose?\" ''CMAJ'' 167 (7), p. 737</ref> This risk also appears to increase among patients who received [[gemfibrozil]]<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Pmid , Psaty BM, Furberg CD, Ray WA, Weiss NS | year = 2004 | title = Potential for conflict of interest in the evaluation of suspected adverse drug reactions: use of cerivastatin and risk of rhabdomyolysis | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 292 | issue = 21| pages = 2622\u201331 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Furberg CD, Pitt B | year = 2001 | title = Withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market | url = | journal = Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med | volume = 2 | issue = 5| pages = 205\u2013207 }}</ref> or lovastatin<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Staffa JA, Chang J, Green L | year = 2002 | title = Cerivastatin and Reports of Fatal Rhabdomyolysis | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = | pages = 539\u2013540 }}</ref> concomitantly, and there is a known interaction between these drugs and cerivastatin.

Those are bile acid sequestrants, nicotinic acid, fibric acid derivatives, [[probucol]] and HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors. Cerivastatin mainly acts by competitively inhibiting HMG-CoA-reductase, which is the rate-limiting enzyme step in cholesterol biosynthesis.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1527-3466.1998.tb00357.x | volume=16 | issue=3 | title=Cerivastatin (BAY w 6228): A Novel HMG-CoA Reductase Inhibitor | year=1998 | journal=Cardiovascular Drug Reviews | pages=236\u2013263 | vauthors=Kuhlmann J, M\u00fcck W, Bischoff H, Keutz E, Llewellyn M}}</ref><ref>[http://www.jlr.org/content/33/11/1569.full.pdf+html], 10.

This also means that the rates subsequent biosynthesis is reduced, since less starting material is available.  Eventually, this will lead to lower cholesterol levels.\n\nThe location of cholesterol biosynthesis and inhibition of HMG-CoA is of significance, since most circulating cholesterol originates from internal production, rather than the diet. If the liver cannot produce more cholesterol, the cholesterol levels in the blood will decrease. Also, HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors cause secondary up-regulation of hepatic LDL receptors, with increased LDL-cholesterol clearance and reduction of both total and LDL cholesterol in the serum.\n\n== Metabolism ==\nCerivastatin is metabolized via the hepatic pathway.<ref>Porter, K.E.; Turner, N.A.; Statins and myocardial remodeling: cell and molecular pathways; expert reviews in molecular medicine, 2011, 13 (22): pp.1-18</ref> ''In vitro'' studies with human liver cells showed that two metabolic pathways are equally important; demethylation of the benzylic methyl ether and hydroxylation at one methyl group of the 6-isopropyl substituent.<ref>[http://www.jlr.org/content/23/3/466.full.pdf+html], Miettinen TA (1982). \"Diurnal variation of cholesterol precursors squalene and methyl sterols in human plasma lipoproteins\" ''The Journal of Lipid Research'' 23: 466-473</ref><ref>[http://dmd.aspetjournals.org/content/dmd/25/3/321.full.pdf], Boberg M, Angerbauer R, Fey P, Kanhai WK, Karl W, Kern A, Ploschke J, Radtke M (1996). \"Metabolism of cerivastatin by human liver microsomes in vitro\". Drug Metabolism and Dispersion, 25 (3): 321-331</ref> Demethylation is catalysed by the enzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4, which generates a metabolite that is known as M-1 in the cerivastatin metabolite pathway. Hydroxylation is catalysed by CYP2C8, which generates the major active metabolite, M-23.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00439 | title=Cerivastatin}}</ref> M-1 and M-23 are, like cerivastatin, pharmacologically active, with comparable potencies. Combination of the latter leads to another minor metabolite, that is not detectable in plasma, which is also known as M-24. Following a 0.8&nbsp;mg dose of cerivastatin, the mean steady state [[Cmax]] values for cerivastatin, M-1 and M-23 were 12.7, 0.55 and 1.4 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Hence, it can be concluded that the cholesterol-lowering effect is mostly due to the cerivastatin itself.\n\n== Efficacy, toxicity and side effects ==\n=== Efficacy and toxicity ===\nThe inhibitory activity of cerivastatin was compared to that of other statins, specifically lovastatin, simvastatin and pravastatin. This comparison was made by determining the IC50 values of each compound. These values were 77 nM, 66 nM and 176 nM for these statins, respectively, while the value for cerivastatin was found to be 1.1 nM.\nUsing Dixon plots, the inhibitory constant of cerivastatin was found to be 1.3 x 10-9 M, which is over 100 times lower than the inhibitory constant of [[lovastatin]], known to be 150 x 10-9 M.\nTo compare cerivastatin activity to that of other statins, its IC25 value was also determined for various types of human smooth muscle cells: cells from the left internal mammary artery (HSMC), cornea fibroblasts (HCF), myoblasts from striated muscle (HM) and umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). The activity in these groups of muscle cells was compared to the activity of the statins listed above, as well as atorvastatin and [[fluvastatin]].\n\nThe pharmacological results from cerivastatin show that it is the most active HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitor among reported statins. Due to its high enzyme affinity, it would seem to offer ultra-low dose therapy in the microgram range. However, due to its relatively severe adverse effects in comparison to other statins, its market use was discontinued.\n\nThe strengths of the available cerivastatin medicine ranged from 0.2 - 0.8&nbsp;mg, resulting in an actual dose of 1.9 - 13.1 \u03bcg/kg body weight for which rhabdomyolysis has been reported.<ref>Kalaria, D.; Wassenaar, W.; \"Rhabdomyolysis and cerivastatin: Was it a problem of dose?\" ''CMAJ'' 167 (7), 2002, p. 737</ref> Although the mechanism of the cerivastatin induced myopathy is not exactly known,<ref>Mo\u00dfhammer, D.; Schaeffeler, E.; Schwab, M.; M\u00f6rike, K.; Mechanisms and assessment of statin-related muscular adverse effects ''British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology'' 78(3), 2014, pp. 454\u2013466</ref> the risk increases with statin dose.<ref>{{PMID|15572720}}, Psaty BM, Furberg CD, Ray WA, Weiss NS (2004). \"Potential for conflict of interest in the evaluation of suspected adverse drug reactions: use of cerivastatin and risk of rhabdomyolysis\" ''JAMA'' 292 (21): 2622\u201331</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Staffa JA, Chang J, Green L | year = 2002 | title = Cerivastatin and Reports of Fatal Rhabdomyolysis | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = | pages = 539\u2013540 }}</ref><ref>Kalaria, D.; Wassenaar, W.; \"Rhabdomyolysis and cerivastatin: Was it a problem of dose?\" ''CMAJ'' 167 (7), 2002, p. 737</ref> This risk also appears to increase among patients who received [[gemfibrozil]]<ref> {{PMID|15572720}} Psaty BM, Furberg CD, Ray WA, Weiss NS (2004). \"Potential for conflict of interest in the evaluation of suspected adverse drug reactions: use of cerivastatin and risk of rhabdomyolysis\" ''JAMA'' 292 (21): 2622\u201331</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Furberg CD, Pitt B | year = 2001 | title = Withdrawal of cerivastatin from the world market | url = | journal = Curr Control Trials Cardiovasc Med | volume = 2 | issue = 5| pages = 205\u2013207 }}</ref> or lovastatin<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Staffa JA, Chang J, Green L | year = 2002 | title = Cerivastatin and Reports of Fatal Rhabdomyolysis | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 346 | issue = | pages = 539\u2013540 }}</ref> concomitantly, and there is a known interaction between these drugs and cerivastatin.

The original versions of the books of the Bible use several different words for alcoholic beverages: at least 10 in [[Hebrew]], and five in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Drunkenness is discouraged and not infrequently portrayed, and some biblical persons abstained from alcohol. Wine is used symbolically, in both positive and negative terms. Its consumption is prescribed for religious rites or medicinal uses in some places.\n\n==Lexigraphy==\nBiblical literature uses several words in its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly the words in the [[Hebrew language]] compared to the words in [[Koine Greek]], the language of both the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament.

Kings were forbidden to abuse alcohol lest their judgments be unjust. It was forbidden to [[priest]]s on duty, though the priests were given \"the finest new wine\" from the first fruits offerings for drinking outside the [[tabernacle]] and temple.\n\nThe [[Nazirite]]s excluded as part of their ascetic regimen not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins, though when Nazirites completed the term of their vow they were required to present wine as part of their sacrificial offerings and could drink of it. While [[John the Baptist]] adopted such a regimen, Jesus did not during his three years of ministry.<ref name=\"RaymondP81\">Raymond p. 81: \"Not only did Jesus Christ Himself use and sanction the use of wine but also ... He saw nothing intrinsically evil in wine.(footnote citing [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11 Mt 15:11])\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Rechabite]]s, a sub-tribe of the [[Kenite]]s, vowed never to drink wine, live in houses, or plant fields or vineyards, not because of any \"threat to wise living\" from the latter [Prov. 20:1] practices, but because of their commitment to a nomadic lifestyle by not being bound to any particular piece of land.<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" /> The Rechabites's strict obedience to the command of their father \"not to drink wine\" [Jer. 35:14] is commended and is contrasted with the failure of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to listen to their God.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his fellow [[Jew]]s abstained from the meat and wine given to them by the king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though precisely how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though it may not have been the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the [[Assyria]]n general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.\n\nChristians are instructed regarding abstinence and their duty toward immature Christians: \"All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.\"<ref>Raymond understands this to mean that \"if an individual by drinking wine either causes others to err through his example or abets a social evil which causes others to succumb to its temptations, then in the interests of Christian love he ought to forego the temporary pleasures of drinking in the interests of heavenly treasures\" (p. 87).</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism and metaphor ===\nThe commonness and centrality of wine in daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible.<ref>Dommershausen, p. 64.</ref><ref>Raymond, p. 24: \"The numerous allusions to the vine and wine in the Old Testament furnish an admirable basis for the study of its estimation among the people at large.\"</ref> Positively, free wine is used as a symbol of [[divine grace]], and wine is repeatedly compared to intimate love in the [[Song of Solomon]]. Negatively, wine is [[personification|personified]] as a mocker (\"[t]he most hardened apostate\" in the Book of Proverbs whose chief sin is pride)<ref>Waltke (2004), p. 114.</ref> and beer a brawler (one who is \"mocking, noisy, and restless\").<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" />\n\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|left|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'' by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]]]]\nAdditionally, the [[chosen people]] and [[kingdom of God]] are compared to a divinely owned vine or vineyard in several places, and the image of new wine being kept in new wineskins, a process that would burst old wineskins, represents that the new faith Jesus was bringing \"cannot be contained within the framework of the old.\"<ref>Browning, p. 395.</ref> The complacent are compared with \"wine left on its dregs\" too long, such that it lacks a good taste and is of no value, and those who are corrupt are compared with excellent wine which has been diluted with water.\n\nWine was also used as a symbol of blessing and judgement throughout the Bible. [[Melchizedek]] blessed and refreshed [[Abraham]]'s army with bread and wine; [[Isaac]] blessed [[Jacob]] by saying, \"May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness \u2013 an abundance of grain and new wine\";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+27%3A28&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 27:28 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when Jacob blessed his sons, he used a great abundance of wine as a symbol of [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]]'s prosperity. The nation of Israel was promised abundant wine and other central crops such as grain and oil<ref>M. S. Miller et al., p. 158f.</ref> if they kept God's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] commandments, and their wine would be taken away as a curse if the Israelites failed to keep the covenant.\n\nDrinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgement and wrath,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+75:8;+Revelation+16:19;+17:2,6;+18:3&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 75:8, Revelation 16:19, Revelation 17:2, Revelation 17:6, Revelation 18:3 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> and Jesus alludes this cup of wrath, which he several times says he himself will drink. Similarly, the winepress is pictured as a tool of judgement where the resulting wine symbolizes the blood of the wicked who were crushed. Connected also to the cup of judgement is the wine of immorality, which the evil drink and which both brings and is part of the wrath of God.\n\n[[File:Parable of the Good Samaritan (detail) by Cornelis van Haarlem.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] showing the Samaritan pouring oil and wine on the injured man's wounds.]]\n\nThe [[Day of the Lord]], which is often understood by Christians to usher in the [[Messianic Age]], is depicted as a time when \"[n]ew wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,\"<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am+9:13;Jl+3:18 Am 9:13; compare Jl 3:18]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=is+27:2;&version=49 Is 27:2 (NAS)]</ref> when God's people will \"plant vineyards and drink their wine,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+9%3A14&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Amos 9:14 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when God himself \"will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine \u2013 the best of meats and the finest of wines.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+25%3A6%2CMatthew+8%3A11%2CMatthew+22%3A2%2CLuke+13%3A29%2CLuke+14%3A15%2CLuke+22%3A28-30%2CRevelation+19%3A9&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 25:6, Matthew 8:11, Matthew 22:2, Luke 13:29, Luke 14:15, Luke 22:28\u201330, Revelation 19:9 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus uses wine at the Last Supper to signify the \"New Covenant in [Jesus'] blood,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A26-29%2CMark+14%3A22-25%2CLuke+22%3A17-20%2C1+Corinthians+10%3A16%2C1+Corinthians+11%3A23-25&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 26:26\u201329, Mark 14:22\u201325, Luke 22:17\u201320, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11:23\u201325 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> but Christians differ over precisely how symbolic the wine is in the continuing ritual of the Eucharist.<ref>Lincoln, p. 848.</ref>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nWine was used in ancient times for various medicinal ends, and the Bible refers to some of these practices.

Advocates of this view, called the \"two-wine\" position, argue that the Greek and Hebrew words rendered \"wine\" in most English versions are generic terms for fruit juices; context determines if the beverage in view is alcoholic or not.  The fact is pointed out that even in earlier stages of the English language, such as in 1611 when the King James Version was translated, \"wine\" could refer to non-alcoholic beverages as well as alcoholic ones.<ref>For example, footnote #7 in the chapter [http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ ''And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit'' in ''The Doctrine of Sanctification'', Thomas Ross, Ph.

Juice does not come \"from the grape\" fermented. Thus, wine had the meaning of unfermented, as well as fermented grape juice. Likewise, John Kersey\u2019s ''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum, or A General English Dictionary'' (1708) declared: \"Wine [is] a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes, or other fruit. Liquor or Liquour, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, etc. Must, sweet Wine, newly press\u2019d from the grape.\" Wine was made of the juice of grapes and must is defined as \"sweet wine, newly pressed from the grape.\" Further, B. N. Defoe\u2019s ''A Complete English Dictionary'' (1735) defined: \"WINE, a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes or other fruit. LIQUOR, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, Water, &c.\" Wine was not defined as fermented drink, but simply \"the juice of grapes.\" Benjamin Martin\u2019s ''Lingua Britannica Reformata, or A New English Dictionary'' (1748) stated: \"WINE, 1. the juice of the grape. 2. a liquor extracted from other fruits besides the grape. 3. the vapours of wine, as wine disturbs his reason. LIQUOR, or LIQUOUR, any liquid thing, as water, juice, drink, etc.\" (pg. 1045). . . . The translators of the KJV, by uniformly rendering the Greek word ''oinos'' as ''wine'', replicated the Greek word\u2019s reference to both fermented and unfermented juice with an English word that, in their day, was similarly general in reference.</ref> The two-wine view is widespread in conservative [[Evangelicalism]].

These were the main products of ancient Palestine, in order of importance. The fruit of the vine was consumed both fresh and dried (raisins), but it was primarily consumed as wine. Wine was, in antiquity, an important food and not just an embellishment to a feast.... Wine was essentially a man's drink in antiquity, when it became a significant dietary component. Even slaves were given a generous wine ration. Scholars estimate that in ancient Rome an adult consumed a liter of wine daily. Even a minimal estimate of 700g. per day means that wine constituted about one quarter of the caloric intake (600 out of 2,500 cal.) and about one third of the minimum required intake of iron.\"</ref> Additionally, the inhabitants of [[Eretz Yisrael|ancient Israel]] drank beer, and wines made from fruits other than grapes, and references to these appear in scripture.<ref name=\"WaltkeP505\">Waltke (2005), p. 505.</ref>\n\nThe word \"Alcohol\" is Arabic; from the root word (Al-Ghawl/Ghul) \"Ghawl\" or \"Ghul\" which translates to Ghoul, Hobgoblin, Bogey(man), Ogre (man eating giant), and Alcohol,.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=auto&tl=en&text=ghawl|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=ar&tl=en&text=%D8%BA%D9%88%D9%84|title=Google Translate|website=translate.google.com}}</ref>  The Qur\u2019an\u2014verse 37:47 uses the Arabic form \"Al-Ghawl\" referring to the intoxication associated with alcohol when in wine.

The references [to drinks that can contain alcohol] in the [New Testament] are very much fewer in number, but once more the good and the bad aspects are equally apparent....\"</ref><ref name=\"RaymondP25\">Raymond, p. 25: \"This favorable view [of wine in the Bible], however, is balanced by an unfavorable estimate.... The reason for the presence of these two conflicting opinions on the nature of wine [is that the] consequences of wine drinking follow its use and not its nature. Happy results ensue when it is drunk in its proper measure and evil results when it is drunk to excess. The nature of wine is indifferent.\"</ref><ref>McClintock and Strong, p. 1016: \"But while liberty to use wine, as well as every other earthly blessing, is conceded and maintained in the Bible, yet all abuse of it is solemnly condemned.\"</ref> The relationships between Judaism and alcohol and Christianity and alcohol have generally maintained this same tension, though some modern Christian sects, particularly American Protestant groups around the time of [[Prohibition]], have rejected alcohol as evil. The original versions of the books of the Bible use several different words for alcoholic beverages: at least 10 in [[Hebrew]], and five in [[Greek language|Greek]]. Drunkenness is discouraged and not infrequently portrayed, and some biblical persons abstained from alcohol. Wine is used symbolically, in both positive and negative terms. Its consumption is prescribed for religious rites or medicinal uses in some places.\n\n==Lexigraphy==\nBiblical literature uses several words in its original languages to refer to different types of alcoholic beverages. Some of these words have overlapping meaning, particularly the words in the [[Hebrew language]] compared to the words in [[Koine Greek]], the language of both the [[Septuagint]] and the New Testament. While some deuterocanonical books may have been originally written in Hebrew or the [[Aramaic language]], some were written in Greek. Hence, the meanings of the words used for alcoholic beverages in each of these languages has bearing on alcohol in the Bible.\n\n=== Hebrew ===\nThe [[Hebrew Bible]] was largely written in [[Biblical Hebrew]], with portions in [[Biblical Aramaic]], and has an important [[Ancient Greek]] translation called the [[Septuagint]]. The modern Hebrew Bible, which generally follows the [[Masoretic Text]], uses several words to represent alcoholic beverages:\n{|border=1 class=\"wikitable\"\n!Hebrew !! Transliteration !!

Kings were forbidden to abuse alcohol lest their judgments be unjust. It was forbidden to [[priest]]s on duty, though the priests were given \"the finest new wine\" from the first fruits offerings for drinking outside the [[tabernacle]] and temple.\n\nThe [[Nazirite]]s excluded as part of their ascetic regimen not only wine, but also vinegar, grapes, and raisins, though when Nazirites completed the term of their vow they were required to present wine as part of their sacrificial offerings and could drink of it. While [[John the Baptist]] adopted such a regimen, Jesus did not during his three years of ministry.<ref name=\"RaymondP81\">Raymond p. 81: \"Not only did Jesus Christ Himself use and sanction the use of wine but also ... He saw nothing intrinsically evil in wine.(footnote citing [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mt+15:11 Mt 15:11])\"</ref>\n\nThe [[Rechabite]]s, a sub-tribe of the [[Kenite]]s, vowed never to drink wine, live in houses, or plant fields or vineyards, not because of any \"threat to wise living\" from the latter [Prov. 20:1] practices, but because of their commitment to a nomadic lifestyle by not being bound to any particular piece of land.<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" /> The Rechabites's strict obedience to the command of their father \"not to drink wine\" [Jer. 35:14] is commended and is contrasted with the failure of [[Jerusalem]] and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] to listen to their God.\n\nDuring the [[Babylonian captivity]], [[Daniel (biblical figure)|Daniel]] and his fellow [[Jew]]s abstained from the meat and wine given to them by the king because they saw it as defiling in some way, though precisely how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though it may not have been the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the [[Assyria]]n general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.\n\nChristians are instructed regarding abstinence and their duty toward immature Christians: \"All food is clean, but it is wrong for a man to eat anything that causes someone else to stumble. It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or to do anything else that will cause your brother to fall.\"<ref>Raymond understands this to mean that \"if an individual by drinking wine either causes others to err through his example or abets a social evil which causes others to succumb to its temptations, then in the interests of Christian love he ought to forego the temporary pleasures of drinking in the interests of heavenly treasures\" (p. 87).</ref>\n\n=== Symbolism and metaphor ===\nThe commonness and centrality of wine in daily life in biblical times is apparent from its many positive and negative metaphorical uses throughout the Bible.<ref>Dommershausen, p. 64.</ref><ref>Raymond, p. 24: \"The numerous allusions to the vine and wine in the Old Testament furnish an admirable basis for the study of its estimation among the people at large.\"</ref> Positively, free wine is used as a symbol of [[divine grace]], and wine is repeatedly compared to intimate love in the [[Song of Solomon]]. Negatively, wine is [[personification|personified]] as a mocker (\"[t]he most hardened apostate\" in the Book of Proverbs whose chief sin is pride)<ref>Waltke (2004), p. 114.</ref> and beer a brawler (one who is \"mocking, noisy, and restless\").<ref name=\"WaltkeP127\" />\n\n[[File:Meeting of abraham and melchizadek.jpg|thumb|left|''Meeting of Abraham and Melchizedek'' by [[Dirk Bouts|Dieric Bouts the Elder]]]]\nAdditionally, the [[chosen people]] and [[kingdom of God]] are compared to a divinely owned vine or vineyard in several places, and the image of new wine being kept in new wineskins, a process that would burst old wineskins, represents that the new faith Jesus was bringing \"cannot be contained within the framework of the old.\"<ref>Browning, p. 395.</ref> The complacent are compared with \"wine left on its dregs\" too long, such that it lacks a good taste and is of no value, and those who are corrupt are compared with excellent wine which has been diluted with water.\n\nWine was also used as a symbol of blessing and judgement throughout the Bible. [[Melchizedek]] blessed and refreshed [[Abraham]]'s army with bread and wine; [[Isaac]] blessed [[Jacob]] by saying, \"May God give you of heaven's dew and of earth's richness \u2013 an abundance of grain and new wine\";<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+27%3A28&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Genesis 27:28 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when Jacob blessed his sons, he used a great abundance of wine as a symbol of [[Judah (biblical figure)|Judah]]'s prosperity. The nation of Israel was promised abundant wine and other central crops such as grain and oil<ref>M. S. Miller et al., p. 158f.</ref> if they kept God's [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] commandments, and their wine would be taken away as a curse if the Israelites failed to keep the covenant.\n\nDrinking a cup of strong wine to the dregs and getting drunk are sometimes presented as a symbol of God's judgement and wrath,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+75:8;+Revelation+16:19;+17:2,6;+18:3&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Psalm 75:8, Revelation 16:19, Revelation 17:2, Revelation 17:6, Revelation 18:3 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2016-11-06}}</ref> and Jesus alludes this cup of wrath, which he several times says he himself will drink. Similarly, the winepress is pictured as a tool of judgement where the resulting wine symbolizes the blood of the wicked who were crushed. Connected also to the cup of judgement is the wine of immorality, which the evil drink and which both brings and is part of the wrath of God.\n\n[[File:Parable of the Good Samaritan (detail) by Cornelis van Haarlem.jpg|thumb|Detail from ''The Good Samaritan'' by [[Cornelis van Haarlem]] showing the Samaritan pouring oil and wine on the injured man's wounds.]]\n\nThe [[Day of the Lord]], which is often understood by Christians to usher in the [[Messianic Age]], is depicted as a time when \"[n]ew wine will drip from the mountains and flow from all the hills,\"<ref>[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Am+9:13;Jl+3:18 Am 9:13; compare Jl 3:18]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=is+27:2;&version=49 Is 27:2 (NAS)]</ref> when God's people will \"plant vineyards and drink their wine,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Amos+9%3A14&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Amos 9:14 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> and when God himself \"will prepare a feast of rich food for all peoples, a banquet of aged wine \u2013 the best of meats and the finest of wines.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+25%3A6%2CMatthew+8%3A11%2CMatthew+22%3A2%2CLuke+13%3A29%2CLuke+14%3A15%2CLuke+22%3A28-30%2CRevelation+19%3A9&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Isaiah 25:6, Matthew 8:11, Matthew 22:2, Luke 13:29, Luke 14:15, Luke 22:28\u201330, Revelation 19:9 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref>\n\nIn the New Testament, Jesus uses wine at the Last Supper to signify the \"New Covenant in [Jesus'] blood,\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+26%3A26-29%2CMark+14%3A22-25%2CLuke+22%3A17-20%2C1+Corinthians+10%3A16%2C1+Corinthians+11%3A23-25&version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 26:26\u201329, Mark 14:22\u201325, Luke 22:17\u201320, 1 Corinthians 10:16, 1 Corinthians 11:23\u201325 \u2013 New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}</ref> but Christians differ over precisely how symbolic the wine is in the continuing ritual of the Eucharist.<ref>Lincoln, p. 848.</ref>\n\n===Medicinal uses===\nWine was used in ancient times for various medicinal ends, and the Bible refers to some of these practices. It was likely used as an anesthetic to dull pain, and many interpreters suggest that it was in this capacity that wines were offered to Jesus at his [[crucifixion]].<ref name=\"HenryProv31\"/><ref name=\"Seesemann, p. 164\"/>\n\nIn the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]], Jesus tells a story about a man from [[Samaria]] who assists an injured man by, among other things, pouring oil and wine on his wounds. Oil mixed with wine was a common remedy in the ancient world to cleanse wounds and assuage their pain.<ref>[http://www.ewordtoday.com/comments/luke/gill/luke10.htm ''John Gill's Exposition of the Bible''] Classic Bible Commentaries</ref>\n\nPaul advises [[Saint Timothy|Timothy]] that he should not drink water only, but should use a little wine for the sake of his stomach and frequent infirmities.

Advocates of this view, called the \"two-wine\" position, argue that the Greek and Hebrew words rendered \"wine\" in most English versions are generic terms for fruit juices; context determines if the beverage in view is alcoholic or not.  The fact is pointed out that even in earlier stages of the English language, such as in 1611 when the King James Version was translated, \"wine\" could refer to non-alcoholic beverages as well as alcoholic ones.<ref>For example, footnote #7 in the chapter [http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ ''And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit'' in ''The Doctrine of Sanctification'', Thomas Ross, Ph. D. dissertation, Great Plains Baptist Divinity School, 2014] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108014156/http://faithsaves.net/drunk-wine-wherein-excess-filled-spirit-ephesians-518/ |date=2014-11-08 }}, notes: \"Bailey\u2019s ''New Universal English Dictionary of Words, and of Arts and Sciences'' (1730) stated: \"Natural wine, is such as it comes from the grape, without any mixture or sophistication.\" (pg. 658). Juice does not come \"from the grape\" fermented. Thus, wine had the meaning of unfermented, as well as fermented grape juice. Likewise, John Kersey\u2019s ''Dictionarium Anglo-Britannicum, or A General English Dictionary'' (1708) declared: \"Wine [is] a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes, or other fruit. Liquor or Liquour, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, etc. Must, sweet Wine, newly press\u2019d from the grape.\" Wine was made of the juice of grapes and must is defined as \"sweet wine, newly pressed from the grape.\" Further, B. N. Defoe\u2019s ''A Complete English Dictionary'' (1735) defined: \"WINE, a Liquor made of the Juice of Grapes or other fruit. LIQUOR, anything that is liquid: Drink, Juice, Water, &c.\" Wine was not defined as fermented drink, but simply \"the juice of grapes.\" Benjamin Martin\u2019s ''Lingua Britannica Reformata, or A New English Dictionary'' (1748) stated: \"WINE, 1. the juice of the grape. 2. a liquor extracted from other fruits besides the grape. 3. the vapours of wine, as wine disturbs his reason. LIQUOR, or LIQUOUR, any liquid thing, as water, juice, drink, etc.\" (pg. 1045). . . . The translators of the KJV, by uniformly rendering the Greek word ''oinos'' as ''wine'', replicated the Greek word\u2019s reference to both fermented and unfermented juice with an English word that, in their day, was similarly general in reference.</ref> The two-wine view is widespread in conservative [[Evangelicalism]]. Dr. Robert Teachout, a fundamental Baptist seminary professor, argued for this position in his doctoral dissertation ''The Use of \"Wine\" in the Old Testament.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faithsaves.net/use-wine-old-testament-robert-teachout/|title=The Use of \"Wine\" in the Old Testament, by Robert Teachout Faith Saves|first=Thomas|last=Ross|date=November 27, 2013}}</ref>  Separatist Baptist support for a Biblical total abstinence position is widespread.<ref>E. g., http://kentbrandenburg.blogspot.com/2009/12/not-given-to-much-wine-and-abstaining.html</ref>   Other sources for this view include the [[Purified Translation of the Bible]], where extensive footnotes are used to promote the idea, and the 19th century ''Temperance Bible Commentary''.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/temperancebible01burngoog|title=The Temperance Bible-commentary: Giving at One View, Version, Criticism, and Exposition, in Regard to All Passages of Holy Writ Bearing on 'wine' and 'strong Drink,' Or Illustrating the Principles of the Temperance Reformation|first1=Frederic Richard|last1=Lees|first2=Dawson|last2=Burns|date=August 13, 1868|publisher=S.W.
