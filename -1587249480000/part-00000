Unlike the major league level, where hitters have the ability to drive the ball into the outfield in all directions, most little league batters are unable to hit the ball out of the infield with any regularity.

In its heyday, it was the largest in Australia, the second largest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (after [[Trams in London|London]]), and one of the largest in the world. The network was heavily worked, with about 1,600 cars in service at any one time at its peak during the 1930s (cf. about 500 [[trams in Melbourne]] today).\nPatronage peaked in 1945 at 405 million passenger journeys. Its maximum street trackage totalled 291&nbsp;km (181 miles) in 1923.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early tramways===\n[[File:Horsedrawn tram which ran between Newtown Station and St Peters.jpg|thumb|left|Horsedrawn tram which ran between [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] stations, c1894]]\n\nSydney's first tram was horse-drawn, running from the [[Redfern railway station|old Sydney railway station]] to [[Circular Quay]] along [[Pitt Street]].<ref name=tram>''The 1861 Pitt Street Tramway and the Contemporary Horse Drawn Railway Proposals'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], February, 1965 pp21-32</ref>\n\nBuilt in 1861, the design was compromised by the desire to haul railway freight wagons along the line to supply city businesses and return cargo from the docks at Circular Quay with passenger traffic as an afterthought.\n\nThis resulted in a track that protruded from the road surface and it caused damage to the wheels of wagons trying to cross it. Hard campaigning by competing [[bus|Horse Omnibus]] owners \u2013 as well as a fatal accident involving the leading Australian musician [[Isaac Nathan]] in 1864 \u2013 led to closure in 1866.\n\nIn 1879 a steam tramway was established in conjunction with the upcoming [[Sydney International Exhibition]] that was to be held in the Domain/Botanical Gardens area of Sydney.<ref>''The Inauguration of Sydney's Steam Tramways'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], March, 1969 pp49-59</ref> Originally planned by the government to be removed after the exhibition, the success of the steam tramway led to the system being expanded rapidly through the city and inner suburbs during the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nThe [[Sydney Steam Motor Tram|Steam Trams]] in Sydney comprised a [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] [[locomotive]] hauling one or more trailers of either single deck or double deck construction.\n\nPreserved Sydney Steam Trams are Motor 1A, owned by the [[Powerhouse Museum]] and is usually stored at the \"Discovery Centre\" at [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], however it is currently on loan to the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at Loftus NSW (currently non-operational),<ref>\"Anniversary of the closure of the Kogarah steam tramway and the opening of the Trolleybus system\" [https://www.sydneytramwaymuseum.com.au/tramfans/anniversary-of-the-closure-of-the-kogarah-steam-tramway-and-the-opening-of-the-trolleybus-system/]</ref> Motor 100A (operational) at the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], [[Auckland]] New Zealand as it was sold to Wanganui Tramways in 1910 and Motor 103A which operates with a former trailer car 93B at [[Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum|Valley Heights Rail Museum]] after previously being at Parramatta Park.\n\nTwo cable tram routes were also built in Sydney. The first route ran from King Street Wharf on the eastern side of Darling Harbour to Ocean Street [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]]. The second route from the original Milsons Point ferry wharf in [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] to Falcon Street North Sydney that was later extended to [[Crows Nest, New South Wales|Crows Nest]]. Constitution of lines north of harbour were due to the steep terrain involved from Milsons Point to North Sydney.<ref>''The Cable Trams of Sydney and the experiments leading to final electrification of the Tramways'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], July/August, 1974 pp145-168/190-192</ref> Cable Trailer 23 is preserved at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at Loftus NSW.\n\nAdditionally, horse trams operated between [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] railway stations in the 1890s and between [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and [[North Manly]] from 1903 to 1907. \nHowever these two instances, the operation of horse tram services were acting as replacements for the existing steam trams services on these lines due to the low patronage during the indicated years.\n\n===Electrification===\n[[File:George Street near Hunter Street, Sydney from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|right|C Class trams on [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]]]]\nThe Sydney tram power supply system was built using [[New York City]] subway electrical equipment that was adapted for tram usage.

Sydney, the largest city in Australia, once had the largest tram system in Australia, the second largest in the Commonwealth (after London), and one of the largest in the world. In the early 1960s the entire network was dismantled.]</ref>\n\nElectrification started in 1898, and most of the system was converted by 1910. An exception was the privately owned [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881<ref>{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Martha |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040535b.htm |title=Biography \u2013 Charles Edward Jeanneret|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> to [[Parramatta ferry wharf|Redbank Wharf]] (Duck River) where the steam tram<ref>''The Parramatta Wharf Tramway'' Matthews, H.H. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1958 pp181-199</ref> remained until 1943 which was operate by the Sydney Ferries Ltd.\n\nAfter experimentation with 3 trams all fitted with different equipment from different manufacturers, full-time services began with [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C-class]] saloon cars, followed by [[Sydney D-Class Tram|D-class]] combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and saloon cars, Sydney started by going the other way. Footboard trams continued to be introduced, notably the single truck [[Sydney E-Class Tram|E-class]] (that ran in a permanently coupled set), [[Sydney J-Class Tram|J-class]] and the [[Sydney K-Class Tram|K-class]], and the more famous  [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O-class]], O/P-class, [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P-class]] and [[Sydney F-Class Tram|L/P-class]] bogie trams that required the conductor to collect fares from the footboard running along the side of the tram, as they had no corridor through the middle connecting each compartment.\n\nRevered though footboard trams were for the number of passengers they could move, they were deathtraps for the conductors working them. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the footboard by passing motor vehicles as they became more popular. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways.<ref>''The Mercury'', 19 June 1926, p. 3.</ref> From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents to tram employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding.  63 of the falls were fatal.<ref name=\"The Sydney Morning Herald 1934, p. 13\">''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 25 April 1934, p. 13.</ref>  Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries.<ref>''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 June 1920, p.13; 25 April 1921, p. 7; 1 Dec. 1933, p. 11; 26 Nov. 1936, p. 12; 20 September 1946, p. 4; 25 May 1949, p. 5 (examples)</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1933 with the introduction of [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R-class]] tram 1938 that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, footboard trams continued in wide use until the very late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.<ref name=\"The Sydney Morning Herald 1934, p. 13\"/>\n\nA part from the G, H and M classes, one of every electric tram class (and in some cases 2 or more) have been preserved by the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at [[Loftus, New South Wales|Loftus]] NSW.\n\n===Demise and closure===\n[[File:Last day of trams, covered in graffiti, Rural Bank tram stop, corner Martin Place and Elizabeth Street, Sydney, 25 February 1961 - unknown photographer (21264008773).jpg |thumb|right|Last day of trams, covered in graffiti, Rural Bank tram stop, corner [[Martin Place]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]], 25 February 1961]]\nBy the 1920s, the system had reached its maximum extent. In many ways, the Sydney tram system was a victim of its own success. The overcrowded and heaving trams running at a high frequency, in competition with growing private motor car and bus use, ended up being blamed for the congestion caused by the latter.\n\nCompetition from the private car and unregulated private bus operators created the perception of traffic congestion which began the gradual closure of lines from the late 1930s.\n\nMaterial shortages and lack of funding caused by the Second World War had caused the system to become rundown from poor maintenance. The perception of the government was that the financial cost of upgrading infrastructure and purchasing new trams would bankrupt the state.\n\nThis led to the government's calling on overseas transport experts to advise the city on its post-war transport issues, and this led to the recommendation that closure of the system was the best option for the state of NSW.\n\nClosure was supported by the [[NRMA]] <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-12/sydneys-original-tram-network-what-happened-curious-sydney/9610328</ref>(who stood to gain from increased membership) but generally went against public opinion as most of the patronage were those who could not afford to purchase private transportation.\n\nNevertheless, closure became government policy in the early 1950s and the system was wound down in stages, with withdrawal of the services completed on 25 February 1961 when R1 class tram 1995 returned from [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]] to Randwick Workshops just before 4:40pm on 25 February 1961, which was driven by Jerry Valek, a Czechoslovakian man from Annandale.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/in-1961-sydney-motorists-were-happy-to-see-the-trams-go-20151027-gkjhui.html</ref><ref>https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/shooting-through-sydney-tram</ref><ref>https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/from-the-archives-sydney-takes-a-final-tram-ride-20190220-p50z48.html</ref><ref>South Pacific Electric Railway Society</ref><ref>NSW State Government Archives</ref>\n\nIt was alleged after the tramways were closed that were many other influences on the government to close down the system. These allegedly came from the rubber and petrol industries, motor vehicle (bus) manufacturers and those opposed to increased public expenditure. The allegations had some elements based on the [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] that occurred in the USA due to the use of \"overseas experts\".\n\n==City Service==\n\n===Circular Quay to Central Station===\n[[File:Approach to Central Railway, 1900.jpg|thumb|The approach to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]], about 1912 with a coupled set of E class trams climbing to the colonnade. Pitt street lines can be seen to the Right of the image.]]\nThis was an extremely busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains at [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]], particularly prior to the opening of the city underground railway lines in 1926. Trams operated from Central station across Eddy Avenue, along [[Castlereagh Street]] via Bligh, Bent and Loftus Streets to Alfred Street [[Circular Quay]] and returned via [[Pitt Street]] in a large anti-clockwise loop. The tram lines down Pitt and Castlereagh streets closed on 27 September 1957.\n\nThese tracks were also used as the city route for some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods as opposed to Elizabeth Street. The services could also be short worked via Bent and Spring Streets at times when Circular Quay was busy or unavailable.\n\nThe sandstone viaduct onto the colonnade at Central station were built across Eddy Avenue for this service, and are being used again today by trams of a sort in the form of the [[Inner West Light Rail]] system, however they are operating in the opposite direction.\n\n==Eastern Suburbs Lines==\n[[File:eastern trams.png|thumb|right|250px|Eastern Suburbs Lines map]]\n[[Circular Quay]] was the focal terminal point of most services to the eastern suburbs, and allowed easy transfer to [[Sydney Ferries Limited|ferries]]. For many years, 27 regular services operated from Circular Quay. A number of full-time services also operated from a secondary terminus at [[Railway Square]].\n\n===Watsons Bay Line===\nThe [[Rushcutters Bay Tram Depot]], which served this line, was located on New South Head Road at Rushcutters Bay on the north side of the road.\n\nThis line, which was first laid down as a cable tramway,  began at a loop at the corner of Erskine and Day Streets near [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard station]] then proceeded south down Day Street, turning left into [[King Street, Sydney|King Street]]. It then proceeded down King Street, crossing four other busy lines ([[George Street, Sydney|George]], [[Pitt Street|Pitt]], [[Castlereagh Street|Castlereagh]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]]). The intersection of King Street and George Street was the busiest in Sydney, with a tram crossing in either of the 4 directions every 8 seconds during the peak travel hours.\n\nIt then passed through Queen's Square at [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]], then swung right into [[College Street, Sydney|College Street]], heading south past [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral]], then turning left into Boomerang Street. The line then swung left into [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] and proceeded down William Street to [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|King's Cross]], before heading into [[Bayswater Road, Sydney|Bayswater Road]] where the line ran east before turning into [[New South Head Road]] at [[Rushcutters Bay]] running on to Ocean Street Edgecliff.\n\nThe line after Ocean Street Edgecliff then followed the course of New South Head Road through [[Double Bay]], [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] and operated as an isolated electric tramway from October 1898 until January 1905 when electric services were extend to the Erskine Street terminus and the cable tramway was closed.\n\nAfter 1905, the line was extended along Dover Road to the Signal Station at [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]]. From the signal station a single track passed  through the parkland area known as \"The Gap\" through narrow rock cuttings, low cliffs and rugged back-drops, twisting and turning its way down to the terminus at [[Watsons Bay]].\n\nThe line reached [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]] in 1894, and Watsons Bay in 1909.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4309674 Drain Grate, Rose Bay]. Heritage, Roads and Traffic Authority. Accessed 22 August 2007.</ref> In 1949 the line from Rose Bay to Watsons Bay closed, but reopened in 1950 due to public protest. This then lead to policy being adopted that when a line was closed, infrastructure such as overhead wires and tracks had to be removed within 24 hours after the last tram to prevent services being reinstated.\n\nIn 1950, the line down King Street to Erskine Street closed and a new terminus constructed at Queens Square. The remainder of the line closed in July 1960. This line had its own depot and city terminus and operated independently, although was connected to the main system. The tram line followed the present-day [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] route 324,<ref>[http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/8293/Gap_Park,_History_of.pdf Gap History] Wollahra Council</ref>\n\n===Woolloomooloo Line===\nThis line branched off from [[Park Street, Sydney|Park Street]] near College Street and ran north along Haig Avenue, Lincoln Crescent (renamed Sir John Young Crescent), Cowper Street, Forbes Street, Challis Steps [[Woolloomooloo]]. Through service ran from [[Circular Quay]] via [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]] and Park Street. The line opened in stages between 1915 and 1918.\n\nThe last extension of the line in 1918 was constructed during the First World War to assist in troop movements to and from overseas battle. [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C-Class trams 31 and 44]] were specially fitter with stretcher bearers to assist with the troop movements and were used on this extension.\n\nThe line was an early closure, when on 28 January 1935, the line was replaced by a bus service from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] which avoided the previous line through the city.\n\n===North Bondi via Bondi Junction and Bondi Beach Line===\nServices operated from either [[Circular Quay]] (via [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]] Streets) or [[Railway Square]] (via Elizabeth and [[Liverpool Street, Sydney|Liverpool]] Streets), to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]]. \nThe line then passed down Oxford Street to [[Bondi Junction]], where it branched off from Bronte services, to run down [[Bondi Road]] to Fletcher Street, [[Bondi Beach#Commercial area|Campbell Parade]] and then to the [[North Bondi]] tram terminus.\n\nA feature of this line was the large three track terminus cut into a hillside at North Bondi, which opened in 1946. \nThe line opened in 1884 as a steam tramway to Bondi, then to [[Bondi Beach]] in 1894, and to [[North Bondi, New South Wales|North Bondi]] in 1929.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16531427|title=BONDI TRAMS.|date=1929-02-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-07-07|pages=17}}</ref> Electric services commenced in 1902.

E, O and P class trams can be seen. The trams on the left were for the Western Suburbs via George Street, while trams on the right were for the Eastern Suburbs via Elizabeth Street.]]\nHeading south down [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] from [[Circular Quay]], the line turned left into [[Park Street, Sydney|Park Street]], then wound through [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]] via a right turn into Yurong Street, a left turn into Stanley Street, a right turn into Bourke Street, then a left turn into Burton Street.\n\nA spur line existed linking Burton Street to the prisoners entrance on Forbes Street at the rear of the Darlinghurst Courthouse. This was to allow prisoners to be transferred from [[Long Bay Correctional Centre|Long Bay Gaol]] or elsewhere by tram to Darlinghurst Courthouse.<ref>[East Sydney Technical College, Court and Old Gaol 1 Jan 1933 ~1 Jan 1933 Archives of City of Sydney http://tools.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AI2/Entity.aspx?Path=\\Item\\4011]</ref> Tram 948 was especially built on a N class frame for this purpose and survives at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]].\n\nA feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Avenue and Boundary Street in [[Darlinghurst]] as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct is now a road bridge.\n\nThe line then twisted down Glenmore, Gurner and Hargrave Streets in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], then Moncur and Queen Streets in [[Woollahra]]. Here, a connection to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] allowed access to [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley Tram Depot]].\n\nThe line then travelled down Edgecliff and Victoria Roads, then wound along Birriga Road in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], finally running down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction line on [[Bondi Beach#Commercial area|Campbell Parade]], to the [[North Bondi]] terminus.\n\nThe line was double track throughout with numerous points to allow short working. Services operated from Circular Quay via Elizabeth Street and Park Street. The line opened to Bellevue Hill in 1909, and to Bondi Beach in 1914. The line was cut back to Ocean Street, Woollahra in 1955; the remainder closed on 27 June 1959. The line followed approximately the current route of State Transit' route 389 between the city and Woollahra and route X84 between Woollahra and Bondi Beach.\n\n===Bronte Line===\nThis line branched from the North Bondi via Bondi Junction line at [[Bondi Junction]], running down Bronte Road and MacPherson Street to [[Bronte, New South Wales|Bronte Beach]]. A feature of this line was the final approach to Bronte Beach in a rock cutting parallel to the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nThe line opened to Waverley in 1890, then to Bronte in 1911. Electric services started to [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]] in 1902, then Bronte in 1911. Through services ran from [[Circular Quay]] or [[Railway Square]]. The line was closed in the early hours of 28 February 1960, the same day as the Bondi via Oxford Street line, and replaced by a bus service, with Bondi Junction route 379 following the route.\n\n===Clovelly Line===\nThe line branched from the line to [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] at Darley Road in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]]. It ran north along Darley Road, then turned right into Clovelly Road to run down to its terminus at [[Clovelly, New South Wales|Clovelly Beach]].\n\nThe line opened from Darley Road to the intersection of Clovelly and Carrington Roads in 1912, then to Clovelly in 1913. Though services ran from [[Circular Quay]] and from [[Railway Square]] (from 1923). The line closed on 27 September 1957 in conjunction with the closure of the Pitt and Castlereagh street lines on the same day as the Clovelly trams used these streets in the city. The tram line followed the current route of State Transit route 339.\n\n===Coogee Line===\nThis line branched from [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] at Alison Road, and ran on its own tram reservation beside [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]] as far as Darley Road.\n\nIt then ran, first alongside, then later along King Street beside the [[Randwick Bus Depot|Randwick Tramway Workshops]], then ran in its own reservation to Belmore Road.\n\nIt then ran down Perouse Road, St Pauls Street, Carr Street and Arden Street before terminating in a [[balloon loop]] in Dolphin Street, [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee Beach]].\n\nIt ran through several small tram reservations on its way down from Randwick to the beach. The line from the city to [[Randwick Racecourse]] opened in 1880, the first suburban extension of the system.\n\nIt was extended to High Street, Randwick in 1881 (in which year the Randwick Tramway Workshops also opened) and to Coogee in 1883, and electric services were introduced in 1902.\n\nThe line closed in October 1960. It follows the current route of State Transit route 373.\n\n===La Perouse Line===\n[[File:Kings Cross Sydney 1950.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] 1950 with an R1 class tram returning from Watson's Bay to Queens Square.]]\nThe La Perouse line was the second longest of the Sydney system (when at maximum extent) and was the last line (along with the Maroubra Line) to close.\n\nThis line branched from [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] at [[Taylor Square]] in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] to run south along Flinders Street, then onto its own tram reservation along the eastern side of [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] beside [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]]. The section of this line from the city as far as Alison Road began life in 1880 as the first suburban extension to Randwick (see Coogee Line). It contained what was probably the world's first use of a balloon loop for tramways, built in Moore Park in 1881. The Sydney system made extensive use of loops.\n\nFrom Alison Road, the La Perouse Line proceeded down the centre of Anzac Parade through [[Maroubra Junction]], and [[Malabar, New South Wales|Malabar]] to its balloon loop terminus at [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]]. At Malabar a single line branched off to serve [[Long Bay Correctional Centre|Long Bay Gaol]]. The line was double track throughout. In 1934 the fourth section of the La Perouse tramline was built to [[Bunnerong Power Station]] in [[Matraville]] to encourage residential and industrial growth in the area.\n\nThe line was built in stages from 1900 to 1902. It was the final line to close on 25 February 1961. The line followed the current route of State Transit route L94/394.\n\n===Maroubra Line===\nThis line branched off the line to La Perouse at the intersection of [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] and Maroubra Road, travelling east along Maroubra Road, Cooper Street (now Mons Avenue), French Street and Mons Avenue before terminating in a balloon loop in Marine Parade, [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra Beach]].\n\nThe line was double track throughout, and passed through several tram reservations on its descent down to the beach. Direct services operated from [[Circular Quay]] and [[Railway Square]].\n\nThe line opened from Anzac Parade to Maroubra Beach in 1921, and was the second last line to close on 25 February 1961 (followed by the La Perouse line). The line followed the current route of State Transit route 397.\n\n===Cross Country Line (Bondi Junction to Coogee)===\nThis line branched off Bronte Road at [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]] and travelled south down Albion Street and Frenchmans Road, then via Frances and Cook Streets to join the Coogee line at Belmore Road in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]].\n\nThe line was single track throughout, with a passing loop on Frenchmans Road. Initially services ran from the junction at Albion Street in Wavelery to Randwick only, this was later extended to [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] in 1907.\n\nFrom 1910, through services operated from [[Bondi Beach]] to Coogee Beach, and later additionally from [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley Tram Depot]] to Coogee Beach.\n\nThe line opened as a steam tramway in 1887, and was electrified in 1902. It closed in 1954, replaced by bus route 313.\n\n===West Kensington via Surry Hills Line===\nThis line branched from the tramlines in [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] and ran down [[Crown Street, Sydney|Crown Street]] to [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], then south along Baptist Street to Phillip Street, where it swung left into Crescent Street before running south along Dowling Street.\n\nIt passed the [[Dowling Street Tram Depot]], then turned left into Todman Avenue where it terminated at [[Kensington, New South Wales|West Kensington]]. Services operated full-time from [[Circular Quay]], and to [[Railway Square]] in peak hours.\n\nThe line opened in 1881 down Crown Street as far as Cleveland Street as a steam tramway.\n\nIt was extended to Phillip Street in 1909, Todman Avenue in 1912, and then to its final terminus down Todman Avenue in 1937.\n\nThe line down Crown Street closed in 1957, the remainder stayed open until 1961 to allow access to the Dowling Street Depot.\n\nState Transit routes 301, 302 and 303 generally follow the route down Crown and Baptist Streets as far as Phillip Street.\n\n===Botany via Railway Square Line===\n[[File:Trams and traffic at Railway Square.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Railway Square]] tram interchange circa 1930. L, N and O Class trams can be seen. The waiting shed in this photo has been preserved by the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]]]]\n\nServices operated from [[Circular Quay]] initially via [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]]s, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regent Streets, to Botany Street in [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]].\n\nA single-track connection along Bourke and O'Dea Streets joined at the present day [[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]], allowing access to the [[Dowling Street Tram Depot]].\n\nThe line then passed down the entire length of Botany Road to [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]]. In [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], a branch led to the former [[Ascot Racecourse, Sydney|Ascot Racecourse]] at the site of [[Sydney Airport]].\n\nPoints were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] for short working. The line was double track throughout.\n\nFrom [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]], a single-track line crossed the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Botany Goods railway]] at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former [[Bunnerong Power Station]] to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single track section between Botany and La Perouse.\n\nThis single-track line was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line opened in 1882 as a steam tramway to Botany, and electric services commenced in 1903.\n\nThe line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany closed in 1960. State Transit route 309 generally follows the route.\n\n===Alexandria Line===\nThis line branched from the Botany line at the junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]].\n\nThe line proceeded down Erskineville Oval for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known as an extension of Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the [[Princes Highway]] near [[St Peters railway station]].\n\nServices operated from [[Circular Quay]] in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction.\n\nThe line opened in 1902 as a single-track electric line, duplicated in 1910. It was closed in 1959. State Transit route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.\n\n===Henderson Road (Erskineville) Line===\n[[File:Botany Rd Mascot. Australia early 1900s.jpg|thumb|300px|Botany Road, Mascot, collision between a truck and an [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O-class tram]]. The gas pump and women's fashions suggest the early-mid 1940s]]\nThis short line branched from the Alexandria line tracks at the corner of Henderson and Mitchell Roads in [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]] and passed along Henderson Road to Park Street in [[Erskineville]], and later to Bridge Street adjacent to [[Erskineville railway station]]. Services operated from [[Circular Quay]].\n\nThe line was an electrified single track throughout. The line opened to Park Street in 1906 and to Bridge Street in 1909. The line was an early closure, in 1933. It was replaced by a private bus service that no longer operates.\n\n===Rosebery Line===\nThis line opened in 1902 initially via Chalmers and Redfern Streets and south along [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] to [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]. In 1924, the line was extended to Epsom Road in [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]].\n\nIn 1948, to facilitate construction of the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line]], a new line was constructed down Elizabeth Street between Devonshire Street and Redfern Street and the route was deviated to run down this new section.\n\nThe line was electrified double track throughout. The line was closed in 1957.\n\n===Daceyville Line===\nThis line branched from the Botany Road line at Gardners Road, and passed east along Gardners Road to join the lines at [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] at what was known as [[Daceyville, New South Wales|Daceyville]] Junction. It included a large collection of sidings at the former Rosebery Racecourse, now the site of The Lakes Golf Course. The full line opened in 1913, with services from [[Circular Quay]] via [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]]. Some services were extended to [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra Beach]] via the Anzac Parade lines. The line closed in 1957.\n\n==Western Lines==\nThe Western Lines, also known as \"The Red Lines\" after the colour of the destination symbols and \"The George Street Lines\" (as they ran down [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] to Circular Quay), originated the majority of services from [[Fort Macquarie]] and [[Circular Quay]] down [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] to various destinations. In the peak hours and other busy periods, supplementary services operated from [[Railway Square]]. The 1920s were seen as a boom period. with up to 200 trams in use on lines to [[Leichardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]], [[Drummoyne]], [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]], [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]], [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]. The tram lines to Glebe Point, Balmain (Gladstone Park), [[Lilyfield]], Leichhardt and [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] were closed in November 1958.\n\n===Abbotsford via Leichhardt and Five Dock===\n[[File:Rozelle Tram Depot (5515644489).jpg|thumb|[[Rozelle Tram Depot]], 1919. Upon closure of the [[Ultimo Tram Depot]] on 27 June 1953 the Rozelle received additional trams to run the [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]] to [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] route|250px]]\n\nTrams to Abbortsford via [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] and [[Five Dock]] left the city via [[Parramatta Road]] and [[Norton Street]]. Trams to Leichhardt then continued down [[Norton Street]] to the original terminus at Darley Road Leichardt.\n\nThe Abbotsford line branched off the Leichhardt line at Marion Street, Leichhardt opposite the Leichardt Town Hall. The line followed Marion Street, Ramsey Street, [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]], and then turned right onto Great North Road, travelling through Five Dock and [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]] before terminating near The Terrace, connecting with ferry services at [[Abbotsford ferry wharf|Abbotsford wharf]].<ref>Gregory's Street Directory 1955 page 27 and 28</ref>\n\nThe line was closed between Five Dock and Abbotsford in 1954, Haberfield and Five Dock in 1956, and closed from Leichardt to Haberfield in 1958 with the closure of the \"George Street lines\".\n\n===Lilyfield===\nThe Lilyfield line branched off the Balmain line at Epping Junction (adjacent to [[Harold Park Paceway]] and the [[Rozelle Tram Depot]]) and then went via [[reserved track]] to Taylor Street and then right into Booth Street, [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]]. The tram line turned right into Catherine Street and terminated at the intersection of Abattoir Road and Grove Street, on the bridge over the railway goods yard.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 26</ref> This was the only tram terminus in Sydney located on a bridge. The Lilyfield line was closed in November 1958.\n\nThe current stop of the [[Inner West Light Rail]] (numbered L1 and also known as the Inner West Light Rail) of Lilyfield is located underneath the bridge of the former terminus.\n\n===Balmain===\nThe first steam tram to service [[Darling Street]] was in 1892. Ten years later the service was electrified.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lExV-ASBAtkC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=rozelle+tram+depot&source=bl&ots=4hLJTBK3yv&sig=8ciBW_4UE6xo5yJOMcUZGsvmIIE&hl=en&ei=CGvAS8CFK8-TkAXj45TaBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=49&ved=0CNsBEOgBMDA#v=onepage&q=rozelle%20tram%20depot&f=false A Pictorial History of Balmain, page 11]</ref> Services left the CBD via George Street and ran via George Street West (Now Broadway), Catherine Street, St Johns Road, Ross Street, in reservation to Crescent Street (now part of The Crescent). The line then crossed Johnstone Creek on a dedicated bridge before being on its own reservation where it rejoined street running along The Crescent. The line then traveled Commercial Road to Barnes Street and then Weston Road. The line turned into Darling Street to the terminus at Darling Street Wharf.\n\nA feature of this line was a counterweight dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep single-line section of track near the terminus at [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]]. Due to the very steep incline at the bottom of the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to the dummy and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via the dummy. The dummy is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]]. The slot through which the dummy was fixed to the cable can be seen in that photograph.\n\n[[Circular Quay]] to [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] tram services terminated at Gladstone Park for most of the life of the system. [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]] was the terminus for the cross suburban route to [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]]. The Canterbury to Darling Street wharf service ceased in 1954. Until 1955, City to Balmain services continued to the wharf, when buses replaced trams between Gladstone Park and the wharf. Balmain services were closed with other western line services in November 1958. State Transit route 442 has since replaced the tram route.\n\n===Birchgrove===\nServices branched off from the main line on [[Darling Street]], turning left into Rowntree Street, then another left into Cameron Street, before turning right into Grove Street and terminating at Wharf Road, Birchgrove. This route follows the contemporary 441 bus route.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 26, 26A, 1, and 13</ref> Service to [[Birchgrove, New South Wales|Birchgrove]] was terminated in 1954.\n\n===Glebe Point===\nThis line travelling from the city branched off onto [[Glebe Point Road]] from [[Parramatta Road]], terminating near the corner of Pendrill Street.<ref name=\"Gregory's Street Directory 1955, p 5\">Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, map 5</ref>\n\n===Ryde and Drummoyne===\n[[File:Rozelletram.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sydney R-Class Tram|R1 2010]] at [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]]]]\nThe line to Ryde (Station) was the longest line of the Sydney system. When cut back to Drummoyne the La Perouse line took over the title.\n\nRyde services ran the full length of [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] and turned into [[Harris Street]] just after [[Railway Square]] following the same route as today's route 501 bus service. Trams went along Harris Street and crossed the [[Glebe Island Bridge]]. From White Bay junction until the Darling Street junction, Ryde trams shared tracks in [[Victoria Road (Sydney)|Victoria Road]] with the Balmain and Birchgrove lines. The tram then crossed the [[Iron Cove Bridge]] and the former [[Gladesville Bridge]] before turning right onto Blaxland Road. It then wound its way along Blaxland Road, behind the site of the current council chambers, terminating near the intersection of Pope and Devlin Street in [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]].<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, map 72, 26</ref>\n\nThere was a peak hour service to [[Drummoyne]] via [[Forest Lodge, New South Wales|Forest Lodge]]. At Forest Lodge the line swung right into Ross Street before entering onto its own [[reserved track]], now known as Minogue Crescent, passing [[Rozelle Tram Depot]]. This joined the main Victoria Road Ryde line at White Bay junction.\n\nIt was initially a single line, later duplicated from [[Rozelle]] to Ryde between 1906 and 1936. The tram terminus was established at the western end of Blaxland Road, located near the current [[Top Ryde City]] shopping centre, and extended down Victoria Road through [[Gladesville]], where it eventually terminated at [[Fort Macquarie]] (present site of the [[Sydney Opera House]]). The entire trip took approximately 61 minutes to complete, and was the single longest route on the Sydney tram network, measuring 10 miles 61 chains (17.3&nbsp;km) via [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]].\n\nIn 1914 a single tram line was added between Ryde Post Office (corner of Church Street and Parkes Street) and [[West Ryde railway station]]. The Sydney to Ryde service became very popular, particularly at weekends when Sydney residents would travel to the orchards of the Ryde District to buy produce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4310588 |title=Tram Track on Blaxland Road, Ryde |publisher=Rta.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThe tram service from Ryde to the city was cut back to Drummoyne on 19 January 1949 and replaced by buses.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18145643 Buses Replace Trams To-day On Ryde Route] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 19 December 1949 p.3 accessed 4 April 2012</ref> The service to Drummoyne was terminated in 1953.\n\n===Balmain via Pyrmont===\nServices commenced at [[Railway Square]], travelling south-west on [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]], turning right onto [[Harris Street]], passing the former [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Darling Harbour goods yard]]. At [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] a separate line branched off from the main line on Harris Street, turning left into Miller Street, turning right into Bank Street, crossing the former [[Glebe Island Bridge]]. It then travelled along Commercial Road turning right onto [[Victoria Road (Sydney)|Victoria Road]], then right onto [[Darling Street]], terminating at the [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]].<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 6, 2, 1</ref>\n\n===Annandale and Forest Lodge===\nLines ran along Booth Street, [[Parramatta Road]], Ross Street, St Johns Road, Mt Vernon Street and Catherine Street, as well as Taylor Street.

Four lines then proceeded to [[Cooks River]], [[Dulwich Hill]], [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Earlwood]]. A short lived line also operated between Canterbury and [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]]. Most of these lines were closed on 27 September 1957, in conjunction with the closure of the Pitt and Castlereagh lines through the CBD on the same day.\n\n===Cooks River Line===\nThis line ran south-west along City Road from [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]], then along [[King Street, Newtown|King Street]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], past [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] railway stations to the [[Princes Highway]].\n\nIt then proceeded down the Princes Highway to its terminus at the [[Cooks River]]. At [[Tempe, New South Wales|Tempe]], a connection lead to the [[Tempe Bus Depot|Tempe Tram Depot]], on the corner of the Princes Highway and Gannon Street.\n\nPast the terminus at the [[Cooks River]], a single line led over the river to the Wolli Creek Perway Yard. The line reached St Peters as a steam tramway in 1891, then to Cooks River in 1900 when electric services commenced.\n\nThe line closed on 27 September 1957 with today's [[Transit Systems Sydney]] route 422 parallelling the former line, with occasional extensions to Kogarah.\n\n===Dulwich Hill Line===\nThis line branched from the line to Cooks River at [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], and travelled down Enmore Road through [[Enmore, New South Wales|Enmore]], then along Victoria Road to Marrickville Road before tuning right along Marrickville Road through [[Marrickville]] and [[Dulwich Hill]] to New Canterbury Road. At the New Canterbury Road terminus, a tram turning loop was provided, this is currently used as a layover area for buses. Current Transit Systems Sydney route 426 follows this tramline. The line closed on 27 September 1957.\n\n===Canterbury Line to Darling Street Wharf===\n[[File:Sydney R class no 1923 at Sydenham, 20 November 1954..jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sydney R-Class Tram|R1923]] at [[Sydenham railway station, Sydney|Sydenham station]] in November 1954]]\n[[File:Laying tracks in newtown 1927.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Re-laying tracks outside [[Newtown Tram Depot]] in 1927]]\nA cross country connection between the Canterbury Line at New Canterbury Road to [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] and the Western Suburbs lines on [[Parramatta Road]] allowed a cross country service to operate between [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]. From Crystal Street, Fort Street (single line loops), Parramatta Road, this route continued via [[Norton Street]], [[Leichardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]] to Balmain Road, [[Rozelle]] where it crossed [[Victoria Road, Sydney|Victoria Road]] to [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]]. It now forms the basis of [[Transit Systems Sydney|Transit Systems]] route 445.\n\nFrom [[Circular Quay]] trams reached [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]] via [[Castlereagh Street]] ([[Pitt Street]] on inbound services), [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]], City Road, [[King Street, Newtown|King Street]], then headed south on Enmore Road the tram turned right into Addison Road, before turning right into Livingstone Road and then left onto New Canterbury Road in Petersham. The line then travelled down New Canterbury Road through [[Dulwich Hill]] and [[Hurlstone Park]] to a terminus adjacent to [[Canterbury railway station, Sydney|Canterbury railway station]] in Broughton Street.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 28, 27, 33 (maps adjoining in that order)</ref> Transit Systems Sydney route 428 follows the route of this line.\n\n===Earlwood Line===\nThis line branched from the line to Dulwich Hill at Illawarra Road at Marrickville Road. It travelled south-west along Illawarra Road, crossing the [[Cooks River]], followed by a steep ascent up Homer Street to the [[Earlwood]] shopping district. The line terminated in Homer Street at the intersection of William Street and Hartill Law Avenue.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory 1955, Map 33</ref> Transit Systems Sydney route 423 follows the former tram line, although this bus route now extends to [[Kingsgrove]]. The line closed on 27 September 1957, along with all the 'Green line' tram lines.\n\n===Cooks River to Dulwich Hill Line===\nA cross country line connected the Cooks River and Dulwich Hill lines via [[Sydenham, New South Wales|Sydenham]], operating along Railway Road and Sydenham Road in Sydenham. A cross country service operated between [[Cooks River]] and [[Dulwich Hill]]. Transit Systems Sydney route 425 follows this route, but now terminates 400m up the road at Tempe Depot. The line closed on 27 September 1957.\n\n===Hurlstone Park to Summer Hill Line===\nA short-lived single track line operated from the Canterbury Line at [[Hurlstone Park]] along Old Canterbury Road and Prospect Road to [[Summer Hill railway station]]. Services operated between Canterbury and Summer Hill from 1915 however low patronage and competition from motor buses saw the line close in 1933. The disused track and overhead remained in place until the 1950s. This line was in use in the early 1950s. There were double tracks opposite [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar School]] in Prospect Road.\n\n===Erskineville Line===\nThis line branched from tracks at Regent Street in [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]], and passed west along Meagher Street, then south into Abercombie Street, across the junction with Cleveland Street through Golden Grove, before swinging south into Golden Grove Street then right into Wilson Street.\n\nThe line then passed under the railway lines at Burren Street, adjacent to the entrance to [[Macdonaldtown railway station]].\n\nThe line then became a single track loop passing up Burren Street to Erskineville Road, then west to Septimus Street, then Albert Street before rejoining the tracks at Burren Street. Services operated from [[Circular Quay]] using the [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]] lines.\n\nThe line opened as an electric double track tramway in 1909. The line south of [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] closed in 1940, with the northern section used by other services until its closure in 1958.\n\n==Southern Suburbs Lines==\n'''The following lines were all isolated from the main system.'''\n\n===Rockdale to Brighton-Le-Sands Line===\n[[File:Southern sydney trams.png|right|thumb|300px|Southern Sydney tramways map]]\nThis line opened as a private steam tramway in 1885. It was electrified in 1900, and moved into government ownership in 1914.\n\nThe line connected with the trains at [[Rockdale railway station|Rockdale station]] in a direct extension of Bay Street, now reshaped, but still known as Tramway Arcade, then passed down Bay Street to [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands]].\n\nAt The Grand Parade, the line turned right and terminated at the intersection of The Grand Parade and Teralba Road.\n\nThe line was single track throughout, running on the northern side of Bay Street, and down the middle of The Grand Parade, with a double track at each end, and a passing loop between Farr Street and West Botany Street, Rockdale. While travelling in Bay Street, the conductor operated from the kerb-side of the carriages, regardless of the direction of the tram.\n\nThe line closed in 1949 and was replaced by a bus service (currently route 478/9). A small depot on the north side of Bay Street Brighton-le-Sands, with a track entry between Aero Street and Francis Lane (now Francis Avenue) maintained the cars.\n\nWith regard to the suburb name, a lower case \"l\" was used for the central part of \"Brighton-le-Sands\" during the period in which the trams operated, but the official name was changed to an upper-case \"L\" some time afterwards.\n\n===Kogarah to Sans Souci Line===\n{{See also|Trolleybuses in Sydney}}\nThis steam tramway opened in 1887<ref name=\"Kogarah Council Timeline\">{{cite web|work=Kogarah Municipal Council| title=Kogarah Council Timeline|url=http://www.kogarah.nsw.gov.au/www/html/488-kogarah.asp| accessdate=19 July 2007}}</ref> using small railway locomotives and carriages.\n\nIn 1891 two conventional steam tram motors were built for the line by Henry Vale. Six C1 type trailers replaced the railway carriages around the same period.\n\nThe tramway operated for 50 years until it was replaced by an electric [[Trolleybuses in Sydney|trolleybus]] service in 1937.\n\nIt connected with trains at [[Kogarah railway station|Kogarah station]] by way of a large balloon loop through the streets, then passed south down Rocky Point Road to [[Sans Souci, New South Wales|Sans Souci]], [[Sandringham, New South Wales|Sandringham]] and [[Dolls Point]].\n\nSmall depots at Sandringham and Kogarah serviced the line. The line was single track at each end with a double-track middle section down Rocky Point Road.<ref>''The Kogarah-Sans Souci Tramway'' Eardley, G.H. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1957 pp177-190</ref> Track on the line was laid to railway standards to allow railway trucks to haul goods over the line. Although laid as double track along Rocky Point Road, the trams only used the most eastern track. The western track being laid to enable electric trams to be used, however this never happened as trolleybuses took over operation.\n\nWilson's 1917 map shows the route leaving Kogarah Station (no loop), then Gray Street, across Kogarah Road, and thence by a ROW to\nRocky Point Road, entering near Herman Street, thence along Russell Avenue, Clareville Street to the foreshore, then along the foreshore\n(now Cook Park) to Sans Souci/Rocky Point Road, then north along that road, rejoining the line at Russell Avenue.<ref>Wilson's Sydney and Suburban Street Directory 1931, p. 479.</ref>\n\n===Arncliffe to Bexley Line===\nThis steam tramway opened in 1909 and closed in 1926. It connected with trains at [[Arncliffe railway station|Arncliffe station]], and ran down Wollongong Road, then Forest Road through [[Bexley, New South Wales|Bexley]] before terminating at the corner of Forest and Preddys Roads, Bexley. The line was single track, with a passing loop midway. A small car shed at [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]] maintained the trams.\n\n===Sutherland to Cronulla Line===\nThis line opened as a steam tramway between [[Sutherland railway station]] and [[Cronulla]]\u2019s Shelley Beach, in 1911. It closed to passengers and was replaced by a bus service in 1931, and closed completely in 1932. It pre-dated the [[Cronulla railway line]], which took over its role.<ref>[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1963 pp181-194</ref>\n\n==North Shore Lines==\n[[File:Sydney north tram map.png|right|thumb|300px|North Shore Lines map]]\n[[File:Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels looking North.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Former Tram Tunnels leading to disused Platforms 1 and 2 at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard station]]]]\nA feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. Trams ran from Blue Street, [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now used by the [[Cahill Expressway]]), through a tram platform at [[Milsons Point railway station|Milsons Point]] similar to the [[Milsons Point railway station|railway station]] on the opposite side, and dived underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station. These platforms were converted into a car park after the tramway's closure on 28 June 1958. Wynyard station's railway platforms are thus numbered 3-6.\n\nThe line along Military Road, opened in September 1893, was the first permanent electric tramway in Sydney and New South Wales.\n\nThe first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which started at the original [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]], located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred Street (now Alfred Street South), Junction Street (now [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]]), Blue Street and Miller Streets to the [[Ridge Street Tram Depot|winding engine house and depot at Ridge Street]]. It used cable grip cars called \"dummies\" and unpowered trailer cars, similar to the large Melbourne cable tramway system but quite different from the surviving lines in San Francisco, where everything is combined in a single vehicle.\n\nThe original cable line was extended via Miller and Falcon Streets to [[Crows Nest, New South Wales|Crows Nest]], and later the whole line was electrified and extensions were built to various termini around the Lower North Shore.\n\nThe history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods \u2013 the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third from then until the general closure of the system in 1958.\n\n===First period 1886\u20131909===\n[[File:Spitt junction mosman 1900.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Opening ceremony for the [[Spit Junction]] tram line 3 November 1900 showing C and D class electric trams and cable trailer cars.]]\nIn the initial years of the North Sydney tramways, services operated from [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]] to:\n* [[Ridge Street Tram Depot]] was originally a cable tram depot which opened in May 1886.

It opened as far as Victoria Avenue, [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]] in April 1898 and extended to [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood station]] in July 1908. Through electric services from Milsons Point began when the original cable tramway was electrified in February 1900.\n* [[Lane Cove]]: opened as an electric line from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams connecting with other electric services at Ridge Street. It was initially opened as far as [[Gore Hill]] and extended to Lane Cove in March 1909.

The Milsons Point line was deviated at North Sydney via Walker and Mount Streets to avoid congestion at Victoria Cross. The McMahons Point line was opened to relieve the load on the [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]] and connecting tramway. Services to [[Lane Cove]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] were altered to operate to and from McMahons Point via the new direct route to Crows Nest. In conjunction with the construction of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the Milsons Point line was diverted to a new terminus in Glen Street in July 1924. Escalators were provided to carry tram passengers to the new ferry wharf below. Otherwise, services operated as during the first period.\n\n===Third period 1932\u20131958===\n[[File:D car no. 117 Parriwi Road, approaching The Spit.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Sydney D-Class Tram|D117]] on Parriwi Road approaching [[The Spit, New South Wales|The Spit]].

As mentioned above, this line had a combination of long, steep grades and windy track, and only trams fitted with track brakes (which were not otherwise used on the Sydney tramways) or [[Dynamic braking|dynamic (rheostatic) brakes]] were permitted. The single track down Hayes Street was the steepest unassisted in Sydney.\n* [[Cremorne Point ferry wharf|Cremorne Point wharf]] - [[The Spit, New South Wales|The Spit]]: the Cremorne Wharf line closed in April 1956.\n* [[Mosman Bay ferry wharf|Mosman wharf]] - Cremorne Junction: The Mosman Wharf line closed in November 1955.\n* [[Taronga Zoo ferry wharf|Athol Wharf]] - [[Balmoral, New South Wales|Balmoral]]: A feature of this line was the steep grade down to the wharf at the terminus.

It was a difficult route to construct on account of the height above sea level and the short distance to be traversed. Apart from the direct city service to Wynyard via the Sydney Harbour Bridge, cross regional services ran to Lane Cove, [[Taronga Zoo ferry wharf|Athol Wharf]], Northbrdge and Chatswood, making it one of the busiest lines on the North Sydney system.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>[[:File:Public plaque in balmoral.JPG|Public Plaque, Mosman Council]]</ref>\n*Upon departure from the Esplanade terminus, at the corner of Mandalong Road, trams travelled south-East along The Esplanade. After passing Botanic Road the line swung right onto Henry Plunkett Reserve. From this point the line went off-road and ascended uphill onto its own reservation, travelling through a narrow rock cutting, now public walking track (pictured). After a steep ascent through the reserve the line crossed several small residential streets along the way, such as; Mulbring, Gordon, Plunkett and Beaconsfield Street, before once again entering onto Gordon Street where the line swung right onto Middle Head Road.

Passenger traffic fell considerably by autumn that year, and services reverted to horse-drawn trams from 20 July 1903. However, following considerable increase in passengers during the next four years, steam trams were returned from 1 October 1907.\n\nA line was built to [[The Spit, New South Wales|The Spit]], and the Manly to Curl Curl line was progressively extended to [[Brookvale, New South Wales|Brookvale]], [[Collaroy]], and [[Narrabeen]]. A branch was run to [[Freshwater, New South Wales|Harbord]]. Electrification commenced with the construction of the line to The Spit, and was extended throughout the system.\n\nThe Narrabeen line was also used for carrying freight, for a spur was run to the freight wharf at Manly, and goods sidings were built at [[Balgowlah]] in Sydney Road near Wanganella Street; at Brookvale from a line in Alfred Road short of Federal Parade; and at Narrabeen near King Street.<ref>K. McCarthy (Ed. D. R. Keenan), The Manly Lines of the Sydney Tramway System, Transit Press, Sutherland, 1995, pp. 6-8, 10, 32</ref>\n\nVarious track layouts and routes existed in the early days in the vicinity of the Manly terminus, with quite different arrangements existing in 1903, 1911, 1912, and 1914.\nThe routes prior to 1914 used [[The Corso]] and North Steyne, but from 1914 were confined to Belgrave Street. The Manly lines closed on 1 October 1939.<ref>L. A. Clark, ''North of the Harbour'', ARHS, 1976, pp. 100-101</ref>\n\nThe Manly lines, which were administered by the Railways, suffered from maladministration (as in the case of the Castle Hill line), resulting in considerable overcapitalisation of the network, unnecessary re-routing and re-building of the track at Manly terminus. Consequently, the system never made a profit. Re-building the terminal at Manly terminus several times, accompanied by costly property resumption, accounted for huge expenditures with little gain.\n\nIn 1919 planning began to move slightly the balloon loop at Manly, requiring demolition and re-building the Pier Hotel. Rebuilding track in Belgrave street and the terminus was estimated to cost \u00a35,695, while land resumption including demolition of the Pier Hotel was estimated at \u00a340,000 (less \u00a33,500 from sale of land). The hotel was demolished in 1924.\n\nThe Department was slow to provide a speedy service. It persisted in scheduling the long-distance trams behind the all-stops (instead of the other way around).  It rejected residents' suggestions to schedule the Narrabeen tram first, and to make the first set-down Dee Why or similar place. For nearly a decade from at least 1923, residents had been asking for faster services to Narrabeen.  The trip took 49 minutes. A new timetable was introduced from 1 November 1920, giving a trip time of 39 minutes, but it proved unworkable and the timetable reverted to an old one on 4 July 1921, back to 48 minutes.\n\nResidents wanted optional stopping and express running to Dee Why from Manly.  The Railways ignored those requests, and persisted in running the Narrabeen tram from Manly, behind the all-stops trams to Balgowlah and Harbord. Finally, when the Department moved to schedule Narrabeen trams first, with first set-down at Dee Why from 25 November 1931, it took only 31\u201333 minutes by tram from Manly to Narrabeen, down from 39 minutes previously, and down from 49 minutes when the service was inaugurated.<ref>K.

At Park Avenue a Right of way took the tram north, then east alongside Raglan Street, eventually joining Raglan Street at Kangaroo Road.\n\nFrom there, which was a junction for the Narrabeen line, the line turned south, finishing at a large loop at The Esplanade (Manly).<ref>1934 edition of Gregory's Street Directory of Sydney and Suburbs, facsimile edition 2006, maps 60, 74, 77</ref>  The [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] to Spit section opened on 9 January 1911.<ref>L.

In 1901, this line was extended north to [[Mortlake, New South Wales|Mortlake]], and in 1909 a branch to [[Cabarita, New South Wales|Cabarita]] Park was opened.\n\nThe system was electrified in 1912. Services operated from Ashfield station along [[Hume Highway|Liverpool Road]], Georges River Road, onto a reserved corridor that swung off Georges River Road at a point roughly opposite Windsor Avenue.\n\nFrom this point the corridor ran diagonally towards, then across Burwood Road and onto what is now Tangarra Street East.\n\nThe reserved corridor ended at Portland Street, at which point the line continued west along the length of Tangarra Street, then north along what is now Coronation Parade (the two parallel streets were originally known as, from east to west, The Boulevarde and Punchbowl Road), back to Liverpool Road heading east through Enfield, and then north along Burwood Road through [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]].\n\nThe line then turned into Crane Street, then Majors Bay Road and Brewer Street to Cabarita Junction.\n\nThe line was double track until this point, then it split into single-track branches to Mortlake via Frederick, Vanhee and Gale Streets and Tenneyson Road, and to Cabarita via Cabarita Road.\n\nShort services were turned back at Brighton Avenue, Plymouth Street, Enfield, [[Burwood railway station, Sydney|Burwood station]] and Wellbank Street.\n\nServices operated every five minutes between Ashfield and Wellbank Street in peak periods, and every 15 minutes (30 minutes at off-peak times) on the two branches.\n\nA depot on Tangarra Street, near Kembla Street and Coronation Parade, served the lines.\n\nAfter electrification, services were provided predominately by [[O-Class Tram|O Class trams]] after experimentation with other classes found that they were unable to operate the timetables due to topography challenges.\n\nThe lines closed in 1948, and were replaced by buses. Tramway infrastructure was removed throughout the route in 1951. The Tangarra Street depot was used by buses until its closure in 1989.\n\nThe depot was demolished to make way for housing. A small brick hut used as a waiting room for passengers still stands on the western side of the Coronation Parade reserve near Dean Street. This is one of very few surviving remnants of the line.\n\nThe reserved tramway corridor at [[Croydon Park, New South Wales|Croydon Park]] is now residential property from its eastern limit starting at Georges River Road opposite Windsor Avenue and running diagonally to Burwood Road, and also from Burwood Road to Tangarra Street East (with property boundaries following the route of the corridor). Tangarra Street East, which did not exist in the days of tram operation, follows the route of the remainder of the corridor to its western limit at the intersection with Portland Street.\n\n==Castle Hill line==\n{{main|Rogans Hill railway line}}\nA steam tramway opened between [[Parramatta]] and [[Baulkham Hills]] in 1902, and was extended to [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] in 1910, carrying passengers and produce to and from the area.\n\nThis tramway commenced at Argyle Street in Parramatta and tracked north along Church Street to [[Northmead]], then along [[Windsor Road, Sydney|Windsor Road]] and Old Northern Road to Castle Hill.\n\nIn 1919, the NSW government decided to convert the tramway into a [[Rogans Hill railway line|railway]] to encourage the subdivision of estates for residential use. This involved a new connection to the Main Western Railway at Westmead and a new line to Northmead.\n\nThe section from Argyle Street Parramatta to Northmead became an isolated line before closing not long after the railway began operations.\n\nThe railway line was later extended to [[Rogans Hill]] in 1924. The new line proved to be unsuccessful and was closed on 31 January 1932 and was seen by members of the public as turning a perfect tramway into an underperforming railway.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[File:First Tram across Bridge (8368180041).jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney R-Class Tram|O1106]] at the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] opening in May 1932]]\n\nIn 1905 an [[Sydney Tram Classification|alphabetical classification]] was introduced to the NSW Government Tramways. Generally the letters A and B were allotted to steam stock, with letters [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C]] to [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R]] (R1) (with the exception of the letters I and Q) to electric cars based on the seating capacity of the class. The letter S was added after the fleet number for service (non-passenger) stock.\n\nPerhaps the most famous well-remembered of the electric trams that operated in Sydney were the [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O]] and [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P class]] trams known officially as ''[[Running board|footboard cars]]'', after the footboards running along the length of each side of these trams, and upon which conductors precariously balanced to collect fares. However they were mostly referred to as ''toastrack trams'' for their cross-bench wooden seating layout that resembled a toast rack of the time. Their high seating capacity of 80 (with a crush load of 180 when in coupled set) was a major advantage for Sydney's crowded system, specialty for major events such as [[Sydney Royal Easter Show|The Royal Easter Show]] at Moore Park and horse race meetings at [[Randwick Racecourse]]. They were routinely coupled in pairs to run as ''Coupled Set''. 626 [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O class]] and 258 [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P class]] trams were constructed from 1908, with some remaining in service until 1958 with the closure of the George Street lines.\n\nThe first modern ''corridor'' style tram numbered 1738 of the [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R Class]] was introduced on 29 September 1933, offering 48 seats in the comfort of being fully enclosed from the weather, padded upholstered seating in the main saloons and the safety of a corridor running internally the full length of the tram assist with the collection of fares and movement between seats, these cars were seen an improvement comfort wise over the older \"toastrack trams\" however lacked the seating numbers of the O and P classes.\n\nOriginally 200 of the R class were ordered, however the last 5 of the class had modifications made to them during construction due to consultation with both staff and the traveling public to increase the number of seating and ease of movement, These cars 1933 to 1937 were known as the R/R1 class cars and the modifications were distinctly noticeable compared to both the R and R1 classes.\n\nThe final order of tramcars for Sydney was for the [[Sydney R1-Class Tram|R1 class]]. Like their predecessors the R Class, these cars were of the corridor arrangement and built to body shape closer to the R/R1 class. However unlike the R class the R1 class had only one saloon (as opposed to a saloon at either end and a drop-centre section in the middle) but had the increased seating of 56. The First 50 were ordered and delivered prior to World War 2, with a further 250 ordered in the late 1940s, however due to steel shortages after the war, the first of the 250 did not enter service until 1950 with the last entering service to North Sydney Depot in 1953.\n\nDue to the delays in receiving trams and ongoing steel shortages, the last 150 of the order was cancelled spelling the final end of Sydney's trams. Some of these cars had not been in service long enough for a major overhaul before their withdrawal between 1958 and February 1961.\n\nUnlike the preceding O and P class trams that were fitted with [[Multiple Unit]] equipment, neither the R nor R1 classes were fitted and so could not operate in coupled sets. They could be coupled, however there was no provision to operate them in coupled service because there were no cables for air or power connections to the trailing car due to the lack of equipment.\n\nUpon withdrawal, most cars were stripped of their metal components such as bogies and anything that either could be used to keep other trams running or sold as salvageable scrap metal.\n\nCars were then towed from their respective depots or driven directly to [[Randwick Bus Depot|Randwick Tramway Workshops]] at the end of their last day of operation and the placed on the sidings known in tramway circles as 'burning hill'. As many as 15 trams could be burnt in any one day during the height of tram disposal.\n\nSome were sold as stripped shells to private users to be used as campground shelters and storage sheds (all classes) or workers/camping accommodation (mostly those of the R and R1 class).\n\nTrams burnt of the R, R/R1 and R1 classes, although mostly made of steel construction, were less that 8 years old at time of being burnt and was seen by some members of society as an official act of vandalism and a waste of resources (especially steel) by the government of the period.<ref>Shooting Through by the Sydney Tramway Museum</ref>\n\nIn 1950, L/P class tram 154 was the first of Sydney's trams (and first in Australia) to be preserved the fledgling Australian Electric Traction Association, later known as the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]], beginning the preservation of nearly every class of tram. The collection of preserved trams has grown to include the last known examples of some classes and even enabled the recreation of multiple set operations of a coupled set of O class cars, however there are no known examples of the G,H or M classes of trams.\n\n==Accidents==\n* On 21 August 1924, a coupled set of E-class cars ran out of control near McMahon's Point, derailed and crashed into a house.  There were two fatalities, and the trams were extensively damaged.<ref>D. R. Keenan, ''The North Sydney Lines of the Sydney Tramway system'', Transit Press, Sans Souci, n.d., pp. 35, 104 with photographs</ref>\n* In 1929, a P-class tram crashed into a barber's shop on the corner of Quay and Ultimo Roads near Central Station. Almost half of the tramcar ended up in the shop.\n* There were accidents at [[Taronga Zoo ferry wharf|Athol Wharf]], [[Taronga Park]], when trams lost control running down the steep hill and ended up in the harbour, in 1942, 1952 and 1958.<ref>{{cite web|author=lindsaybridge No real name given + Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/4129812411/in/set-72157605298170997/ |title=1958 [439&#93; TOO FAR! &#124; Flickr \u2013 Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n* Scores of accidents \u2013 some fatal \u2013 befell tram conductors while collecting fares from the footboard of moving trams.

''Tramways of Sydney''. Transit Press 1979</ref> a small section of the original tram tacks were uncovered during roadworks in late 2009. The City of Sydney have left these exposed to serve as a historical reminder.\n*A section of uncovered tramway track was, until late 2015, visible along O'Dea Avenue in [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]. The single track was visible through the concrete road surface for a few hundred metres, but was mostly removed during storm water improvement works through 2015 - 2016. The removal of this section can be seen in Google StreetView Timeline, where the lines were clearly visible in 2014, but began to be obscured in later years.  Occasionally other buried sections of track are exposed when roadworks are carried out. For example, at the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Penshurst Street, [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]], extensive tram tracks are visible whenever road resurfacing is carried out.\n*There is a small section of tram track going in both directions on Lower Fort Street Road in [[Millers Point]].\n*There is a small fragment of tram track exposed in the Moore Park grounds near the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n*There is a small fragment of tram track exposed on [[Old South Head Road]], [[Watsons Bay]] at the top of Heart Break Hill.\n*The tracks in [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]]s were asphalted over and were not removed. Occasionally they appear through the road surface.\n*Several ornate tram shelters still stand, such as at the corner of [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Streets]], City.\n*At [[North Bondi]] and [[Bronte, New South Wales|Bronte]], bus shelters are built into small cuttings that were previously tram stops.\n*Ornamental rosettes located where overhead wiring span wires were attached can be seen on many older buildings and rock faces, there are seven on a rock wall near the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the site of [[Fort Macquarie Tram Depot|Fort Macquarie Depot]] as well as on buildings in the CBD.\n*Many street corners where trams turned were 'cut-back' to allow space for trams to turn, and subsequently many buildings on such corners still have rounded fronts.\n*The abnormally wide median strip in [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] south of [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] once accommodated tram line to La Perouse and Maroubra Beach.\n*Between Beach Road and Ramsgate Ave on Campbell Parade Bondi Beach, the area between the lanes that is now car parking space was once the line from Bondi to North Bondi.\n*The open space at North Bondi that is the bus terminal was once a three track terminal for all lines to Bondi. The terminal was cut into the hill and was filled in for bus operations.\n*When walking up the steps to [[The Gap (Sydney)|The Gap]] at [[Watsons Bay]], there is flat ground in between two sets of steps. This continues for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.\n*The round cut rock wall opposite Mosman Bay ferry wharf was cut back to allow a balloon loop for the trams.\n*The [[Ultimo Tram Depot]] is now part of the [[Powerhouse Museum]].\n*Tunnel Portals to [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]] from the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] still exist and can be seen from the pedestrian walkway.\n*Former location of Wynyard tram platforms is now part of the Wynyard Lane Car Park at the station. The \n*[[Millers Point]] tram tracks were buried by bitumen when the lines were closed, as the line which comprised the stop at Millers Point where State Transit terminate, was dug up around 1979-80 and the tram lines were removed and a new road surface laid.\n*During construction of the CBD and South East light rail at many points workers found many of the original tracks under the road surface. Rail that was salvageable was donated to the Sydney Tramway Museum.\n\nA map of these and other surviving physical remnants has been created.

Many suburbs with \"Junction\" in their name reflect their tramway heritage, such as [[Bondi Junction]], [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick Junction]], and [[Maroubra Junction]].\n*The eastern most southbound traffic lanes on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] were originally constructed to carry the City and Suburban Railway but were used for trams, and are still separated from and clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes, with the remnants of the eastern Milsons Point station (tram) located at the site of the former northern toll plaza of the [[Cahill Expressway]].\n* [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] platforms are still numbered from 3 to 6. Platforms 1 and 2 were tram platforms and the railway platforms were never renumbered when the tram platforms were removed.\n*On many buildings within the CBD of Sydney, Rosettes are still attached to walls on streets that trams ran on. These are the points of attachment for the overhead wires used to provide power to the trams.\n*[[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]] (derelict) and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] (now the [[Powerhouse Museum]]) power stations were constructed by the New South Wales government to provide power to both the railways and the tramways survive.\n*[[Rozelle Tram Depot|Rozelle]] (Now Tramsheds), [[Newtown Tram Depot|Newtown]] (derelict), [[Ultimo Tram Depot|Ultimo]] (owned by [[Powerhouse Museum]] as storage), [[Tempe Bus Depot|Tempe]] (Now Transit System Bus Depot), [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley]] (Now Sydney Buses Depot) and [[Leichhardt Bus Depot|Leichhardt]] (Now as the [[Sydney Bus Museum]] and Transit Systems bus depot) tram depots all still exist.\n* [[wikt:shoot through like a Bondi tram|Shoot through like a Bondi tram]] is a phrase still used in Sydney, meaning to depart in haste.\n*Preserved Steam Motor Tram Motor 1A, owned by the [[Powerhouse Museum]], Motor 100A (operational) at the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], [[Auckland]] New Zealand, Motor 103A (operational at [[Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum|Valley Heights Rail Museum]] with trailers 93B (operational) and 72B (Awaiting restoration) and replica Double Deck trailer built by Randwick Workshops on the frame of K class car 746.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport|New South Wales}}\n* [[Light rail in Sydney]]\n* [[List of light-rail transit systems]]\n* [[Public transport in Sydney]]\n* [[Trams in Australia]]\n* [[Transportation in Australia]]\n*[[Sydney Tramway Museum]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* D Budd et al.: ''Wait Here for Trams: Sydney's Trams, the Last Decade''.

network''' served the inner suburbs of [[Sydney]], Australia from 1879 until 1961. In its heyday, it was the largest in Australia, the second largest in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] (after [[Trams in London|London]]), and one of the largest in the world. The network was heavily worked, with about 1,600 cars in service at any one time at its peak during the 1930s (cf. about 500 [[trams in Melbourne]] today).\nPatronage peaked in 1945 at 405 million passenger journeys. Its maximum street trackage totalled 291&nbsp;km (181 miles) in 1923.\n\n==History==\n\n===Early tramways===\n[[File:Horsedrawn tram which ran between Newtown Station and St Peters.jpg|thumb|left|Horsedrawn tram which ran between [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] stations, c1894]]\n\nSydney's first tram was horse-drawn, running from the [[Redfern railway station|old Sydney railway station]] to [[Circular Quay]] along [[Pitt Street]].<ref name=tram>''The 1861 Pitt Street Tramway and the Contemporary Horse Drawn Railway Proposals'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], February, 1965 pp21-32</ref>\n\nBuilt in 1861, the design was compromised by the desire to haul railway freight wagons along the line to supply city businesses and return cargo from the docks at Circular Quay with passenger traffic as an afterthought.\n\nThis resulted in a track that protruded from the road surface and it caused damage to the wheels of wagons trying to cross it. Hard campaigning by competing [[bus|Horse Omnibus]] owners \u2013 as well as a fatal accident involving the leading Australian musician [[Isaac Nathan]] in 1864 \u2013 led to closure in 1866.\n\nIn 1879 a steam tramway was established in conjunction with the upcoming [[Sydney International Exhibition]] that was to be held in the Domain/Botanical Gardens area of Sydney.<ref>''The Inauguration of Sydney's Steam Tramways'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], March, 1969 pp49-59</ref> Originally planned by the government to be removed after the exhibition, the success of the steam tramway led to the system being expanded rapidly through the city and inner suburbs during the 1880s and 1890s.\n\nThe [[Sydney Steam Motor Tram|Steam Trams]] in Sydney comprised a [[Baldwin Locomotive Works|Baldwin]] [[locomotive]] hauling one or more trailers of either single deck or double deck construction.\n\nPreserved Sydney Steam Trams are Motor 1A, owned by the [[Powerhouse Museum]] and is usually stored at the \"Discovery Centre\" at [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]], however it is currently on loan to the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at Loftus NSW (currently non-operational),<ref>\"Anniversary of the closure of the Kogarah steam tramway and the opening of the Trolleybus system\" [https://www.sydneytramwaymuseum.com.au/tramfans/anniversary-of-the-closure-of-the-kogarah-steam-tramway-and-the-opening-of-the-trolleybus-system/]</ref> Motor 100A (operational) at the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], [[Auckland]] New Zealand as it was sold to Wanganui Tramways in 1910 and Motor 103A which operates with a former trailer car 93B at [[Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum|Valley Heights Rail Museum]] after previously being at Parramatta Park.\n\nTwo cable tram routes were also built in Sydney. The first route ran from King Street Wharf on the eastern side of Darling Harbour to Ocean Street [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]]. The second route from the original Milsons Point ferry wharf in [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] to Falcon Street North Sydney that was later extended to [[Crows Nest, New South Wales|Crows Nest]]. Constitution of lines north of harbour were due to the steep terrain involved from Milsons Point to North Sydney.<ref>''The Cable Trams of Sydney and the experiments leading to final electrification of the Tramways'' Wylie, R.F. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], July/August, 1974 pp145-168/190-192</ref> Cable Trailer 23 is preserved at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at Loftus NSW.\n\nAdditionally, horse trams operated between [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] railway stations in the 1890s and between [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] and [[North Manly]] from 1903 to 1907. \nHowever these two instances, the operation of horse tram services were acting as replacements for the existing steam trams services on these lines due to the low patronage during the indicated years.\n\n===Electrification===\n[[File:George Street near Hunter Street, Sydney from The Powerhouse Museum Collection.jpg|thumb|right|C Class trams on [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] near [[Hunter Street, Sydney|Hunter Street]]]]\nThe Sydney tram power supply system was built using [[New York City]] subway electrical equipment that was adapted for tram usage.

Sydney, the largest city in Australia, once had the largest tram system in Australia, the second largest in the Commonwealth (after London), and one of the largest in the world. In the early 1960s the entire network was dismantled.]</ref>\n\nElectrification started in 1898, and most of the system was converted by 1910. An exception was the privately owned [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] line built by Charles Edward Jeanneret in 1881<ref>{{cite web|last=Rutledge |first=Martha |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A040535b.htm |title=Biography \u2013 Charles Edward Jeanneret|work=Australian Dictionary of Biography |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref> to [[Parramatta ferry wharf|Redbank Wharf]] (Duck River) where the steam tram<ref>''The Parramatta Wharf Tramway'' Matthews, H.H. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1958 pp181-199</ref> remained until 1943 which was operate by the Sydney Ferries Ltd.\n\nAfter experimentation with 3 trams all fitted with different equipment from different manufacturers, full-time services began with [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C-class]] saloon cars, followed by [[Sydney D-Class Tram|D-class]] combination cars. In contrast to other cities that started with combination cars and toastracks, then quickly abandoned them for drop-centre and saloon cars, Sydney started by going the other way. Footboard trams continued to be introduced, notably the single truck [[Sydney E-Class Tram|E-class]] (that ran in a permanently coupled set), [[Sydney J-Class Tram|J-class]] and the [[Sydney K-Class Tram|K-class]], and the more famous  [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O-class]], O/P-class, [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P-class]] and [[Sydney F-Class Tram|L/P-class]] bogie trams that required the conductor to collect fares from the footboard running along the side of the tram, as they had no corridor through the middle connecting each compartment.\n\nRevered though footboard trams were for the number of passengers they could move, they were deathtraps for the conductors working them. On average, each day one conductor fell or was knocked off the footboard by passing motor vehicles as they became more popular. The majority suffered a fractured skull. In the three years 1923, 1924, 1925, there were 282, 289, and 233 accidents respectively to conductors on NSW tramways.<ref>''The Mercury'', 19 June 1926, p. 3.</ref> From 1916 to 1932, there were 4,097 accidents to tram employees, and from 1923 to 1931 there were 10,228 accidents to passengers having falls when alighting or boarding.  63 of the falls were fatal.<ref name=\"The Sydney Morning Herald 1934, p. 13\">''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 25 April 1934, p. 13.</ref>  Of the more than 100 falls reported of conductors, one quarter died from their injuries.<ref>''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 2 June 1920, p.13; 25 April 1921, p. 7; 1 Dec. 1933, p. 11; 26 Nov. 1936, p. 12; 20 September 1946, p. 4; 25 May 1949, p. 5 (examples)</ref>\n\nIt was not until 1933 with the introduction of [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R-class]] tram 1938 that the drop-centre saloon tram, widely used elsewhere in Australia, came to Sydney. Even so, footboard trams continued in wide use until the very late 1950s, despite calls as early as 1934 by the tram union for them to be modified.<ref name=\"The Sydney Morning Herald 1934, p. 13\"/>\n\nA part from the G, H and M classes, one of every electric tram class (and in some cases 2 or more) have been preserved by the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]] at [[Loftus, New South Wales|Loftus]] NSW.\n\n===Demise and closure===\n[[File:Last day of trams, covered in graffiti, Rural Bank tram stop, corner Martin Place and Elizabeth Street, Sydney, 25 February 1961 - unknown photographer (21264008773).jpg |thumb|right|Last day of trams, covered in graffiti, Rural Bank tram stop, corner [[Martin Place]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]], 25 February 1961]]\nBy the 1920s, the system had reached its maximum extent. In many ways, the Sydney tram system was a victim of its own success. The overcrowded and heaving trams running at a high frequency, in competition with growing private motor car and bus use, ended up being blamed for the congestion caused by the latter.\n\nCompetition from the private car and unregulated private bus operators created the perception of traffic congestion which began the gradual closure of lines from the late 1930s.\n\nMaterial shortages and lack of funding caused by the Second World War had caused the system to become rundown from poor maintenance. The perception of the government was that the financial cost of upgrading infrastructure and purchasing new trams would bankrupt the state.\n\nThis led to the government's calling on overseas transport experts to advise the city on its post-war transport issues, and this led to the recommendation that closure of the system was the best option for the state of NSW.\n\nClosure was supported by the [[NRMA]] <ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-04-12/sydneys-original-tram-network-what-happened-curious-sydney/9610328</ref>(who stood to gain from increased membership) but generally went against public opinion as most of the patronage were those who could not afford to purchase private transportation.\n\nNevertheless, closure became government policy in the early 1950s and the system was wound down in stages, with withdrawal of the services completed on 25 February 1961 when R1 class tram 1995 returned from [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]] to Randwick Workshops just before 4:40pm on 25 February 1961, which was driven by Jerry Valek, a Czechoslovakian man from Annandale.<ref>https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/in-1961-sydney-motorists-were-happy-to-see-the-trams-go-20151027-gkjhui.html</ref><ref>https://sydneylivingmuseums.com.au/stories/shooting-through-sydney-tram</ref><ref>https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/from-the-archives-sydney-takes-a-final-tram-ride-20190220-p50z48.html</ref><ref>South Pacific Electric Railway Society</ref><ref>NSW State Government Archives</ref>\n\nIt was alleged after the tramways were closed that were many other influences on the government to close down the system. These allegedly came from the rubber and petrol industries, motor vehicle (bus) manufacturers and those opposed to increased public expenditure. The allegations had some elements based on the [[General Motors streetcar conspiracy]] that occurred in the USA due to the use of \"overseas experts\".\n\n==City Service==\n\n===Circular Quay to Central Station===\n[[File:Approach to Central Railway, 1900.jpg|thumb|The approach to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]], about 1912 with a coupled set of E class trams climbing to the colonnade. Pitt street lines can be seen to the Right of the image.]]\nThis was an extremely busy service for passengers transferring from suburban trains at [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central]], particularly prior to the opening of the city underground railway lines in 1926. Trams operated from Central station across Eddy Avenue, along [[Castlereagh Street]] via Bligh, Bent and Loftus Streets to Alfred Street [[Circular Quay]] and returned via [[Pitt Street]] in a large anti-clockwise loop. The tram lines down Pitt and Castlereagh streets closed on 27 September 1957.\n\nThese tracks were also used as the city route for some eastern and south-western routes during busy periods as opposed to Elizabeth Street. The services could also be short worked via Bent and Spring Streets at times when Circular Quay was busy or unavailable.\n\nThe sandstone viaduct onto the colonnade at Central station were built across Eddy Avenue for this service, and are being used again today by trams of a sort in the form of the [[Inner West Light Rail]] system, however they are operating in the opposite direction.\n\n==Eastern Suburbs Lines==\n[[File:eastern trams.png|thumb|right|250px|Eastern Suburbs Lines map]]\n[[Circular Quay]] was the focal terminal point of most services to the eastern suburbs, and allowed easy transfer to [[Sydney Ferries Limited|ferries]]. For many years, 27 regular services operated from Circular Quay. A number of full-time services also operated from a secondary terminus at [[Railway Square]].\n\n===Watsons Bay Line===\nThe [[Rushcutters Bay Tram Depot]], which served this line, was located on New South Head Road at Rushcutters Bay on the north side of the road.\n\nThis line, which was first laid down as a cable tramway,  began at a loop at the corner of Erskine and Day Streets near [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard station]] then proceeded south down Day Street, turning left into [[King Street, Sydney|King Street]]. It then proceeded down King Street, crossing four other busy lines ([[George Street, Sydney|George]], [[Pitt Street|Pitt]], [[Castlereagh Street|Castlereagh]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]]). The intersection of King Street and George Street was the busiest in Sydney, with a tram crossing in either of the 4 directions every 8 seconds during the peak travel hours.\n\nIt then passed through Queen's Square at [[St James railway station, Sydney|St James station]], then swung right into [[College Street, Sydney|College Street]], heading south past [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney|St Mary's Cathedral]], then turning left into Boomerang Street. The line then swung left into [[William Street, Sydney|William Street]] and proceeded down William Street to [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|King's Cross]], before heading into [[Bayswater Road, Sydney|Bayswater Road]] where the line ran east before turning into [[New South Head Road]] at [[Rushcutters Bay]] running on to Ocean Street Edgecliff.\n\nThe line after Ocean Street Edgecliff then followed the course of New South Head Road through [[Double Bay]], [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]] and operated as an isolated electric tramway from October 1898 until January 1905 when electric services were extend to the Erskine Street terminus and the cable tramway was closed.\n\nAfter 1905, the line was extended along Dover Road to the Signal Station at [[Vaucluse, New South Wales|Vaucluse]]. From the signal station a single track passed  through the parkland area known as \"The Gap\" through narrow rock cuttings, low cliffs and rugged back-drops, twisting and turning its way down to the terminus at [[Watsons Bay]].\n\nThe line reached [[Edgecliff, New South Wales|Edgecliff]] in 1894, and Watsons Bay in 1909.<ref>[http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4309674 Drain Grate, Rose Bay]. Heritage, Roads and Traffic Authority. Accessed 22 August 2007.</ref> In 1949 the line from Rose Bay to Watsons Bay closed, but reopened in 1950 due to public protest. This then lead to policy being adopted that when a line was closed, infrastructure such as overhead wires and tracks had to be removed within 24 hours after the last tram to prevent services being reinstated.\n\nIn 1950, the line down King Street to Erskine Street closed and a new terminus constructed at Queens Square. The remainder of the line closed in July 1960. This line had its own depot and city terminus and operated independently, although was connected to the main system. The tram line followed the present-day [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] route 324,<ref>[http://www.woollahra.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0004/8293/Gap_Park,_History_of.pdf Gap History] Wollahra Council</ref>\n\n===Woolloomooloo Line===\nThis line branched off from [[Park Street, Sydney|Park Street]] near College Street and ran north along Haig Avenue, Lincoln Crescent (renamed Sir John Young Crescent), Cowper Street, Forbes Street, Challis Steps [[Woolloomooloo]]. Through service ran from [[Circular Quay]] via [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]] and Park Street. The line opened in stages between 1915 and 1918.\n\nThe last extension of the line in 1918 was constructed during the First World War to assist in troop movements to and from overseas battle. [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C-Class trams 31 and 44]] were specially fitter with stretcher bearers to assist with the troop movements and were used on this extension.\n\nThe line was an early closure, when on 28 January 1935, the line was replaced by a bus service from [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] which avoided the previous line through the city.\n\n===North Bondi via Bondi Junction and Bondi Beach Line===\nServices operated from either [[Circular Quay]] (via [[Bridge Street, Sydney|Bridge]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]] Streets) or [[Railway Square]] (via Elizabeth and [[Liverpool Street, Sydney|Liverpool]] Streets), to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]]. \nThe line then passed down Oxford Street to [[Bondi Junction]], where it branched off from Bronte services, to run down [[Bondi Road]] to Fletcher Street, [[Bondi Beach#Commercial area|Campbell Parade]] and then to the [[North Bondi]] tram terminus.\n\nA feature of this line was the large three track terminus cut into a hillside at North Bondi, which opened in 1946. \nThe line opened in 1884 as a steam tramway to Bondi, then to [[Bondi Beach]] in 1894, and to [[North Bondi, New South Wales|North Bondi]] in 1929.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article16531427|title=BONDI TRAMS.|date=1929-02-15|work=Sydney Morning Herald (NSW : 1842 - 1954)|access-date=2018-07-07|pages=17}}</ref> Electric services commenced in 1902.

The trams on the left were for the Western Suburbs via George Street, while trams on the right were for the Eastern Suburbs via Elizabeth Street.]]\nHeading south down [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] from [[Circular Quay]], the line turned left into [[Park Street, Sydney|Park Street]], then wound through [[East Sydney, New South Wales|East Sydney]] via a right turn into Yurong Street, a left turn into Stanley Street, a right turn into Bourke Street, then a left turn into Burton Street.\n\nA spur line existed linking Burton Street to the prisoners entrance on Forbes Street at the rear of the Darlinghurst Courthouse. This was to allow prisoners to be transferred from [[Long Bay Correctional Centre|Long Bay Gaol]] or elsewhere by tram to Darlinghurst Courthouse.<ref>[East Sydney Technical College, Court and Old Gaol 1 Jan 1933 ~1 Jan 1933 Archives of City of Sydney http://tools.cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au/AI2/Entity.aspx?Path=\\Item\\4011]</ref> Tram 948 was especially built on a N class frame for this purpose and survives at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]].\n\nA feature was the tram only viaduct over Barcom Avenue and Boundary Street in [[Darlinghurst]] as the line headed into MacDonald Street. This viaduct is now a road bridge.\n\nThe line then twisted down Glenmore, Gurner and Hargrave Streets in [[Paddington, New South Wales|Paddington]], then Moncur and Queen Streets in [[Woollahra]]. Here, a connection to [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] allowed access to [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley Tram Depot]].\n\nThe line then travelled down Edgecliff and Victoria Roads, then wound along Birriga Road in [[Bellevue Hill, New South Wales|Bellevue Hill]], finally running down Curlewis Street in Bondi to join the Bondi Beach via Bondi Junction line on [[Bondi Beach#Commercial area|Campbell Parade]], to the [[North Bondi]] terminus.\n\nThe line was double track throughout with numerous points to allow short working. Services operated from Circular Quay via Elizabeth Street and Park Street. The line opened to Bellevue Hill in 1909, and to Bondi Beach in 1914. The line was cut back to Ocean Street, Woollahra in 1955; the remainder closed on 27 June 1959. The line followed approximately the current route of State Transit' route 389 between the city and Woollahra and route X84 between Woollahra and Bondi Beach.\n\n===Bronte Line===\nThis line branched from the North Bondi via Bondi Junction line at [[Bondi Junction]], running down Bronte Road and MacPherson Street to [[Bronte, New South Wales|Bronte Beach]]. A feature of this line was the final approach to Bronte Beach in a rock cutting parallel to the [[Pacific Ocean]].\n\nThe line opened to Waverley in 1890, then to Bronte in 1911. Electric services started to [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]] in 1902, then Bronte in 1911. Through services ran from [[Circular Quay]] or [[Railway Square]]. The line was closed in the early hours of 28 February 1960, the same day as the Bondi via Oxford Street line, and replaced by a bus service, with Bondi Junction route 379 following the route.\n\n===Clovelly Line===\nThe line branched from the line to [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] at Darley Road in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]]. It ran north along Darley Road, then turned right into Clovelly Road to run down to its terminus at [[Clovelly, New South Wales|Clovelly Beach]].\n\nThe line opened from Darley Road to the intersection of Clovelly and Carrington Roads in 1912, then to Clovelly in 1913. Though services ran from [[Circular Quay]] and from [[Railway Square]] (from 1923). The line closed on 27 September 1957 in conjunction with the closure of the Pitt and Castlereagh street lines on the same day as the Clovelly trams used these streets in the city. The tram line followed the current route of State Transit route 339.\n\n===Coogee Line===\nThis line branched from [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] at Alison Road, and ran on its own tram reservation beside [[Centennial Park, New South Wales|Centennial Park]] as far as Darley Road.\n\nIt then ran, first alongside, then later along King Street beside the [[Randwick Bus Depot|Randwick Tramway Workshops]], then ran in its own reservation to Belmore Road.\n\nIt then ran down Perouse Road, St Pauls Street, Carr Street and Arden Street before terminating in a [[balloon loop]] in Dolphin Street, [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee Beach]].\n\nIt ran through several small tram reservations on its way down from Randwick to the beach. The line from the city to [[Randwick Racecourse]] opened in 1880, the first suburban extension of the system.\n\nIt was extended to High Street, Randwick in 1881 (in which year the Randwick Tramway Workshops also opened) and to Coogee in 1883, and electric services were introduced in 1902.\n\nThe line closed in October 1960. It follows the current route of State Transit route 373.\n\n===La Perouse Line===\n[[File:Kings Cross Sydney 1950.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] 1950 with an R1 class tram returning from Watson's Bay to Queens Square.]]\nThe La Perouse line was the second longest of the Sydney system (when at maximum extent) and was the last line (along with the Maroubra Line) to close.\n\nThis line branched from [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] at [[Taylor Square]] in [[Darlinghurst, New South Wales|Darlinghurst]] to run south along Flinders Street, then onto its own tram reservation along the eastern side of [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] beside [[Moore Park, New South Wales|Moore Park]]. The section of this line from the city as far as Alison Road began life in 1880 as the first suburban extension to Randwick (see Coogee Line). It contained what was probably the world's first use of a balloon loop for tramways, built in Moore Park in 1881. The Sydney system made extensive use of loops.\n\nFrom Alison Road, the La Perouse Line proceeded down the centre of Anzac Parade through [[Maroubra Junction]], and [[Malabar, New South Wales|Malabar]] to its balloon loop terminus at [[La Perouse, New South Wales|La Perouse]]. At Malabar a single line branched off to serve [[Long Bay Correctional Centre|Long Bay Gaol]]. The line was double track throughout. In 1934 the fourth section of the La Perouse tramline was built to [[Bunnerong Power Station]] in [[Matraville]] to encourage residential and industrial growth in the area.\n\nThe line was built in stages from 1900 to 1902. It was the final line to close on 25 February 1961. The line followed the current route of State Transit route L94/394.\n\n===Maroubra Line===\nThis line branched off the line to La Perouse at the intersection of [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] and Maroubra Road, travelling east along Maroubra Road, Cooper Street (now Mons Avenue), French Street and Mons Avenue before terminating in a balloon loop in Marine Parade, [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra Beach]].\n\nThe line was double track throughout, and passed through several tram reservations on its descent down to the beach. Direct services operated from [[Circular Quay]] and [[Railway Square]].\n\nThe line opened from Anzac Parade to Maroubra Beach in 1921, and was the second last line to close on 25 February 1961 (followed by the La Perouse line). The line followed the current route of State Transit route 397.\n\n===Cross Country Line (Bondi Junction to Coogee)===\nThis line branched off Bronte Road at [[Waverley, New South Wales|Waverley]] and travelled south down Albion Street and Frenchmans Road, then via Frances and Cook Streets to join the Coogee line at Belmore Road in [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick]].\n\nThe line was single track throughout, with a passing loop on Frenchmans Road. Initially services ran from the junction at Albion Street in Wavelery to Randwick only, this was later extended to [[Coogee, New South Wales|Coogee]] in 1907.\n\nFrom 1910, through services operated from [[Bondi Beach]] to Coogee Beach, and later additionally from [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley Tram Depot]] to Coogee Beach.\n\nThe line opened as a steam tramway in 1887, and was electrified in 1902. It closed in 1954, replaced by bus route 313.\n\n===West Kensington via Surry Hills Line===\nThis line branched from the tramlines in [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] and ran down [[Crown Street, Sydney|Crown Street]] to [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] in [[Surry Hills, New South Wales|Surry Hills]], then south along Baptist Street to Phillip Street, where it swung left into Crescent Street before running south along Dowling Street.\n\nIt passed the [[Dowling Street Tram Depot]], then turned left into Todman Avenue where it terminated at [[Kensington, New South Wales|West Kensington]]. Services operated full-time from [[Circular Quay]], and to [[Railway Square]] in peak hours.\n\nThe line opened in 1881 down Crown Street as far as Cleveland Street as a steam tramway.\n\nIt was extended to Phillip Street in 1909, Todman Avenue in 1912, and then to its final terminus down Todman Avenue in 1937.\n\nThe line down Crown Street closed in 1957, the remainder stayed open until 1961 to allow access to the Dowling Street Depot.\n\nState Transit routes 301, 302 and 303 generally follow the route down Crown and Baptist Streets as far as Phillip Street.\n\n===Botany via Railway Square Line===\n[[File:Trams and traffic at Railway Square.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Railway Square]] tram interchange circa 1930. L, N and O Class trams can be seen. The waiting shed in this photo has been preserved by the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]]]]\n\nServices operated from [[Circular Quay]] initially via [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], Chalmers and Redfern Streets (from 1902), then in 1933 via [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]]s, and Eddy Avenue, Lee and Regent Streets, to Botany Street in [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]].\n\nA single-track connection along Bourke and O'Dea Streets joined at the present day [[Green Square, New South Wales|Green Square]], allowing access to the [[Dowling Street Tram Depot]].\n\nThe line then passed down the entire length of Botany Road to [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]]. In [[Mascot, New South Wales|Mascot]], a branch led to the former [[Ascot Racecourse, Sydney|Ascot Racecourse]] at the site of [[Sydney Airport]].\n\nPoints were provided at Bay Street on Botany Road in [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]] for short working. The line was double track throughout.\n\nFrom [[Botany, New South Wales|Botany]], a single-track line crossed the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Botany Goods railway]] at Beauchamp Road, then passed along Perry Street and Bunnerong Road, past the former [[Bunnerong Power Station]] to join the La Perouse line at Yarra Junction. Generally a shuttle service operated on this single track section between Botany and La Perouse.\n\nThis single-track line was cut back to Military Road in 1935. The line opened in 1882 as a steam tramway to Botany, and electric services commenced in 1903.\n\nThe line from the junctions at Cleveland Street to Botany closed in 1960. State Transit route 309 generally follows the route.\n\n===Alexandria Line===\nThis line branched from the Botany line at the junction of Henderson and Botany Roads in [[Alexandria, New South Wales|Alexandria]].\n\nThe line proceeded down Erskineville Oval for short working. The line turned right into the present day Sydney Park Road (then known as an extension of Mitchell Road) before terminating at the junction with the Cook's River line at the [[Princes Highway]] near [[St Peters railway station]].\n\nServices operated from [[Circular Quay]] in a route similar to the Botany line as far as the Henderson Road junction.\n\nThe line opened in 1902 as a single-track electric line, duplicated in 1910. It was closed in 1959. State Transit route 308 generally follows the route as far as St Peters station.\n\n===Henderson Road (Erskineville) Line===\n[[File:Botany Rd Mascot.

Services operated from [[Circular Quay]].\n\nThe line was an electrified single track throughout. The line opened to Park Street in 1906 and to Bridge Street in 1909. The line was an early closure, in 1933. It was replaced by a private bus service that no longer operates.\n\n===Rosebery Line===\nThis line opened in 1902 initially via Chalmers and Redfern Streets and south along [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Street]] to [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]. In 1924, the line was extended to Epsom Road in [[Rosebery, New South Wales|Rosebery]].\n\nIn 1948, to facilitate construction of the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line]], a new line was constructed down Elizabeth Street between Devonshire Street and Redfern Street and the route was deviated to run down this new section.\n\nThe line was electrified double track throughout. The line was closed in 1957.\n\n===Daceyville Line===\nThis line branched from the Botany Road line at Gardners Road, and passed east along Gardners Road to join the lines at [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] at what was known as [[Daceyville, New South Wales|Daceyville]] Junction. It included a large collection of sidings at the former Rosebery Racecourse, now the site of The Lakes Golf Course. The full line opened in 1913, with services from [[Circular Quay]] via [[Waterloo, New South Wales|Waterloo]]. Some services were extended to [[Maroubra, New South Wales|Maroubra Beach]] via the Anzac Parade lines. The line closed in 1957.\n\n==Western Lines==\nThe Western Lines, also known as \"The Red Lines\" after the colour of the destination symbols and \"The George Street Lines\" (as they ran down [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] to Circular Quay), originated the majority of services from [[Fort Macquarie]] and [[Circular Quay]] down [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] to various destinations. In the peak hours and other busy periods, supplementary services operated from [[Railway Square]]. The 1920s were seen as a boom period. with up to 200 trams in use on lines to [[Leichardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]], [[Drummoyne]], [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]], [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]], [[Glebe, New South Wales|Glebe]] and [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]]. The tram lines to Glebe Point, Balmain (Gladstone Park), [[Lilyfield]], Leichhardt and [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]] were closed in November 1958.\n\n===Abbotsford via Leichhardt and Five Dock===\n[[File:Rozelle Tram Depot (5515644489).jpg|thumb|[[Rozelle Tram Depot]], 1919.

Trams to Leichhardt then continued down [[Norton Street]] to the original terminus at Darley Road Leichardt.\n\nThe Abbotsford line branched off the Leichhardt line at Marion Street, Leichhardt opposite the Leichardt Town Hall. The line followed Marion Street, Ramsey Street, [[Haberfield, New South Wales|Haberfield]], and then turned right onto Great North Road, travelling through Five Dock and [[Abbotsford, New South Wales|Abbotsford]] before terminating near The Terrace, connecting with ferry services at [[Abbotsford ferry wharf|Abbotsford wharf]].<ref>Gregory's Street Directory 1955 page 27 and 28</ref>\n\nThe line was closed between Five Dock and Abbotsford in 1954, Haberfield and Five Dock in 1956, and closed from Leichardt to Haberfield in 1958 with the closure of the \"George Street lines\".\n\n===Lilyfield===\nThe Lilyfield line branched off the Balmain line at Epping Junction (adjacent to [[Harold Park Paceway]] and the [[Rozelle Tram Depot]]) and then went via [[reserved track]] to Taylor Street and then right into Booth Street, [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]]. The tram line turned right into Catherine Street and terminated at the intersection of Abattoir Road and Grove Street, on the bridge over the railway goods yard.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 26</ref> This was the only tram terminus in Sydney located on a bridge. The Lilyfield line was closed in November 1958.\n\nThe current stop of the [[Dulwich Hill Line]] (numbered L1 and also known as the Inner West Light Rail) of Lilyfield is located underneath the bridge of the former terminus.\n\n===Balmain===\nThe first steam tram to service [[Darling Street]] was in 1892. Ten years later the service was electrified.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=lExV-ASBAtkC&pg=PA50&lpg=PA50&dq=rozelle+tram+depot&source=bl&ots=4hLJTBK3yv&sig=8ciBW_4UE6xo5yJOMcUZGsvmIIE&hl=en&ei=CGvAS8CFK8-TkAXj45TaBQ&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=49&ved=0CNsBEOgBMDA#v=onepage&q=rozelle%20tram%20depot&f=false A Pictorial History of Balmain, page 11]</ref> Services left the CBD via George Street and ran via George Street West (Now Broadway), Catherine Street, St Johns Road, Ross Street, in reservation to Crescent Street (now part of The Crescent). The line then crossed Johnstone Creek on a dedicated bridge before being on its own reservation where it rejoined street running along The Crescent. The line then traveled Commercial Road to Barnes Street and then Weston Road. The line turned into Darling Street to the terminus at Darling Street Wharf.\n\nA feature of this line was a counterweight dummy system that controlled and assisted trams on a steep single-line section of track near the terminus at [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]]. Due to the very steep incline at the bottom of the street, the trams used a complex 'dummy' / counterweight system constructed under the road surface. A 4-wheel 'dummy' car sat on the single-track at the top of the hill, connected via a large sheave under the track to the counterweight running on a narrow-gauge track in a tunnel under the road. A tram destined for the wharf would close-up to the dummy and push it down the steep hill (gradient 1 in 8), thus raising the counterweight and being assisted in braking. The tram was then assisted up the hill by the weight of the descending counterweight via the dummy. The dummy is behind car 2010 in the photograph below, and is on display at the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]]. The slot through which the dummy was fixed to the cable can be seen in that photograph.\n\n[[Circular Quay]] to [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] tram services terminated at Gladstone Park for most of the life of the system. [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]] was the terminus for the cross suburban route to [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]]. The Canterbury to Darling Street wharf service ceased in 1954. Until 1955, City to Balmain services continued to the wharf, when buses replaced trams between Gladstone Park and the wharf. Balmain services were closed with other western line services in November 1958.

This route follows the contemporary 441 bus route.<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, Map 26, 26A, 1, and 13</ref> Service to [[Birchgrove, New South Wales|Birchgrove]] was terminated in 1954.\n\n===Glebe Point===\nThis line travelling from the city branched off onto [[Glebe Point Road]] from [[Parramatta Road]], terminating near the corner of Pendrill Street.<ref name=\"Gregory's Street Directory 1955, p 5\">Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, map 5</ref>\n\n===Ryde and Drummoyne===\n[[File:Rozelletram.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Sydney R-Class Tram|R1 2010]] at [[Balmain East ferry wharf|Darling Street wharf]]]]\nThe line to Ryde (Station) was the longest line of the Sydney system. When cut back to Drummoyne the La Perouse line took over the title.\n\nRyde services ran the full length of [[George Street, Sydney|George Street]] and turned into [[Harris Street]] just after [[Railway Square]] following the same route as today's route 501 bus service. Trams went along Harris Street and crossed the [[Glebe Island Bridge]]. From White Bay junction until the Darling Street junction, Ryde trams shared tracks in [[Victoria Road (Sydney)|Victoria Road]] with the Balmain and Birchgrove lines. The tram then crossed the [[Iron Cove Bridge]] and the former [[Gladesville Bridge]] before turning right onto Blaxland Road. It then wound its way along Blaxland Road, behind the site of the current council chambers, terminating near the intersection of Pope and Devlin Street in [[Ryde, New South Wales|Ryde]].<ref>Gregory's Street Directory, 1955, map 72, 26</ref>\n\nThere was a peak hour service to [[Drummoyne]] via [[Forest Lodge, New South Wales|Forest Lodge]]. At Forest Lodge the line swung right into Ross Street before entering onto its own [[reserved track]], now known as Minogue Crescent, passing [[Rozelle Tram Depot]]. This joined the main Victoria Road Ryde line at White Bay junction.\n\nIt was initially a single line, later duplicated from [[Rozelle]] to Ryde between 1906 and 1936. The tram terminus was established at the western end of Blaxland Road, located near the current [[Top Ryde City]] shopping centre, and extended down Victoria Road through [[Gladesville]], where it eventually terminated at [[Fort Macquarie]] (present site of the [[Sydney Opera House]]). The entire trip took approximately 61 minutes to complete, and was the single longest route on the Sydney tram network, measuring 10 miles 61 chains (17.3&nbsp;km) via [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]].\n\nIn 1914 a single tram line was added between Ryde Post Office (corner of Church Street and Parkes Street) and [[West Ryde railway station]]. The Sydney to Ryde service became very popular, particularly at weekends when Sydney residents would travel to the orchards of the Ryde District to buy produce.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rta.nsw.gov.au/cgi-bin/index.cgi?action=heritage.show&id=4310588 |title=Tram Track on Blaxland Road, Ryde |publisher=Rta.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n\nThe tram service from Ryde to the city was cut back to Drummoyne on 19 January 1949 and replaced by buses.<ref>[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18145643 Buses Replace Trams To-day On Ryde Route] ''Sydney Morning Herald'' 19 December 1949 p.3 accessed 4 April 2012</ref> The service to Drummoyne was terminated in 1953.\n\n===Balmain via Pyrmont===\nServices commenced at [[Railway Square]], travelling south-west on [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]], turning right onto [[Harris Street]], passing the former [[Metropolitan Goods railway line|Darling Harbour goods yard]]. At [[Pyrmont, New South Wales|Pyrmont]] a separate line branched off from the main line on Harris Street, turning left into Miller Street, turning right into Bank Street, crossing the former [[Glebe Island Bridge]].

Four lines then proceeded to [[Cooks River]], [[Dulwich Hill]], [[Canterbury, New South Wales|Canterbury]] and [[Earlwood]]. A short lived line also operated between Canterbury and [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]]. Most of these lines were closed on 27 September 1957, in conjunction with the closure of the Pitt and Castlereagh lines through the CBD on the same day.\n\n===Cooks River Line===\nThis line ran south-west along City Road from [[Broadway, Sydney|Broadway]], then along [[King Street, Newtown|King Street]], [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], past [[Newtown railway station, Sydney|Newtown]] and [[St Peters railway station|St Peters]] railway stations to the [[Princes Highway]].\n\nIt then proceeded down the Princes Highway to its terminus at the [[Cooks River]]. At [[Tempe, New South Wales|Tempe]], a connection lead to the [[Tempe Bus Depot|Tempe Tram Depot]], on the corner of the Princes Highway and Gannon Street.\n\nPast the terminus at the [[Cooks River]], a single line led over the river to the Wolli Creek Perway Yard. The line reached St Peters as a steam tramway in 1891, then to Cooks River in 1900 when electric services commenced.\n\nThe line closed on 27 September 1957 with today's [[Transit Systems Sydney]] route 422 parallelling the former line, with occasional extensions to Kogarah.\n\n===Dulwich Hill Line===\nThis line branched from the line to Cooks River at [[Newtown, New South Wales|Newtown]], and travelled down Enmore Road through [[Enmore, New South Wales|Enmore]], then along Victoria Road to Marrickville Road before tuning right along Marrickville Road through [[Marrickville]] and [[Dulwich Hill]] to New Canterbury Road. At the New Canterbury Road terminus, a tram turning loop was provided, this is currently used as a layover area for buses. Current Transit Systems Sydney route 426 follows this tramline.

A cross country service operated between [[Cooks River]] and [[Dulwich Hill]]. Transit Systems Sydney route 425 follows this route, but now terminates 400m up the road at Tempe Depot. The line closed on 27 September 1957.\n\n===Hurlstone Park to Summer Hill Line===\nA short-lived single track line operated from the Canterbury Line at [[Hurlstone Park]] along Old Canterbury Road and Prospect Road to [[Summer Hill railway station]]. Services operated between Canterbury and Summer Hill from 1915 however low patronage and competition from motor buses saw the line close in 1933. The disused track and overhead remained in place until the 1950s. This line was in use in the early 1950s. There were double tracks opposite [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar School]] in Prospect Road.\n\n===Erskineville Line===\nThis line branched from tracks at Regent Street in [[Chippendale, New South Wales|Chippendale]], and passed west along Meagher Street, then south into Abercombie Street, across the junction with Cleveland Street through Golden Grove, before swinging south into Golden Grove Street then right into Wilson Street.\n\nThe line then passed under the railway lines at Burren Street, adjacent to the entrance to [[Macdonaldtown railway station]].\n\nThe line then became a single track loop passing up Burren Street to Erskineville Road, then west to Septimus Street, then Albert Street before rejoining the tracks at Burren Street. Services operated from [[Circular Quay]] using the [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]] lines.\n\nThe line opened as an electric double track tramway in 1909. The line south of [[Cleveland Street, Sydney|Cleveland Street]] closed in 1940, with the northern section used by other services until its closure in 1958.\n\n==Southern Suburbs Lines==\n'''The following lines were all isolated from the main system.'''\n\n===Rockdale to Brighton-Le-Sands Line===\n[[File:Southern sydney trams.png|right|thumb|300px|Southern Sydney tramways map]]\nThis line opened as a private steam tramway in 1885. It was electrified in 1900, and moved into government ownership in 1914.\n\nThe line connected with the trains at [[Rockdale railway station|Rockdale station]] in a direct extension of Bay Street, now reshaped, but still known as Tramway Arcade, then passed down Bay Street to [[Brighton-Le-Sands, New South Wales|Brighton-Le-Sands]].\n\nAt The Grand Parade, the line turned right and terminated at the intersection of The Grand Parade and Teralba Road.\n\nThe line was single track throughout, running on the northern side of Bay Street, and down the middle of The Grand Parade, with a double track at each end, and a passing loop between Farr Street and West Botany Street, Rockdale. While travelling in Bay Street, the conductor operated from the kerb-side of the carriages, regardless of the direction of the tram.\n\nThe line closed in 1949 and was replaced by a bus service (currently route 478/9). A small depot on the north side of Bay Street Brighton-le-Sands, with a track entry between Aero Street and Francis Lane (now Francis Avenue) maintained the cars.\n\nWith regard to the suburb name, a lower case \"l\" was used for the central part of \"Brighton-le-Sands\" during the period in which the trams operated, but the official name was changed to an upper-case \"L\" some time afterwards.\n\n===Kogarah to Sans Souci Line===\n{{See also|Trolleybuses in Sydney}}\nThis steam tramway opened in 1887<ref name=\"Kogarah Council Timeline\">{{cite web|work=Kogarah Municipal Council| title=Kogarah Council Timeline|url=http://www.kogarah.nsw.gov.au/www/html/488-kogarah.asp| accessdate=19 July 2007}}</ref> using small railway locomotives and carriages.\n\nIn 1891 two conventional steam tram motors were built for the line by Henry Vale. Six C1 type trailers replaced the railway carriages around the same period.\n\nThe tramway operated for 50 years until it was replaced by an electric [[Trolleybuses in Sydney|trolleybus]] service in 1937.\n\nIt connected with trains at [[Kogarah railway station|Kogarah station]] by way of a large balloon loop through the streets, then passed south down Rocky Point Road to [[Sans Souci, New South Wales|Sans Souci]], [[Sandringham, New South Wales|Sandringham]] and [[Dolls Point]].\n\nSmall depots at Sandringham and Kogarah serviced the line. The line was single track at each end with a double-track middle section down Rocky Point Road.<ref>''The Kogarah-Sans Souci Tramway'' Eardley, G.H. [[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1957 pp177-190</ref> Track on the line was laid to railway standards to allow railway trucks to haul goods over the line. Although laid as double track along Rocky Point Road, the trams only used the most eastern track. The western track being laid to enable electric trams to be used, however this never happened as trolleybuses took over operation.\n\nWilson's 1917 map shows the route leaving Kogarah Station (no loop), then Gray Street, across Kogarah Road, and thence by a ROW to\nRocky Point Road, entering near Herman Street, thence along Russell Avenue, Clareville Street to the foreshore, then along the foreshore\n(now Cook Park) to Sans Souci/Rocky Point Road, then north along that road, rejoining the line at Russell Avenue.<ref>Wilson's Sydney and Suburban Street Directory 1931, p. 479.</ref>\n\n===Arncliffe to Bexley Line===\nThis steam tramway opened in 1909 and closed in 1926. It connected with trains at [[Arncliffe railway station|Arncliffe station]], and ran down Wollongong Road, then Forest Road through [[Bexley, New South Wales|Bexley]] before terminating at the corner of Forest and Preddys Roads, Bexley. The line was single track, with a passing loop midway. A small car shed at [[Arncliffe, New South Wales|Arncliffe]] maintained the trams.\n\n===Sutherland to Cronulla Line===\nThis line opened as a steam tramway between [[Sutherland railway station]] and [[Cronulla]]\u2019s Shelley Beach, in 1911. It closed to passengers and was replaced by a bus service in 1931, and closed completely in 1932. It pre-dated the [[Cronulla railway line]], which took over its role.<ref>[[Australian Railway History|Australian Railway Historical Society Bulletin]], December, 1963 pp181-194</ref>\n\n==North Shore Lines==\n[[File:Sydney north tram map.png|right|thumb|300px|North Shore Lines map]]\n[[File:Wynyard Former Tram Tunnels looking North.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Former Tram Tunnels leading to disused Platforms 1 and 2 at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard station]]]]\nA feature of these lines was the underground tram terminus at [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] (the only one in Australia), and the tracks over the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]]. Trams ran from Blue Street, [[North Sydney, New South Wales|North Sydney]] over a now-demolished steel arch bridge over the Harbour Bridge Roadway, then over the eastern side of the harbour bridge (now used by the [[Cahill Expressway]]), through a tram platform at [[Milsons Point railway station|Milsons Point]] similar to the [[Milsons Point railway station|railway station]] on the opposite side, and dived underground into platforms 1 and 2 of Wynyard station. These platforms were converted into a car park after the tramway's closure on 28 June 1958. Wynyard station's railway platforms are thus numbered 3-6.\n\nThe line along Military Road, opened in September 1893, was the first permanent electric tramway in Sydney and New South Wales.\n\nThe first part of the North Sydney tramway system was a double-track cable tramway which started at the original [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]], located where the north pylon of the Harbour Bridge is now. The line originally extended via Alfred Street (now Alfred Street South), Junction Street (now [[Pacific Highway (Australia)|Pacific Highway]]), Blue Street and Miller Streets to the [[Ridge Street Tram Depot|winding engine house and depot at Ridge Street]]. It used cable grip cars called \"dummies\" and unpowered trailer cars, similar to the large Melbourne cable tramway system but quite different from the surviving lines in San Francisco, where everything is combined in a single vehicle.\n\nThe original cable line was extended via Miller and Falcon Streets to [[Crows Nest, New South Wales|Crows Nest]], and later the whole line was electrified and extensions were built to various termini around the Lower North Shore.\n\nThe history of the North Sydney tramway system can be divided into three periods \u2013 the first from the original opening in 1886 to 1909, when the McMahons Point line opened. The second period covers the time until the Wynyard line was opened across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932, and the third from then until the general closure of the system in 1958.\n\n===First period 1886\u20131909===\n[[File:Spitt junction mosman 1900.jpg|300px|right|thumb|Opening ceremony for the [[Spit Junction]] tram line 3 November 1900 showing C and D class electric trams and cable trailer cars.]]\nIn the initial years of the North Sydney tramways, services operated from [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]] to:\n* [[Ridge Street Tram Depot]] was originally a cable tram depot which opened in May 1886.

It opened as far as Victoria Avenue, [[Willoughby, New South Wales|Willoughby]] in April 1898 and extended to [[Chatswood railway station|Chatswood station]] in July 1908. Through electric services from Milsons Point began when the original cable tramway was electrified in February 1900.\n* [[Lane Cove]]: opened as an electric line from Crows Nest in February 1900, with trams connecting with other electric services at Ridge Street.

The Milsons Point line was deviated at North Sydney via Walker and Mount Streets to avoid congestion at Victoria Cross. The McMahons Point line was opened to relieve the load on the [[Milsons Point ferry wharf|Milsons Point wharf]] and connecting tramway. Services to [[Lane Cove]] and [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]] were altered to operate to and from McMahons Point via the new direct route to Crows Nest. In conjunction with the construction of the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]], the Milsons Point line was diverted to a new terminus in Glen Street in July 1924. Escalators were provided to carry tram passengers to the new ferry wharf below.

After passing Botanic Road the line swung right onto Henry Plunkett Reserve. From this point the line went off-road and ascended uphill onto its own reservation, travelling through a narrow rock cutting, now public walking track (pictured). After a steep ascent through the reserve the line crossed several small residential streets along the way, such as; Mulbring, Gordon, Plunkett and Beaconsfield Street, before once again entering onto Gordon Street where the line swung right onto Middle Head Road.

Passenger traffic fell considerably by autumn that year, and services reverted to horse-drawn trams from 20 July 1903. However, following considerable increase in passengers during the next four years, steam trams were returned from 1 October 1907.\n\nA line was built to [[The Spit, New South Wales|The Spit]], and the Manly to Curl Curl line was progressively extended to [[Brookvale, New South Wales|Brookvale]], [[Collaroy]], and [[Narrabeen]]. A branch was run to [[Freshwater, New South Wales|Harbord]]. Electrification commenced with the construction of the line to The Spit, and was extended throughout the system.\n\nThe Narrabeen line was also used for carrying freight, for a spur was run to the freight wharf at Manly, and goods sidings were built at [[Balgowlah]] in Sydney Road near Wanganella Street; at Brookvale from a line in Alfred Road short of Federal Parade; and at Narrabeen near King Street.<ref>K. McCarthy (Ed. D. R. Keenan), The Manly Lines of the Sydney Tramway System, Transit Press, Sutherland, 1995, pp. 6-8, 10, 32</ref>\n\nVarious track layouts and routes existed in the early days in the vicinity of the Manly terminus, with quite different arrangements existing in 1903, 1911, 1912, and 1914.\nThe routes prior to 1914 used [[The Corso]] and North Steyne, but from 1914 were confined to Belgrave Street. The Manly lines closed on 1 October 1939.<ref>L. A. Clark, ''North of the Harbour'', ARHS, 1976, pp. 100-101</ref>\n\nThe Manly lines, which were administered by the Railways, suffered from maladministration (as in the case of the Castle Hill line), resulting in considerable overcapitalisation of the network, unnecessary re-routing and re-building of the track at Manly terminus. Consequently, the system never made a profit. Re-building the terminal at Manly terminus several times, accompanied by costly property resumption, accounted for huge expenditures with little gain.\n\nIn 1919 planning began to move slightly the balloon loop at Manly, requiring demolition and re-building the Pier Hotel. Rebuilding track in Belgrave street and the terminus was estimated to cost \u00a35,695, while land resumption including demolition of the Pier Hotel was estimated at \u00a340,000 (less \u00a33,500 from sale of land). The hotel was demolished in 1924.\n\nThe Department was slow to provide a speedy service. It persisted in scheduling the long-distance trams behind the all-stops (instead of the other way around).  It rejected residents' suggestions to schedule the Narrabeen tram first, and to make the first set-down Dee Why or similar place. For nearly a decade from at least 1923, residents had been asking for faster services to Narrabeen.  The trip took 49 minutes. A new timetable was introduced from 1 November 1920, giving a trip time of 39 minutes, but it proved unworkable and the timetable reverted to an old one on 4 July 1921, back to 48 minutes.\n\nResidents wanted optional stopping and express running to Dee Why from Manly.  The Railways ignored those requests, and persisted in running the Narrabeen tram from Manly, behind the all-stops trams to Balgowlah and Harbord. Finally, when the Department moved to schedule Narrabeen trams first, with first set-down at Dee Why from 25 November 1931, it took only 31\u201333 minutes by tram from Manly to Narrabeen, down from 39 minutes previously, and down from 49 minutes when the service was inaugurated.<ref>K.

At Park Avenue a Right of way took the tram north, then east alongside Raglan Street, eventually joining Raglan Street at Kangaroo Road.\n\nFrom there, which was a junction for the Narrabeen line, the line turned south, finishing at a large loop at The Esplanade (Manly).<ref>1934 edition of Gregory's Street Directory of Sydney and Suburbs, facsimile edition 2006, maps 60, 74, 77</ref>  The [[Manly, New South Wales|Manly]] to Spit section opened on 9 January 1911.<ref>L.

Evidence of the catenary overhead is to be found in photographs in McCarthy's book.<ref>K. McCarthy (Ed. D. R. Keenan), ''The Manly Lines of the Sydney Tramway System'', Transit Press, Sutherland, pp. 37-38, 42, 57-58.</ref>\n\n==Enfield Lines==\n[[File:Enfield Coronation Parade.JPG|The Coronation Parade arch displays 4 light bulbs which were originally the holders for the four electricity cables that ran along the former tram line|thumb]]\nThe Enfield system was a separate group of lines based around a depot in [[Enfield, New South Wales|Enfield]], in Sydney's inner south-west.\n\nThe system began as a steam tramway opening in 1891 between [[Ashfield railway station, Sydney|Ashfield station]] and Enfield. In 1901, this line was extended north to [[Mortlake, New South Wales|Mortlake]], and in 1909 a branch to [[Cabarita, New South Wales|Cabarita]] Park was opened.\n\nThe system was electrified in 1912. Services operated from Ashfield station along [[Hume Highway|Liverpool Road]], Georges River Road, onto a reserved corridor that swung off Georges River Road at a point roughly opposite Windsor Avenue.\n\nFrom this point the corridor ran diagonally towards, then across Burwood Road and onto what is now Tangarra Street East.\n\nThe reserved corridor ended at Portland Street, at which point the line continued west along the length of Tangarra Street, then north along what is now Coronation Parade (the two parallel streets were originally known as, from east to west, The Boulevarde and Punchbowl Road), back to Liverpool Road heading east through Enfield, and then north along Burwood Road through [[Burwood, New South Wales|Burwood]].\n\nThe line then turned into Crane Street, then Majors Bay Road and Brewer Street to Cabarita Junction.\n\nThe line was double track until this point, then it split into single-track branches to Mortlake via Frederick, Vanhee and Gale Streets and Tenneyson Road, and to Cabarita via Cabarita Road.\n\nShort services were turned back at Brighton Avenue, Plymouth Street, Enfield, [[Burwood railway station, Sydney|Burwood station]] and Wellbank Street.\n\nServices operated every five minutes between Ashfield and Wellbank Street in peak periods, and every 15 minutes (30 minutes at off-peak times) on the two branches.\n\nA depot on Tangarra Street, near Kembla Street and Coronation Parade, served the lines.\n\nAfter electrification, services were provided predominately by [[O-Class Tram|O Class trams]] after experimentation with other classes found that they were unable to operate the timetables due to topography challenges.\n\nThe lines closed in 1948, and were replaced by buses. Tramway infrastructure was removed throughout the route in 1951. The Tangarra Street depot was used by buses until its closure in 1989.\n\nThe depot was demolished to make way for housing. A small brick hut used as a waiting room for passengers still stands on the western side of the Coronation Parade reserve near Dean Street. This is one of very few surviving remnants of the line.\n\nThe reserved tramway corridor at [[Croydon Park, New South Wales|Croydon Park]] is now residential property from its eastern limit starting at Georges River Road opposite Windsor Avenue and running diagonally to Burwood Road, and also from Burwood Road to Tangarra Street East (with property boundaries following the route of the corridor). Tangarra Street East, which did not exist in the days of tram operation, follows the route of the remainder of the corridor to its western limit at the intersection with Portland Street.\n\n==Castle Hill line==\n{{main|Rogans Hill railway line}}\nA steam tramway opened between [[Parramatta]] and [[Baulkham Hills]] in 1902, and was extended to [[Castle Hill, New South Wales|Castle Hill]] in 1910, carrying passengers and produce to and from the area.\n\nThis tramway commenced at Argyle Street in Parramatta and tracked north along Church Street to [[Northmead]], then along [[Windsor Road, Sydney|Windsor Road]] and Old Northern Road to Castle Hill.\n\nIn 1919, the NSW government decided to convert the tramway into a [[Rogans Hill railway line|railway]] to encourage the subdivision of estates for residential use. This involved a new connection to the Main Western Railway at Westmead and a new line to Northmead.\n\nThe section from Argyle Street Parramatta to Northmead became an isolated line before closing not long after the railway began operations.\n\nThe railway line was later extended to [[Rogans Hill]] in 1924. The new line proved to be unsuccessful and was closed on 31 January 1932 and was seen by members of the public as turning a perfect tramway into an underperforming railway.\n\n==Rolling stock==\n[[File:First Tram across Bridge (8368180041).jpg|thumb|left|[[Sydney R-Class Tram|O1106]] at the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] opening in May 1932]]\n\nIn 1905 an [[Sydney Tram Classification|alphabetical classification]] was introduced to the NSW Government Tramways. Generally the letters A and B were allotted to steam stock, with letters [[Sydney C-Class Tram|C]] to [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R]] (R1) (with the exception of the letters I and Q) to electric cars based on the seating capacity of the class. The letter S was added after the fleet number for service (non-passenger) stock.\n\nPerhaps the most famous well-remembered of the electric trams that operated in Sydney were the [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O]] and [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P class]] trams known officially as ''[[Running board|footboard cars]]'', after the footboards running along the length of each side of these trams, and upon which conductors precariously balanced to collect fares. However they were mostly referred to as ''toastrack trams'' for their cross-bench wooden seating layout that resembled a toast rack of the time. Their high seating capacity of 80 (with a crush load of 180 when in coupled set) was a major advantage for Sydney's crowded system, specialty for major events such as [[Sydney Royal Easter Show|The Royal Easter Show]] at Moore Park and horse race meetings at [[Randwick Racecourse]]. They were routinely coupled in pairs to run as ''Coupled Set''. 626 [[Sydney O-Class Tram|O class]] and 258 [[Sydney P-Class Tram|P class]] trams were constructed from 1908, with some remaining in service until 1958 with the closure of the George Street lines.\n\nThe first modern ''corridor'' style tram numbered 1738 of the [[Sydney R-Class Tram|R Class]] was introduced on 29 September 1933, offering 48 seats in the comfort of being fully enclosed from the weather, padded upholstered seating in the main saloons and the safety of a corridor running internally the full length of the tram assist with the collection of fares and movement between seats, these cars were seen an improvement comfort wise over the older \"toastrack trams\" however lacked the seating numbers of the O and P classes.\n\nOriginally 200 of the R class were ordered, however the last 5 of the class had modifications made to them during construction due to consultation with both staff and the traveling public to increase the number of seating and ease of movement, These cars 1933 to 1937 were known as the R/R1 class cars and the modifications were distinctly noticeable compared to both the R and R1 classes.\n\nThe final order of tramcars for Sydney was for the [[Sydney R1-Class Tram|R1 class]]. Like their predecessors the R Class, these cars were of the corridor arrangement and built to body shape closer to the R/R1 class. However unlike the R class the R1 class had only one saloon (as opposed to a saloon at either end and a drop-centre section in the middle) but had the increased seating of 56. The First 50 were ordered and delivered prior to World War 2, with a further 250 ordered in the late 1940s, however due to steel shortages after the war, the first of the 250 did not enter service until 1950 with the last entering service to North Sydney Depot in 1953.\n\nDue to the delays in receiving trams and ongoing steel shortages, the last 150 of the order was cancelled spelling the final end of Sydney's trams. Some of these cars had not been in service long enough for a major overhaul before their withdrawal between 1958 and February 1961.\n\nUnlike the preceding O and P class trams that were fitted with [[Multiple Unit]] equipment, neither the R nor R1 classes were fitted and so could not operate in coupled sets. They could be coupled, however there was no provision to operate them in coupled service because there were no cables for air or power connections to the trailing car due to the lack of equipment.\n\nUpon withdrawal, most cars were stripped of their metal components such as bogies and anything that either could be used to keep other trams running or sold as salvageable scrap metal.\n\nCars were then towed from their respective depots or driven directly to [[Randwick Bus Depot|Randwick Tramway Workshops]] at the end of their last day of operation and the placed on the sidings known in tramway circles as 'burning hill'. As many as 15 trams could be burnt in any one day during the height of tram disposal.\n\nSome were sold as stripped shells to private users to be used as campground shelters and storage sheds (all classes) or workers/camping accommodation (mostly those of the R and R1 class).\n\nTrams burnt of the R, R/R1 and R1 classes, although mostly made of steel construction, were less that 8 years old at time of being burnt and was seen by some members of society as an official act of vandalism and a waste of resources (especially steel) by the government of the period.<ref>Shooting Through by the Sydney Tramway Museum</ref>\n\nIn 1950, L/P class tram 154 was the first of Sydney's trams (and first in Australia) to be preserved the fledgling Australian Electric Traction Association, later known as the [[Sydney Tramway Museum]], beginning the preservation of nearly every class of tram. The collection of preserved trams has grown to include the last known examples of some classes and even enabled the recreation of multiple set operations of a coupled set of O class cars, however there are no known examples of the G,H or M classes of trams.\n\n==Accidents==\n* On 21 August 1924, a coupled set of E-class cars ran out of control near McMahon's Point, derailed and crashed into a house.  There were two fatalities, and the trams were extensively damaged.<ref>D. R. Keenan, ''The North Sydney Lines of the Sydney Tramway system'', Transit Press, Sans Souci, n.d., pp. 35, 104 with photographs</ref>\n* In 1929, a P-class tram crashed into a barber's shop on the corner of Quay and Ultimo Roads near Central Station. Almost half of the tramcar ended up in the shop.\n* There were accidents at [[Taronga Zoo ferry wharf|Athol Wharf]], [[Taronga Park]], when trams lost control running down the steep hill and ended up in the harbour, in 1942, 1952 and 1958.<ref>{{cite web|author=lindsaybridge No real name given + Add Contact |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/intervene/4129812411/in/set-72157605298170997/ |title=1958 [439&#93; TOO FAR! &#124; Flickr \u2013 Photo Sharing! |publisher=Flickr |date= |accessdate=2012-11-07}}</ref>\n* Scores of accidents \u2013 some fatal \u2013 befell tram conductors while collecting fares from the footboard of moving trams.

''Tramways of Sydney''. Transit Press 1979</ref> a small section of the original tram tacks were uncovered during roadworks in late 2009. The City of Sydney have left these exposed to serve as a historical reminder.\n*A section of uncovered tramway track was, until late 2015, visible along O'Dea Avenue in [[Zetland, New South Wales|Zetland]]. The single track was visible through the concrete road surface for a few hundred metres, but was mostly removed during storm water improvement works through 2015 - 2016. The removal of this section can be seen in Google StreetView Timeline, where the lines were clearly visible in 2014, but began to be obscured in later years.  Occasionally other buried sections of track are exposed when roadworks are carried out. For example, at the intersection of Victoria Avenue and Penshurst Street, [[Chatswood, New South Wales|Chatswood]], extensive tram tracks are visible whenever road resurfacing is carried out.\n*There is a small section of tram track going in both directions on Lower Fort Street Road in [[Millers Point]].\n*There is a small fragment of tram track exposed in the Moore Park grounds near the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]].\n*There is a small fragment of tram track exposed on [[Old South Head Road]], [[Watsons Bay]] at the top of Heart Break Hill.\n*The tracks in [[Pitt Street|Pitt]] and [[Castlereagh Street]]s were asphalted over and were not removed. Occasionally they appear through the road surface.\n*Several ornate tram shelters still stand, such as at the corner of [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]] and [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth Streets]], City.\n*At [[North Bondi]] and [[Bronte, New South Wales|Bronte]], bus shelters are built into small cuttings that were previously tram stops.\n*Ornamental rosettes located where overhead wiring span wires were attached can be seen on many older buildings and rock faces, there are seven on a rock wall near the [[Sydney Opera House]] at the site of [[Fort Macquarie Tram Depot|Fort Macquarie Depot]] as well as on buildings in the CBD.\n*Many street corners where trams turned were 'cut-back' to allow space for trams to turn, and subsequently many buildings on such corners still have rounded fronts.\n*The abnormally wide median strip in [[Anzac Parade, Sydney|Anzac Parade]] south of [[Kingsford, New South Wales|Kingsford]] once accommodated tram line to La Perouse and Maroubra Beach.\n*Between Beach Road and Ramsgate Ave on Campbell Parade Bondi Beach, the area between the lanes that is now car parking space was once the line from Bondi to North Bondi.\n*The open space at North Bondi that is the bus terminal was once a three track terminal for all lines to Bondi. The terminal was cut into the hill and was filled in for bus operations.\n*When walking up the steps to [[The Gap (Sydney)|The Gap]] at [[Watsons Bay]], there is flat ground in between two sets of steps. This continues for a fair way in both directions, and is the old tram right of way.\n*The round cut rock wall opposite Mosman Bay ferry wharf was cut back to allow a balloon loop for the trams.\n*The [[Ultimo Tram Depot]] is now part of the [[Powerhouse Museum]].\n*Tunnel Portals to [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard]] from the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] still exist and can be seen from the pedestrian walkway.\n*Former location of Wynyard tram platforms is now part of the Wynyard Lane Car Park at the station. The \n*[[Millers Point]] tram tracks were buried by bitumen when the lines were closed, as the line which comprised the stop at Millers Point where State Transit terminate, was dug up around 1979-80 and the tram lines were removed and a new road surface laid.\n*During construction of the CBD and South East light rail at many points workers found many of the original tracks under the road surface. Rail that was salvageable was donated to the Sydney Tramway Museum.\n\nA map of these and other surviving physical remnants has been created.

Many suburbs with \"Junction\" in their name reflect their tramway heritage, such as [[Bondi Junction]], [[Randwick, New South Wales|Randwick Junction]], and [[Maroubra Junction]].\n*The eastern most southbound traffic lanes on the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge]] were originally constructed to carry the City and Suburban Railway but were used for trams, and are still separated from and clearly distinguishable from the other six road lanes, with the remnants of the eastern Milsons Point station (tram) located at the site of the former northern toll plaza of the [[Cahill Expressway]].\n* [[Wynyard railway station, Sydney|Wynyard railway station]] platforms are still numbered from 3 to 6. Platforms 1 and 2 were tram platforms and the railway platforms were never renumbered when the tram platforms were removed.\n*On many buildings within the CBD of Sydney, Rosettes are still attached to walls on streets that trams ran on. These are the points of attachment for the overhead wires used to provide power to the trams.\n*[[White Bay Power Station|White Bay]] (derelict) and [[Ultimo Power Station|Ultimo]] (now the [[Powerhouse Museum]]) power stations were constructed by the New South Wales government to provide power to both the railways and the tramways survive.\n*[[Rozelle Tram Depot|Rozelle]] (Now Tramsheds), [[Newtown Tram Depot|Newtown]] (derelict), [[Ultimo Tram Depot|Ultimo]] (owned by [[Powerhouse Museum]] as storage), [[Tempe Bus Depot|Tempe]] (Now Transit System Bus Depot), [[Waverley Bus Depot|Waverley]] (Now Sydney Buses Depot) and [[Leichhardt Bus Depot|Leichhardt]] (Now as the [[Sydney Bus Museum]] and Transit Systems bus depot) tram depots all still exist.\n* [[wikt:shoot through like a Bondi tram|Shoot through like a Bondi tram]] is a phrase still used in Sydney, meaning to depart in haste.\n*Preserved Steam Motor Tram Motor 1A, owned by the [[Powerhouse Museum]], Motor 100A (operational) at the [[Museum of Transport and Technology]], [[Auckland]] New Zealand, Motor 103A (operational at [[Valley Heights Locomotive Depot Heritage Museum|Valley Heights Rail Museum]] with trailers 93B (operational) and 72B (Awaiting restoration) and replica Double Deck trailer built by Randwick Workshops on the frame of K class car 746.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Transport|New South Wales}}\n* [[Light rail in Sydney]]\n* [[List of light-rail transit systems]]\n* [[Public transport in Sydney]]\n* [[Trams in Australia]]\n* [[Transportation in Australia]]\n*[[Sydney Tramway Museum]]\n\n==Further reading==\n* D Budd et al.: ''Wait Here for Trams: Sydney's Trams, the Last Decade''.

Vickery]]; delivered to the [[Keystone Tankship Corporation]] and operated by that company until acquired by the [[United States Navy]] on 26 June 1941; renamed '''''Suwannee''''' (AO-33); and commissioned on 16 July 1941, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Joseph R. Lannom in command.\n\n==World War II==\nAfter operating for six months as an oiler with the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], ''Suwannee'' was redesignated '''AVG-27''' on 14 February 1942 and decommissioned on 21 February at [[Newport News, Virginia]], for conversion to a {{sclass-|Sangamon|escort carrier}}. On 20 August, she was redesignated an auxiliary carrier, '''ACV-27''', and was recommissioned as such on 24 September 1942, Captain [[Joseph J. Clark]] in command.\n\n===1942===\nLess than a month after commissioning, ''Suwannee'' was underway from [[Hampton Roads]] for the [[Operation Torch|invasion of North Africa]]. She joined {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}} as the other carrier attached to the Center Attack Group whose specific objective was [[Casablanca]] itself, via [[Fedhala]] just to the north. Early in the morning of 8 November, she arrived off the coast of [[Morocco]] and, for the next few days, her [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s maintained combat and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] air patrols, while her [[Grumman TBF Avenger]]s joined ''Ranger''{{'}}s in bombing missions. During the [[Naval Battle of Casablanca]] from 8\u201311 November, ''Suwannee'' sent up 255 air sorties and lost only five planes, three in combat and two to operational problems.\n\nOn 11 November, off [[Fedhala Roads]], her anti-submarine patrol sank what was reported to be a [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]], but which was later determined to have been one of the three [[French Navy|French]] submarines which sortied from Casablanca on the day of the assault. She was the first escort carrier to score against the enemy undersea menace, and she helped to prove the usefulness of her type in anti-submarine warfare.\n\n[[File:Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat of VGF-27 aboard USS Suwanee (ACV-27), circa in late 1942 or early 1943 (80-G-K-15634).jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F]] \"Rosenblatt's Reply\" on ''Suwannee'', 1942\u201343.]]\n\n''Suwannee'' remained in North African waters until mid-November, then sailed, via [[Bermuda]], for [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. She arrived back at Hampton Roads on 24 November and stayed until 5 December, when she got underway for the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]].\n\n===1943===\nThe auxiliary carrier transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 11\u201312 December and arrived at [[New Caledonia]] on 4 January 1943. For the next seven months, she provided air escort for transports and supply ships replenishing and bolstering the marines on Guadalcanal, as well as for the forces occupying other islands in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] group. During that span of time, she visited [[Guadalcanal]], [[Efate]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] in addition to New Caledonia.\n\nShe returned to the United States at [[San Diego]] in October, and by 5 November was back at Espiritu Santo. On 13 November, she departed to participate in the [[Gilbert Islands campaign|Gilbert Islands operation]]. From 19\u201323 November, she was a part of the Air Support Group of the Southern Attack Force, and her planes bombed [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]], while the ships in the Northern Attack Force engaged the enemy at [[Makin (islands)|Makin]]. Following the occupation of the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilberts]], the escort carrier returned to the U.S., via [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving in San Diego on 21 December.\n\n===1944===\nShe remained on the west coast for two weeks into the new year, then set a course for [[Lahaina Roads]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. She departed Hawaii on 22 January 1944 and headed for the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]]. During [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|that operation]], ''Suwannee'' joined the Northern Attack Force, and her planes bombed and strafed [[Roi-Namur|Roi and Namur]] Islands, in the northern part of [[Kwajalein]] Atoll, and conducted anti-submarine patrols for the task force. She remained in the vicinity of Kwajalein for the first 15 days of February, then spent the next nine days helping out at [[Eniwetok]]. On 24 February, she headed east again and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 March for a two-week stay.\n\nBy 30 March, she was in the vicinity of the [[Palau Islands]] as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] subjected those islands to two days of extensive bombing raids. A week later, she put into Espiritu Santo for four days. After short stops at [[Purvis Bay]] in the Solomons and at [[Seeadler Harbor]], [[Manus Island|Manus]], the escort carrier headed for [[New Guinea]]. For two weeks, she supported the Hollandia landings by shuttling replacement aircraft to the larger fleet carriers actually engaged in air support of the landings. She returned to Manus on 5 May.\n\nFollowing two voyages from Espiritu Santo, one to [[Tulagi]] and the other to Kwajalein, ''Suwannee'' arrived off [[Saipan]] in mid-June. For the next one and a half months, she supported the invasion of the Marianas, participating in the campaigns against Saipan and Guam. On 19 June, as the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] began to unfold, ''Suwannee'' was one of the first ships to draw enemy blood when one of her planes flying combat air patrol attacked and sank the {{Jsub|I-184}}. ''Suwanee''{{'}}s planes did not actually become engaged in the famous battle of naval aircraft, because they remained with the invasion forces in the Marianas providing anti-submarine and combat air patrols.\n\nOn 4 August, she cleared the Marianas for Eniwetok and Seeadler Harbor, reaching the latter port on 13 August. Almost a month later, on 10 September, she put to sea to support the landings on [[Morotai]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. Those landings went off without opposition on 15 September, and ''Suwannee'' returned to Seeadler Harbor to prepare for the invasion of the [[Philippines]].\n\nOn 12 October, the escort carrier got underway from Manus in [[Rear Admiral]] [[Thomas L. Sprague]]'s Escort Carrier Group to provide air support for the [[Battle of Leyte|landings at Leyte Gulf]]. She reached the Philippines several days later, and her planes began strikes on enemy installations in the [[Visayas]] until 25 October. She provided air support for the assault forces with antisubmarine and combat air patrols and strikes against Japanese installations ashore.\n\nOn 24\u201325 October 1944, the Japanese launched a major surface offensive from three directions to contest the landings at [[Leyte Gulf]]. While [[Admiral]] [[Jisaburo Ozawa|Jisaburo Ozawa's]] Mobile Force sailed south from Japan and drew the bulk of Admiral [[William Halsey|William Halsey's]] [[United States Third Fleet|3d Fleet]] off to the north, Admiral Shima's 2nd Striking Force, along with Admiral [[Shoji Nishimura|Shoji Nishimura's]] Force, attempted to force the [[Surigao Strait]] from the south. This drew Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf|Jesse B. Oldendorf's]] Bombardment Group south to meet that threat in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]. With Admiral Oldendorf's old battleships fighting in Surigao Strait and Halsey's 3rd Fleet scurrying north, ''Suwannee'', with the other 15 escort carriers and 22 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, formed the only Allied naval force operating off Leyte Gulf when [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita|Takeo Kurita's]] 1st Striking Force sneaked through the unguarded [[San Bernardino Strait]] into the [[Philippine Sea]].\n\nJust before 07:00 on the 25th, one of {{USS|Kadashan Bay|CVE-76|2}}'s planes reported a Japanese force of four [[battleship]]s, eight [[cruiser]]s, and 11 destroyers. This force, Kurita's, immediately began a surface engagement with [[Rear Admiral]] [[Clifton Sprague|Clifton Sprague's]] \"Taffy 3\", the northernmost group of escort carriers. ''Suwannee'' was much farther south as an element of Rear Admiral Thomas Sprague's \"Taffy 1\". Consequently, she did not participate in the running surface [[Battle off Samar]].\n[[Image:CVE27 Kamikaze engine parts.jpg|240px|thumb|USS ''Suwannee'' after the ''kamikaze'' attack from 25 October 1944. Parts of the A6M5 Zero's [[Nakajima Sakae]] 21, 14-cylinder radial engine were found in the vicinity of the hit. Cylinder heads are destroyed, connecting rods and crankshaft are visible.]]\n\nHer problems came from another quarter. At 07:40 on the 25th, \"Taffy 1\" was jumped by land-based planes from [[Davao City|Davao]] in the first deliberate suicide attack of the war. The first one crashed into {{USS|Santee|CVE-29|2}}; and, 30 seconds later, ''Suwannee'' splashed a ''kamikaze'' during his run on {{USS|Petrof Bay|CVE-80|2}}. Her gunners soon shot down another enemy plane, then bore down on a third circling in the clouds at about {{convert|8000|ft|m|abbr=on}}. They hit the enemy, but he rolled over, dove at ''Suwannee'' and crashed into her at 08:04 about {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} forward of the after elevator, opening a {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} hole in her flight deck.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Peter C|title=Kamikaze To Die For The Emperor|date=2014|publisher=Pen & Sword Books Ltd|location=Barnsley, UK|isbn=9781781593134|pages=14\u201318}}</ref> His bomb compounded the fracture when it exploded between the flight and hangar decks, tearing a {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}} gash in the latter and causing a number of casualties.<ref name=\"Smith\" />\n\nMedical officer Lieutenant Walter B. Burwell wrote:\n\n<blockquote>One of our corpsmen tending the wounded on the flight deck saw the plight of those isolated by fire on the forecastle. He came below to report that medical help was critically needed there. It seemed to me that we would have to try to get through to them. So he and I restocked our first aid bags with morphine [[syrette]]s, tourniquets, [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfa]], Vaseline, and bandages, commandeered a fire extinguisher and made our way forward, dodging flames along the main deck. Along part of the way, we were joined by a sailor manning a seawater fire hose with fairly good pressure, and though the seawater would only scatter the gasoline fires away from us, by using the water and foam alternatively as we advanced, we managed to work our way up several decks, through passageways along the wrecked and burning combat information center and decoding area, through officers' country, and finally out on the forecastle. Many of the crew on the forecastle and the catwalks above it had been blown over the side by the explosions. But others trapped below and aft of the forecastle area found themselves under a curtain of fire from aviation gasoline pouring down from burning planes on the flight deck above. Their only escape was to leap aflame into the sea, but some were trapped so that they were incinerated before they could leap. By the time we arrived on the forecastle, the flow of gasoline had mostly consumed itself, and flames were only erupting and flickering from combustible areas of water and oil. Nonetheless, the decks and bulkheads were still blistering hot and ammunition in the small arms locker on the deck below was popping from the heat like strings of firecrackers. With each salvo of popping, two or three more panicky crew men would leap over the side, and we found that our most urgent task was to persuade those poised on the rail not to jump by a combination of physical restraint and reassurance that fires were being controlled and that more help was on the way. Most of the remaining wounded in the forecastle area were severely burned beyond recognition and hope.</blockquote>\n\nWithin two hours, her [[flight deck]] was sufficiently repaired to enable the escort carrier to resume air operations. ''Suwanee''{{'}}s group fought off two more air attacks before 13:00; then steamed in a northeasterly direction to join Taffy 3 and launch futile searches for Kurita's rapidly retiring force. Just after noon on 26 October, another group of ''kamikazes'' jumped Taffy 1. A Zero crashed into ''Suwanee''{{'}}s flight deck at 1240 and careened into a [[torpedo bomber]] which had just been recovered. The two planes erupted upon contact as did nine other planes on her flight deck. The resulting fire burned for several hours, but was finally brought under control. The casualties for 25\u201326 October were 107 dead and 160 wounded. The escort carriers put into [[Kossol Roads]] in the Palaus on 28 October, then headed for Manus for upkeep on 1 November.\n\n===1945===\nAfter five days in Seeadler Harbor, ''Suwannee'' got underway to return to the west coast for major repairs. She stopped at Pearl Harbor overnight on 19\u201320 November and arrived at [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] on 26 November. Her repairs were completed by 31 January 1945; and, after brief stops at [[Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard|Hunter's Point]] and [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda]], California, she headed west and back into the war. The escort carrier stopped at Pearl Harbor from 16\u201323 February, at Tulagi from 4\u201314 March and at [[Ulithi]] from 21\u201327 March, before arriving off [[Okinawa]] on 1 April.\n\nHer first assignment was close air support for the invasion troops, but, within a few days, she settled down to a routine of pounding the ''kamikaze'' bases at [[Sakishima Gunto]]. For the major portion of the next 77 days, her planes continued to deny the enemy the use of those air bases. Periodically, she put into the anchorage at [[Kerama Retto]] to rearm and replenish but she spent the bulk of her time in air operations at sea.\n\nOn 16 June, she headed for [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] in Leyte Gulf. She remained there for a week, then returned to the Netherlands East Indies at [[Makassar Strait]] to support the landings at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]]. The carrier reentered San Pedro Bay on 6 July and spent the next month there. On 3 August, she got underway for Okinawa, arriving in [[Buckner Bay]] three days later.\n\nHostilities ended on 15 August, but Suwannee remained at Okinawa for the next three weeks. On 7 September, {{USS|Van Valkenburgh|DD-656|6}} stood out of Buckner Bay in company with {{USS|Anthony|DD-515|2}}, {{USS|Wadsworth|DD-516|2}}, {{USS|Beale|DD-471|2}}, and {{USS|Ammen|DD-527|2}}, as screen for the carriers ''Suwannee'', {{USS|Chenango|CVE-28|2}}, {{USS|Cape Gloucester|CVE-109|2}}, and the cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL\u201462|2}}, bound for Japan and occupation duty in the erstwhile enemy's waters. For the week that followed, the group operated off the coast of Kyushu, southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, while aircraft from the carriers patrolled the island and coast and assisted in locating mines in the clearance operations paving the way for entry into the harbor at Nagasaki. The ships had entered Nagasaki Harbor by 15 September while Allied prisoners of war (New Zealand) were taken on board the hospital ship {{USS|Haven|AH-12|2}}. The carriers were sent there because of their medical facilities and doctors. ''Chenango'' left Nagasaki on the morning of 15 September with war prisoners. Crew members of ''Suwannee'' were given shore leave during their stay and observed the devastation of ground zero first hand. ''Suwannee'' and all the other ships in port experienced very difficult circumstances when a typhoon hit on 17 September. While moored between two buoys with two {{convert|32|mm|in mm|frac=4|order=out}} steel cables and an {{convert|8|in|cm}} hawser both bow and stern, she lost all contact with the stern buoy and moved dangerously close to shore. The bow cables and hawser held and she remained safely in place by turning the screws to maintain position.\n\nOn 21 September ''Suwannee'' departed Nagasaki and remained at sea until she made a quick seven-hour stop at the outer harbor of Nagasaki before heading toward Kobe. That stop was aborted because of a minefield on the path there, so they returned south to Wakayama on 27 September. On 2 October, ''Suwannee'' Captain Charles C. McDonald and Rear Admiral [[William Sample]], who headed COMCARDIV 22 on board ''Suwannee'' took off in a [[Martin PBM Mariner]] to maintain their flight qualifications and never returned. They were declared dead on 4 October. They and the seven members of the flight crew were discovered in the wreckage of the aircraft on 19 November 1948 and their bodies were recovered.\n\nDuring this time USS ''Suwannee'' was transferred from the U.S. 9th Fleet to the 5th Fleet. They remained at Wakayama until the morning of 4 October and again ran into a typhoon. They then spent a few days in the port of Kure just south of Hiroshima and then they returned near Wakayama on 10 October for \"typhoon anchorage\" as another storm was approaching. They once again anchored in Wakayama on the 13th for about two days and then headed north to Tokyo, arriving on the evening of 18 October. About this time ''Suwannee'' received orders detaching them from the fleet and assigned them to [[Operation Magic Carpet]].\n\nThe ship reached Saipan around 15:00 on 28 October and stayed just long enough (15 hours) to load stores and 400 troops. Then on to Guam, arriving at 17:00 on 29 October to load approximately 35 planes (for a total complement of around 70 planes) then on to Pearl Harbor. For their November participation in Operation Magic Carpet they were part of a much larger contingency of ships. In the Pacific, all the 1,430,000 Navy, Coast Guard and Marine personnel and the 1,360,000 Army people (on 1 November) except those in occupation units are scheduled to be returned by June. Engaged in the Pacific operations as of 10 November were 489 ships having space for slightly under 700,000 passengers. Included were: 6 battleships, 7 large carriers, 4 ''Independence''-class carriers, 45 escort carriers, 21 light cruisers, 164 troopships, 165 assault transports, 30 hospital transports, 7 converted [[Liberty ship]]s and 40 miscellaneous craft.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/71488175/All-Hands-Naval-Bulletin-Dec-1945]</ref>\n \nAfter a stop in Hawaii, ''Suwannee'' was sent to Long Beach and had a short dry-dock period. Then it was back to Operation Magic Carpet on 4 December. This trip was to be a non-stop return to Okinawa to pick up 1500 troops on an overnight stop, and then return to Seattle. Because of bad weather they did not arrive in Okinawa until 21 December. In mid-January ''Suwannee'' unloaded many grateful troops in Los Angeles and then headed north. After a few days off San Francisco she headed for Pier 91 in Seattle and then on to Bremerton. On 28 October, the carrier was placed in a reserve status with the [[16th Fleet]] at [[Boston]] and, just over two months later, on 8 January 1947, she was placed out of commission.\n\n''Suwannee'' remained in reserve at Boston for the next 12 years. She was re-designated an escort helicopter aircraft carrier, '''CVHE-27''', on 12 June 1955. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold to the [[Isbrantsen Steamship Company]], of New York City on 30 November 1959 for conversion to merchant service. The project was subsequently canceled and, in May 1961, her hulk was resold to the [[J.C. Berkwit Company]], also of New York City. She was finally scrapped in [[Bilbao]], Spain, in June 1962.\n\n==Awards==\n''Suwannee'' earned 13 [[battle star]]s during [[World War II]].\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|title=U.S. Aircraft Carriers|author=Friedman, Norman|publisher=Naval Institute Press| year=1983|isbn=0-87021-739-9}}\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/suwannee.html}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.navsource.org/archives/03/027.htm navsource.org: USS ''Suwannee'']\n* [http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/auxil/ao33.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Suwannee'']\n* [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/oral-histories/wwii/battle-of-leyte-gulf-lt-burwell.html Account of kamikaze attack by Lieutenant Walter B.

Vickery]]; delivered to the [[Keystone Tankship Corporation]] and operated by that company until acquired by the [[United States Navy]] on 26 June 1941; renamed '''''Suwannee''''' (AO-33); and commissioned on 16 July 1941, [[Commander (United States)|Commander]] Joseph R. Lannom in command.\n\n==World War II==\nAfter operating for six months as an oiler with the [[United States Fleet Forces Command|Atlantic Fleet]], ''Suwannee'' was redesignated '''AVG-27''' on 14 February 1942 and decommissioned on 21 February at [[Newport News, Virginia]], for conversion to a {{sclass-|Sangamon|escort carrier}}. On 20 August, she was redesignated an auxiliary carrier, '''ACV-27''', and was recommissioned as such on 24 September 1942, Captain [[Joseph J. Clark]] in command.\n\n===1942===\nLess than a month after commissioning, ''Suwannee'' was underway from [[Hampton Roads]] for the [[Operation Torch|invasion of North Africa]]. She joined {{USS|Ranger|CV-4|2}} as the other carrier attached to the Center Attack Group whose specific objective was [[Casablanca]] itself, via [[Fedhala]] just to the north. Early in the morning of 8 November, she arrived off the coast of [[Morocco]] and, for the next few days, her [[Grumman F4F Wildcat]]s maintained combat and [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] air patrols, while her [[Grumman TBF Avenger]]s joined ''Ranger''{{'}}s in bombing missions. During the [[Naval Battle of Casablanca]] from 8\u201311 November, ''Suwannee'' sent up 255 air sorties and lost only five planes, three in combat and two to operational problems.\n\nOn 11 November, off [[Fedhala Roads]], her anti-submarine patrol sank what was reported to be a [[Kriegsmarine|German]] [[U-boat]], but which was later determined to have been one of the three [[French Navy|French]] submarines which sortied from Casablanca on the day of the assault. She was the first escort carrier to score against the enemy undersea menace, and she helped to prove the usefulness of her type in anti-submarine warfare.\n\n[[File:Grumman F4F-4 Wildcat of VGF-27 aboard USS Suwanee (ACV-27), circa in late 1942 or early 1943 (80-G-K-15634).jpg|thumb|left|[[Grumman F4F Wildcat|F4F]] \"Rosenblatt's Reply\" on ''Suwannee'', 1942\u201343.]]\n\n''Suwannee'' remained in North African waters until mid-November, then sailed, via [[Bermuda]], for [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]]. She arrived back at Hampton Roads on 24 November and stayed until 5 December, when she got underway for the [[South Pacific Area|South Pacific]].\n\n===1943===\nThe auxiliary carrier transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 11\u201312 December and arrived at [[New Caledonia]] on 4 January 1943. For the next seven months, she provided air escort for transports and supply ships replenishing and bolstering the marines on Guadalcanal, as well as for the forces occupying other islands in the [[Solomon Islands|Solomons]] group. During that span of time, she visited [[Guadalcanal]], [[Efate]] and [[Espiritu Santo]] in addition to New Caledonia.\n\nShe returned to the United States at [[San Diego]] in October, and by 5 November was back at Espiritu Santo. On 13 November, she departed to participate in the [[Gilbert Islands campaign|Gilbert Islands operation]]. From 19\u201323 November, she was a part of the Air Support Group of the Southern Attack Force, and her planes bombed [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]], while the ships in the Northern Attack Force engaged the enemy at [[Makin (islands)|Makin]]. Following the occupation of the [[Gilbert Islands|Gilberts]], the escort carrier returned to the U.S., via [[Pearl Harbor]], arriving in San Diego on 21 December.\n\n===1944===\nShe remained on the west coast for two weeks into the new year, then set a course for [[Lahaina Roads]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]]. She departed Hawaii on 22 January 1944 and headed for the [[Marshall Islands|Marshalls]]. During [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|that operation]], ''Suwannee'' joined the Northern Attack Force, and her planes bombed and strafed [[Roi-Namur|Roi and Namur]] Islands, in the northern part of [[Kwajalein]] Atoll, and conducted anti-submarine patrols for the task force. She remained in the vicinity of Kwajalein for the first 15 days of February, then spent the next nine days helping out at [[Eniwetok]]. On 24 February, she headed east again and arrived at Pearl Harbor on 2 March for a two-week stay.\n\nBy 30 March, she was in the vicinity of the [[Palau Islands]] as the [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th Fleet]] subjected those islands to two days of extensive bombing raids. A week later, she put into Espiritu Santo for four days. After short stops at [[Purvis Bay]] in the Solomons and at [[Seeadler Harbor]], [[Manus Island|Manus]], the escort carrier headed for [[New Guinea]]. For two weeks, she supported the Hollandia landings by shuttling replacement aircraft to the larger fleet carriers actually engaged in air support of the landings. She returned to Manus on 5 May.\n\nFollowing two voyages from Espiritu Santo, one to [[Tulagi]] and the other to Kwajalein, ''Suwannee'' arrived off [[Saipan]] in mid-June. For the next one and a half months, she supported the invasion of the Marianas, participating in the campaigns against Saipan and Guam. On 19 June, as the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]] began to unfold, ''Suwannee'' was one of the first ships to draw enemy blood when one of her planes flying combat air patrol attacked and sank the {{Jsub|I-184}}. ''Suwanee''{{'}}s planes did not actually become engaged in the famous battle of naval aircraft, because they remained with the invasion forces in the Marianas providing anti-submarine and combat air patrols.\n\nOn 4 August, she cleared the Marianas for Eniwetok and Seeadler Harbor, reaching the latter port on 13 August. Almost a month later, on 10 September, she put to sea to support the landings on [[Morotai]] in the [[Netherlands East Indies]]. Those landings went off without opposition on 15 September, and ''Suwannee'' returned to Seeadler Harbor to prepare for the invasion of the [[Philippines]].\n\nOn 12 October, the escort carrier got underway from Manus in [[Rear Admiral]] [[Thomas L. Sprague]]'s Escort Carrier Group to provide air support for the [[Battle of Leyte|landings at Leyte Gulf]]. She reached the Philippines several days later, and her planes began strikes on enemy installations in the [[Visayas]] until 25 October. She provided air support for the assault forces with antisubmarine and combat air patrols and strikes against Japanese installations ashore.\n\nOn 24\u201325 October 1944, the Japanese launched a major surface offensive from three directions to contest the landings at [[Leyte Gulf]]. While [[Admiral]] [[Jisaburo Ozawa|Jisaburo Ozawa's]] Mobile Force sailed south from Japan and drew the bulk of Admiral [[William Halsey|William Halsey's]] [[United States Third Fleet|3d Fleet]] off to the north, Admiral Shima's 2nd Striking Force, along with Admiral [[Shoji Nishimura|Shoji Nishimura's]] Force, attempted to force the [[Surigao Strait]] from the south. This drew Admiral [[Jesse B. Oldendorf|Jesse B. Oldendorf's]] Bombardment Group south to meet that threat in the [[Battle of Surigao Strait]]. With Admiral Oldendorf's old battleships fighting in Surigao Strait and Halsey's 3rd Fleet scurrying north, ''Suwannee'', with the other 15 escort carriers and 22 [[destroyer]]s and [[destroyer escort]]s, formed the only Allied naval force operating off Leyte Gulf when [[Vice Admiral]] [[Takeo Kurita|Takeo Kurita's]] 1st Striking Force sneaked through the unguarded [[San Bernardino Strait]] into the [[Philippine Sea]].\n\nJust before 07:00 on the 25th, one of {{USS|Kadashan Bay|CVE-76|2}}'s planes reported a Japanese force of four [[battleship]]s, eight [[cruiser]]s, and 11 destroyers. This force, Kurita's, immediately began a surface engagement with [[Rear Admiral]] [[Clifton Sprague|Clifton Sprague's]] \"Taffy 3\", the northernmost group of escort carriers. ''Suwannee'' was much farther south as an element of Rear Admiral Thomas Sprague's \"Taffy 1\". Consequently, she did not participate in the running surface [[Battle off Samar]].\n[[Image:CVE27 Kamikaze engine parts.jpg|240px|thumb|USS ''Suwannee'' after the ''kamikaze'' attack from 25 October 1944.

At 07:40 on the 25th, \"Taffy 1\" was jumped by land-based planes from [[Davao City|Davao]] in the first deliberate suicide attack of the war. The first one crashed into {{USS|Santee|CVE-29|2}}; and, 30 seconds later, ''Suwannee'' splashed a ''kamikaze'' during his run on {{USS|Petrof Bay|CVE-80|2}}.

''Suwanee''{{'}}s group fought off two more air attacks before 13:00; then steamed in a northeasterly direction to join Taffy 3 and launch futile searches for Kurita's rapidly retiring force. Just after noon on 26 October, another group of ''kamikazes'' jumped Taffy 1. A Zero crashed into ''Suwanee''{{'}}s flight deck at 1240 and careened into a [[torpedo bomber]] which had just been recovered. The two planes erupted upon contact as did nine other planes on her flight deck. The resulting fire burned for several hours, but was finally brought under control. The casualties for 25\u201326 October were 107 dead and 160 wounded. The escort carriers put into [[Kossol Roads]] in the Palaus on 28 October, then headed for Manus for upkeep on 1 November.\n\n===1945===\nAfter five days in Seeadler Harbor, ''Suwannee'' got underway to return to the west coast for major repairs. She stopped at Pearl Harbor overnight on 19\u201320 November and arrived at [[Puget Sound Navy Yard]] on 26 November. Her repairs were completed by 31 January 1945; and, after brief stops at [[Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard|Hunter's Point]] and [[Naval Air Station Alameda|Alameda]], California, she headed west and back into the war. The escort carrier stopped at Pearl Harbor from 16\u201323 February, at Tulagi from 4\u201314 March and at [[Ulithi]] from 21\u201327 March, before arriving off [[Okinawa]] on 1 April.\n\nHer first assignment was close air support for the invasion troops, but, within a few days, she settled down to a routine of pounding the ''kamikaze'' bases at [[Sakishima Gunto]]. For the major portion of the next 77 days, her planes continued to deny the enemy the use of those air bases. Periodically, she put into the anchorage at [[Kerama Retto]] to rearm and replenish but she spent the bulk of her time in air operations at sea.\n\nOn 16 June, she headed for [[San Pedro Bay (Philippines)|San Pedro Bay]] in Leyte Gulf. She remained there for a week, then returned to the Netherlands East Indies at [[Makassar Strait]] to support the landings at [[Balikpapan]], [[Borneo]]. The carrier reentered San Pedro Bay on 6 July and spent the next month there. On 3 August, she got underway for Okinawa, arriving in [[Buckner Bay]] three days later.\n\nHostilities ended on 15 August, but Suwannee remained at Okinawa for the next three weeks. On 7 September, {{USS|Van Valkenburgh|DD-656|6}} stood out of Buckner Bay in company with {{USS|Anthony|DD-515|2}}, {{USS|Wadsworth|DD-516|2}}, {{USS|Beale|DD-471|2}}, and {{USS|Ammen|DD-527|2}}, as screen for the carriers ''Suwannee'', {{USS|Chenango|CVE-28|2}}, {{USS|Cape Gloucester|CVE-109|2}}, and the cruiser {{USS|Birmingham|CL\u201462|2}}, bound for Japan and occupation duty in the erstwhile enemy's waters. For the week that followed, the group operated off the coast of Kyushu, southwest of Nagasaki, Japan, while aircraft from the carriers patrolled the island and coast and assisted in locating mines in the clearance operations paving the way for entry into the harbor at Nagasaki. The ships had entered Nagasaki Harbor by 15 September while Allied prisoners of war (New Zealand) were taken on board the hospital ship {{USS|Haven|AH-12|2}}. The carriers were sent there because of their medical facilities and doctors. ''Chenango'' left Nagasaki on the morning of 15 September with war prisoners. Crew members of ''Suwannee'' were given shore leave during their stay and observed the devastation of ground zero first hand. ''Suwannee'' and all the other ships in port experienced very difficult circumstances when a typhoon hit on 17 September. While moored between two buoys with two {{convert|32|mm|in mm|frac=4|order=out}} steel cables and an {{convert|8|in|cm}} hawser both bow and stern, she lost all contact with the stern buoy and moved dangerously close to shore. The bow cables and hawser held and she remained safely in place by turning the screws to maintain position.\n\nOn 21 September ''Suwannee'' departed Nagasaki and remained at sea until she made a quick seven-hour stop at the outer harbor of Nagasaki before heading toward Kobe. That stop was aborted because of a minefield on the path there, so they returned south to Wakayama on 27 September. On 2 October, ''Suwannee'' Captain Charles C. McDonald and Rear Admiral [[William Sample]], who headed COMCARDIV 22 on board ''Suwannee'' took off in a [[Martin PBM Mariner]] to maintain their flight qualifications and never returned. They were declared dead on 4 October. They and the seven members of the flight crew were discovered in the wreckage of the aircraft on 19 November 1948 and were recovered.\n\nDuring this time USS ''Suwannee'' was transferred from the U.S. 9th Fleet to the 5th Fleet. They remained at Wakayama until the morning of 4 October and again ran into a typhoon. They then spent a few days in the port of Kure just south of Hiroshima and then they returned near Wakayama on 10 October for \"typhoon anchorage\" as another storm was approaching. They once again anchored in Wakayama on the 13th for about two days and then headed north to Tokyo, arriving on the evening of 18 October. About this time ''Suwannee'' received orders detaching them from the fleet and assigned them to Operation Magic Carpet.\n\nThe ship reached Saipan around 15:00 on 28 October and stayed just long enough (15 hours) to load stores and 400 troops. Then on to Guam, arriving at 17:00 on 29 October to load approximately 35 planes (for a total complement of around 70 planes) then on to Pearl Harbor. For their November participation in Operation Magic Carpet they were part of a much larger contingency of ships. In the Pacific, all the 1,430,000 Navy, Coast Guard and Marine personnel and the 1,360,000 Army people (on 1 November) except those in occupation units are scheduled to be returned by June. Engaged in the Pacific operations as of 10 November were 489 ships having space for slightly under 700,000 passengers. Included were: 6 battleships, 7 large carriers, 4 ''Independence''-class carriers, 45 escort carriers, 21 light cruisers, 164 troopships, 165 assault transports, 30 hospital transports, 7 converted [[Liberty ship]]s and 40 miscellaneous craft.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/71488175/All-Hands-Naval-Bulletin-Dec-1945]</ref>\n \nAfter a stop in Hawaii, ''Suwannee'' was sent to Long Beach and had a short dry-dock period. Then it was back to Operation Magic Carpet on 4 December. This trip was to be a non-stop return to Okinawa to pick up 1500 troops on an overnight stop, and then return to Seattle. Because of bad weather they did not arrive in Okinawa until 21 December. In mid-January ''Suwannee'' unloaded many grateful troops in Los Angeles and then headed north. After a few days off San Francisco she headed for Pier 91 in Seattle and then on to Bremerton. On 28 October, the carrier was placed in a reserve status with the [[16th Fleet]] at [[Boston]] and, just over two months later, on 8 January 1947, she was placed out of commission.\n\n''Suwannee'' remained in reserve at Boston for the next 12 years. She was re-designated an escort helicopter aircraft carrier, '''CVHE-27''', on 12 June 1955. Her name was struck from the [[Naval Vessel Register|Navy List]] on 1 March 1959. Her hulk was sold to the [[Isbrantsen Steamship Company]], of New York City on 30 November 1959 for conversion to merchant service. The project was subsequently canceled and, in May 1961, her hulk was resold to the [[J.C. Berkwit Company]], also of New York City. She was finally scrapped in [[Bilbao]], Spain, in June 1962.\n\n==Awards==\n''Suwannee'' earned 13 [[battle star]]s during [[World War II]].\n\n==References ==\n{{reflist}}\n* {{cite book|title=U.S. Aircraft Carriers|author=Friedman, Norman|publisher=Naval Institute Press| year=1983|isbn=0-87021-739-9}}\n{{DANFS|http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/s/suwannee.html}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.navsource.org/archives/03/027.htm navsource.org: USS ''Suwannee'']\n* [http://www.hazegray.org/danfs/auxil/ao33.txt hazegray.org: USS ''Suwannee'']\n* [http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/oral-histories/wwii/battle-of-leyte-gulf-lt-burwell.html Account of kamikaze attack by Lieutenant Walter B.
