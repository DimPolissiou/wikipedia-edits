Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

Retrieved 18 June 2019. \n</ref> Its genesis was the earlier [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] and the resultant overflow onto the streets of the poor and destitute. Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the King wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the City for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of.<ref>Nichols, John Gough. (1851). ''Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London''. London: Printed for the Camden Society by J.B. Nichols and Son, Printers. 'Preface' xxvi-xxvii. [https://archive.org/details/ChronicleOfTheGreyFriarsOfLondon/page/n1 The Internet Archive website] Retrieved 18 June 2019.</ref> Edward granted [[Bridewell Palace]], his lands at the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy]], and rents and other chattels to create three Royal Hospitals \u2014 Bridewell Hospital (now the [[King Edward's School, Witley]], [[Surrey]]), [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Christ's Hospital, which was for the education of poor children.\n\nThe first boys and girls entered the school in [[Newgate]] in 1552. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September. On this day, two Grecians destined for scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge Universities gave orations in praise of the school, one in [[Latin]] and the other in English. The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England's satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Coote endured a cartoon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1646990&partId=1|title=A peep into the blue coat school !!!!!!!!!!!-|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> by [[George Cruikshank]], a vaunted caricaturist, and national humiliation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/25/sex-drugs-and-the-birth-of-modernity|title=Sex, drugs and the birth of modernity|date=2019-05-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-06-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nTwo of 19th-century London's most notable architects, [[John Shaw Sr.|John Shaw Senior]] and [[John Shaw Jr|John Shaw Junior]], were architects and surveyors to Christ's Hospital throughout the first half of the 1800s. The Shaws' work included the old school hall (c.1825).\n\n[[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.\n\nA commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stow|first=John|editor=Thoms, William J.|title=A Survey of London, written in the year 1598 by John Stow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119|edition=New edition, 1842 |year=1598|publisher=Whittaker|page=119}}</ref> The nickname \"Blue-coat School\" comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is \"Housey\" and the long coat is called a \"Housey coat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/29-records-of-christs-hospital-and-bluecoat-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=London Metropolitan Archives : Information Leaflet Number 29 : Records of Christ's Hospital and Bluecoats Schools |website=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nSecond and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle. When pupils reach their \"Little [[Desiderius Erasmus|Erasmus]]\" year (year 9), they are presented with more elaborate hallmarked [[sterling silver]] 'broadie' buckles and belts, which the pupils keep after leaving the school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independentschoolparent.com/education-news/wearing-it-with-pride|title=Wearing it with Pride |website=Independent School Parents}}</ref>\n\nA complementary uniform was introduced for girls on re-unification of the schools in 1985. This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

Due to its connection with the [[City of London]], certain individuals and corporate bodies exercise rights of presentation, proposing suitable candidates for admission. In effect the selection of pupils is made according to a complex set of scholarships.\n\n*Donation Governors are individuals who, in return for a financial donation, can propose a suitable candidate.\n*A number of [[livery companies]] have rights of presentation, including the [[Ironmongers' Company]], the [[Cooks' Company]], the [[Drapers' Company]], the [[Grocers' Company]], the [[Fishmongers' Company]], the [[Skinners' Company]], the [[Mercers' Company]], the [[Master Mariners' Company]], and others.\n*The [[Freedom of the City#Freedom of the City of London|Guild of Freemen of the City of London]] have rights of presentation.\n*The Council of Almoners exercises rights of presentation in respect of:\n**Distinguished Service Presentation: sons, daughters, grandsons or granddaughters of persons distinguished in literature, science or art, the service of the Crown or services to Christ's Hospital (established 1866).\n**Royal Mathematical School: sons or daughters of [[Royal Navy]], [[Royal Marines]] or Royal Navy Reserve List 1 (Merchant Navy) personnel\n**Girls' Additional Endowment Fund: orphan daughters of various professions (trust established 1904/5)\n**Brodribb Foundation: blood relations of members of the Brodribb family (established 1927)\n**Almoners' Presentees: supplementary places should the number of children presented fall short of vacancies available\n\nIn the open competitive examination, precedence is given to candidates who satisfy the conditions of a number of trusts, including:\n*children from schools in the area formerly controlled by the [[Inner London Education Authority]]\n*children from schools in certain ancient country parishes\n*Oliver Whitby Educational Foundation: children from [[Chichester]]\n*Royal Air Force Foundation: sons and daughters of officers or men of the [[Royal Air Force]], [[Royal Auxiliary Air Force]] or Royal Air Force Reserve.

The school was rated 'excellent' (the top grade) in the report released in January 2013. The optional term 'Exceptional' was not used. The report also noted: \"The school is advised to make the following improvement.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a concert every February at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], under the direction of the then Head of Piano [[John Thwaites (musician)|John Thwaites]].\n\nChrist's Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme ''[[Rock School]]'', in which [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017211313/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml |date=17 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2008 Christ's Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Christ's Hospital Band]] participating in the Lord Mayor's Show in 2008]]\n\nThe school's most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named [[Christ's Hospital Band]]. It plays for the daily parade and performs in the annual [[Lord Mayor's Show]] in the [[City of London]]. The band also has a regular engagement each summer at [[Lord's Cricket Ground]]. The band led the procession at the Queen's 80th birthday parade in London on 21 April 2006 and has played at [[Twickenham Stadium]] on a number of occasions.\n\n===Drama===\nAn Arts Centre complex designed by architect Bill Howell was opened in 1974, including a theatre with Tudor-style auditorium, an extension to the music school, the 'Octagon' rehearsal/performance space, and classrooms.\n\nThe Christ's Hospital Arts Centre served as a principal arts venue for Horsham and the surrounding area until the establishment of an arts centre in Horsham in the 1980s. A programme of performances continues to be open to the public.\n\nFormer pupils in theatre and film include [[Jason Flemyng]], [[Leo Gregory]],<ref>{{cite news| url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1639572,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=How I found my inner hippy | first=Will | last=Hodgkinson | date=11 November 2005 | accessdate=29 April 2010}}</ref> [[James D'Arcy]], [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]] and [[Roger Allam]].\n\n== Names of year groups ==\nEach year group has a particular name, unique to Christ's Hospital.

The school [[House system|houses]] are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an \"A\" and \"B\" side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:\n\n===Avenue houses===\n\n*Peele \u2013 [[George Peele]] (boys)\n*Thornton \u2013 [[Edward Thornton (1766\u20131852)|Edward Thornton]]<ref>''Christ's Hospital'', G.A.T. Allan, Shepperton 1984, {{ISBN|0-86364-005-2}}</ref> (girls)\n*Middleton \u2013 [[Thomas Middleton (bishop)|Thomas Middleton]] (boys)\n*Coleridge \u2013 [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]] (girls)\n*Lamb \u2013 [[Charles Lamb]] (boys)\n*Barnes \u2013 [[Thomas Barnes (journalist)|Thomas Barnes]] (girls)\n*Maine \u2013 [[Henry James Sumner Maine]] (boys)\n*Leigh Hunt \u2013 [[Leigh Hunt]] (girls)\n\nThe sixteen original main boarding houses stretch from Peele to Leigh Hunt along The Avenue, built as four H-blocks on either side of the main Quad. Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school.

Founded in 1552 and received its first Royal Charter in 1553, Christ's Hospital follows much of the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] tradition. Since its establishment, Christ's Hospital has been a [[charity school]], with a core aim to offer children from humble backgrounds the chance of a better education.\n\n==Charitable foundation==\n[[File:quad DH.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Christ's Hospital quad towards dining hall. Picture taken from Big School]]\nChrist's Hospital is almost unique for a British independent school in that the majority of the students receive bursaries. This stems from its founding charter as a charitable school. School fees are paid on a [[Means test|means-tested]] basis, with substantial subsidies paid by the school or their benefactors, so that pupils from all walks of life are able to have private education that would otherwise be beyond the means of their parents.\n\n[[File:CH FntAvQuad.jpg|thumb|left|Westward photo of Quad and Front Avenue. (View from Art School)]]\n\nThe trustees of the foundation are the Council of Almoners, chaired by the Treasurer of Christ's Hospital, who govern the foundation according to a Scheme of Administration granted by the [[Charity Commission]]. The historic Court of Governors survives as a formal institution consisting of over 650 benefactors but its powers have since the 19th century been largely transferred to the smaller Council of Almoners.\n\nIn 2007 Christ's Hospital was formally separated into two related [[Charitable organization|registered charities]]: Christ's Hospital Foundation<ref>{{EW charity|306975|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL FOUNDATION}}</ref> and Christ's Hospital School.<ref>{{EW charity|1120090|CHRIST'S HOSPITAL SCHOOL}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Christ's Hospital, engraved by Toms c.1770..jpg|thumb|Christ's Hospital's buildings in London in 1770]]\n[[File:Edward VI of England c. 1546.jpg|left|thumb|[[Edward VI of England|Edward VI]]]]\nChrist's Hospital was the result of the foundation by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and confirmed by [[Edward VI of England|King Edward VI]], assisted by [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Nicholas Ridley]], Bishop of London, and Sir Richard Dobbs, [[Lord Mayor of London]].<ref>Thornbury, Walter. \"Christ's Hospital.\" ''Old and New London'': Volume 2.

Retrieved 18 June 2019. \n</ref> Its genesis was the earlier [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolution of the monasteries]] and the resultant overflow onto the streets of the poor and destitute. Encouraged by a sermon from Ridley, exhorting mercy to the poor, the King wrote to the Lord Mayor encouraging him to action. This he did via a committee of 30 merchants. [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] had already granted the use of Greyfriars to the City for the relief of the poor and to house the homeless children which the magistrates had taken notice of.<ref>Nichols, John Gough. (1851). ''Chronicle of the Grey Friars of London''. London: Printed for the Camden Society by J.B. Nichols and Son, Printers. 'Preface' xxvi-xxvii. [https://archive.org/details/ChronicleOfTheGreyFriarsOfLondon/page/n1 The Internet Archive website] Retrieved 18 June 2019.</ref> Edward granted [[Bridewell Palace]], his lands at the [[Savoy Palace|Savoy]], and rents and other chattels to create three Royal Hospitals \u2014 Bridewell Hospital (now the [[King Edward's School, Witley]], [[Surrey]]), [[St Thomas' Hospital]] and Christ's Hospital, which was for the education of poor children.\n\nThe first boys and girls entered the school in [[Newgate]] in 1552. The [[Royal Charter]] was granted and signed by its founder, Edward VI, the following year. The first treasurer was [[Richard Grafton]]. The Protestant foundation survived the [[Mary I of England|Marian]] period and in the 1560s it sent its first scholars to Oxford and Cambridge.\n\nThe school occupied Newgate as its major site for 350 years, but from time to time children were housed in other parts of the country. 32 children perished during the [[Great Plague of London|Great Plague of 1665]]. In the following year the [[Great Fire of London]] destroyed much of the Hospital, except four cloisters and three wards, but there were no casualties among the children. Around 200 pupils were sent to Islington and Clerkenwell and then to Ware and Hertford.\n\nBy the end of the 17th century the buildings had been rebuilt with the assistance of [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]], a governor of Christ's Hospital, and [[Nicholas Hawksmoor]], who designed the Writing School (1696). The church of [[Christ Church Greyfriars|Christ Church, Newgate Street]], designed by Wren, replaced the damaged choir of the former Greyfriars' church and served as a place of worship for the children of Christ's Hospital in the City until the move to Horsham. Through the will of the royal jeweller, [[George Heriot]], it also became the inspiration for the foundation of [[George Heriot's School|George Heriot's Hospital]] in [[Edinburgh]], which was the first of the \"Hospital Schools\" to be founded in Scotland.\n\nChrist's Hospital was given its second [[royal charter]] by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] in 1673. This specifically created the [[Royal Mathematical School]], the original purpose of which was to train [[mathematics|mathematicians]] and [[navigation|navigators]] who would serve as naval officers and merchant seafarers. [[Samuel Pepys]], Secretary to His Majesty's Navy and from 1699 Vice-President of Christ's Hospital, made a considerable contribution to Christ's Hospital. [[Isaac Newton]], [[Jonas Moore]], [[John Flamsteed]], and  [[Edmund Halley]] contributed to plans for the course of study of the new school within the foundation.\n\n[[File:Blue Coat School Microcosm edited.jpg|thumb|This early 19th-century picture shows the Great Hall on St. Matthew's Day, 21 September. On this day, two Grecians destined for scholarships to Oxford and Cambridge Universities gave orations in praise of the school, one in [[Latin]] and the other in English. The [[Antonio Verrio|Verrio]] painting can be seen along the wall on the right.]]\n\nThe girls of the hospital settled at [[Hertford]] from 1707. The governors had been paying a teacher in Hertford from 1653, and the removal of some children from London following the Great Fire strengthened the link with the town. In 1761, 200 boys under the age of ten along with the boys from Ware were relocated to Hertford. In 1778 the last girls were moved out of London to join the others at Hertford, where the school was rebuilt 1795\u20131798 to provide accommodation for the new numbers.\n\nChrist's Hospital's most famous upper master was [[James Boyer]] who presided from 1778 to 1799 and instructed [[James Leigh Hunt]], [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]].\n\nIn November 1815 the \u201cmost infamous Regency [[flagellant]]\u201d, an MP named [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Sir Eyre Coote,]] entered Christ's Hospital mathematical school, sent away the younger boys and paid the older ones for a session of mutual flogging. The school nurse arrived to find him buttoning his breeches; England's satirical press had come of age in time to make the very most of such a moment. Coote endured a cartoon<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=1646990&partId=1|title=A peep into the blue coat school !!!!!!!!!!!-|website=British Museum|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-06-02}}</ref> by [[George Cruikshank]], a vaunted caricaturist, and national humiliation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/books-and-arts/2019/05/25/sex-drugs-and-the-birth-of-modernity|title=Sex, drugs and the birth of modernity|date=2019-05-23|work=The Economist|access-date=2019-06-02|issn=0013-0613}}</ref>\n\nTwo of 19th-century London's most notable architects, [[John Shaw Sr.|John Shaw Senior]] and [[John Shaw Jr|John Shaw Junior]], were architects and surveyors to Christ's Hospital throughout the first half of the 1800s. The Shaws' work included the old school hall (c.1825).\n\n[[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|The Duke of Cambridge]] started a tradition of Royal Presidents in 1854.\n\nA commission of inquiry in 1837 proposed reforms, and in 1864 the Taunton Commission investigated the endowed schools. As a result of this a greater number of girls were admitted. However, in the 1890s boys still outnumbered girls at Hertford.\n\nAnother commission in 1877 proposed a new site for the school, where all the boys would be taught. This proposal  was questioned by some of the Governors. The Duke of Cambridge said \"I am one of those who are perfectly prepared to go with the spirit of the age in which we live, but I confess that I am also one of those who do not love change for change\u2019s sake. To upset an old and long standing institution... is a very dangerous experiment to try.\"\n\nHowever, the proposal was carried out. {{convert|1200|acre|km2}} of land outside Horsham in Sussex was purchased from the Aylesbury Dairy Company for \u00a347,500. The foundation stone was laid by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward, Prince of Wales]] on 23 October 1897, on behalf of the Sovereign, the date being the anniversary of the birthday of the founder. Architectural features from the old school buildings (the Grecians' Arch and the Wren Arch) were salvaged and incorporated in the new buildings.\n\nThe boys were relocated from Newgate and Hertford to the new site in 1902. Hertford became a girls-only school.\n\nOver the centuries Christ's Hospital has continued to enjoy royal patronage. In 1919, [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] became the first Royal Patron, followed by [[George VI of the United Kingdom|George VI]] in 1937 and HM [[Elizabeth II|The Queen]] in 1953.\n\n==Traditions==\n[[File:Constant Lambert as a Blue coat boy.jpg|thumb|The composer [[Constant Lambert]] as a pupil, wearing the traditional uniform]]\nLinks with the City and the [[Lord Mayor of London]] are well maintained, with an annual parade through the City of London on [[Matthew the Evangelist|St. Matthew's Day]] and a regular place in the [[Lord Mayor's Show]].\n\nOne of the Christ's Hospital traditions is marching into lunch with the band, which is done each day except Sunday, weather permitting.\n\nAnother is the annual speech-day parade, where the Lord Mayor of London and his procession watch the school perform a march-past through the main quad. They also join the school in chapel for a grand service, and eat lunch with the Grecian year and their parents. Lastly they move to Big School to hear the Senior Grecian's oration and witness the Grecian prize-giving. This is held on the Saturday at the start of the Summer Half Term.\n\n===Uniform===\nThe school's  Tudor [[school uniform|uniform]] consists of belted, long blue coats, knee-breeches, yellow socks, and [[bands (neckwear)|bands]] at the neck. The uniform has been in place since 1553.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stow|first=John|editor=Thoms, William J.|title=A Survey of London, written in the year 1598 by John Stow|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8vA9AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA119|edition=New edition, 1842 |year=1598|publisher=Whittaker|page=119}}</ref> The nickname \"Blue-coat School\" comes from the blue coats worn by the students; however, the nickname used within the school community itself is \"Housey\" and the long coat is called a \"Housey coat\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/things-to-do/london-metropolitan-archives/visitor-information/Documents/29-records-of-christs-hospital-and-bluecoat-schools.pdf |format=PDF |title=London Metropolitan Archives : Information Leaflet Number 29 : Records of Christ's Hospital and Bluecoats Schools |website=Cityoflondon.gov.uk |accessdate=2016-01-25}}</ref>\n\nSecond and third form pupils wear a simple leather belt with a buckle.

This consists of a knee-length pleated skirt, summer jacket, yellow socks (for the boys and junior girls), and grey socks or grey/black tights for senior girls, as well as the long coat in winter, and the bands.\n\nIn 2011 students and alumni stated that they saw the uniform as an important way of giving the school a unique identity and unifying the school. Around that time the administrators had discussed the idea of updating the uniform. Over 95% of students voted in favour of keeping the original uniform.<ref name=\"Unifvote\">\"Students Vote to Keep Tudor Uniform.\" British Heritage 32, no. 2 (May 2011): 10.

Famous alumni of Christ's Hospital Music School include conductors Sir [[Colin Davis]], [[Charles Hazlewood]], [[Adrian Bawtree]], and Simon Joly, trumpeter [[David Mason (trumpet player)|David Mason]] (formerly Principal Trumpet of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra), composer [[Tim Benjamin]], and composer and conductor [[Constant Lambert]].\n\nThe school's chapel has a large five-manual [[Rushworth and Dreaper]] organ, one of four organs in the School (the others being a 3-manual 1829 Hill in Big School, played on by [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and [[Karg-Elert]], a 2-manual [[Henry Willis & Sons|Father Willis]] in the Dining Hall, and a Flight and Robson chamber organ in the Court Room). The near 150-strong Chapel Choir has made many recordings and through these has earned an excellent reputation.\n\nThroughout the school's history, many musically gifted pupils have gone on to take up choral and organ scholarships at Oxford and Cambridge universities or have gained places at leading music conservatories. The school has a Symphony Orchestra and many other smaller choirs and instrumental ensembles, along with an annual House Singing Competition. The Music Department organises a concert every February at [[St John's, Smith Square]] in London. The school is also famous as the first place in England to host a complete cycle of the chamber music of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]], under the direction of the then Head of Piano [[John Thwaites (musician)|John Thwaites]].\n\nChrist's Hospital was featured in the first series of the reality television programme ''[[Rock School]]'', in which [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] helped a group of pupils form their own rock band.<ref>[http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017211313/http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/rock_school/series_about.jhtml |date=17 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lord Mayor's Show 2008 Christ's Hospital.jpg|thumb|The [[Christ's Hospital Band]] participating in the Lord Mayor's Show in 2008]]\n\nThe school's most famous ensemble is its marching band, simply named [[Christ's Hospital Band]].

The school [[House system|houses]] are named after notable Old Blues (the CH-specific term for alumni), primarily writers. Each house has an \"A\" and \"B\" side, home to roughly 45 pupils. The houses are arranged from west to east as follows:\n\n===Avenue houses===\n\n*Peele \u2013 [[George Peele]] (boys)\n*Thornton \u2013 [[Edward Thornton (1766\u20131852)|Edward Thornton]]<ref>''Christ's Hospital'', G.A.T.

Leigh Hunt was originally the pair of preparatory houses, Prep A and Prep B, and were converted to junior houses on the abolition in 1964 of entry at the age of nine.\n\nThe sixteen original houses provided two dormitories (Upper Dorm and Lower Dorm) sleeping up to about 30 boys each. As the merger of the boys and girls approached, some dormitories were divided into cubicles, and subsequent developments created dormitories accommodating about twelve pupils each. Since 2001 there has been a rolling refurbishment programme, with the refurbished houses providing a range of accommodation: four-bed rooms for the junior pupils to one-bed rooms for the more senior pupils.\n\nUntil 1964, boys at Horsham lived in all-through houses from 2nd Form to Grecians (with the exception of Prep A and Prep B). Then houses were divided into senior houses (Peele, Thornton, Middleton, Coleridge and Lamb) and Junior houses (Barnes, Maine, Leigh Hunt) with boys transferring to a senior house after Little Erasmus. In conjunction with the merger, a further reorganisation occurred with each house converting to a senior side and a junior side. This system reverted to the all-through houses in 2000, now from 2nd Form to Deps.\n\n=== Grecians houses===\n\nYear 13 (Grecian) students move to Grecians houses, which provide a transitional style of life in preparation for university or life beyond school. The two Grecians houses were completed early in 2001 and have individual study bedrooms plus several general common rooms and kitchenettes shared by a group of seven to ten pupils.<ref>http://www.christs-hospital.org.uk/parents-handbook-dec09.pdf</ref> allowed them to prepare to live in mixed communal environment as they prepare themselves for university education.\n\n*Grecians West (for pupils who were previously in Peele, Thornton, Middleton, and Coleridge)\n*Grecians East (for pupils who were previously in Lamb, Barnes, Maine, and Leigh Hunt)\n\n==Controversies ==\n===Sexual abuse ===\nSexual abuse of pupils from 1969 to 2001<ref name=\"bbc20180713\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|author=|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref> led to six former teachers being convicted of offences after more than 20 former students made complaints to the police in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-44654838|title=Teacher guilty of raping pupil|date=5 July 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/16353070.teacher-james-husband-from-york-jailed-for-17-years-for-raping-pupil|title=Teacher James Husband, from York, jailed for 17 years for raping pupil|date=13 July 2018|work=York Press|access-date=2018-07-13}}</ref> The convicted former teachers were sentenced to prison terms of up to 17 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-44817719|title=Christ's Hospital School teacher jailed for pupil rape|date=13 July 2018|website=BBC News}}</ref>\n\n==Alumni==\n{{See|List of people educated at Christ's Hospital}}\nPeople educated at Christ's Hospital are called Old Blues.\n\n==Staff==\nNotable members of staff have included:\n*[[Edward Baldwin, 4th Earl Baldwin of Bewdley]]\n*[[Adrian Bawtree]]\n*[[Edward Buck (rower)|Edward Buck]]\n*[[Samuel Cobb (poet)|Samuel Cobb]]\n*[[Gerald Davies]]\n*[[Ralph Henry Carless Davis]]\n*[[John Flamsteed]] ([[Astronomer Royal]])\n*[[William Hamilton Fyfe]]\n*[[Steve Gatting]]\n*[[Bruce Grindlay]]\n*[[George Andrew Jacob]]\n*[[Craig Sellar Lang]]\n*[[Derrick Somerset Macnutt]]<ref>{{cite web |last1=Harrison |first1=Derek |title=Derrick Somerset Macnutt |url=http://www.crossword.org.uk/ximenes.htm |website=www.crossword.org.uk |accessdate=18 December 2018}}</ref>\n*[[William Wales (astronomer)]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|West Sussex|London|Schools}}\n*[[Christ's Hospital Band]]\n*[[Christ's Hospital railway station]]\n*[[Erasmus Smith]]\n*[[List of Victoria Crosses by school]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n*{{cite book|last1=Davies-Jenkins|first1=Sue|title=Hang on tight : Christ's Hospital : from girlhood to Governor|date=2010|publisher=The Memoir Club|location=Durham|isbn=978-1-84104-499-6}}\n*{{cite book|last1=Allan|first1=G.

Teams representing 75 nations from all six populated continents entered the competition, and its [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification rounds]] began in May 1968. Fourteen teams qualified from this process to join host nation [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and defending champions [[England national football team|England]] in the 16-team final tournament. [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]], [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] made their first appearances at the final stage.\n\nThe tournament was won by [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], which defeated another two-time former champion, [[Italy national football team|Italy]], 4\u20131 in [[1970 FIFA World Cup Final|the final]] in [[Mexico City]].

football teams|men's national teams]]. Held from 31 May to 21 June in Mexico, it was the first World Cup tournament staged in North America, and the first held outside Europe and South America. Teams representing 75 nations from all six populated continents entered the competition, and its [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification rounds]] began in May 1968. Fourteen teams qualified from this process to join host nation [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and defending champions [[England national football team|England]] in the 16-team final tournament.

The original white settlement was Paiaka to the east, closer to the present town of [[Shannon, New Zealand|Shannon]] in 1844.<ref name=\"Hannigan\" /> When Paiaka was largely destroyed by [[1855 Wairarapa earthquake|an earthquake in 1855]] the settlers moved downstream to Te Awahou,<ref name=\"Hannigan\" /> which was named \"Foxton\" from 1866.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/EP18660920.2.13.1|title=Page 4 Advertisements Column 1 (Evening Post, 1866-09-20)|website=paperspast.natlib.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://horowhenua.kete.net.nz/site/topics/show/2258-a-walk-through-historic-foxton-part-2|title=A walk through historic Foxton \u2013 Part 2|website=Kete Horowhenua}}</ref> In the early years of European settlement it was an important trading post and shipping port as the sea was the easiest way to transport goods and people to the Manawatu. The Manawatu River was then the main access to the rich hinterland. The west coast of the lower North Island is not naturally supplied with harbours and the Foxton harbour had a dangerous bar at the river mouth. As the only real harbour between Whanganui and Wellington it was used anyway.\n\n== History ==\nFoxton was named after Sir [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], and has a history of [[New Zealand flax|flax]] stripping, which was used to make wool packs, matting and rope. Other industries associated with the town have included clothing manufacturing and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink [[Foxton Fizz]],<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7041966/Fizzing-for-return-to-Foxton Fizzing for return to Foxton]</ref> although the products are now made in [[Putaruru]].<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/6572863/Foxton-Fizz-nabs-Z-contract Foxton Fizz nabs Z contract]</ref> \n\nEarly on, Foxton became a thriving regional centre, and with that status came a newspaper - the Manawatu Herald (est. in 1878).\n\nIt was only with the advent of the [[Palmerston North]]-[[Wellington]] railway that [[Palmerston North]] began to overtake it as the most important centre in the [[Manawatu]].  The central government had originally proposed that Foxton was to be on the route of the main line from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Palmerston North]], and a [[Light rail|tramway]] linking Foxton and [[Palmerston North]] was upgraded into the [[Foxton Branch]] railway in the 1870s.  However, due to government delays in extending the line further south, a group of Wellingtonian businessmen established the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] (WMR), which announced in February 1881 that the \"West Coast\" line would run to Longburn, bypassing Foxton. This was a shorter and more direct route to Napier and Auckland, and avoided \"unproductive country\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cassells |first= K R (Ken) |title= Uncommon Carrier \u2013 The History of the Wellington & Manawatu Railway Company, 1882\u20131908 |year= 1994 |publisher= [[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]] |location= Wellington  |isbn= 0908573634 |pages= 20, 22 }}</ref>\n\nWhen this line opened in 1886, Foxton's status as a port slipped, and this position deteriorated further when the WMR was incorporated into the government's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] in 1908. The branch railway closed in 1959, leaving only road access to the town.<ref>Malcolm McKinnon.

Botany of the Manawatu district, New Zealand.

The Manawatu River was then the main access to the rich hinterland. The west coast of the lower North Island is not naturally supplied with harbours and the Foxton harbour had a dangerous bar at the river mouth. As the only real harbour between Whanganui and Wellington it was used anyway.\n\n== History ==\nFoxton was named after Sir [[William Fox (politician)|William Fox]], and has a history of [[New Zealand flax|flax]] stripping, which was used to make wool packs, matting and rope. Other industries associated with the town have included clothing manufacturing and sawmilling. The town is known for producing the soda drink [[Foxton Fizz]],<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/industries/7041966/Fizzing-for-return-to-Foxton Fizzing for return to Foxton]</ref> although the products are now made in [[Putaruru]].<ref>[http://www.stuff.co.nz/dominion-post/business/6572863/Foxton-Fizz-nabs-Z-contract Foxton Fizz nabs Z contract]</ref> \n\nEarly on, Foxton became a thriving regional centre, and with that status came a newspaper - the Manawatu Herald (est. in 1878).\n\nIt was only with the advent of the [[Palmerston North]]-[[Wellington]] railway that [[Palmerston North]] began to overtake it as the most important centre in the [[Manawatu]].  The central government had originally proposed that Foxton was to be on the route of the main line from [[Wellington]] to [[Auckland]] via [[Palmerston North]], and a [[Light rail|tramway]] linking Foxton and [[Palmerston North]] was upgraded into the [[Foxton Branch]] railway in the 1870s.  However, due to government delays in extending the line further south, a group of Wellingtonian businessmen established the [[Wellington and Manawatu Railway]] (WMR), which announced in February 1881 that the \"West Coast\" line would run to Longburn, bypassing Foxton. This was a shorter and more direct route to Napier and Auckland, and avoided \"unproductive country\".<ref>{{cite book |last= Cassells |first= K R (Ken) |title= Uncommon Carrier \u2013 The History of the Wellington & Manawatu Railway Company, 1882\u20131908 |year= 1994 |publisher= [[New Zealand Railway and Locomotive Society]] |location= Wellington  |isbn= 0908573634 |pages= 20, 22 }}</ref>\n\nWhen this line opened in 1886, Foxton's status as a port slipped, and this position deteriorated further when the WMR was incorporated into the government's [[Rail transport in New Zealand|national rail network]] in 1908.

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor.

In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day.

Besides hosting the series, Saget also served as a member of its writing staff, alongside Todd Thicke and Bob Arnott. The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

While Fugelsang has not been seen in new recent never-before-seen footage on the road or in the studio on ''AFV'' since leaving the show in May 1999 after only two years co-hosting it together, Fuentes made a few brief cameo appearances in interview segments likely taking place at her house speaking on behalf of her and Fugelsang (and AFV; especially during their tenure) on the \"AFV: America...

The show moved to a much smaller [[soundstage]] and the set featured various video screens and monitors (resembling iMac computers) placed on shelves. A special sports version of the show called ''AFV: The Sports Edition,'' that was hosted by [[ESPN]] anchor [[Stuart Scott]], was rebroadcast every [[New Year's Day]] and aired occasionally before [[NBA playoff]] games with a post 8:30&nbsp;p.m. Eastern Time tip-off until 2008. A special entitled ''America's Funniest Home Videos: Deluxe Uncensored'' (which was released only on home video and featured somewhat more risque content than that allowed on the television broadcasts) was hosted by [[Steve Carell]] and taped on the set used from the 1998\u201399 season.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron's \"real\" final new episode aired on May 17, 2015, the season finale, ending his run as host after 15 seasons (the longest hosting tenure for the series to date). The episode-- taped on-location at [[Disneyland]] for that season's edition of the annual \"Grand Prize Spectacular,\" ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary and the Disneyland Resort's 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration that began on May 22, 2015 (which has appeared in various formats since 2005, in which one of the two (formerly three) $100,000 winners from the current season wins a [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts]], or in earlier seasons, an [[Adventures by Disney]] vacation package)-- featured an [[auto-tune]]d montage of clips and outtakes from Bergeron's run as host and closed with him being escorted after walking off the outdoor stage near [[Sleeping Beauty Castle]] following the grand prize presentation on a golf cart driven by Saget in a special [[cameo appearance]]. ABC aired encores of this episode on two different occasions-- the first on July 19, 2015, to coincide with Disneyland's official 60th birthday on the weekend of July 17, 2015 (the actual 60th anniversary of Disneyland's grand-opening on July 17, 1955) and the second on September 20, 2015, as the network's final episode airing, new or rerun, of ''AFV'' with Saget and Bergeron signing off for the final time. Bergeron made his first guest appearance in the studio on the season 26 \"Grand Prize Spectacular\" finale of Ribiero's ''AFV'' on May 22, 2016 and played the show's final on-air audience participation game \"Who Breaks It?\" and won an Ribiero ''AFV'' pillow and socks. Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=McClellan, Steve|title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=October 3, 1994|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form. The 2003-2015 Bergeron episodes began airing on [[BiteTV|Bite]] on August 28, 2014 and stopped airing on June 5, 2015.\n\n==Seasons==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!

The most common videos feature unintentional [[physical comedy]], pets or children and some staged [[practical joke|prank]]s. Originally airing as a [[television special|special]] in 1989, it later debuted as a regular weekly series in 1990. The show was hosted by [[Bob Saget]] for the 1989 special and the first eight seasons of the series incarnation. After Saget's retirement from hosting in 1997, [[John Fugelsang]] and [[Daisy Fuentes]] later took over as co-host for its ninth and tenth seasons. After two years of being shown as occasional specials, hosted by various actors and comedians such as [[D.L. Hughley]] and [[Richard Kind]], ABC brought the series back on Friday nights in 2001 with new host [[Tom Bergeron]], who has since become the series' longest-serving host, hosting 15 seasons. Bergeron announced in 2014 that he would be leaving as host of the show, and [[Alfonso Ribeiro]] took over as host in 2015. On October 29, 2018, ABC renewed ''AFV'' for two more seasons, bringing to its 30th (which premiered on Sunday, September 29, 2019) and 31st seasons.\n\n==Premise==\nAFV is based on the [[Tokyo Broadcasting System]] program ''[[Fun TV with Kato-chan and Ken-chan]],'' which featured a segment in which viewers were invited to send in [[video clip]]s from their [[home movies]]; ABC, which owns half the program, pays a royalty fee to the Tokyo Broadcasting System for the use of the format (although the original parent show left the air in 1992).<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105171457/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18306720.html|archive-date=November 5, 2012|author=Littleton, Cynthia|title=Putting the fun in 'Home Videos'; Vincent John Di Bona, executive producer of television program ''America's Funniest Home Videos''|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=May 20, 1996|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Contestants can submit their videos by uploading them on the show's official website, AFV.com, on the AFV applications for Android or iOS or on the AFV Official Facebook fan page, or by sending them via mail to a [[Hollywood, California]] [[post-office box]] address.<ref name=\"afv.com\" /> The majority of the video clips are short (5\u201330 seconds) and are mostly related to the host's monologues. Videos usually feature people and animals getting into humorous accidents caught on camera; while others include clever marriage proposals, people and animals displaying interesting talents (such as pets that sound like they speak certain words or phrases, or genius toddlers with the ability to name all past [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidents]]), and [[practical joke]]s. A group of screeners view the submitted tapes, giving them a grade (on a scale of 1\u201310) based on that particular tape's humor. The videos deemed the funniest by the screeners then go on to the show's producers and then is turned over to Di Bona and another producer for final approval.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120124/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8162596.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Susan Bickelhaupt, Globe Staff|title='Funniest Home Videos' Outstrips '60 Minutes'|agency=[[The Boston Globe]]|date=February 28, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Home video material that involves staged accidents, or/and adults, children, or babies getting seriously injured or the abuse of animals, or overall does not meet ABC network [[standards and practices]] are generally not accepted and will not appear on the show.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3995728.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title=Saget aims to clip hurtful video bits|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=April 27, 1990|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> Every week, the producers choose three videos that the studio audience will vote on.

In 2014, all episodes of the show that were originally produced and aired in standard definition before both the season 21 premiere and the show's initial conversion to HD capability simultaneously in 2010 and/or already airing in rerun syndication for almost over a decade or more (and still are) got stretched vertically downward with slightly re-edited graphics due to widescreen and HD broadcast capability and signals on more broadcast television stations (and cable) networks, ''AFV''{{'}}s 25th anniversary, Tom Bergeron's 15th and final year as host of the show, and Alfonso Ribiero's entrance as the current host in season 26 that also included an almost-brand-new set, new version of the theme song, new graphics, and new logo among other things; while the funny video clips recorded with the use of camcorders before 2009 or the years preceding the invention of today's mobile devices such as the iPhone or iPad (and especially the videos that were aired on episodes in the Bob Saget, John Fugelsang, Daisy Fuentes, and the early Tom Bergeron eras of ''AFV'') continued (and still continue in the Alfonso Ribiero run of ''AFV'') to be stretched horizontally to this day.

The success of ''AFHV'' led to a spinoff called ''[[America's Funniest People]],'' hosted by Saget's ''Full House'' co-star [[Dave Coulier]] (and co-hosted by actress/producer [[Arleen Sorkin]] for the first two seasons, then model [[Tawny Kitaen]] for the final two), focusing on videos featuring people ''intentionally'' trying to be funny by doing celebrity impressions, committing pranks, and performing short amateur comedy routines, among other things.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120305/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4001399.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=Ernest Tucker|title='Video' host rewinds pal's format|work=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date=June 3, 1990|access-date=March 8, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> During the show's first four seasons, ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' aired on Sunday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]];<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120321/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1226954.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=John Carmody|title=The TV Column|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=December 6, 1989|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> beginning with the fifth season, the show started the Sunday primetime lineup on ABC, airing at 7:00&nbsp;p.m., followed by ''America's Funniest People'' at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. as part of an hour-long block of funny home videos.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC153DF932A25756C0A965958260|author=Bill Carter|title=Coming Next: New ABC Prime Time|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 11, 1993}}</ref> Saget always ended each episode with the phrase \"Keep those cameras safely rolling\" and saying something to his wife who was (implied to be) watching the show. Beginning about the middle of the first season, the show began featuring the \"Assignment America\" segment, which called for a series of videos to be sent in (collected or made) pertaining to a specific theme. Another segment introduced during Saget's tenure as host called \"Backwards Classics,\" shows videos being played in reverse set to classical music. Since the show's debut as a regular series, the show routinely includes two to three times per episode, a montage of themed videos set to a particular song, called the \"Music Montage\"; classic songs (mostly from the 1950s through the 1970s, with only a few songs from the 1980s scattered in) were used during these montages in the original run of the series, though more recent pop, R&B and rock songs have been incorporated since Tom Bergeron became the show's host. In season five, an animated sidekick was introduced named \"Stretchy McGillicuddy\" (voiced by [[Danny Mann]]), who was known for trying to tease Saget and doing other crazy things. In one episode (in season five), he was shown on the two large TV monitors on both sides of the set and Bob had to turn him off with a remote. Stretchy's catchphrase was: \"Don't get a little touchy, Bob, I'm just a little stretchy!\" The character was dropped from the show at the end of the seventh season. In 1994, ABC canceled ''America's Funniest People'' after four seasons due to declining ratings and had to decide what to do with its Sunday night 7:30&nbsp;p.m. timeslot.

For Saget's final season on ''AFHV,'' two new episodes would be shown. Numerous comedy skits were performed on the set during Saget's tenure as host. The set consisted of a living room design (the main set, originally a three-wall design with a bay window, was remodeled for the 1992\u201393 season as a flatter frame outline with translucent walls \u2013 though the furniture featured on the original set remained). The beginning of each episode was tied in with a skit just before the transition was made from the introduction to Saget. This usually consisted of several actors in a fake room (usually in the upper part of the audience section or in another soundstage) pretending to get excited watching ''America's Funniest Home Videos,'' a technique that was scrapped at the end of the fifth season. Saget himself soon grew tired of the repetitive format and was eager to pursue other projects as a comedian, actor and director. Producer Di Bona held him to his contract, resulting in a frustrated Saget listlessly going through the motions, constantly getting out of character and making pointed remarks on the air during his last two seasons. Saget's contract expired in May 1997 and he decided to leave the show afterward. However, according to Di Bona, the producers felt a change (and change of hosts) was needed for ''AFV'' as a result of ABC going through a change of leadership (hence ABC's ownership transition from Capital Cities to Disney).<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120437/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-83875289.html \"News Lite: Names in the News; ABC 'Videos' Gets New Host\"], ''[[Los Angeles Daily News]]'', August 2, 1997.

During this period, the show introduced a segment called \"Bad News, Good News,\" which shows a video of an accident; then one of the hosts makes a humorous statement about the upside of what happened. This segment continued to appear occasionally until the fourth year of Bergeron's stint as host. Another notable segment was the \"AFV Hall of Fame,\" in which a clip is shown and Fugelsang reveals the moment of impact (a screen that shows a still picture of that clip) that occurred in it. This segment was scrapped at the end of season ten. Another featured segment was \"Who Would You Like to See...\" in which a random person is asked which celebrity they would like to see involved in a random humorous mishap, with a photo of a celebrity's face posterized over the face of the actual person in the video.

Retrieved March 6, 2011, from HighBeam Research.</ref> On July 20, 2001, the show returned in its third format, this time with Bergeron, who was also hosting [[Hollywood Squares]] at the time. The show was expanded to a single full hour-long episode, instead of two consecutive half-hour episodes, and was shown Friday nights at 8:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern; however, it went on hiatus for two months due in part to the [[September 11 attacks]] and also because of ABC airing specials and trying a new Friday night lineup (''[[The Mole (U.S. season 2)|The Mole II: The Next Betrayal]],'' ''[[Thieves (TV series)|Thieves]]'' and\n''[[Once and Again]]''), which was ultimately short-lived (''Thieves'' ended after only ten episodes, the first eight of which aired) and the show returned to the schedule in December 2001. In his earlier episodes, Bergeron used the set (with the bulky see-through iMac computers) from the ''AFV'' specials that aired in 2000, until the latter part of his first season, when a new set (with a studio audience) was introduced featuring a round video screen with several monitors. In September 2003, the show returned to its former Sunday 7:00&nbsp;p.m. Eastern timeslot, still an hour long (though special episodes occasionally aired on Friday nights until 2007). Unlike Saget, who provided voice-overs to the clips, Bergeron humorously narrated them, though he did lend his voice to some clips from time to time. Changes of the set were replacement of the round video wall by a curved video wall, changing the color of the pillars to blue (sometimes other colors), addition of curved light borders hanging through the set, lights under the center with return of the letters \"AFV.\" The Bergeron version added new segments, such as \"Tom's Home Movies,\" where his face is digitally superimposed over the face of a person in each of the videos with varying expressions shown to match the person's reaction to their mishaps in the videos (a recurring gag referenced by Bergeron in this segment is on his superimposed head being larger than normal size), various audience participation games using funny home videos including \"Head, Gut, or Groin,\" where Bergeron picked one or two members of the studio audience to guess whether the person in the video would be hit in the aforementioned three areas of the body in order to win an ''America's Funniest Home Videos'' compilation DVD (since the 2012\u201313 season, a [[bobblehead]] of Bergeron was given as the prize) and the \"slo-mo gizmo,\" where a video is played first at normal speed and then again at a slower speed and using [[telestrator]]. Bergeron nearly always ended each episode with the phrase \"If you get it on tape, you could get it in cash,\" which was later changed to \"Upload to us. Get rich, get famous\" by the 2008-09 season. That phrase would continue to be used for another 10 years, including into Ribiero's first three seasons until the season 29 premiere on Sunday, September 30, 2018. While only four or more of the Bergeron-era segments (\"Vs.,\" \"The Dog/Cat Park,\" \"Name That Sound\" and \"A Moment With...\" to say the least) and a few interactive games continue to be shown on Ribiero's ''AFV'' at present, the segments introduced (and still seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Bergeron hosted the show include: \n*\"Vs.\" (featuring compilations of two sets of related videos, in which the \"winner\" of the two is revealed at the end, followed by a fictional \"preview\" of the videos in which the winner is claimed to face in the next segment)\n*\"A Moment of EWWWWW!\" (featuring a video that focuses on something gross such as mucus hanging from a person's nose after sneezing)\n*\"The Dog/Cat Park\" (a compilation of animal videos featuring dogs or cats that is named accordingly to the animals featured)\n*\"AFV Family of the Week\" (featuring funny videos of adults and children, the \"family\" featured are actually people of no familial relation)\n*\"Nincompoop Corner\" (a compilation of videos of people getting into situations that humorously showcase a lack of good judgement)\n*\"AFV Dictionary\" (featuring a humorous dictionary definition made to apply to the video being shown)\n*\"Name that Sound\" (which features audio of an unusual sound, followed by a clip of the video which the sound came from that usually reveals a person or animal making the noise)\n*\"Pick the Real Video\" (a multiple-choice game in which audience members are asked to choose which video is the one that will be shown)\n*\"What's Behind the Blue Blob,\" \"Kid, Cat, or Canine\" (both are games which audience members are asked to guess the person, animal or object featured in the video that is then revealed)\n*\"The Naughty File\" (featuring a video incorporating inappropriate behavior such as a child urinating at a family gathering)\n*\"A Moment With...\" (An out of the ordinary video is shown for a few seconds)\n*\"What's with the French?\"\n*\"AFV Pop Quiz\" (a multiple-choice game leading into and out of a commercial break in which viewers are asked to guess what occurs next in the video)\n*\"The AFV $10,000 Club\" (an early segment in which a home video that already won $10,000 in a previous show was showcased) \n*''Mysterious Mysteries of Mystery'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a video with mysterious things happening like balloons replacing faces, in news headline form)\n*''On This Day in AFV History'' (an early segment in which Tom narrates a very old video, with a date, which Tom says that date, for example, a video from October 10, 1987, features a kid petting a pig, which bites him in the crotch)\n*\"A Salute To... \" (a segment that salutes specifically themed clips)\nStarting with the 2007\u201308 season, the series began allowing viewers to upload their funny home videos online at ABC.com, but has since the 2012\u201313 season; launched their own website that same year and has viewers upload their videos instead to AFV.com, in addition to sending their videos via standard mail.

Bergeron made his second ''AFV'' guest appearance alongside Ribiero, Saget and (from the John and Daisy-era) Fuentes for an ''AFV'' 30th anniversary special called \"AFV: America...This Is You\" on Sunday, December 8, 2019 to celebrate ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary.<ref name=VarietyRibeiroAFV>{{cite web|title=Alfonso Ribeiro Named New Host of 'America's Funniest Home Videos'|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/alfonso-ribeiro-americas-funniest-home-videos-new-host-1201500927/|periodical=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|date=May 19, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Bob Saget Showed Up For Tom Bergeron's Last America's Funniest Home Videos Episode|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/m/television/Bob-Saget-Showed-Up-Tom-Bergeron-Last-America-Funniest-Home-Videos-Episode-71971.html|author=Nick Venable|website=Cinema Blend|date=May 18, 2015|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===2015\u2013present: Alfonso Ribeiro===\n[[File:AFHV new logo.png|thumb|Current version of alternative logo, used since 2015.]]\nOn May 19, 2015, two days after Bergeron's final episode aired, ABC announced that Ribeiro (known for playing [[Carlton Banks]] on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'') would take over as host of ''AFV'' beginning with the season 26 premiere on October 11, 2015. Bergeron formally introduced Ribeiro's new role as host during the latter's guest performance on the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 20)|season 20 finale]] of ''Dancing with the Stars'' (Ribeiro appeared as a DWTS competitor and won the [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 19)|previous season]]). Before becoming the current host of the show, Ribeiro made his only guest appearance in the studio on a season 25 episode of ''AFV'' playing one of the show's audience participation games with then-host Bergeron called \"Who's Makin' That Racket?\". While some of the Bergeron-era clip segments, the in-studio audience and background parts of the Bergeron-era set props remained intact and/or continued to air for all five years of Ribiero's tenure as host, the stage featured a metal floor layout and stairway connected to a cube screen put together like a puzzle using smaller sized flat-panel TV screens and new segments (especially for Ribiero's run) continued to be added and aired on the show. The show also introduced the Squares-era (probably in reference to the cube screen) with Ribiero's entrance as host in 2015. Additional set props like the arrow screens with flat-panel monitors on them and light-up color-changing versions of the tables where some of the studio audience sit when not in the bleacher areas made their debut to the ''AFV'' set starting in 2019. Starting in March 2018, when ''American Idol'' returned to television as an ABC show after one year off the air since being cancelled by FOX, the credits started sometimes being shown on some episodes at the bottom of the screen entirely at the beginning and ending (during Ribeiro's signoffs) of the show with the spinning Vin Di Bona Productions signature logo and ABC copyright notice being shown in the image shots of the studio without the background bumpers and jingles at show's actual end. Also, starting in 2019, the main logo (not the letter initials) with announcer [[Jess Harnell]] using the full name of show as he's welcoming the studio audience and viewers to \"America's Funniest Home Videos\" (and introducing Ribiero to the set) at the beginning of the program was moved to the lower right corner of TV screens after many years and decades seen right at the center of the screen. Ribeiro also humorously narrates the clip, much like his predecessor, though he makes extensive use of rhyming in his speeches. The segments introduced (and still yet to be seen in reruns whenever and wherever available for airtime) during this period when Ribiero hosted the show include:\n*\"#TBT: But On A...\" (a \"Throwback Thursday\" segment that started in the Ribiero-era of ''AFV'' that reunites viewers, including longtime viewers and fans of ''AFV'' on any day of the week, including Thursdays, Sundays and Mondays, with theirs and the show's nostalgic, classic and some new modern classic clips submitted over the decades past and present-- provided all episodes of ''AFV'' with or without this segment and regardless of host-- as shows and clips become reruns and classics in their own right when they reach syndication-- are aired on any local station, cable and broadcast network again and again on any day of the week and at present with new episodes of ''AFV'' and this segment airing on Sundays on ABC. In season 30, a temporary \"Throwback 30\" version of this segment debuted in ''AFV''{{'}}s 30th anniversary season that takes you to clips from specific years-- all clips from, let's say 1989-- similar to the \"On This Day In AFV History\" segment from Bergeron's ''AFV'' run, but with more clips and not just one)\n*\"Hey Alfonso!\" (segment not \"officially\" named until season 30 that since season 26 features kids and adults in videos asking Alfonso to show them and the viewers specifically themed clips-- Dogs, slow-mo, the like)\n*\"This One Time On AFV\" (clips shown with a [[Mother Goose]] or fairy tale storytelling skit)\n*\"Alfonso's Flubs\" (blooper clips of Ribeiro in the studio trying to get his monologue lines right)\n*\"Alfonso's Rhyme Time\" (Ribeiro comes up with rhyming words in his clip narration that relate to the funny subject matter of the clip)\n*\"I Think I See The Problem\" (a segment featuring clips of people looking for one way to solve a problem, but unintentionally discover another way household problems can be solved through funny fails)\n*\"#NotTrending\" (clips of attempted trends and fads by ordinary people never thought of that could catch on later, but haven't or don't look like they could trend or catch on soon on social media-- ''AFV'' is a start for them)\n*\"Maybe It's Not Your Thing\" (clips of people trying to do things and finally fail at doing that not be their thing)\n*\"Alfonso's Advice\" (Ribeiro giving advice to the viewer on how to avoid a fail as clips show people failing to follow the advice)\n*\"Video Symphony\" (Clips featuring sound effects in ''AFV''{{'}}s version of a musical symphony)\n*\"What The Fluff\" (Clips featuring people disappearing or sometimes attempting and failing to disappear \"magically\" behind towels by running; to the amazement and/or despair of kids and/or animals)\n*\"Bad Places To Sit\" (Clips featuring people sitting in bad chairs and calling down or animals sitting in strange, bad locations)\n*\"Something To Brighten Your Day\" (Clips to make you laugh and brighten your day after a bad day)\n*\"The Problem Then/Now\" (featuring clips from, let's say, 1989, 1993, 1997, 2001 and 2004 likely representing the \"Then\" and clips from 2017, 2019 and 2020 representing the \"Now\" while the \"Now's\" will eventually become \"Then's\" as the clips and episode become classics and reruns in their own right in the upcoming decades)\n*\"Horrible Headlines\" (''AFV''{{'}}s funny version of \"Fake News\" featuring horribly non-newsworthy funny-- or scary-- clips)\n*\"Catastrophe Countdown\" (Featuring clips of people who hopefully will avert catastrophe in 3, 2, 1 and catastrophe happens)\n*\"Here's Why\" (Showing viewers why people shouldn't do things the way they do them or get things where they shouldn't get them)\nBeginning with the 2018-19 season, Ribeiro nearly ended each week's episode with the phrase \"Good night, everybody and remember, send your video to us (or 'me' referring to Ribeiro), get yourself on TV\" after three (and including the final seven years of the Bergeron-era, 10) years of saying \"Upload to us.

For the start of the season on October 8, 2017, instead of leading off Sunday nights, it aired Sunday nights at 8 p.m. ET/7 p.m. CT and was led into at the start of the season by ''[[The Toy Box]].'' During some parts of the holiday season starting on November 26, 2017 and remaining that way for almost the first two months of 2018 through January 21, 2018 (and final 'repeat/repeat' on February 4, 2018), ''AFV'' aired in a 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format. ''AFV'' returned with new episodes in the 7/6 central time slot (still an hour-long on Sunday nights) due to holiday movie presentations and specials airing on ABC on Sunday nights at 8/7 central during the holiday season on December 10, 2017, and then permanently starting on February 11, 2018. ABC repeated the 'repeat/new episode' scheduling format for ''AFV'' on January 6, 2019, with new episodes returning to the 7/6 central time slot on March 3, 2019, when ''American Idol'' premieres with ''AFV'' likely to be pre-empted in some time zones when ''American Idol'' airs the live (in all time-zones) finale episodes in May 2019. ABC renewed ''AFV'' for a 29th season on March 13, 2018, which premiered at its regular 7/6 central Sunday night timeslot (and was the lead-off starting on October 7, 2018 to ''Dancing With The Stars Juniors'') on September 30, 2018.\n\n==$100,000 contest==\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2015}}\nAfter every half of the season, the $10,000 winners from the preceding episodes are brought back to participate in a contest to win an additional $100,000. (Previously, there would be three $100,000 shows per season, after runs of shows consisting of either 5, 6, or 7 episodes. Beginning with the 24th season, the format changed to two $100,000 shows, each one after a 9-or-10-episode run. This format was also used in season 9, as well as seasons 12-14.) Two $100,000 contests air each season (the final $100,000 episode originally aired as the season finale until the 15th season, at which point it begin airing as the episode before each season's final episode), though only one aired in the first season.<ref name=\"afv.com\">{{cite web|url=http://afv.com/contest-rules/ |title=Contest Rules}}</ref>\n\n===Voting===\n*1990\u201397 (Saget era): ABC stations (5 in season one, 3 from 1990 to 1993, and 2 from 1993 onward) around the country are joined via satellite to cast their votes along with the Los Angeles studio audience (the final $100,000 show of season two was decided by a telephone vote).\n*1998\u2013present (post-Saget era): Three formats have been used at various times:\n# The Los Angeles studio audience votes to determine the winner.\n# Viewers log onto the show's website to cast their votes.\n# The show declares the winner by going to the Disney Parks and asking park-goers, as well inviting characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck and Goofy, to determine the $100,000 winning clip.<ref name=\"afv.com\"/>\n\n===Other contests===\n* 2002: \"Battle of the Best\": The Quad Squad ($25,000 and trip to Maui)<ref>{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Josh |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2148214/ |title=The agonizing journey from America's Funniest Home Videos to YouTube.&nbsp;\u2013 By Josh Levin&nbsp;\u2013 Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 9, 2009}}</ref>\n* 2005: Disney Dream Vacation ($100,000 and free vacations to all 11 [[Walt Disney Parks and Resorts|Disney theme parks]] around the world)\n* 2006: Dancing Machine ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 48 years)\n* 2006: The Quad Squad ($250,000) (The Funniest Video of All Time)\n* 2009: Birthday Blowout ($100,000 and free vacations to 500+ places for 50 years)\n* 2015: H20 NO-NO: Trip To Disneyland for 60 People (to celebrate the Disneyland Resort 60th Anniversary Diamond Celebration)\n* 2016: Donkey Delights: Trip to Disney World Florida and Shanghai Disneyland China\n* 2018: Sedated Saber Skirmish: Trip to Walt Disney World to experience the new Toy Story Land\n* 2019: Blast with the Laughing Gas: Trip to Aulani: A Disney Resort in Hawaii\n\n==Ratings==\n===Season averages===\n''America's Funniest Home Videos'' became an instant hit with audiences, with the original special in November 1989 averaging a 17.7 rating and 25 share, finishing at ninth place in the Nielsen ratings that week.

This version of the song accompanied the opening and closing credits for the first seven-and-a-half seasons. This theme was reused once again for when [[Tom Bergeron]] introduced [[Bob Saget]] as well as a montage of classic videos and Saget's first, original intro moment to the stage from the pilot episode and a latter segment (using the theme's original lyrics) showcasing Saget's run (during ''AFV''{{'}}s first eight seasons) on the show in the ''AFV'' 20th anniversary special, which aired in 2009. The show's online series of videos entitled ''AFV XD'' is noted for its use of this version of the theme song, as well as portions of the original graphics from the 1989\u201397 seasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/show/afvxd|title=AFV XD}}</ref>{{Better source|reason=No content on this channel.|date=October 2016}} During the final part of the $100,000 shows, bands as well as other artists would play the theme. Midway through Saget's final season in 1997, the theme was revamped (as well as the graphics and animation of the show's intro) featuring a duet of new vocals, Peter Hix (who had previously performed the theme song for ''America's Funniest People'') and Terry Wood. The new version was also set in a different key than the original. When ''AFHV'' returned for its ninth season with Fuentes and Fugelsang in 1998, a completely new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" made its debut. Since that time, the theme has been an instrumental (also composed by Slider) with a faster, ska/reggae beat, with the original key restored, making it sound similar to \"[[The Impression That I Get]]\" by [[The Mighty Mighty Bosstones]]. The 13th season uses the trimmed version of 1998 ''AFV'' theme song, in which was heard as a guitar chorus which was heard in theme song during seasons 14-22, as well as an alternate version of this theme exists that is stripped of the trumpets (this version is only heard as the closing theme during the 2002\u201303 season in ABC and broadcast syndication runs, as well as in re-edited bumpers with added video clips from that particular episode in some 2002\u201303 season episodes in broadcast syndication). In reruns of the Fugelsang-Fuentes episodes on [[WGN America]] and later the Bergeron episodes on WGN America and [[ABC Family]], the theme is noticeably slowed down during the show's opening titles and commercial bumpers. For season 26, with Ribeiro, a new arrangement of \"The Funny Things You Do\" was introduced with that season's premiere episode in 2015, replacing the 1998 theme after seventeen seasons. The current theme, which Slider also composed, is stylized more alike the original version with its key of that theme, as well as the additional hook of the 1998 version retained. The 1990, 1998 and 2015 themes can be heard in their entirety at the Television Production Music Museum. The 1997 theme used during Saget's last season has not been released to this day, as it is reportedly being held by Di Bona. \"The Funny Things You Do\" was the theme song to the [[Australia's Funniest Home Videos|Australian version]] between 1991 and 2004. It was replaced by an instrumental version as part of a major revamp in 2005.\n\n==Reruns/syndication==\n{{more citations needed section|date=April 2017}}\nVirtually all episodes of ''AFHV'' are, or have been, in [[broadcast syndication|syndication]], with each host period packaged separately from each other. Until 2001, the Saget version was syndicated by [[20th Television]], which assumed syndication rights through its purchase of [[MTM Enterprises]], which had syndicated the show from 1995 to 1998.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106120747/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-15768681.html|archive-date=November 6, 2012|author=McClellan, Steve|title=MTM launches 'Videos'; MTM Television Distribution offers syndication of America's Funniest Home Videos\"|journal=[[Broadcasting & Cable]]|date=October 3, 1994|access-date=March 7, 2011|via=HighBeam Research}}</ref> [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] (formerly Buena Vista Television), the sister company of one of the show's production companies [[ABC Productions]], distributes all versions of the series. Ironically, [[Disney]]/[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] would [[Acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney|acquire]] [[20th Television]]'s parent ([[21st Century Fox]]) in 2019, thus effectively giving Disney ownership of the series' original syndicator (along with the remains of MTM).\n\n===Bob Saget episodes===\nThe Saget episodes were split into two separate packages: Seasons 1-5 (1989\u201394) and Seasons 6-8 (1994-97). All episodes from all the Bob Saget seasons aired in off-network syndication. The episodes from Seasons 1-5 aired on [[Ion Televison (American TV channel)|PAX]] from 2003 to 2005, [[Nick at Nite]] from April to October 2007 and [[Hallmark Channel]] from January 2010 to April 2011. When the Saget episodes aired in syndication thru MTM/20th Television, the contest plugs were replaced by a generic version announced by Gary Owens. In addition, the closing credits were slightly edited to include a telephone number to visit the show online. In the PAX airings, when back-to-back episodes aired, the end credits from the first episode (outside Di Bona's executive producer credit on some episodes and $100,000 shows where marching bands performed the show's theme in celebration) and the opening titles of the second episode were cut and replaced with an announcer saying \"Now don't go away, here's more of ''America's Funniest Home Videos!''\" before cutting to Anderson introducing Saget. These episodes also removed some videos, along with winner's interviews in order to fit more network advertising within a 30-minute time slot, a practice also used by Nick at Nite and Hallmark. Some contest plugs were also removed, except for PAX airings. Nick at Nite and Hallmark sometimes uses a modern generic contest plug announced by Harnell. Modern scrolling network-projected [[closing credits]] also scrolled by at the end of episodes, rather than the original credits. The episodes from Seasons 6-8 aired on [[Freeform (TV channel)|ABC Family]] from September 2004 to October 2007 with outdated information and contest plugs removed.\n\n===Tom Bergeron episodes===\nThe Bergeron episodes began airing in off-network syndication on September 14, 2009; [[WGN America]] also aired the off-network syndicated episodes in late night until September 2011. [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]] has aired reruns of the Tom Bergeron-era episodes of ''AFV'' since 2016. Since 2014, re-edits of this episode run before the show's HD conversion premiered to fill a [[16:9]] frame and to remove outdated content and contest plugs. The 2009\u20132015 Tom Bergeron episodes began airing on [[TBS (U.S. TV channel)|TBS]] on September 15, 2014, with earlier episodes eventually becoming a part of the package until TBS stopped carrying the show in 2017.\n\n===Alfonso Ribeiro episodes===\nRibeiro's run has yet to enter syndication, though he does regular promotional advertising on the 2015\u2013present ''AFV'' set for [[Up (TV channel)|UPtv]]'s syndication package of Bergeron-era episodes. ABC of course sometimes airs repeats of the current or previous season(s) (regardless of hosts) on Sunday evenings on weeks without a new episode and sometimes in other time slots, mainly Saturday evenings when no sports coverage is offered.\n\n===International airings===\nIn Canada, [[Corus Entertainment]] currently holds repeat rights to the Saget (seasons 6-8) and Bergeron era of the series and it airs on [[ABC Spark]] (94-97 episodes) and [[CMT (Canadian TV channel)|CMT]] (Bergeron era). Currently no network broadcasts new episodes in Canada as of the fall of 2018, leaving viewers to watch the original ABC airing; in the past, [[Citytv]] and its sister network [[Omni Television]], along with [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] carried the series, though those networks have since let the rights lapse due to [[National Football League|NFL]] commitments which block any [[simultaneous substitution|simsub]] opportunities for advertising if ''AFV'' aired later. Australia's [[Fox8]] also carries the series, both in new and rerun form.
