And this is not uncommon. We\u2019ve seen this with many, many other disease outbreaks, new viruses that emerge. They trickle out from rural areas through a person getting infected maybe in Hunan province and then moving into Wuhan, that maybe they\u2019re part of the [[wildlife trade]]. Maybe a farmer got infected, or a farmer\u2019s animals, and they were shipped into the markets.

Development began by the beginning of 1999, with styling freeze in early 2001 and engineering sign-off in 2003.\n\n==Japanese model==\n\n[[File:SUBARU LEGACY B4 ASTEROPE 01.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru Legacy B4 GT Asterope]]\n\nOn May 23, 2003, Fuji Heavy Industries continued to offer the \"Blitzen\" model in Japan only, and debuted the fourth generation Legacy B4 Hardtop Body for the [[Japanese Domestic Market]] with tagline Blood type\uff1aB4 and the commercial song are the remixed version of \"[[Gymnop\u00e9dies|GYMNOPEDIE No.1]]\" When Touring Wagon Body debuted with tagline Grand Touring Speciality and the commercial song are \"Finding Beauty\" composed by Scottish composer [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]] from His second independent album [[As If to Nothing]]. The Hardtop Legacy B4 and Touring Wagon Model was voted the 2003\u20132004 [[Japan Car of the Year]], Subaru's first win for the award after fighting off stiff competition from [[Toyota Prius (XW20)|Toyota Prius]] and [[Mazda RX-8]]. in 2005 [[Bruce Willis]] was return as a spokesman for second time after [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)|first generation]] in 1991 to 1993 with tagline I feel LEGACY. Blitzen was a special package above the standard Legacy vehicles, and all Blitzen models were identified with the \"B4\" branding.\n\nStarting with this generation, Subaru installed an [[Electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] instrument cluster which lights up when the engine is started, regardless if the exterior lights are on.\n\nFor the home market, the Legacy B4 and Touring Wagon were offered in 2.0i, 2.0R, 2.0GT, 2.0GT {{proper name|spec.B}}, 3.0R, and 3.0R {{proper name|spec.B}} trim levels. The base model 2.0i has SOHC version of EJ20 engine producing 140 PS, and the 2.0R comes with 165 PS DOHC engine. The turbocharged EJ20 DOHC engine installed in the 2.0GT and 2.0GT {{proper name|spec.B}} producing 280 PS Due to advancements in turbocharger technology and tightening emission standards, the twin-turbo setup was replaced by a [[Turbocharger#Twin-scroll|twin scroll turbo]] and [[Active valve control system|AVCS]]. The 3.0R and 3.0R {{proper name|spec.B}} are powered by the new 250 PS 6-cylinder EZ30 engine.\n\nTo commemorate Subaru's 50 years of making automobiles and The First Japan Car of the Year Victory, the '''50th Anniversary''' Legacy was released in January 2004. This special edition model was based on the Legacy 2.0R, and 2.0GT.\n\n[[File:Legacy-Blitzen.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru Legacy Blitzen Touring Wagon]]\n\nThe Legacy '''Blitzen''' of December 2004 is the special edition based on the 2.0GT B4 and Touring Wagon. These high-performance sports models came with special colour bright red, sports suspension, 18-inch alloys, unique grille, and aero-style bumpers.\n\nBased on the Legacy 2.0GT {{proper name|spec.B}} B4 and Touring Wagon, the '''WR-Limited 2004''' was released in July 2004, and the 2.0GT-based '''WR-Limited 2005''' was launched in August 2005. The WR-Limited models were painted in WR Blue Mica, and came with Gold alloy wheels, front under spoiler, special blue and black seats, and special emblems.\n\nAlso added to the Japanese line-up in August 2005 was the Legacy '''2.0GT {{proper name|spec.B}} tuned by STI'''. This sports model has Bilstein suspension, 5-speed for 2005 or 6-speed manual for models after 2006, STI genome exhaust, [[Brembo]] brakes (4-piston front, 2-piston rear) and 18-inch alloy wheels by STI.\n\n===Facelift model (2006\u201308)===\n[[File:Subaru Legacy B4 BL.jpg|thumb|right|The facelifted Subaru Legacy B4 2.0R (Japan)]]\n\nThe Japanese Legacy received a cosmetic update in May 2006. Notable changes included new bumpers, headlights, front fenders, grille, and rear combination lamps. This facelift trickled down to export models in 2007.\n\n[[Kazuyoshi Miura]] was used as a spokesman for the Hardtop, Touring Wagon and Outback and the commercial song were from Japanese rock band [[L'Arc-en-Ciel]].\n\nAlthough model grades remained largely unchanged, the number of option packages available for certain grades reduced. The base model 2.0i Touring Wagon could also be ordered as the Casual Selection model. Urban Selection models were added to the 2.0R, 2.0GT, and 2.0GT SI-Cruise. The 2.0R was also offered as B-Sports Limited version.\n\n===EyeSight (2008\u201309)===\nOn 2008-05-08, Subaru announced the EyeSight models for Japanese market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/news/08_04_06/08_05_08_01.html |title=\u30b9\u30d0\u30eb \u30ec\u30ac\u30b7\u30a3 \u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u3092\u4e00\u90e8\u6539\u826f |publisher=Subaru.jp |accessdate=2009-06-01}}</ref> It consists of 2 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD cameras]] with one on each side of the rear-view mirror, that use human-like [[stereoscopic]] vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver.

The [[Subaru of Indiana|Lafayette Factory]]-built Subaru Legacy won [[International Car of the Year|2005 International Car of the Year]] for Most Dependable/Sedan from ''[[Road & Travel Magazine]]'', 2005 Automobile All-Stars for All-Star Family Car from [[Automobile (magazine)|''Automobile Magazine'']] and The 2006 [[International Engine of the Year]] Award in the 2.0 litre to 2.5 litre category for [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ255|EJ255]] engine.\n\nThe model marked the return of a turbocharged engine to the North American Legacy, featuring the [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ255|EJ255]] engine rated at {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, a 2.5-liter unit derived from that of the [[Subaru Impreza (second generation)|USDM Impreza WRX]] with {{convert|20|hp|kW||abbr=on}} more.{{Clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} Due to advancements in turbocharger technology and tightening emission standards, the twin-turbo setup was not used. Turbocharged models, along with the H6 engine, offered Subaru's first 5-speed automatic transmission, featuring SportShift technology licensed from Prodrive, Ltd.\n\nThe 2005 model year Legacy was offered in 2.5i, 2.5i Limited, 2.5GT, and 2.5GT Limited. All trim levels were available as Sedan and Wagon. The wagon body shared the roof sheet metal with the Outback model that had raised metal \"humps\" under the roof rails, unlike the Japanese and European wagons that had a sleeker roof. Another difference from other overseas markets was that both sedans and wagons had longer front and rear bumpers, designed to meet the Canadian 5-mph bumper specification.\n\nFor 2006, the regular GT was dropped, and the 2.5i Special Edition was added into the line up. The manual transmission was also discontinued for the [[station wagon]]. Priced between the base and the Limited models, the 2.5i Special Edition came with a power moonroof and power driver seat, while the 2.5i Limited also came with leather interior, power front passenger seat, and climate control automatic air condition.\n\nThe high-performance Subaru Legacy '''2.5GT {{proper name|spec.B}}''' arrived as a 500-unit limited edition model for the 2006 model year, and became a regular model for the next following years. It has Bilstein shock absorbers and 18-inch alloy wheels for better handling, Vehicle Dynamics Control, and from 2007, 6-speed manual gearbox and the ''Subaru Intelligent Drive'' ('''SI-Drive''') with three modes: Intelligent, Sport, and Sport Sharp. The 2.5GT {{proper name|spec.B}} model is only available as a sedan and not a station wagon.\n\n[[File:2008 Subaru Legacy Wagon.jpg|left|thumb|2008 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Wagon (Canada)]]\nFor the 2008 model year, the Legacy sedan received facelift with new bumpers, front fenders, tail lights, and alloy wheels. By this time the Legacy wagon and [[Subaru Outback#Third generation (2003\u20132009)|Outback]] sedan were discontinued, leaving only the Legacy sedan and Outback wagon, though the wagon was not discontinued in Canada. 2008 also brought the 3.0&nbsp;L EZ30 flat-6 engine to the North American Legacy sedan in the 3.0R Limited trim level. The flat-6 has been available in the Outback sedan wagon since 2000. For 2008, the 2.5i USA model has been certified [[PZEV]] emissions, and a badge has been attached to the rear of the vehicle on the bottom right hand side of the trunklid or tailgate. All other models are certified [[Low Emission Vehicle#Phase 2 - 2004 and later|LEV2]]. The PZEV Legacy is available for sale in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers, who only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==European Model==\n[[File:2008 Subaru Legacy Sports Tourer REn 2.0 Rear.jpg|right|thumb|Subaru Legacy Sports Tourer (United Kingdom)]]\n\n===Ecomatic Autogas Hybrid (2007\u2013)===\nThe Ecomatic Autogas Hybrid is a version of the Legacy with the 2.0R or 2.5i engine that can run on LPG for the German market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subaru-ecomatic.de/modelle/legacy.php |title=Subaru ecomatic page |publisher=Subaru-ecomatic.de |accessdate=2010-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130114811/http://subaru-ecomatic.de/modelle/legacy.php |archive-date=January 30, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Diesel (2008\u2013)===\nThe [[List of Subaru engines#Subaru EE engine (diesel)|Subaru EE]] [[flat-4]] diesel engine is offered in both the Legacy and Outback sedan and wagon; identified as the Subaru Legacy 2.0D, the vehicle was released in the EU starting March 2008.

The highest trim level offered in the United States was the Outback \"[[L.L. Bean Edition]]\" that offered optional equipment as standard, including a wood and leather steering wheel, an auxiliary port on the stereo for external music player compatibility (2007 and later), perforated leather seats, [[Global Navigation Satellite System|GPS navigation]], a double-sized, one-piece glass moonroof, and the 3.0-liter [[flat-6|H6]] engine. Starting with this generation, the interior retractable rear cargo cover had a separate stowage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the [[cargo cover]] could be removed for large items and stowed out of the way inside the vehicle.\n\nA new Outback variant for the 2005 and newer years was the Outback XT. This model came with the same turbocharged 2.5L EJ255 4-cylinder engine found in the Impreza WRX model. This engine produced {{convert|243|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was much higher than the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine, which produced {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The XT model came equipped with any 2 of the 3 standard transmissions: a 5-speed Auto-SportShift, or a 5-speed manual.\n\nIn 2007, the Outback (along with the Ford Mondeo) won [[Top Gear (current format)|''Top Gear'']]'s \"Car of the Year\" award.<ref>[[Top Gear (current format)|''Top Gear'']], Series 10, Episode 10, 12/23/2007</ref>\n\nAs of the 2008 model year, the Legacy wagon and Outback sedan were discontinued in the United States, leaving only the Legacy sedan and Outback wagon models.

The reason being that due to the lift that was given the rear multi-link suspension geometry was changed resulting in the rear wheels toeing in excessively when weight, such as people in the back seats or cargo in the trunk, is loaded and the rear is compressed downward.\n\nThis then causes the excessively toed rear wheels to fight each other until one loses grip completely, usually on slippery road surfaces, and the rear is swung out by the other. Subaru has released a TSB<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbase.com/BBBMotor/TSb/DownloadPdf?id=139225|title=05-36-07 JAN 07 Tires/Alignment - Tire Pressure/Rear Wheel Toe-In Specs|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> with rear tire pressure and alignment adjustments for all 05-09 Outbacks with this raised suspension, however for some the issue still persists. The best fixes that have been found are an aftermarket camber adjustment kit installation, since the OEM suspension doesn't have a camber adjustment independent from toe adjustment causing you to sacrifice one for the other to be adjusted perfectly, and stiffer rear springs, after which a realignment with an extra {{convert|200-300|lb|kg||abbr=on}} of weight added so as to have a buffer zone for the rear toe.

It has Bilstein shock absorbers and 18-inch alloy wheels for better handling, Vehicle Dynamics Control, and from 2007, 6-speed manual gearbox and the ''Subaru Intelligent Drive'' ('''SI-Drive''') with three modes: Intelligent, Sport, and Sport Sharp. The 2.5GT {{proper name|spec.B}} model is only available in the sedan body and not the station wagon body.\n\n[[File:2008 Subaru Legacy Wagon.jpg|left|thumb|2008 Subaru Legacy 2.5i Wagon (Canada)]]\nFor the 2008 model year, the Legacy sedan received facelift with new bumpers, front fenders, tail lights, and alloy wheels. By this time the Legacy wagon and [[Subaru Outback#Third generation (2003\u20132009)|Outback]] sedan were discontinued in the United States, leaving the Legacy sedan and Outback wagon. The Legacy wagon was not discontinued in Canada. 2008 also brought the 3.0&nbsp;L flat-6 engine to the North American Legacy sedan in the 3.0R Limited trim level. The flat-6 has been available in the Outback sedan wagon since 2000. For 2008, the 2.5i USA model has been certified [[PZEV]] emissions, and a badge has been attached to the rear of the vehicle on the bottom right hand side of the trunklid or tailgate. All other models are certified [[Low Emission Vehicle#Phase 2 - 2004 and later|LEV2]]. The PZEV Legacy is available for sale in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers who only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n==European Model==\n[[File:2008 Subaru Legacy Sports Tourer REn 2.0 Rear.jpg|right|thumb|Subaru Legacy Sports Tourer (United Kingdom)]]\n\n===Ecomatic Autogas Hybrid (2007\u2013)===\nThe Ecomatic Autogas Hybrid is a version of the Legacy with the 2.0R or 2.5i engine that can run on LPG for the German market.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.subaru-ecomatic.de/modelle/legacy.php |title=Subaru ecomatic page |publisher=Subaru-ecomatic.de |accessdate=2010-10-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130114811/http://subaru-ecomatic.de/modelle/legacy.php |archive-date=January 30, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n===Diesel (2008\u2013)===\nThe [[List of Subaru engines#Subaru EE engine (diesel)|Subaru EE]] [[flat-4]] diesel engine is offered in both the Legacy and Outback sedans and wagons, identified as the Subaru Legacy 2.0D, the vehicle was released in the EU starting March 2008.

Models equipped with a 3.0L EZ30D [[flat-6|H6]] were introduced at the 2004 [[Chicago Auto Show]]. The ground clearance is {{convert|8.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} in the US, so as to get around fuel economy regulations,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/13/business/to-avoid-fuel-limits-subaru-is-turning-a-sedan-into-a-truck.html|title=To Avoid Fuel Limits, Subaru Is Turning a Sedan Into a Truck|last=Hakim|first=Danny|date=2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-10|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> and {{convert|7.8|in|mm|abbr=on}} most elsewhere. In some countries, such as Canada, it varied by what engine was installed.\n\nThis generation of Outback carried the same model codes as the Legacy Wagon: BP9 for the 2.5 liter and BPE for the 3.0-liter model. The highest trim level offered in the USA was the Outback \"[[L.L. Bean Edition]]\" that offered optional equipment as standard, including a wood and leather steering wheel, an auxiliary port on the stereo for external music player compatibility (2007 and later models), perforated leather seats, [[Global Navigation Satellite System|GPS navigation]], a double-sized, one-piece glass moonroof, and the 3.0-liter [[flat-6|H6]] engine. Starting with this generation, the interior retractable rear cargo cover had a separate stowage compartment in the spare tire storage area so that the [[cargo cover]] could be removed for large items and stowed out of the way inside the vehicle.\n\nA new Outback variant for the 2005 and newer years was the Outback XT. This model came with the same turbocharged 2.5L 4-cylinder engine found in the Impreza WRX model. This engine produced {{convert|243|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}, which was much higher than the naturally aspirated 2.5L engine, which produced {{convert|175|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}}. The XT model came equipped with any 2 of the 3 standard transmissions: a 5-speed Auto-SportShift, or a 5-speed manual.\n\nIn 2007, the Outback (along with the Ford Mondeo) won [[Top Gear (current format)|''Top Gear'']]'s \"Car of the Year\" award.<ref>[[Top Gear (current format)|''Top Gear'']], Series 10, Episode 10, 12/23/2007</ref>\n\nAs of the 2008 model year, the Legacy wagon and Outback sedan were discontinued in the United States, leaving only the Legacy sedan and Outback wagon models. The Outback wagon also received styling revisions for the 2008 model year, most notably an enlarged, chrome-ringed grille. Additionally, in July, 2008 Subaru ceased offering a special edition L.L. Bean trim level on the Outback.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cars.com/kickingtires/2008/06/l-l-bean-subaru.html |title=Subaru and L.L.

The PZEV Outback was available for sale in all 50 states, unlike other manufacturers who usually only sell PZEV certified vehicles in states that have adopted California emission standards.\n\n===EyeSight===\nStarting May 2008, the Japanese-spec Legacy could be fitted with a new safety feature called EyeSight. It consists of two cameras, one on each side of the rear-view mirror, that use human-like [[stereoscopic]] vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system helps maintain a safe distance on the highway, warns the driver during unintended lane departure, emits a wake up call should everyone else pull away from the [[traffic lights]], and keeps an eye out for pedestrians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subaru.jp/legacy/touringwagon/index.html |title=Introduction of EyeSight technology retrieved September 4, 2008 |publisher=Subaru.jp |accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Gardiner |first=Justin |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/09/04/japans-subarus-get-stereoscopic-vision/ |title=Retrieved from Autoblog September 4, 2008 |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=2008-09-04 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}</ref> [[Autonomous cruise control system|SI-Cruise]] has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid.\n\n===Diesel===\nThe Subaru EE series [[flat-4]] diesel engine was offered in both Legacy and Outback models in Europe exclusively.

Ghost Walk) in wet or snowy conditions even while driving slowly on a straight and level road with snow tires.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.subaruoutback.org/forums/66-problems-maintenance/11267-2005-2009-outback-dangerous-ice.html|title=2005-2009 Outback, DANGEROUS ON ICE! - Subaru Outback - Subaru Outback Forums|website=www.subaruoutback.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}</ref> A number of possible causes have been explored but the general consensus based on the data available has been that the ride lift that was given to bypass the fuel regulations, and lack of load leveling, has been playing a major role in the issue. The reason being that due to the lift that was given the rear multi-link suspension geometry was changed resulting in the rear wheels toeing in excessively when weight, such as people in the back seats or cargo in the trunk, is loaded and the rear is compressed downward.\n\nThis then causes the excessively toed rear wheels to fight each other until one loses grip completely, usually on slippery road surfaces, and the rear is swung out by the other. Subaru has released a TSB<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.revbase.com/BBBMotor/TSb/DownloadPdf?id=139225|title=05-36-07 JAN 07 Tires/Alignment - Tire Pressure/Rear Wheel Toe-In Specs|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> with rear tire pressure and alignment adjustments for all 05-09 Outbacks with this raised suspension, however for some the issue still persists. The best fixes that have been found are an aftermarket camber adjustment kit installation, since the OEM suspension doesn't have a camber adjustment independent from toe adjustment causing you to sacrifice one for the other to be adjusted perfectly, and stiffer rear springs, after which a realignment with an extra {{convert|200-300|lb|kg||abbr=on}} of weight added so as to have a buffer zone for the rear toe.
