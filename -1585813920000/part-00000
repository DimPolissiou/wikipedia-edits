It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia.

One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque.

It was founded in the 15th century, and reached its peak in the 18th century, when it briefly became the hegemon of South Sulawesi replacing [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]]. Wajoq retained its independence until it was [[South Sulawesi expeditions of 1905|subdued in the early 20th century]] by the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch colonial government]]. It continued to exist in some form up to mid-20th century, when the self-governing entity was transformed into [[Wajo Regency]] in the newly independent [[Republic of Indonesia]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Early history (c. 1400\u20131582) ===\nThe emergence of Wajoq and other interior polities of South Sulawesi is associated with the major [[intensive farming|agricultural expansion]] and [[centralized government|political centralization]] in the 14th century, which was encouraged by an increase in external demand for South Sulawesi rice.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|pp=34\u201336}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=100\u2013103}} Population rose as the formerly common [[Slash-and-burn|swidden]] agriculture was increasingly replaced with intensive [[wet rice]] cultivation. Throughout the interior of the peninsula, forests were [[deforestation|cleared]] and new settlements were founded.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=98\u2013100}} The people of Wajoq themselves associate the origin of their polity with migrations and establishment of new settlements. Wajorese text ''[[Lontaraq Sukkuqna Wajoq]]'' (''Complete Chronicle of Wajoq''), for example, recounts the story of a Bugis noble who, on a hunting expedition, found \"an area with wide fields, thick forests with wild boars, deer, and buffalo, and numerous lakes replete with fish\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=27}} He then decided to settle and founded the polity of Cinnotabiq,{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=348, 359}} which transformed into Wajoq in the early 15th century.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=24}}\n\nTradition mantains that the name \"Wajoq\" came from the ''bajoq'' tree{{efn|Commonly identified as a ''[[Macaranga]]'' species ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=403}}).}}, under which the then Cinnotabiq ruler La Tenribali{{efn|Also known in several manuscripts as La Tenriba or La Tenribabbareng ({{harvnb|Abidin|1985|p=399}}).}} supposedly concluded a [[social contract]] with the three chiefs of Boliq, whose communities formed the core of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=25, 114}} La Tenribali was appointed to reign over Boliq lands and thus became the first ''batara'' (ruler, {{abbr|lit.|literally}} \"sky\") of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=477\u2013478}} The third ''batara'' of Wajoq, La Pateddungi To Samallangiq, was forced to [[abdicate]] by his people, reportedly because of his immoral actions. He was later [[assassin]]ated by a Wajorese noble.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=478}} Wajoq then underwent a constitutional change, after which a governing council was established. This council included and was presided by an elective principal ruler, who from then on would be known as the ''arung matoa'' (lit. \"senior lord\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=174}}). La Pal\u00e9wo To Palippu from B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola was chosen by the council as the first ''arung matoa'' of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|pp=479\u2013482}}\n\nDuring the reign of the fourth ''arung matoa'', [[La Tadampareq|La Tadampareq Puang ri Maggalatung]] ({{abbr|r.|reigned}} {{abbr|c.|circa}} 1491\u20131521{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=575}}), Wajoq became one of the major Bugis polities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=112\u2013113}} By the turn of the 16th century, Wajoq had been able to secure a relatively higher standing in its relationship with the neighboring [[Luwu|Luwuq]], which was a powerful polity in South Sulawesi during the 15th century, and presumably was regarded as Wajoq's overlord.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=21}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Together with Luwuq, Wajoq won a war against the nearby polity of [[Sidenreng|Sid\u00e9nr\u00e9ng]] in [[Ajatappareng]], forcing the latter to cede its territories north of the central lakes to Wajoq.{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=228}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=113\u2013114}} Wajoq under La Tadampareq also absorbed the remnants of what might have been the core territories of Cina, another influential early Bugis polity.{{sfnp|Caldwell|Wellen|2017|pp=306, 319}} Balance of power in the region further shifted in the early 16th century when [[Bone state|Bon\u00e9]], a Bugis polity south of Wajoq, emerged victorious against Luwuq, and thus assumed a paramount position in the eastern part of the peninsula.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=28}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=22}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=114}} At the same time, the [[Makassar people|Makassar]] twin kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Gowa|Gowa]] and [[Kingdom of Tallo|Talloq]] to the west also [[Early history of Gowa and Talloq#Gowa and Talloq from 1511 to 1565|started to expand their power]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=24}} Early in the century, Gowa had cooperated with Bon\u00e9 in wars against Luwuq and Wajoq,{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=23}} but by the mid of the century their struggles for [[hegemony]] made Gowa and Bon\u00e9 clashed against each other. By this time, Wajoq had also fallen under Gowa's sphere of influence, and supported Gowa in a war against Bon\u00e9 in the 1560s.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=116, 131\u2013132}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=30}}\n\n=== The ''Tellumpocco'' alliance and the rise of Gowa-Talloq (1582\u20131660) ===\n[[File:South Sulawesi circa 1600.svg|thumb|upright=1|Political division of southern Sulawesi in around 1590]]\n\nThe continued rise of Gowa and its harsh treatment of its Bugis subordinates Wajoq and [[Soppeng|Sopp\u00e9ng]] prompted the latter two to sign the Treaty of Timurung, a mutual defense pact initiated by Bon\u00e9 in 1582.{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=132\u2013133}} The relationship between these three allied Bugis polities, also known as the ''[[Tellumpocco]]'' (\"Three Powers\", lit. \"Three Peaks\"), is defined as that of brothers, with Bon\u00e9 acting as the elder, Wajoq the middle, and Sopp\u00e9ng the younger one. It sought to reclaim the autonomy of these Bugis lands, and to stop Gowa's expansionism.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=30\u201331}}{{sfnp|Druce|2009|p=249}} Gowa's subsequent campaigns against Wajoq in 1582 and 1590 as well as against Bon\u00e9 in 1585 and 1588 were all successfully repulsed by the alliance, or in the case of 1590 campaign, abandoned following the murder of Gowa's ruler [[Tunijalloq]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=31}}\n\nNevertheless, by the early 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had succeeded in becoming the most dominant powers in the South Sulawesi peninsula as they bolstered international trade and promoted the new faith of [[Islam]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29, 177}} Between 1608 and 1611, Gowa waged successful campaigns throughout South Sulawesi, forcing Sopp\u00e9ng to embrace Islam in 1609, Wajoq in 1610, and Bon\u00e9 in 1611.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=33}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=136\u2013137}} Thereafter, the ''Tellumpocco'' surrendered the control of their foreign affairs to Gowa, although they were allowed to retain the alliance and still preserve considerable autonomy within their own domains.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}} This arrangement proved to be quite successful to win the support of the Bugis. Wajoq in particular grew increasingly loyal to Gowa. The ''arung matoa'' To Mappassaungng\u00e9 (r. 1627\u20131628{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=576}}) even offered to guard the Gowa capital when its ruler was off for an expedition, despite he was not being obliged to do so.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37\u201338}}\n\nWajoq entered another conflict when the ruler of Bon\u00e9, [[La Maddaremmeng]] (r. 1626\u20131643), whether for political or religious reasons, attacked and pillaged P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, one of Wajoq's constituent communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=40}}{{efn|La Maddaremmeng had previously became a subject of controversy, as he had enforced a stricter interpretation of Islam to his people. He also went to abolish non-hereditary slavery in accordance to his belief, and tried to convince the other ''Tellumpocco'' members to follow his steps. This was not received favorably by Gowa, who viewed Bon\u00e9's attempt to spread its religious influence as a direct challenge to its hegemony over South Sulawesi ({{harvnb|Wellen|2014|p=29}}; {{harvnb|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}; {{harvnb|Pelras|1996|p=142}}).}} As La Maddaremmeng refused to compensate for the goods seized in P\u00e9n\u00e9ki, Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 went to war against each other.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} Gowa and Sopp\u00e9ng sided with Wajoq in this conflict, and the joint forces succeeded in [[Battle of Passemp\u00e9|defeating Bon\u00e9 in October 1643]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=39\u201340}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=142}} Bon\u00e9 was harshly punished by being made a vassal of Gowa,{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=29}} with a Bugis noble installed as a [[regent]] responsible to a Makassar lord. A subsequent rebellion led by La Maddaremmeng's brother was also quashed, and Bon\u00e9's status was further degraded to that of a \"slave\" (i.e. a colony), while its nobles were forcibly relocated to Gowa.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=41\u201342}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=142\u2013143}} Several contested territories held by Bon\u00e9 were given to Wajoq, and a large number of people from Bon\u00e9 were forced into [[Corv\u00e9e|unpaid labor]] in Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=29\u201330}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=42\u201343}} This humiliation entrenched a feeling of resentment among the people of Bon\u00e9 towards both Gowa and Wajoq.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=43}}\n\n=== Makassar War and Wajorese migrations (1660\u20131730) ===\nBy the second quarter of the 17th century, Gowa and Talloq had became the most politically and economically powerful polities in eastern Indonesia. The twin kingdoms' attempt to retain their hegemony brought them to a conflict with the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), which wanted to monopolize the [[spice trade]] in the [[Moluccas]].{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=45\u201347}} In 1660, the Dutch attacked Gowa and managed to seize the fort of Paqnakkukang.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=49}} Gowa then forced its vassals to provide labor to build military constructions in anticipation of further conflict, which ultimately resulted in a rebellion led by the Bon\u00e9 noble [[Arung Palakka]].{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=50\u201352}} However, his attempt to revive the ''Tellumpocco'' alliance failed, as Wajoq refused to break its treaty with Gowa to join forces with the rebels.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=30}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=54}}<!-- According to the historian [[Leonard Andaya]], Wajoq's decision can be explained by the fact that its recent experiences with Gowa were much more positive than those with Bon\u00e9.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}} In the most recent memory of the Wajorese, it was Bon\u00e9, not Gowa, which invaded their country. Wajoq and Bon\u00e9 also had frequent disputes over territorial boundaries and the allegiance of their vassals.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=54\u201355}}{{efn|system of vassals...}} On the other hand, Wajoq's relationship with Gowa had been more friendly in the preceding years; Wajoq was one of Gowa's most trusted vassals, with the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Senngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) had even been married to a daughter of Gowa ruler [[Hasanuddin of Gowa|Hasanuddin]] (r. 1653\u20131669).{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 54\u201355}}--> Lacking enough support, the rebellion was successfully quelled by Gowa and Wajoq forces, driving Arung Palakka to escape to [[Buton]], and later, to [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], seeking aid from the VOC.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=56\u201359, 66}}\n\nDuring the [[Makassar War]] (1666\u20131669), Wajoq fiercely supported Gowa against the alliance of the VOC and local forces from Bon\u00e9 and elsewhere led by Arung Palakka. Even after the fall of Gowa's court Sombaopu and the formal surrender of Gowa and Talloq, the ''arung matoa'' [[La Tenrilai To Sengngeng]] (r. 1658\u20131670) still refused to abide by the [[Treaty of Bungaya]] and continued to resist the Dutch and Bon\u00e9 forces.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=31\u201332}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=37, 124\u2013126, 138}} By mid-1670, Arung Palakka had launched a large-scale invasion of Wajoq.<!-- Along the way, several Wajoq's vassals deserted and joined Bon\u00e9 forces, bringing the total number of invading forces to around 40,000 people when it arrived to besiege Tosora, the walled capital city of Wajoq.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=138\u2013139}}--> Despite hard resistance from Wajorese defenders, the walled capital city of Tosora fell to the Bon\u00e9-led forces in December 1670. La Tenrilai was [[killed in action]], and his successor [[La Paliliq To Malu]] (r. 1670\u20131679) was forced to sign a treaty restricting Wajorese political, trade and military powers, in addition to the Treaty of Bungaya.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=33\u201335}}{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|pp=140\u2013141}} In spite of Wajoq's surrender, it still faced harsh retribution from Arung Palakka and the people of Bon\u00e9.

By this time, Arung Palakka had been sending soldiers to help the VOC in [[Trunajaya rebellion|a campaign in Java]], and the VOC did not want to risk severing their relationship with an important ally.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=37\u201338}}{{sfnp|Andaya|pp=142\u2013143, 190\u2013192, 205}}\n\nIt was these difficulties faced by the Wajorese in their homeland which prompted them to emigrate elsewhere.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}} While migration had always been an important part of Wajorese culture, it was particularly prominent in the aftermath of the Makassar War, when a large number of Wajorese migrants established themselves abroad in Makassar, eastern [[Borneo]], the [[Lesser Sunda Islands]], and the [[Straits of Malacca]] area, among other places.{{sfnp|Andaya|1981|p=143}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=38, 82}}{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} These diaspora communities were connected to their homeland as well as to each other by familial, commercial, political and legal ties.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82}} By the early 18th century, a sequence of Wajorese rulers had began to take advantage of these connections to revitalize their country.

These communities were related to each other as well as to the central government at Tosora in various ways, ranging from vassalage to alliance \"as between brothers\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=176\u2013177}} The polity of Wajoq was divided into three ''limpo'' or main districts, namely B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, Tua, and Talotenreng, which represented its three original founding communities.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|pp=49\u201350}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|pp=177\u2013178}} Each ''limpo'' held power over several smaller communities that either chose to affiliate themselves with the said ''limpo'' or were conquered.{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=50}} Each of these communities had considerable freedom, with its own leader and customs. It can also switch allegiance between different states, and by doing so, both its people and its territory will be subject to the new state.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}\n\nThe paramount ruler of Wajoq was titled ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}} In running the day-to-day administration of Wajoq, the ''arung matoa'' was assisted by three pairs of civilian and military leaders, each pair representing one of the three ''limpo''.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} The civilian leader of a ''limpo'' was called a ''ranreng'' or regent, while the military leader was called a ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' or \"standard bearer\".{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}} The titles of the ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were taken from the banner they carried: ''Pilla'' or \"Scarlet\" for B\u00e9tt\u00e9mpola, ''Patola'' or \"Multi-colored\" for Talotenreng, and ''Cakkuridi'' or \"Yellow\" for Tua.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=485}} Each of the ''ranreng'' and  ''bat\u00e9 lompo'' were at least as powerful as the ''arung matoa''; together, these seven officials formed the state's highest governing body, known as ''Petta Wajoq''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=23}}{{sfnp|Pelras|1996|p=178}}\n\nThe ''arung matoa'' was chosen among the \"white-blood\" or nobility class. The position of arung matoa cannot be held at once with another office. It also cannot be inherited and can only be held for life as long as the ruler was deemed fit for the position.{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=465, 535}} A ruler in precolonial South Sulawesi was expected to be subordinate to the state and the ''[[adat]]'' or customary law which delineates the autonomy of local communities; failure to do so may result in removal from office. The ''arung matoa'' La Samal\u00e9wa To Appakiung (r. 1612\u20131616), for example, was deposed by his people, reportedly because of his arbitrary actions.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=22}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|p=385}}\n\nThe central governing council of Wajoq consisted of 40 officials, collectively called the ''Arung Patampulu'' (lit. \"Forty Lords\"{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=165}}), of which the ''arung matoa'' was a member as well as the head.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}} The whole members only convened on certain occasions, including the election of a new ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=23, 175}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2018|p=51}} The power of ''Arung Patampulu'', in turn, was balanced by three non-noble officials known as ''punggawa'', who were elected among the elders of each district.{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=482}}{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}} These ''punggawa'' had considerable power. According to Brooke:{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=245}}\n\n{{quote\n|text=The powers of these pangawas [sic], or tribunes of the people, is considerable. With them only it rests to summon a meeting of the council of forty. They possess the right of veto to the appointment of an aru matoah [sic].

The census of the population and the appointment of freemen, as heads of towns or villages, are in their hands, with many other privileges.\n|author=James Brooke\n}}\n\nIn addition to having ''punggawa'' as the formal permanent representation in the government, \"respectable\" commoners and village heads were also entitled to participate in the occasional extraordinary deliberative assembly which might be held in case the ''Arung Patampulu'' could not agree on the best way to resolve certain issues. These commoners may discuss and give input to the government on the best way to resolve these issues, although the ultimate decision in this kind of situations rested in the hands of ''arung matoa''.{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=246}}\n<!--\n- Diaspora governmental structure (focus on Borneo and Makassar)...\n-->\n\n==Culture and society==\n{{see also|Bugis people}}\n{{sect-stub|date=April 2020}}\nWajorese texts often reiterate that \"the people of Wajoq are free\", and that their only master is the customary law, which is based on consensus. The concept of the \"freedoms of Wajoq\" included, among others: [[freedom of speech|freedom of expressing opinions]], freedom to act based on one's intention, [[freedom of movement]], [[freedom of contract]], and the freedom from unjust punishment.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=148}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1983|p=481}}{{sfnp|Abidin|1985|pp=433, 447\u2013448}} These \"freedoms\", however, had limitations and do not necessarily apply to the whole population.\n\nBugis women in the precolonial states of South Sulawesi were routinely involved in many aspects of the society. Women were also actively involved in the government. One 19th-century observer states that the women of South Sulawesi were commonly \"consulted by the men on all public affairs\" and were often \"raised to the throne, [even] when the monarchy is elective\".{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}} The British adventurer [[James Brooke]] (future [[Rajah of Sarawak]]), notes that at the time of his visit to Wajoq in 1840, four out of six members of Petta Ennengng\u00e9 were women, who frequently \"appear in public like the men; ride, rule, and visit even foreigners, without the knowledge or consent of their husbands.\"{{sfnp|Henley|Caldwell|2019|p=250}}\n\n==Economy==\nWajoq was the source of most South Sulawesi overseas merchants between late 17th and late 19th centuries.{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Wajorese commerce extended as far as [[Sumatra]], [[Cambodia]], and [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}}{{sfnp|Reid|1998|p=147}} Throughout the Maritime Southeast Asia, Wajorese and other Bugis merchants acted as intermediaries between large and small trading nations.{{sfnp|Lineton|1975b|p=178}} Wajorese trade flourished in part because of deliberate support from the government at Wajoq as well as from Wajorese communities abroad.{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=67\u201368}} Leaders of Wajorese overseas communities regularly convened to advance their interest. One such conference in the early 18th century saw the codification of laws regulating Wajorese commerce and navigation, popularly called the Ammana Gappa's law code, after the then leader of the Wajorese community in Makassar. These laws set up frameworks for managing credit and debts as well as regulating other kinds of business relationships, providing ways to resolve conflict and giving Wajorese merchants advantages over merchants from other groups in Maritime Southeast Asia.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|pp=84, 91, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|pp=64\u201365, 71}} Such a law code, according to historian Kathryn Wellen, is \"highly unusual, if not unique, for early modern insular Southeast Asia\".{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=84}}\n\nThe government financially supported Wajorese merchants by providing monetary loans, taken from the fund established by La Sal\u00e9wangeng. Borrowers were obliged to return the principals alongside parts of their profits. The profits would then be used to further Wajoq's interest, such as building armaments or renovating the state's mosque. This system allowed a large segment of Wajorese population to participate in commerce while also utilizing their economic power for the benefit of the society as a whole.{{sfnp|Wellen|2009|p=82\u201383, 97}}{{sfnp|Wellen|2014|p=76}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Early history of Gowa and

Beasley School of Law''' (also known as '''Temple Law School or Temple Law''') is one of the professional online graduate schools of [[Temple University]], located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1895, the law school has an enrollment of about 530 students. In 2018, Temple Beasley School of Law was ranked the 47th best law school overall and 2nd best for Trial Advocacy training by ''[[U.S. News & World Report|US News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/temple-university-beasley-03139|title=How Does Temple University James E. Beasley School of Law Rank Among America's Best Law Schools?|website=grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com|access-date=2016-07-30}}</ref> Temple Law consistently boasts a top-three national ranking in [[Trial Advocacy]], and is a perennial powerhouse in national [[Mock trial|Mock Trial]] competition.

The faculty is well balanced and diverse. [[Gregory Mandel|Gregory N. Mandel]], a noted intellectual property law scholar, was named Dean in May 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.temple.edu/news/gregory-n-mandel-appointed-dean|title=Professor Gregory N.

Epps]], a professor at Temple Law since 1985, served as Dean from 2008-2016, when she was appointed Provost of Temple University.  Robert J. Reinstein served as Dean of the Law School from 1989 to 2008.\n\n==Specialized coursework==\n*Integrated Trial Advocacy Program (ITAP)\n*Integrated Transactional Program (ITP)\n*The Law & Public Policy Program\n\n==Study abroad programs==\nTemple Law School offers two [[study abroad]] programs that are open to students from any ABA approved law school: the summer session in [[Rome]] and the spring semester in [[Tokyo]] (at [[Temple University Japan]]). The Tokyo program is perhaps the most notable, as it is the only ABA-accredited semester program for law students in [[Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, Temple JD students are eligible to study at the following partner institutions:[[Tsinghua University]], [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|University College Cork]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Utrecht University]], Jindal Global Law School, [[University of Lucerne]], [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law|InterAmerican University]], [[Bocconi University]], and [[University of M\u00fcnster|University of Muenster]].\n\nStudy abroad credits from any program can be used toward the J.D. program or the joint JD/LL.M. in Transnational Law.\n\n==Graduate Law Programs (LL.M., S.J.D., Certificate, Teaching Fellowship)==\nThe Law School offers several advanced degree programs, including Master of Laws Degree (LL.M.) in Trial Advocacy, Transnational Law, Asian Law or Taxation. Certificate programs in Estate Planning and Employee Benefits are offered through the Taxation program.  International lawyers also have the opportunity to design their own curriculum through Temple's General LL.M. program. In addition to the LL.M., Temple offers an advanced degree for aspiring scholars, the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.), and a Graduate Teaching Fellowship program.\n\n*LL.M. in Trial Advocacy\n*LL.M. in Transnational Law\n*LL.M. in Taxation\n\nThe Graduate Tax Program is designed to provide understanding of complex taxation issues.  The program provides candidates with a strong foundation in tax law, as well as the opportunity to develop expertise beyond the level of study offered in J.D. programs. A degree candidate must satisfactorily complete 24 credit hours of course work, including all core curriculum requirements and a writing seminar. Candidates may study on a full-time or part-time basis and all coursework must be completed within four years of matriculation. Applicants must have satisfactorily completed a basic income tax course in law school or demonstrated comparable work experience. An applicant who cannot meet this requirement must take the basic course in taxation offered in Temple's J.D. program in the student's first term after admission to the LL.M. program.\n\n===LL.M. in Asian Law===\nTemple's LL.M. in Asian law is designed for J.D. holders and students who wish to focus on the law of Asian countries, particularly China, Japan and India, the more powerful economies of the region. Students complete the first of two semesters at the Philadelphia campus, taking foundational courses such as Chinese Law, Japanese Law, and Law in Asia. Students are then required to spend the second semester at one of either Temple University Japan in Tokyo, Jindal Global Law School in the National Capital Region (Delhi) of India, or Tsinghua University Law School in Beijing, China. Students must maintain a G.P.A. of at least 2.50 (out of 4.0) over the course of the 24 credits they must earn to graduate.\n\n===General LL.M. for International Lawyers===\nTemple offers a general studies LL.M. program for foreign-trained lawyers. With the exception of two required research and writing courses, students can design their own curriculum from more than 180 courses offered annually in American and International law.  General LL.M. degree candidates must successfully complete 24 credit hours of course work with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (out of a possible 4.0).  The program can be completed in two semesters beginning in August and continuing through May.  In addition to the main campus in Philadelphia, the General LL.M. is offered in [[Tokyo]] and [[Beijing]]. Students can also earn up to 6 credits at Temple's six-week summer law program in Rome, Italy. Students in this program must complete classes at the main campus.\n\n===Doctor of Juridical Science===\nThe Doctor of Juridical Science is a research-oriented degree program designed for those seeking to pursue careers as law teachers and scholars of law. Candidates enrolled in the S.J.D. program are required to spend their initial academic year in residence at the main campus in Philadelphia.\n\n===Estate Planning and Employee Benefits Certificates===\nAn Estate Planning Certificate and Employee Benefits Certificate is offered through the Graduate Tax Program for practitioners who do not wish to pursue an LL.M. degree. The ''Estate Planning Certificate'' (EPCERT) exposes students to federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxation issues, as well as federal income taxation of trusts and estates.\n\n==Law School Organizations==\n\n===Moot Court===\n[[File:Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law.jpg|thumb|Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law]]\n[[File:Shusterman Hall.jpg|thumb|Side view of Shusterman Hall]]\nTemple Law's [[Moot court|Moot Court]] was started in the 1950s. Moot Court members are selected as second-year law students through the Samuel L. Polsky Selection Competition, which is held during the fall semester. Polsky participants research and write an appellate brief, then argue both sides of the case before experienced attorneys who serve as appellate court justices. Students receiving the highest scores for brief writing and oral argument are invited to join the Society.\n\n===Law journals===\nTemple Law is home to two student-edited journals and law reviews. The [[Temple Law Review]] is published quarterly, and the [[Temple International and Comparative Law Journal]] is published on a bi-annual basis.\n\n==Employment statistics==\nAccording to 2021 US News and World Report, 59.8% of the graduating class obtained jobs at graduation, 83.3 acquired jobs in 10 months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://premium.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/temple-university-03139|title=US News and World Report 2021|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Temple's [[Law School Transparency]] under-employment score is 16.3%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job ten months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/temple/2013/ |title=Temple University Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Rankings and recognition==\n* In 2020, Temple Beasley School of Law was ranked the 56th best law school overall and 2nd best for Trial Advocacy training by ''[[U.S. News & World Report|US News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://premium.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/temple-university-03139|title=2021 Top Law Schools|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n* [[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]] ranked Temple Law 43rd in its annual '''''Top Law Schools''''' report for legal employment outcomes in 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abovethelaw.com/law-school-rankings/top-law-schools/?rf=1|title=The 2017 ATL Top 50 Law School Rankings|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>\n* [[The National Law Journal|National Law Journal]] ranked Temple Law as a top law best school in its annual report for 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/03/08/the-top-50-go-to-law-schools/|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> The law school ranked 19th for alumni who were promoted to partnership in 2015.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202751499299?slreturn=20160628094526|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>''\n* ''Super Lawyer'' ranks Temple Law as 6th in Highest Caliber Graduate and Most Prepared to Practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can you get a job after graduation|url= http://lawschools.superlawyers.com/services-view/job_accessibility|publisher= Super Lawyer|date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n* As of 2020, Temple's Pennsylvania Bar Examination passage rate is 81.3% for first time takers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://premium.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/temple-university-03139|title=US News and World Report Bar Passage Rate|last=|first=|date=2013-10-18|website=|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n[[File:Back entrance of Barrack Hall.jpg|thumb|Back entrance of Barrack Hall]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Lynne Abraham]] (1965), former district attorney of [[Philadelphia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Mari Carmen Aponte]] (1975), appointed by President Barack Obama to the position of U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Amy Banse]] (1987), president of [[Comcast Interactive Media]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Susan Paradise Baxter]] (1983), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Louis Charles Bechtle]] (1954), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Edward G.

Reinstein served as Dean of the Law School from 1989 to 2008.\n\n==Specialized coursework==\n*Integrated Trial Advocacy Program (ITAP)\n*Integrated Transactional Program (ITP)\n*The Law & Public Policy Program\n\n==Study abroad programs==\nTemple Law School offers two [[study abroad]] programs that are open to students from any ABA approved law school: the summer session in [[Rome]] and the spring semester in [[Tokyo]] (at [[Temple University Japan]]). The Tokyo program is perhaps the most notable, as it is the only ABA-accredited semester program for law students in [[Japan]].\n\nAdditionally, Temple JD students are eligible to study at the following partner institutions:[[Tsinghua University]], [[University College Cork - National University of Ireland, Cork|University College Cork]], [[Tel Aviv University]], [[Utrecht University]], Jindal Global Law School, [[University of Lucerne]], [[Interamerican University of Puerto Rico School of Law|InterAmerican University]], [[Bocconi University]], and [[University of M\u00fcnster|University of Muenster]].\n\nStudy abroad credits from any program can be used toward the J.D. program or the joint JD/LL.M. in Transnational Law.\n\n==Graduate Law Programs (LL.M., S.J.D., Certificate, Teaching Fellowship)==\nThe Law School offers several advanced degree programs, including Master of Laws Degree (LL.M.) in Trial Advocacy, Transnational Law, Asian Law or Taxation. Certificate programs in Estate Planning and Employee Benefits are offered through the Taxation program.  International lawyers also have the opportunity to design their own curriculum through Temple's General LL.M. program. In addition to the LL.M., Temple offers an advanced degree for aspiring scholars, the Doctor of Juridical Science (S.J.D.), and a Graduate Teaching Fellowship program.\n\n*LL.M. in Trial Advocacy\n*LL.M. in Transnational Law\n*LL.M. in Taxation\n\nThe Graduate Tax Program is designed to provide understanding of complex taxation issues.  The program provides candidates with a strong foundation in tax law, as well as the opportunity to develop expertise beyond the level of study offered in J.D. programs. A degree candidate must satisfactorily complete 24 credit hours of course work, including all core curriculum requirements and a writing seminar. Candidates may study on a full-time or part-time basis and all coursework must be completed within four years of matriculation. Applicants must have satisfactorily completed a basic income tax course in law school or demonstrated comparable work experience. An applicant who cannot meet this requirement must take the basic course in taxation offered in Temple's J.D. program in the student's first term after admission to the LL.M. program.\n\n===LL.M. in Asian Law===\nTemple's LL.M. in Asian law is designed for J.D. holders and students who wish to focus on the law of Asian countries, particularly China, Japan and India, the more powerful economies of the region. Students complete the first of two semesters at the Philadelphia campus, taking foundational courses such as Chinese Law, Japanese Law, and Law in Asia. Students are then required to spend the second semester at one of either Temple University Japan in Tokyo, Jindal Global Law School in the National Capital Region (Delhi) of India, or Tsinghua University Law School in Beijing, China. Students must maintain a G.P.A. of at least 2.50 (out of 4.0) over the course of the 24 credits they must earn to graduate.\n\n===General LL.M. for International Lawyers===\nTemple offers a general studies LL.M. program for foreign-trained lawyers. With the exception of two required research and writing courses, students can design their own curriculum from more than 180 courses offered annually in American and International law.  General LL.M. degree candidates must successfully complete 24 credit hours of course work with a cumulative grade point average of 2.0 (out of a possible 4.0).  The program can be completed in two semesters beginning in August and continuing through May.  In addition to the main campus in Philadelphia, the General LL.M. is offered in [[Tokyo]] and [[Beijing]]. Students can also earn up to 6 credits at Temple's six-week summer law program in Rome, Italy. Students in this program must complete classes at the main campus.\n\n===Doctor of Juridical Science===\nThe Doctor of Juridical Science is a research-oriented degree program designed for those seeking to pursue careers as law teachers and scholars of law. Candidates enrolled in the S.J.D. program are required to spend their initial academic year in residence at the main campus in Philadelphia.\n\n===Estate Planning and Employee Benefits Certificates===\nAn Estate Planning Certificate and Employee Benefits Certificate is offered through the Graduate Tax Program for practitioners who do not wish to pursue an LL.M. degree. The ''Estate Planning Certificate'' (EPCERT) exposes students to federal estate, gift, and generation-skipping taxation issues, as well as federal income taxation of trusts and estates.\n\n==Law School Organizations==\n\n===Moot Court===\n[[File:Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law.jpg|thumb|Shusterman Hall - The James E. Beasley School of Law]]\n[[File:Shusterman Hall.jpg|thumb|Side view of Shusterman Hall]]\nTemple Law's [[Moot court|Moot Court]] was started in the 1950s. Moot Court members are selected as second-year law students through the Samuel L. Polsky Selection Competition, which is held during the fall semester. Polsky participants research and write an appellate brief, then argue both sides of the case before experienced attorneys who serve as appellate court justices. Students receiving the highest scores for brief writing and oral argument are invited to join the Society.\n\n===Law journals===\nTemple Law is home to two student-edited journals and law reviews. The [[Temple Law Review]] is published quarterly, and the [[Temple International and Comparative Law Journal]] is published on a bi-annual basis.\n\n==Employment statistics==\nAccording to Temple's official 2017 ABA-required disclosures, 86% of the Class of 2017 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment ten months after graduation, excluding solo practitioners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.temple.edu/documents/CareerPlanning/ABA-Summary-Report_2013.pdf |title=Annual Placement Reports}}</ref> Temple's [[Law School Transparency]] under-employment score is 16.3%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job ten months after graduation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lstscorereports.com/schools/temple/2013/ |title=Temple University Profile}}</ref>\n\n==Rankings and recognition==\n* In 2018, Temple Beasley School of Law was ranked the 47th best law school overall and 2nd best for Trial Advocacy training by ''[[U.S. News & World Report|US News & World Report]]''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools|title=2018 Top Law Schools}}</ref>\n* [[Above the Law (blog)|Above the Law]] ranked Temple Law in its annual '''''Top 50 Law Schools''''' report for legal employment outcomes in 2015, 2016 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://abovethelaw.com/law-school-rankings/top-law-schools/?rf=1|title=The 2017 ATL Top 50 Law School Rankings|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>\n* [[The National Law Journal|National Law Journal]] ranked Temple Law as the 34th best school in its annual Top 50 Go-To La''w'' Schools report for 2018.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.com/sites/almstaff/2018/03/08/the-top-50-go-to-law-schools/|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref> The law school ranked 19th for alumni who were promoted to partnership in 2015.''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationallawjournal.com/home/id=1202751499299?slreturn=20160628094526|title=The Top 50 Go-To Law Schools|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-28}}</ref>''\n* ''Super Lawyer'' ranks Temple Law as 6th in Highest Caliber Graduate and Most Prepared to Practice.<ref>{{cite web|title=Can you get a job after graduation|url= http://lawschools.superlawyers.com/services-view/job_accessibility|publisher= Super Lawyer|date=6 April 2015}}</ref>\n* As of July 2017, Temple's Pennsylvania Bar Examination passage rate is 84.57% for first time takers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pabarexam.org/pdf/statistics/july/j2017.pdf|title=July 2017 Pennsylvania Bar Examination Statistics|date=2013-10-18|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-31}}</ref>\n[[File:Back entrance of Barrack Hall.jpg|thumb|Back entrance of Barrack Hall]]\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Lynne Abraham]] (1965), former district attorney of [[Philadelphia]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Mari Carmen Aponte]] (1975), appointed by President Barack Obama to the position of U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Amy Banse]] (1987), president of [[Comcast Interactive Media]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n* [[Susan Paradise Baxter]] (1983), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Louis Charles Bechtle]] (1954), Judge of the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]\n* [[Edward G.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]], which similarly offer Talmud focused learning to women.\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies.

Their ideology revolves around three pillars: the Land of Israel, the People of Israel, and the Torah of Israel.<ref>[[Adriana Kemp]], ''Israelis in Conflict: Hegemonies, Identities, and Challenges'', Sussex Academic Press, 2004, pp.314\u2013315.</ref>\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Abraham Isaac Kook 1924.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Isaac Kook]], 1924]]\n\nIn 1862, German Orthodox [[Rabbi]] [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]] published his tractate ''Derishat Zion'', positing that the salvation of the Jews, promised by the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]], can come about only by self-help.<ref>[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=56&letter=K Zvi Hirsch Kalischer] (Jewish Encyclopedia)</ref> Rabbi [[Moshe Shmuel Glasner]] was another prominent rabbi who supported Zionism. The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]]. Today, [[Otzma Yehudit]] is the leading wing of this school of thought.\n\n== Educational institutions ==\n:''See: [[Yeshiva #Israel]]; [[:Category:Religious Zionist yeshivot]]; [[List of Midrashot]].''\n[[File:Mercaz HaRav01.JPG|thumb|[[Mercaz Harav]], Jerusalem]]\nThe flagship religious institution of the Religious Zionist movement is the [[yeshiva]] founded by Rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook in 1924, called in his honor \"[[Mercaz haRav]]\" (lit., the Rabbi's center). \nOther Religious Zionist yeshivot include [[Ateret Cohanim]], [[Beit El yeshiva]] and Yeshivat [[Or Etzion]], founded by Rav [[Haim Druckman]], a foremost disciple of Rabbi [[Tzvi Yehuda Kook]].\n\nThere are also approximately 90 ''[[Hesder]]'' yeshivot, allowing students to continue [[Torah study]] during their National Service (see [[#Military_service|below]]).\nThe first was [[Yeshivat Kerem B'Yavneh]], established in 1954; the largest is the [[Hesder Yeshiva of Sderot]] with over 800 students.\nOthers well known include [[Machon Meir|Yeshivat Machon Meir]], [[Yeshivat Har Etzion]], [[Yeshivat HaKotel]], [[Yeshivat Birkat Moshe]] in [[Maale Adumim]], [[Yeshiva Har Bracha|Yeshivat Har Bracha]] and Yeshivat Har Hamor.  \n\nThese institutions usually offer a [[kollel]] for ''[[Semikha]]'', or Rabbinic ordination. Students generally prepare for the ''Semikha'' test of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]; often for that of the [[posek]] R. [[Zalman Nechemia Goldberg]].\nTraining as a [[Dayan (rabbinic judge)]] in this community is usually through [[:he:\u05de\u05db\u05d5\u05df \u05d0\u05e8\u05d9\u05d0\u05dc|''Machon Ariel'']] (''[[Machon Harry Fischel]]''), also founded by Rav Kook, or [[:he:\u05d0\u05e8\u05e5_\u05d7\u05de\u05d3\u05d4_(\u05db\u05d5\u05dc\u05dc) |''Kollel Eretz Hemda'']].\n\nWomen study in institutions known as ''Midrashot'' (sing. [[Midrasha]]) - examples are [[Ein_HaNetziv#Education|Ein HaNatziv Women's Seminary]] and [[Migdal Oz (seminary)|Migdal Oz]]. Some also offer degree studies (and may then be known as a ''machon'').\n[[Nishmat (midrasha)|Nishmat]] trains women as [[Yoetzet Halacha|Yoatzot Halacha]]; see also [[Midreshet Lindenbaum]] and [[Matan Women's Institute for Torah Studies|Matan]].\n\nHigh school students study at [[Education_in_Israel#Educational_tracks|''Mamlachti dati'']] schools, often associated with ''[[Bnei Akiva]]''. The first of these was at [[Kfar Haroeh]] established by [[Moshe-Zvi Neria]].\nFor degree studies, many attend [[Bar Ilan University]], which allows students to combine Yeshiva studies with university study; \n[[Jerusalem College of Technology]] similarly (which also offers a Haredi track).\nThere are also [[List_of_Israeli_universities_and_colleges#Colleges|several colleges of education]] associated with Hesder and the ''Midrashot'', such as [[Herzog College]] and the [[Lifshitz College of Education]]. These often allow specializations in [[Tanach]] and ''Machshava'' ([[Jewish thought]]).\n\n== Dress ==\nReligious Zionists are often called ''Kippot sruggot'', referring to the knitted or crocheted [[kippot|skullcaps]] (Hebrew ''kippa'', pl. ''kippot'') worn by many of the men. However, there are also men who wear other types of headcoverings, such as ''kippot'' in black velvet.\n\n== Politics ==\nMost Religious Zionists embrace [[right-wing]] politics, especially the religious right-wing [[Jewish Home]] party, but also support the mainstream right-wing [[Likud]]. There are also some left-wing Religious Zionists, such as Rabbi [[Michael Melchior]], whose views were represented by the [[Meimad]] party (which ran together with the [[Labor (Israel)|Israeli Labor party]]). Many Israeli [[Israeli settlements|settlers]] in the [[West Bank]] are Religious Zionists, along with most of the settlers forcibly expelled from the [[Gaza Strip]] in August and September 2005.\n\n== Military service ==\n{{unreferencedsect|date=November 2015}}\n[[File:IDF soldier put on tefillin.jpg|thumb|Second-Lieutenant [[From the Wilderness and Lebanon|Asael Lubotzky]], an [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] field commander during [[Second Lebanon War]], prays with [[Tefilin]]]]\nAll adult Jewish males in Israel are obligated to serve in the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]]. Certain segments of Orthodoxy defer their service in order to engage in full-time Torah study. Religious Zionist belief advocates that both are critical to Jewish survival and prosperity.\n\nFor this reason, many Religious Zionist men take part in the [[Hesder]] program, which allows military service to be combined with [[yeshiva]] studies. Some others attend a pre-army [[Mechina]] educational program, delaying their service by one year. 88% of Hesder students belong to combat units, compared to a national average of below 30%. \n\nWhile some Religious Zionist women serve in the army, most choose national service, known as [[Sherut Leumi]], instead (working at hospitals, schools, and day-care centers).\nIn November 2010, the IDF held a special conference which was attended by the heads of Religious Zionism in order to encourage female Religious Zionists to join the IDF.

In neither of these contexts does the word mean anything particularly significant about the Brahmin caste.\n\nIn modern India, those who work or aspire for a social order based on equality may use the words 'Brahmanism' and 'Brahminism' interchangeably. [[B. R. Ambedkar]], who later chaired the drafting Committee of Indian Constitution, in a speech in February, 1938 explained the word to mean \"negation of the spirit of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity\".<ref>http://velivada.com/2017/06/03/dr-ambedkars-speech-depressed-class-workmens-conference-nashik/</ref> He also clarified that the word does not mean the power, privileges and interests of Brahmins as a community.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Indian religions]]\n* [[History of India]]\n* [[History of Hinduism]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Hinduism and society]]\n", "name_user": "QueerEcofeminist", "label": "safe", "comment": "cleanup (viaWP:JWB)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brahminism"}

For wedge bonding, only gold wire requires heat. Wedge bonding can use large diameter wires or wire ribbons for power electronics application. Ball bonding is limited to small diameter wires, suitable for interconnect application.\n\nIn either type of wire bonding, the wire is attached at both ends using a combination of downward pressure, ultrasonic energy, and in some cases heat, to make a [[Welding|weld]]. Heat is used to make the metal softer. The correct combination of temperature and ultrasonic energy is used in order to maximize the reliability and strength of a wire bond. If heat and ultrasonic energy is used, the process is called thermosonic bonding.\n\nIn wedge bonding, the wire must be drawn in a straight line according to the first bond. This slows down the process due to time needed for tool alignment. Ball bonding, however, creates its first bond in a ball shape with the wire sticking out at the top, having no directional preference. Thus, the wire can be drawn in any direction, making it a faster process.\n\nCompliant bonding<ref name=\"four\">A.Coucoulas, \"Compliant Bonding\" Proceedings 1970 IEEE 20th Electronic Components Conference, pp. 380-89, 1970. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CompliantBondingPublic_1-10.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225284187_Compliant_Bonding_Alexander_Coucoulas_1970_Proceeding_Electronic_Components_Conference_Awarded_Best_Paper</ref> transmits heat and pressure through a compliant or indentable aluminum tape and therefore is applicable in bonding gold wires and the beam leads that have been electroformed to the silicon integrated circuit (known as the beam leaded integrated circuit).\n\n==Manufacturing and reliability challenges==\nThere are multiple challenges when it comes to wire bond manufacturing and reliability. These challenges tend of be a function of several parameters such as the material systems, bonding parameters, and use environment. Different wire bond-[[Contact pad|bond pad]] metal systems such as [[Aluminum]]-Aluminum (Al-Al), [[Gold]]-Aluminum (Au-Al), and [[Copper]]-Aluminum (Cu-Al) require different manufacturing parameters and behave differently under the same use environments.\n\n===Wire bond manufacturing===\nMuch work has been done to characterize various metal systems, review critical manufacturing parameters, and identify typical reliability issues that occur in wire bonding.<ref>G. G. Harman, Wire Bonding in Microelectronics: Materials, Processes, Reliability and Yield. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010.</ref><ref>S.K. Prasad, Advanced Wirebond Interconnection Technology. New York: Springer, 2004.</ref> When it comes to material selection, the application and use environment will dictate the metal system. Often the electrical properties, mechanical properties, and cost are taken into account when making a decision. For example, a high current device for a space application might require a large diameter aluminum wire bond in a hermetically sealed ceramic package. If cost is a large constraint, then avoiding gold wire bonds may be a necessity. Some recent work has been done to look at copper wire bonds in automotive applications.<ref>[http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Suitability-of-Cu-wire-bonded-ICs-for-auto-applications.pdf?t=1506700543823 Ensuring suitability of Cu wire bonded ICs for automotive applications]</ref> This is only a small sampling, as there is a vast body of work reviewing and testing what material systems work best in different applications.\n\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, the bonding parameters play a critical role in bond formation and bond quality. Parameters such bond force, ultrasonic energy, temperature, and loop geometry, to name a few, can have a significant effect on bond quality. There are various wire bonding techniques ([[thermosonic bonding]], ultrasonic bonding, [[thermocompression bonding]]) and types of wire bonds ([[ball bonding]], [[wedge bonding]]) that affect susceptibility to manufacturing defects and reliability issues. Certain materials and wire diameters are more practical for fine pitch or complex layouts. The bond pad also plays an important role as the metallization and barrier layer(s) stackup will impact the bond formation.\n\nTypical failure modes that result from poor bond quality and manufacturing defects include: fracture at the ball bond neck, heel cracking (wedge bonds), pad liftoff, pad peel, overcompression, and improper intermetallic formation. A combination of wire bond pull/shear testing, [[nondestructive testing]], and [[Destructive testing|destructive physical analysis (DPA)]] can be used to screen manufacturing and quality issues.\n\n===Wire bond reliability===\nWhile wirebond manufacturing tends to focus on bond quality, it often does not account for wearout mechanisms related to wire bond reliability. In this case, an understanding of the application and use environment can help prevent reliability issues. Common examples of environments that lead to wire bond failures include elevated temperature, humidity, and temperature cycling.<ref>Hillman, C., \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig_Hillman/publication/312084398_Predicting_and_Avoiding_Die_Attach_Wire_Bond_and_Solder_Joint_Failures/links/586e5e9008ae329d6213a2e2/Predicting-and-Avoiding-Die-Attach-Wire-Bond-and-Solder-Joint-Failures.pdf Predicting and avoiding die attach, wire bond, and solder joint failures].\" International Symposium on 3D Power Electronics Integration and Manufacturing (3D-PEIM), 2016.</ref>\n\nUnder elevated temperatures, excessive [[Intermetallic|intermetallics (IMC)]] growth can create brittle points of fracture. Lots of work that has been done to characterize the intermetallic formation and aging for various metal systems. This not a problem in metal systems where the wire bond and bond pad are the same material such as Al-Al. This does become a concern in dissimilar metal systems. One of the most well known examples is the brittle intermetallics formed in [[Gold-aluminum intermetallics|gold-aluminum IMCs]] such as [[Gold-aluminum intermetallics|purple plague]]. Additionally, diffusion related issues, such as [[Kirkendall effect|Kirkendall voiding]] and Horsting voiding, can also lead to wire bond failures.\n\nUnder elevated temperature and humidity environments, [[corrosion]] can be a concern. This is most common in Au-Al metal systems and is driven by [[galvanic corrosion]]. The presence of halides such as chlorine can accelerate this behavior. This Au-Al corrosion is often characterized with [[Physics of failure#Next stage \u2013 Electronic packaging|Peck's law]] for temperature and humidity. This is not as common in other metal systems.\n\nUnder temperature cycling, thermomechanical stress is generated in the wire bond as a result of [[Thermal expansion|coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)]] mismatch between the [[Epoxy|epoxy molding compound (EMC)]], the [[Lead frame|leadframe]], the die, the die adhesive, and the wire bond. This leads to [[Low-cycle fatigue|low cycle fatigue]] due to shear or tensile stresses in the wire bond. Various [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] models have been used to predict the fatigue life of wire bonds under such conditions.\n\nProper understanding of the use environment and metal systems are often the most important factors for increasing wire bond reliability.\n\n== Testing ==\nWhile there are some wire bond pull and shear testing techniques,<ref>MIL-STD-883: Test Method Standard for Microcircuits, Method 2011.7 Bond Strength (Destructive Bond Pull Test)</ref><ref>MIL-STD-883: Test Method Standard for Microcircuits, Method 2023.5 Nondestructive Bond Pull</ref><ref>ASTM F459-13: Standard Test Methods for Measuring Pull Strength of Microelectronic Wire Bonds</ref><ref>JESD22-B116: Wire Bond Shear Test Method</ref> these tend to be applicable for manufacturing quality rather than reliability. They are often monotonic overstress techniques, where peak force and fracture location are the critical outputs. In this case the damage is plasticity dominated, and does not reflect some wearout mechanisms that might be seen under environmental conditions.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Triangulation-wire-pull.png|frame|right|Wire pull triangulation]] -->\nWire pull testing applies an upward force under the wire, effectively pulling it away from the substrate or die.<ref name=\"wirepull\">[http://www.wirepull.how/ How to test bonds: How to Wire Pull?] April 2016.</ref> The purpose of the test is as [http://www.xyztec.com/how-to/wire-pull/MIL-STD-883-2011-9-bond-strength-bond-pull-test.php MIL-STD-883 2011.9] describes it: \"To measure bond strengths, evaluate bond strength distributions, or determine compliance with specified bond strength requirements\". A wire can be pulled to destruction, but there are also non-destructive variants whereby one tests whether the wire can withstand a certain force. Non-destructive test methods are typically used for 100% testing of safety critical, high quality and high cost products, avoiding damage to the acceptable wired bonds tested.\n\nThe term wire pull usually refers to the act of pulling a wire with a hook mounted on a pull sensor on a [[bond tester]]. However, to promote certain failure modes, wires can be cut and then pulled by tweezers, also mounted on a pull sensor on a bond tester. Usually wires up to 75&nbsp;\u03bcm diameter (3 mil) are classified as thin wire. Beyond that size, we speak about thick wire testing.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Purple plague (intermetallic)]]\n* [[Kirkendall effect]]\n* [[Ball Bonding]]\n* [[Wedge bonding]]\n* [[Thermosonic Bonding]]\n* [[Pull off test]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2018/02/CopperWirebond_TS105.pdf Amkor Copper (Cu) Wirebonding]\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2015/03/Copper-Wirebond-J-Devices-TSJD404.pdf J-Devices Copper (Cu) Wirebonding]\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2018/02/SilverWirebond_TS108.pdf Amkor Silver (Ag) Wirebonding]\n\n{{wafer bonding}}\n\n[[Category:Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n[[Category:Packaging (microfabrication)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "text_old": "[[Image:wirebond-ballbond.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gold wire ball-bonded to a gold [[contact pad]]]]\n[[Image:transistor-die-KSY34.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Aluminium wires wedge-bonded to a KSY34 [[bipolar transistor|transistor]] die]]\n[[Image:Wire-bonded Germanium Diode.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Germanium diode]] AAZ15 bonded with gold wire]]\n[[Image:Wirebonding2.svg|thumb|right|250px|The interconnections in a power package are made using thick (250 to 400 \u03bcm), wedge-bonded, aluminium wires]]\n\n'''Wire bonding''' is the method of making interconnections between an [[integrated circuit]] (IC) or other [[semiconductor device]] and its [[integrated circuit packaging|packaging]] during [[Fabrication (semiconductor)|semiconductor device fabrication]].

Processing also is carried out under conditions which yield the ultimate in surface cleanliness and smooth finish and permits entirely snag-free de-reeling.<ref name=\"ametek-aluminum\">{{cite web |url=https://www.ametek-ecp.com/products/wire-and-ribbon/aluminum-alloys-wire-ribbon |title=Aluminum Bonding Wire and Ribbon: Silicon Aluminum Wire, Aluminum Ribbon |work=ametek-ecp.com |date=June 20, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n== Attachment techniques ==\n[[File:Ultrasonic wedge bonding.webm|thumb|250px|Demonstration of ultrasonic wedge bonding of an aluminium wire between gold electrodes on a printed circuit board and gold electrodes on a sapphire substrate, reverse bonding order.]]\nThe main classes of wire bonding:\n*[[Ball bonding]]\n*[[Wedge bonding]]\n*[[Compliant bonding]]\n\nBall bonding usually is restricted to gold and copper wire and usually requires heat. For wedge bonding, only gold wire requires heat. Wedge bonding can use large diameter wires or wire ribbons for power electronics application. Ball bonding is limited to small diameter wires, suitable for interconnect application.\n\nIn either type of wire bonding, the wire is attached at both ends using a combination of downward pressure, ultrasonic energy, and in some cases heat, to make a [[Welding|weld]]. Heat is used to make the metal softer. The correct combination of temperature and ultrasonic energy is used in order to maximize the reliability and strength of a wire bond. If heat and ultrasonic energy is used, the process is called thermosonic bonding.\n\nIn wedge bonding, the wire must be drawn in a straight line according to the first bond. This slows down the process due to time needed for tool alignment. Ball bonding, however, creates its first bond in a ball shape with the wire sticking out at the top, having no directional preference. Thus, the wire can be drawn in any direction, making it a faster process.\n\nCompliant bonding<ref name=\"four\">A.Coucoulas, \"Compliant Bonding\" Proceedings 1970 IEEE 20th Electronic Components Conference, pp. 380-89, 1970. http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:CompliantBondingPublic_1-10.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225284187_Compliant_Bonding_Alexander_Coucoulas_1970_Proceeding_Electronic_Components_Conference_Awarded_Best_Paper</ref> transmits heat and pressure through a compliant or indentable aluminum tape and therefore is applicable in bonding gold wires and the beam leads that have been electroformed to the silicon integrated circuit (known as the beam leaded integrated circuit).\n\n==Manufacturing and reliability challenges==\nThere are multiple challenges when it comes to wire bond manufacturing and reliability. These challenges tend of be a function of several parameters such as the material systems, bonding parameters, and use environment. Different wire bond-[[Contact pad|bond pad]] metal systems such as [[Aluminum]]-Aluminum (Al-Al), [[Gold]]-Aluminum (Au-Al), and [[Copper]]-Aluminum (Cu-Al) require different manufacturing parameters and behave differently under the same use environments.\n\n===Wire bond manufacturing===\nMuch work has been done to characterize various metal systems, review critical manufacturing parameters, and identify typical reliability issues that occur in wire bonding.<ref>G. G. Harman, Wire Bonding in Microelectronics: Materials, Processes, Reliability and Yield. New York: McGraw Hill, 2010.</ref><ref>S.K. Prasad, Advanced Wirebond Interconnection Technology. New York: Springer, 2004.</ref> When it comes to material selection, the application and use environment will dictate the metal system. Often the electrical properties, mechanical properties, and cost are taken into account when making a decision. For example, a high current device for a space application might require a large diameter aluminum wire bond in a hermetically sealed ceramic package. If cost is a large constraint, then avoiding gold wire bonds may be a necessity. Some recent work has been done to look at copper wire bonds in automotive applications.<ref>[http://www.dfrsolutions.com/hubfs/Resources/services/Suitability-of-Cu-wire-bonded-ICs-for-auto-applications.pdf?t=1506700543823 Ensuring suitability of Cu wire bonded ICs for automotive applications]</ref> This is only a small sampling, as there is a vast body of work reviewing and testing what material systems work best in different applications.\n\nFrom a manufacturing perspective, the bonding parameters play a critical role in bond formation and bond quality. Parameters such bond force, ultrasonic energy, temperature, and loop geometry, to name a few, can have a significant effect on bond quality. There are various wire bonding techniques ([[thermosonic bonding]], ultrasonic bonding, [[thermocompression bonding]]) and types of wire bonds ([[ball bonding]], [[wedge bonding]]) that affect susceptibility to manufacturing defects and reliability issues. Certain materials and wire diameters are more practical for fine pitch or complex layouts. The bond pad also plays an important role as the metallization and barrier layer(s) stackup will impact the bond formation.\n\nTypical failure modes that result from poor bond quality and manufacturing defects include: fracture at the ball bond neck, heel cracking (wedge bonds), pad liftoff, pad peel, overcompression, and improper intermetallic formation. A combination of wire bond pull/shear testing, [[nondestructive testing]], and [[Destructive testing|destructive physical analysis (DPA)]] can be used to screen manufacturing and quality issues.\n\n===Wire bond reliability===\nWhile wirebond manufacturing tends to focus on bond quality, it often does not account for wearout mechanisms related to wire bond reliability. In this case, an understanding of the application and use environment can help prevent reliability issues. Common examples of environments that lead to wire bond failures include elevated temperature, humidity, and temperature cycling.<ref>Hillman, C., \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Craig_Hillman/publication/312084398_Predicting_and_Avoiding_Die_Attach_Wire_Bond_and_Solder_Joint_Failures/links/586e5e9008ae329d6213a2e2/Predicting-and-Avoiding-Die-Attach-Wire-Bond-and-Solder-Joint-Failures.pdf Predicting and avoiding die attach, wire bond, and solder joint failures].\" International Symposium on 3D Power Electronics Integration and Manufacturing (3D-PEIM), 2016.</ref>\n\nUnder elevated temperatures, excessive [[Intermetallic|intermetallics (IMC)]] growth can create brittle points of fracture. Lots of work that has been done to characterize the intermetallic formation and aging for various metal systems. This not a problem in metal systems where the wire bond and bond pad are the same material such as Al-Al. This does become a concern in dissimilar metal systems. One of the most well known examples is the brittle intermetallics formed in [[Gold-aluminum intermetallics|gold-aluminum IMCs]] such as [[Gold-aluminum intermetallics|purple plague]]. Additionally, diffusion related issues, such as [[Kirkendall effect|Kirkendall voiding]] and Horsting voiding, can also lead to wire bond failures.\n\nUnder elevated temperature and humidity environments, [[corrosion]] can be a concern. This is most common in Au-Al metal systems and is driven by [[galvanic corrosion]]. The presence of halides such as chlorine can accelerate this behavior. This Au-Al corrosion is often characterized with [[Physics of failure#Next stage \u2013 Electronic packaging|Peck's law]] for temperature and humidity. This is not as common in other metal systems.\n\nUnder temperature cycling, thermomechanical stress is generated in the wire bond as a result of [[Thermal expansion|coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE)]] mismatch between the [[Epoxy|epoxy molding compound (EMC)]], the [[Lead frame|leadframe]], the die, the die adhesive, and the wire bond. This leads to [[Low-cycle fatigue|low cycle fatigue]] due to shear or tensile stresses in the wire bond. Various [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] models have been used to predict the fatigue life of wire bonds under such conditions.\n\nProper understanding of the use environment and metal systems are often the most important factors for increasing wire bond reliability.\n\n== Testing ==\nWhile there are some wire bond pull and shear testing techniques,<ref>MIL-STD-883: Test Method Standard for Microcircuits, Method 2011.7 Bond Strength (Destructive Bond Pull Test)</ref><ref>MIL-STD-883: Test Method Standard for Microcircuits, Method 2023.5 Nondestructive Bond Pull</ref><ref>ASTM F459-13: Standard Test Methods for Measuring Pull Strength of Microelectronic Wire Bonds</ref><ref>JESD22-B116: Wire Bond Shear Test Method</ref> these tend to be applicable for manufacturing quality rather than reliability. They are often monotonic overstress techniques, where peak force and fracture location are the critical outputs. In this case the damage is plasticity dominated, and does not reflect some wearout mechanisms that might be seen under environmental conditions.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Triangulation-wire-pull.png|frame|right|Wire pull triangulation]] -->\nWire pull testing applies an upward force under the wire, effectively pulling it away from the substrate or die.<ref name=\"wirepull\">[http://www.wirepull.how/ How to test bonds: How to Wire Pull?] April 2016.</ref> The purpose of the test is as [http://www.xyztec.com/how-to/wire-pull/MIL-STD-883-2011-9-bond-strength-bond-pull-test.php MIL-STD-883 2011.9] describes it: \"To measure bond strengths, evaluate bond strength distributions, or determine compliance with specified bond strength requirements\". A wire can be pulled to destruction, but there are also non-destructive variants whereby one tests whether the wire can withstand a certain force. Non-destructive test methods are typically used for 100% testing of safety critical, high quality and high cost products, avoiding damage to the acceptable wired bonds tested.\n\nThe term wire pull usually refers to the act of pulling a wire with a hook mounted on a pull sensor on a [[bond tester]]. However, to promote certain failure modes, wires can be cut and then pulled by tweezers, also mounted on a pull sensor on a bond tester. Usually wires up to 75&nbsp;\u03bcm diameter (3 mil) are classified as thin wire. Beyond that size, we speak about thick wire testing.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Purple plague (intermetallic)]]\n* [[Kirkendall effect]]\n* [[Ball Bonding]]\n* [[Wedge bonding]]\n* [[Thermosonic Bonding]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Resources==\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2018/02/CopperWirebond_TS105.pdf Amkor Copper (Cu) Wirebonding]\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2015/03/Copper-Wirebond-J-Devices-TSJD404.pdf J-Devices Copper (Cu) Wirebonding]\n*[https://c44f5d406df450f4a66b-1b94a87d576253d9446df0a9ca62e142.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/2018/02/SilverWirebond_TS108.pdf Amkor Silver (Ag) Wirebonding]\n\n{{wafer bonding}}\n\n[[Category:Semiconductor device fabrication]]\n[[Category:Packaging (microfabrication)]]\n[[Category:Articles containing video clips]]\n", "name_user": "Xray0100", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wire_bonding"}
