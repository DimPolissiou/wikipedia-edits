The temporomandibular joint is susceptible to a huge range of diseases, some rarer than others, and there is no implication that all of these will cause any symptoms or limitation in function at all.\n\nThe preferred terms in medical publications is to an extent influenced by geographic location. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''pain dysfunction syndrome'' is in common use.<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /> In the United States, the term ''temporomandibular disorder'' is generally favored. The American Academy of Orofacial Pain uses ''temporomandibular disorder'', whilst the [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research]] uses ''temporomandibular joint disorder''.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> A more complete list of synonyms for this topic is extensive, with some being more commonly used than others.

This type of TMD is sometimes termed \"posttraumatic TMD\" (pTMD) to distinguish it from TMD of unknown cause, sometimes termed \"[[idiopathic]] TMD\" (iTMD).<ref name=\"Fernandez 2009\" /> Sometimes muscle-related (myogenous) TMD (also termed myogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to myofascial pain and dysfunction) is distinguished from joint-related TMD (also termed arthogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to true articular disease), based upon whether the muscles of mastication or the TMJs themselves are predominantly involved. This classification, which effectively divides TMD into 2 syndromes, is followed by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> However, since most people with TMD could be placed into both of these groups, which makes a single diagnosis difficult when this classification is used. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) allows for multiple diagnoses in an attempt to overcome the problems with other classifications. RDC/TMD considers temporomandibular disorders in 2 axes; axis I is the physical aspects, and axis II involves assessment of psychological status, mandibular function and TMD-related psychosocial disability.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> Axis I is further divided into 3 general groups. Group I are muscle disorders, group II are disc displacements and group III are joint disorders,<ref name=\"Manfredini 2011\" /> although it is common for people with TMD to fit into more than one of these groups.\n\n===By duration===\nSometimes distinction is made between acute TMD, where symptoms last for less than 3 months, and chronic TMD, where symptoms last for more than 3 months.<ref name=\"Mujakperuo 2010\" /> Not much is known about acute TMD since these individuals do not typically attend in [[secondary care]] (hospital).<ref name=\"Mujakperuo 2010\" />\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation.

The term arthrosis may cause confusion since in the specialized TMD literature it means something slightly different from in the wider medical literature. In medicine generally, arthrosis can be a nonspecific term for a joint, any disease of a joint (or specifically degenerative joint disease), and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definitions of \"Arthrosis\" from various medical and popular dictionaries |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arthrosis|publisher=Farlex |access-date=30 May 2013}}</ref> In the specialized literature that has evolved around TMD research, arthrosis is differentiated from arthritis by the presence of low and no inflammation respectively.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" /> Both are however equally degenerative.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" /> The TMJs are sometimes described as one of the most used joints in the body. Over time, either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint, wear and degeneration can occur, termed osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, an [[autoimmune]] joint disease, can also affect the TMJs. Degenerative joint diseases may lead to defects in the shape of the tissues of the joint, limitation of function (e.g. restricted mandibular movements), and joint pain.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" />\n\n===Psychosocial factors===\n[[Stress (psychological)|Emotional stress]] (anxiety, depression, anger) may increase pain by causing [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], [[Viscus|visceral]] and skeletal activity and by reduced inhibition via the descending pathways of the [[limbic system]].<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> The interactions of these biological systems have been described as a vicious \"anxiety-pain-tension\" cycle which is thought to be frequently involved in TMD.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> Put simply, stress and anxiety cause grinding of teeth and sustained muscular contraction in the face.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> This produces pain which causes further anxiety which in turn causes prolonged muscular spasm at trigger points, [[vasoconstriction]], [[ischemia]] and release of pain mediators.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> The pain discourages use of the masticatory system (a similar phenomenon in other chronic pain conditions is termed \"fear avoidance\" behavior), which leads to reduced muscle flexibility, tone, strength and endurance.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> This manifests as limited mouth opening and a sensation that the teeth are not fitting properly.<ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" />\n\nPersons with TMD have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders than people without TMD.<ref name=\"Orlando 2007\" /> People with TMD have been shown to have higher levels of anxiety, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatization and [[sleep deprivation]], and these could be considered important [[risk factor]]s for the development of TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /><ref name=\"Orlando 2007\" /> In the 6 months before the onset, 50\u201370% of people with TMD report experiencing stressful life events (e.g. involving work, money, health or relationship loss).<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> It has been postulated that such events induce anxiety and cause increased jaw muscle activity.<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> Muscular hyperactivity has also been shown in people with TMD whilst taking examinations or watching horror films.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" />\n\nOthers argue that a link between muscular hyperactivity and TMD has not been convincingly demonstrated, and that emotional distress may be more of a consequence of pain rather than a cause.<ref name=\"Glick 2003\" />\n\n===Bruxism===\n{{Main|Bruxism}}\n\nBruxism is an oral [[parafunctional habit|parafunctional activity]] where there is excessive clenching and grinding of the teeth. It can occur during sleep or whilst awake. The cause of bruxism itself is not completely understood, but psychosocial factors appear to be implicated in awake bruxism and [[dopamine]]rgic dysfunction and other [[central nervous system]] mechanisms may be involved in sleep bruxism. If TMD pain and limitation of mandibular movement are greatest upon waking, and then slowly resolve throughout the day, this may indicate sleep bruxism. Conversely, awake bruxism tends to cause symptoms that slowly get worse throughout the day, and there may be no pain at all upon waking.\n\nThe relationship of bruxism with TMD is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\">{{cite book |last=Scully |first=Crispian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment |year=2008 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780443068188 |edition=2nd |pages=8,14,30,31,33,101,104,106,291\u2013295,338,339,351}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Glick 2003\">{{cite book |vauthors=Greenberg MS, Glick M |title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis & treatment |year=2003 |publisher=BC Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |isbn=978-1-55009-186-1 |edition=10th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Tyldesley 2003\">{{cite book|vauthors=Tyldesley WR, Field A, Longman L |title=Tyldesley's Oral medicine|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0192631473|edition=5th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Shetty 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shetty S, Pitti V, Satish Babu CL, Surendra Kumar GP, Deepthi BC | title = Bruxism: a literature review | journal = Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 141\u20138 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21886404 | pmc = 3081266 | doi = 10.1007/s13191-011-0041-5 }}</ref> Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism.<ref name=\"De Meyer 1997\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Meyer MD, De Boever JA | title = [The role of bruxism in the appearance of temporomandibular joint disorders] | journal = Revue Belge de M\u00e9decine Dentaire | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 124\u201338 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9709800 }}</ref> Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism.<ref name=\"Cawson 2002\">{{cite book |vauthors=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S |title=Cawson\u015b essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine |year=2002 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-443-07106-5 |edition=7th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when more strict diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower.<ref name=\"Manfredini 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Manfredini D, Lobbezoo F | title = Relationship between bruxism and temporomandibular disorders: a systematic review of literature from 1998 to 2008 | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics | volume = 109 | issue = 6 | pages = e26-50 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20451831 | doi = 10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.02.013 }}</ref> Self-reported bruxism is probably a poor method of identifying bruxism.<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> There are also very many people who grind their teeth and who do not develop TMD.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Bruxism and other parafunctional activities may play a role in perpetuating symptoms in some cases.<ref name=\"Buescher 2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buescher JJ | title = Temporomandibular joint disorders | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 10 | pages = 1477\u201382 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18052012 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1115/p1477.html }}</ref>\n\nOther parafunctional habits such as pen chewing,<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> lip and cheek biting<!-- <ref name=\"Glick 2003\" /> --> (which may manifest as [[morsicatio buccarum]] or [[linea alba (cheek)|linea alba]]), are also suggested to contribute to the development of TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Other parafunctional activities might include jaw thrusting, excessive gum chewing, [[nail biting]] and eating very hard foods.\n\n===Trauma===\nTrauma, both micro and macrotrauma, is sometimes identified as a possible cause of TMD;

Recently a plethora of research has substantiated a causal relationship between TMD and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  Severe TMD restricts oral airway opening, and can result in a retrognathic posture that results in glossal blockage of the oropharynx as the tongue relaxes in sleep.  This mechanism is exacerbated by alcohol consumption, as well as other chemicals that result in reduced myotonic status of the oropharynx.\n\n* Obstructive sleep apnea.<ref>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0013523/{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Miller JR, Burgess JA, Critchlow CW | title = Association between mandibular retrognathia and TMJ disorders in adult females | journal = Journal of Public Health Dentistry | volume = 64 | issue = 3 | pages = 157\u201363 | year = 2004 | pmid = 15341139 | doi = 10.1111/j.1752-7325.2004.tb02746.x }}</ref> \n* [[Rheumatoid arthritis]].<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" />\n* Systemic joint laxity.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> \n* Chronic back pain.<ref name=\"Luther 2010\" /> \n* Irritable bowel syndrome.<ref name=\"Kindler 2011\" />\n* Headache.<ref name=\"Kindler 2011\" />\n* Chronic neck pain.<ref name=\"Kindler 2011\" />\n* Interstitial cystitis.<ref name=\"Kindler 2011\" />\n* Regular [[scuba diving]].<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /><ref name=\"Zadik 2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Zadik Y, Drucker S | title = Diving dentistry: a review of the dental implications of scuba diving | journal = Australian Dental Journal | volume = 56 | issue = 3 | pages = 265\u201371 | date = September 2011 | pmid = 21884141 | doi = 10.1111/j.1834-7819.2011.01340.x }}</ref>\n\n==Pathophysiology==\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = vertical\n| header    = \n| width     = 170\n\n| image1    = Gray309.png\n| alt1      = \n| caption1  = Left temporomandibular joint, lateral view.\n\n| image2    = Gray310.png\n| alt2      = \n| caption2  = Left TMJ, medial view, showing sphenomandibular and stylomandibular ligaments.\n\n| image3    = Gray311.png\n| alt3      = \n| caption3  = Sagittal TMJ cross-section showing articular eminence, articular disc, and upper and lower joint spaces.\n}}\n\n===Anatomy and physiology===\n\n====Temporomandibular joints====\n{{main|Temporomandibular joint}}\nThe temporomandibular joints are the dual articulation of the mandible with the skull.

Clicking alone is not diagnostic of TMD since it is present in high proportion of the general population, mostly in people who have no pain.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Crepitus often indicates arthritic changes in the joint, and may occur at any time during mandibular movement, especially lateral movements.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Perforation of the disc may also cause crepitus.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> Due to the proximity of the TMJ to the [[external auditory meatus|ear canal]], joint noises are perceived to be much louder to the individual than to others. Often people with TMD are surprised that what sounds to them like very loud noises cannot be heard at all by others next to them. However, it is occasionally possible for loud joint noises to be easily heard by others in some cases and this can be a source of embarrassment e.g. when eating in company.\n\n====Pain====\nPain symptoms in TMD can be thought of as originating from the joint (arthralgia), or from the muscles (myofascial), or both.

They are usually made of [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] and can be hard or soft. They can be designed to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth. They may cover all the teeth in one arch (full coverage splint) or only some (partial coverage splint). Splints are also termed according to their intended mechanism, such as the anterior positioning splint or the stabilization splint.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Although occlusal splints are generally considered a reversible treatment,<ref name=\"Hupp 2008\" /> sometimes partial coverage splints lead to pathologic tooth migration (changes in the position of teeth). Normally splints are only worn during sleep, and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep. There is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal splints in sleep bruxism than in TMD. A splint can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night. This may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt. Soft splints are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to TMD.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Specific types of occlusal splint are discussed below.\n\nA stabilization splint is a hard acrylic splint that forces the teeth to meet in an \"ideal\" relationship for the muscles of mastication and the TMJs. It is claimed that this technique reduces abnormal muscular activity and promotes \"neuromuscular balance\". A stabilization splint is only intended to be used for about 2\u20133 months.<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /> It is more complicated to construct than other types of splint since a [[Articulator|face bow]] record is required and significantly more skill on the part of the [[dental technician]]. This kind of splint should be properly fitted to avoid exacerbating the problem and used for brief periods of time. The use of the splint should be discontinued if it is painful or increases existing pain.<ref name=TMJA/> A systematic review of all the scientific studies investigating the efficacy of stabilization splints concluded the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"On the basis of our analysis we conclude that the literature seems to suggest that there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilization splint therapy over other active interventions for the treatment of TMD. However, there is weak evidence to suggest that the use of stabilization splints for the treatment of TMD may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, when compared to no treatment\".<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /></blockquote>\n\nPartial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements, which can occasionally be severe. The mechanism of this tooth movement is that the splint effectively holds some teeth out of contact and puts all the force of the bite onto the teeth which the splint covers. This can cause the covered teeth to be intruded, and those that are not covered to over-erupted. I.e. a partial coverage splint can act as a [[Dahl appliance]]. Examples of partial coverage splints include the NTI-TSS (\"nociceptive trigeminal inhibitor tension suppression system\"), which covers the upper front teeth only. Due to the risks involved with long term use, some discourage the use of any type of partial coverage splint.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" />\n\nAn anterior positioning splint is a splint that designed to promote an anteriorly displaced disc. It is rarely used.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> A 2010 review of all the scientific studies carried out to investigate the use of occlusal splints in TMD concluded:\n\n<blockquote>\"Hard stabilization appliances, when adjusted properly, have good evidence of modest efficacy in the treatment of TMD pain compared to non-occluding appliances and no treatment. Other types of appliances, including soft stabilization appliances, anterior positioning appliances, and anterior bite appliances, have some [[Randomized controlled trial|RCT]] evidence of efficacy in reducing TMD pain.

These techniques are sometimes termed \"occlusal rehabilitation\" or \"occlusal equilibration\".<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> At its simplest, occlusal adjustment involves selective grinding (with a dental drill) of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth, with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way.<ref name=\"Luther 2010\" /> However, there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the exact goals. Occlusal adjustment can also be very complex, involving [[orthodontic]]s, [[restorative dentistry]] or even [[orthognathic surgery]]. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism.<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> A \"middle ground\" view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of TMD is neither desirable nor helpful as a first line treatment, and furthermore, with few exceptions, any adjustments should be reversible.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> However, most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment,<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> with no evidence of benefit.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> Specifically, orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for TMD.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> A systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in TMD concluded the following: \n<blockquote>\"There is an absence of evidence of effectiveness for occlusal adjustment. Based on these data occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD.<ref name=\"Koh 2004\" /></blockquote>\n\nThese conclusions were based largely on the fact that, despite many different scientific studies investigating this measure as a therapy, overall no statistically significant differences can be demonstrated between treatment with occlusal adjustment and treatment with [[placebo]]. The reviewers also stated that there are ethical implications if occlusal adjustment was found to be ineffective in preventing TMD.<ref name=\"Koh 2004\" />\n\nOrthodontic treatment, as described earlier, is sometimes listed as a possible predisposing factor in the development of TMD. On the other hand, orthodontic treatment is also often carried out in the belief that it may treat or prevent TMD. Another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and TMD concluded the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"There is no evidence to support or refute the use of orthodontic treatment for the treatment of TMD. In addition, there are no data which identify a link between active orthodontic intervention and the causation of TMD. Based on the lack of data, orthodontic treatment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD.\"<ref name=\"Luther 2010\" /> </blockquote>\n\nA common scenario where a newly placed dental restoration (e.g. a crown or a filling) is incorrectly contoured, and creates a premature contact in the bite. This may localize all the force of the bite onto one tooth, and cause inflammation of the periodontal ligament and reversible increase in tooth mobility. The tooth may become tender to bite on. Here, the \"occlusal adjustment\" has already taken place inadvertently, and the adjustment aims to return to the pre-existing occlusion. This should be distinguished from attempts to deliberately reorganize the native occlusion.\n\n===Surgery===\n{{Main|Surgery for temporomandibular joint dysfunction}}\nAttempts in the last decade to develop [[Surgery|surgical treatment]]s based on [[MRI]] and [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scans now receive less attention.

The temporomandibular joint is susceptible to a huge range of diseases, some rarer than others, and there is no implication that all of these will cause any symptoms or limitation in function at all.\n\nThe preferred terms in medical publications is to an extent influenced by geographic location. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''pain dysfunction syndrome'' is in common use.<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /> In the United States, the term ''temporomandibular disorder'' is generally favored. The American Academy of Orofacial Pain uses ''temporomandibular disorder'', whilst the [[National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research]] uses ''temporomandibular joint disorder''.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> A more complete list of synonyms for this topic is extensive, with some being more commonly used than others.

This type of TMD is sometimes termed \"posttraumatic TMD\" (pTMD) to distinguish it from TMD of unknown cause, sometimes termed \"[[idiopathic]] TMD\" (iTMD).<ref name=\"Fernandez 2009\" /> Sometimes muscle-related (myogenous) TMD (also termed myogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to myofascial pain and dysfunction) is distinguished from joint-related TMD (also termed arthogenous TMD, or TMD secondary to true articular disease), based upon whether the muscles of mastication or the TMJs themselves are predominantly involved. This classification, which effectively divides TMD into 2 syndromes, is followed by the American Academy of Orofacial Pain.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> However, since most people with TMD could be placed into both of these groups, which makes a single diagnosis difficult when this classification is used. The Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD) allows for multiple diagnoses in an attempt to overcome the problems with other classifications. RDC/TMD considers temporomandibular disorders in 2 axes; axis I is the physical aspects, and axis II involves assessment of psychological status, mandibular function and TMD-related psychosocial disability.<ref name=\"Medscape reference\" /> Axis I is further divided into 3 general groups. Group I are muscle disorders, group II are disc displacements and group III are joint disorders,<ref name=\"Manfredini 2011\" /> although it is common for people with TMD to fit into more than one of these groups.\n\n===By duration===\nSometimes distinction is made between acute TMD, where symptoms last for less than 3 months, and chronic TMD, where symptoms last for more than 3 months.<ref name=\"Mujakperuo 2010\" /> Not much is known about acute TMD since these individuals do not typically attend in [[secondary care]] (hospital).<ref name=\"Mujakperuo 2010\" />\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\nSigns and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder vary in their presentation.

The term arthrosis may cause confusion since in the specialized TMD literature it means something slightly different from in the wider medical literature. In medicine generally, arthrosis can be a nonspecific term for a joint, any disease of a joint (or specifically degenerative joint disease), and is also used as a synonym for osteoarthritis.<ref>{{cite web|title=Definitions of \"Arthrosis\" from various medical and popular dictionaries |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/arthrosis|publisher=Farlex |access-date=30 May 2013}}</ref> In the specialized literature that has evolved around TMD research, arthrosis is differentiated from arthritis by the presence of low and no inflammation respectively.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" /> Both are however equally degenerative.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" /> The TMJs are sometimes described as one of the most used joints in the body. Over time, either with normal use or with parafunctional use of the joint, wear and degeneration can occur, termed osteoarthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis, an [[autoimmune]] joint disease, can also affect the TMJs. Degenerative joint diseases may lead to defects in the shape of the tissues of the joint, limitation of function (e.g. restricted mandibular movements), and joint pain.<ref name=\"Cairns 2010\" />\n\n===Psychosocial factors===\n[[Stress (psychological)|Emotional stress]] (anxiety, depression, anger) may increase pain by causing [[Autonomic nervous system|autonomic]], [[Viscus|visceral]] and skeletal activity and by reduced inhibition via the descending pathways of the [[limbic system]].<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> The interactions of these biological systems have been described as a vicious \"anxiety-pain-tension\" cycle which is thought to be frequently involved in TMD.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> Put simply, stress and anxiety cause grinding of teeth and sustained muscular contraction in the face.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> This produces pain which causes further anxiety which in turn causes prolonged muscular spasm at trigger points, [[vasoconstriction]], [[ischemia]] and release of pain mediators.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> The pain discourages use of the masticatory system (a similar phenomenon in other chronic pain conditions is termed \"fear avoidance\" behavior), which leads to reduced muscle flexibility, tone, strength and endurance.<!-- <ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" /> --> This manifests as limited mouth opening and a sensation that the teeth are not fitting properly.<ref name=\"Aggarwal 2011\" />\n\nPersons with TMD have a higher prevalence of psychological disorders than people without TMD.<ref name=\"Orlando 2007\" /> People with TMD have been shown to have higher levels of anxiety, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], somatization and [[sleep deprivation]], and these could be considered important [[risk factor]]s for the development of TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /><ref name=\"Orlando 2007\" /> In the 6 months before the onset, 50\u201370% of people with TMD report experiencing stressful life events (e.g. involving work, money, health or relationship loss).<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> It has been postulated that such events induce anxiety and cause increased jaw muscle activity.<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> Muscular hyperactivity has also been shown in people with TMD whilst taking examinations or watching horror films.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" />\n\nOthers argue that a link between muscular hyperactivity and TMD has not been convincingly demonstrated, and that emotional distress may be more of a consequence of pain rather than a cause.<ref name=\"Glick 2003\" />\n\n===Bruxism===\n{{Main|Bruxism}}\n\nBruxism is an oral [[parafunctional habit|parafunctional activity]] where there is excessive clenching and grinding of the teeth. It can occur during sleep or whilst awake. The cause of bruxism itself is not completely understood, but psychosocial factors appear to be implicated in awake bruxism and [[dopamine]]rgic dysfunction and other [[central nervous system]] mechanisms may be involved in sleep bruxism. If TMD pain and limitation of mandibular movement are greatest upon waking, and then slowly resolve throughout the day, this may indicate sleep bruxism. Conversely, awake bruxism tends to cause symptoms that slowly get worse throughout the day, and there may be no pain at all upon waking.\n\nThe relationship of bruxism with TMD is debated. Many suggest that sleep bruxism can be a causative or contributory factor to pain symptoms in TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\">{{cite book |last=Scully |first=Crispian| name-list-format = vanc |title=Oral and maxillofacial medicine : the basis of diagnosis and treatment |year=2008 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |isbn=9780443068188 |edition=2nd |pages=8,14,30,31,33,101,104,106,291\u2013295,338,339,351}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Glick 2003\">{{cite book |vauthors=Greenberg MS, Glick M |title=Burket's oral medicine diagnosis & treatment |year=2003 |publisher=BC Decker |location=Hamilton, Ont |isbn=978-1-55009-186-1 |edition=10th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Tyldesley 2003\">{{cite book|vauthors=Tyldesley WR, Field A, Longman L |title=Tyldesley's Oral medicine|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0192631473|edition=5th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Shetty 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Shetty S, Pitti V, Satish Babu CL, Surendra Kumar GP, Deepthi BC | title = Bruxism: a literature review | journal = Journal of Indian Prosthodontic Society | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 141\u20138 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 21886404 | pmc = 3081266 | doi = 10.1007/s13191-011-0041-5 }}</ref> Indeed, the symptoms of TMD overlap with those of bruxism.<ref name=\"De Meyer 1997\">{{cite journal | vauthors = De Meyer MD, De Boever JA | title = [The role of bruxism in the appearance of temporomandibular joint disorders] | journal = Revue Belge de M\u00e9decine Dentaire | volume = 52 | issue = 4 | pages = 124\u201338 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9709800 }}</ref> Others suggest that there is no strong association between TMD and bruxism.<ref name=\"Cawson 2002\">{{cite book |vauthors=Cawson RA, Odell EW, Porter S |title=Cawson\u015b essentials of oral pathology and oral medicine |year=2002 |publisher=Churchill Livingstone |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-0-443-07106-5 |edition=7th}}{{page needed|date=May 2013}}</ref> A systematic review investigating the possible relationship concluded that when self-reported bruxism is used to diagnose bruxism, there is a positive association with TMD pain, and when more strict diagnostic criteria for bruxism are used, the association with TMD symptoms is much lower.<ref name=\"Manfredini 2010\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Manfredini D, Lobbezoo F | title = Relationship between bruxism and temporomandibular disorders: a systematic review of literature from 1998 to 2008 | journal = Oral Surgery, Oral Medicine, Oral Pathology, Oral Radiology, and Endodontics | volume = 109 | issue = 6 | pages = e26-50 | date = June 2010 | pmid = 20451831 | doi = 10.1016/j.tripleo.2010.02.013 }}</ref> Self-reported bruxism is probably a poor method of identifying bruxism.<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> There are also very many people who grind their teeth and who do not develop TMD.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Bruxism and other parafunctional activities may play a role in perpetuating symptoms in some cases.<ref name=\"Buescher 2007\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Buescher JJ | title = Temporomandibular joint disorders | journal = American Family Physician | volume = 76 | issue = 10 | pages = 1477\u201382 | date = November 2007 | pmid = 18052012 | url = http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1115/p1477.html }}</ref>\n\nOther parafunctional habits such as pen chewing,<!-- <ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> --> lip and cheek biting<!-- <ref name=\"Glick 2003\" /> --> (which may manifest as [[morsicatio buccarum]] or [[linea alba (cheek)|linea alba]]), are also suggested to contribute to the development of TMD.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Other parafunctional activities might include jaw thrusting, excessive gum chewing, [[nail biting]] and eating very hard foods.\n\n===Trauma===\nTrauma, both micro and macrotrauma, is sometimes identified as a possible cause of TMD;

Recently a plethora of research has substantiated a causal relationship between TMD and Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).  Severe TMD restricts oral airway opening, and can result in a retrognathic posture that results in glossal blockage of the oropharynx as the tongue relaxes in sleep.

The sounds commonly produced by TMD are usually described as a \"click\" or a \"pop\" when a single sound is heard and as \"crepitation\" or \"crepitus\" when there are multiple, grating, rough sounds.

The noise indicates that the articular disc has suddenly moved to and from a temporarily displaced position (disk displacement with reduction) to allow completion of a phase of movement of the mandible.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /><ref name=\"Glick 2003\" /> If the disc displaces and does not reduce (move back into position) this may be associated with locking. Clicking alone is not diagnostic of TMD since it is present in high proportion of the general population, mostly in people who have no pain.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Crepitus often indicates arthritic changes in the joint, and may occur at any time during mandibular movement, especially lateral movements.<ref name=\"Scully 2008\" /> Perforation of the disc may also cause crepitus.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> Due to the proximity of the TMJ to the [[external auditory meatus|ear canal]], joint noises are perceived to be much louder to the individual than to others. Often people with TMD are surprised that what sounds to them like very loud noises cannot be heard at all by others next to them.

They are usually made of [[acrylate polymer|acrylic]] and can be hard or soft. They can be designed to fit onto the upper teeth or the lower teeth. They may cover all the teeth in one arch (full coverage splint) or only some (partial coverage splint). Splints are also termed according to their intended mechanism, such as the anterior positioning splint or the stabilization splint.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Although occlusal splints are generally considered a reversible treatment,<ref name=\"Hupp 2008\" /> sometimes partial coverage splints lead to pathologic tooth migration (changes in the position of teeth). Normally splints are only worn during sleep, and therefore probably do nothing for people who engage in parafunctional activities during wakefulness rather than during sleep. There is slightly more evidence for the use of occlusal splints in sleep bruxism than in TMD. A splint can also have a diagnostic role if it demonstrates excessive occlusal wear after a period of wearing it each night. This may confirm the presence of sleep bruxism if it was in doubt. Soft splints are occasionally reported to worsen discomfort related to TMD.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> Specific types of occlusal splint are discussed below.\n\nA stabilization splint is a hard acrylic splint that forces the teeth to meet in an \"ideal\" relationship for the muscles of mastication and the TMJs. It is claimed that this technique reduces abnormal muscular activity and promotes \"neuromuscular balance\". A stabilization splint is only intended to be used for about 2\u20133 months.<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /> It is more complicated to construct than other types of splint since a [[Articulator|face bow]] record is required and significantly more skill on the part of the [[dental technician]]. This kind of splint should be properly fitted to avoid exacerbating the problem and used for brief periods of time. The use of the splint should be discontinued if it is painful or increases existing pain.<ref name=TMJA/> A systematic review of all the scientific studies investigating the efficacy of stabilization splints concluded the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"On the basis of our analysis we conclude that the literature seems to suggest that there is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilization splint therapy over other active interventions for the treatment of TMD. However, there is weak evidence to suggest that the use of stabilization splints for the treatment of TMD may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, when compared to no treatment\".<ref name=\"Al-Ani 2004\" /></blockquote>\n\nPartial coverage splints are recommended by some experts, but they have the potential to cause unwanted tooth movements, which can occasionally be severe. The mechanism of this tooth movement is that the splint effectively holds some teeth out of contact and puts all the force of the bite onto the teeth which the splint covers. This can cause the covered teeth to be intruded, and those that are not covered to over-erupted. I.e. a partial coverage splint can act as a [[Dahl appliance]].

These techniques are sometimes termed \"occlusal rehabilitation\" or \"occlusal equilibration\".<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> At its simplest, occlusal adjustment involves selective grinding (with a dental drill) of the enamel of the occlusal surfaces of teeth, with the aim of allowing the upper teeth to fit with the lower teeth in a more harmonious way.<ref name=\"Luther 2010\" /> However, there is much disagreement between proponents of these techniques on most of the aspects involved, including the indications and the exact goals. Occlusal adjustment can also be very complex, involving [[orthodontic]]s, [[restorative dentistry]] or even [[orthognathic surgery]]. Some have criticized these occlusal reorganizations as having no evidence base, and irreversibly damaging the dentition on top of the damage already caused by bruxism.<ref name=\"Shetty 2010\" /> A \"middle ground\" view of these techniques is that occlusal adjustment in most cases of TMD is neither desirable nor helpful as a first line treatment, and furthermore, with few exceptions, any adjustments should be reversible.<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> However, most dentists consider this unnecessary overtreatment,<ref name=\"Wassell 2008\" /> with no evidence of benefit.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> Specifically, orthodontics and orthognathic surgery are not considered by most to be appropriate treatments for TMD.<ref name=\"Kerawala 2010\" /> A systematic review investigating all the scientific studies carried out on occlusal adjustments in TMD concluded the following: \n<blockquote>\"There is an absence of evidence of effectiveness for occlusal adjustment. Based on these data occlusal adjustment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD.<ref name=\"Koh 2004\" /></blockquote>\n\nThese conclusions were based largely on the fact that, despite many different scientific studies investigating this measure as a therapy, overall no statistically significant differences can be demonstrated between treatment with occlusal adjustment and treatment with [[placebo]]. The reviewers also stated that there are ethical implications if occlusal adjustment was found to be ineffective in preventing TMD.<ref name=\"Koh 2004\" />\n\nOrthodontic treatment, as described earlier, is sometimes listed as a possible predisposing factor in the development of TMD. On the other hand, orthodontic treatment is also often carried out in the belief that it may treat or prevent TMD. Another systematic review investigating the relationship between orthodontics and TMD concluded the following:\n\n<blockquote>\"There is no evidence to support or refute the use of orthodontic treatment for the treatment of TMD. In addition, there are no data which identify a link between active orthodontic intervention and the causation of TMD. Based on the lack of data, orthodontic treatment cannot be recommended for the treatment or prevention of TMD.\"<ref name=\"Luther 2010\" /> </blockquote>\n\nA common scenario where a newly placed dental restoration (e.g. a crown or a filling) is incorrectly contoured, and creates a premature contact in the bite. This may localize all the force of the bite onto one tooth, and cause inflammation of the periodontal ligament and reversible increase in tooth mobility. The tooth may become tender to bite on. Here, the \"occlusal adjustment\" has already taken place inadvertently, and the adjustment aims to return to the pre-existing occlusion. This should be distinguished from attempts to deliberately reorganize the native occlusion.\n\n===Surgery===\n{{Main|Surgery for temporomandibular joint dysfunction}}\nAttempts in the last decade to develop [[Surgery|surgical treatment]]s based on [[MRI]] and [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scans now receive less attention.

The organization's name is derived from the original ''Mafia'' or ''Cosa nostra'', the [[Sicilian Mafia]], with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America, as the organization originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American [[gangster]]s and Italian crime groups (such as the [[Camorra in New York|American Camorra]]) living in the United States and Canada that were not of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the '''Italian Mafia''' or '''Italian Mob''', though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrant]] [[Little Italy|neighborhoods or ghettos]] in New York's [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]), the [[Lower East Side]], and [[Brooklyn]]. It also emerged in other areas of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and several other major metropolitan areas (such as [[New Orleans]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Mike Dash|author-link=Mike Dash|year=2009|title=First Family|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfamilyterro00dash|url-access=registration}}</ref> and [[Chicago]]) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from [[Sicily]] and other regions of [[Southern Italy]]. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. [[Campania|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with [[Italian organized crime]] groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the [[Camorra]] of [[Naples]], and the [['Ndrangheta]] of [[Calabria]]. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"[[Crime family|family,]]\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known. Despite the name of \"family\" to describe the various units, they are not familial groupings.<ref>Roberto M.

It is also highly active in Chicago and other large Midwestern cities such as Kansas City, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Cleveland, and St. Louis, a smaller presence in places like New Orleans, Florida, Denver, Las Vegas and Los Angeles, and with smaller families, associates, and crews in other parts of the country.<ref name=\"FBI\">{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |title=Italian Organized Crime |website=Organized Crime |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101010181124/http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/organizedcrime/italian_mafia |archivedate=October 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |accessdate=August 7, 2011 }}</ref> At the Mafia's peak, there were at least 26 cities around the United States with Cosa Nostra families, with many more offshoots and associates in other cities.

At its peak, the American Mafia dominated organized crime in the United States. Each crime family has its own territory (except for the Five Families) and operates independently, while nationwide coordination is overseen by [[The Commission (mafia)|the Commission]], which consists of the bosses of each of the strongest families.\n\nToday, most of the Mafia's activities are contained to the [[northeastern United States]] and Chicago, where they continue to dominate organized crime, despite the increasing numbers of other crime groups.<ref>{{cite news|author1=Barrett, Devlin|author2=Gardiner, Sean|title=Structure Keeps Mafia Atop Crime Heap|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704115404576096392318489246|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author1=Gardiner, Sean|author2=Shallwani, Parvaiz|title=Mafia Is Down\u2014but Not Out|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304626804579363363092833756|work=Wall Street Journal|date=24 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Usage of the term ''Mafia''==\n{{further|Sicilian Mafia#Etymology}}\n\nThe word ''mafia'' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8ma\u02d0fja|lang}}) derives from the [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]] adjective ''mafiusu'', which, roughly translated, means \"swagger\", but can also be translated as \"boldness\" or \"[[wikt:bravado|bravado]]\". In reference to a man, ''mafiusu'' (''mafioso'' in Italian) in 19th century [[Sicily]] signified \"fearless\", \"enterprising\", and \"proud\", according to scholar [[Diego Gambetta]].<ref name=\"mafiusu\">This etymology is based on the books ''Che cosa \u00e8 la mafia?'' by [[Gaetano Mosca]], ''Mafioso'' by Gaia Servadio, ''The Sicilian Mafia'' by Diego Gambetta, ''Mafia & Mafiosi'' by Henner Hess, and ''Cosa Nostra'' by John Dickie (see [[#Books|Books]] below).</ref> In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective ''mafiusa'' means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: The Black Hand===\n{{Main|Black Hand (extortion)}}\n[[File:Paul Kelly-2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]]), founder of the [[Five Points Gang]]]]\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869. The ''[[Times-Picayune|New Orleans Times]]'' reported that the city's Second District had become overrun by \"well-known and notorious Sicilian murderers, counterfeiters and burglars, who, in the last month, have formed a sort of general co-partnership or stock company for the plunder and disturbance of the city.\" Emigration from southern Italy to the Americas was primarily to Brazil and Argentina, and New Orleans had a heavy volume of port traffic to and from both locales.\n\nMafia groups in the United States first became influential in the New York City area, gradually progressing from small neighborhood operations in poor [[Little Italy|Italian ghettos]] to citywide and eventually national organizations. The Black Hand was a name given to an [[extortion]] method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/lippmanstudy/articles/Lombardo.pdf |title=Sagepub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>\n\n[[Giuseppe Morello]] was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He was arrested in [[New Orleans]] in 1881 and extradited to Italy.<ref name=\"FBI\"/>\n\nNew Orleans was also the site of the first possible Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent [[David Hennessy]] was murdered execution-style.

Kelly recruited some street hoodlums who later became some of the most famous crime bosses of the century such as [[Johnny Torrio]], [[Al Capone]], [[Lucky Luciano]] and [[Frankie Yale]]. They were often in conflict with the [[Eastman Gang|Jewish Eastmans]] of the same area. There was also an influential Mafia family in East Harlem. The Neapolitan [[Camorra]] was also very active in Brooklyn. In Chicago, the 19th Ward was an Italian neighborhood that became known as the \"Bloody Nineteenth\" due to the frequent violence in the ward, mostly as a result of Mafia activity, [[feud]]s, and vendettas.\n\n===Prohibition era===<!--pls do not change, [[The Mafia during Prohibition]] links to here -->\nOn January 16, 1919, [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] began in the United States with the [[Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|18th Amendment to the United States Constitution]] making it illegal to manufacture, transport, or sell alcohol. Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians. Not explicitly related to Mafia involvement the murder rate during the Prohibition Era rose from 6.8 per 100,000 individuals to 9.7 and within the first three months proceeding the Eighteenth Amendment, a half million dollars in bonded whiskey was stolen from government warehouses.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard.

In New York City, most construction projects could not be performed without the [[Five Families]]' approval. In the [[port]] and [[loading dock]] industries, the Mafia bribed union members to tip them off to valuable items being brought in.

The FBI put a lot more effort and resources into organized crime actives nationwide and created the [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force]] in various cities. However, while all this created more pressure on the Mafia, it did little to curb their criminal activities. Success was made by the beginning of the 1980s, when the FBI was able to rid Las Vegas casinos of Mafia control and made a determined effort to loosen the Mafia's strong hold on labor unions.\n\n=== Mafia involvement in the US economy ===\n[[File:Carlo_Gambino.jpg|thumb|[[Carlo Gambino]], head of the Gambino crime family]]\nBy the late 1970s, the Mafia were involved in many industries,<ref name=\"FBI\"/> including betting on college sports.

They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. [[Michael Franzese]], also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed. Franzese was caught in 1985.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1985-03-26/news/8501110652_1_gas-tax-michael-franzese-colombo-crime-family|title=Gas-tax Fraud Tied To Mob Families|website=tribunedigital-sunsentinel|access-date=2016-06-14}}</ref><ref>{{citation|title=Mafia-Aided Scheme Evades Millions in Gas Taxes|first=Selwyn|last=Raab|date=February 6, 1989|newspaper=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/06/nyregion/mafia-aided-scheme-evades-millions-in-gas-taxes.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nLabor racketeering helped the Mafia control many industries from a macroeconomic scale. This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. [[La Cosa Nostra]] was a Mafia group that rose to [[economic power]] through their heavy involvement in unions. The Mafia has controlled unions all over the U.S. to extort money and resources out of big business, with recent indictments of corruption involving the New Jersey Waterfront Union, the Concrete Workers Union, and the [[Teamster Union|teamster union]].<ref>{{Cite news|ssrn=2002404|title=American Gangsters: RICO, Criminal Syndicates, and Conspiracy Law as Market Control|last=Levin|first=Benjamin|date=2013|work=periodical}}</ref>\n\nRestaurants were yet another powerful means by which the Mafia could gain economic power. A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods. From 1985 to 1987, Sicilian Mafiosi in the U.S. imported an estimated $1.65 billion worth of heroin [[Pizza Connection Trial|through pizzerias]], hiding the cargo in various food products.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/218555.pdf|title=United Nations Activities: La Cosa Nostra in the United States|last=Finckenauer|first=James O.|date=December 6, 2007|work=International Center National Institute of Justice|accessdate=May 31, 2016}}</ref><ref name=nyt030504>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/03/nyregion/gaetano-badalamenti-80-led-pizza-connection-ring.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm Gaetano Badalamenti, 80; Led Pizza Connection Ring], The New York Times (Obituary), May 3, 2004</ref>\n\nAnother one of the areas of the economy that the Mafia was most influential was [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], beginning just after World War II with the opening of the first gambling resort \"[[Flamingo Las Vegas|The Flamingo]]\".<ref name=\"weebly\"/> Many credit the Mafia with being a big part of the city's development in the mid 20th Century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lasvegassun.com/news/2000/jan/03/nevadas-20th-century-economy-a-tale-of-water-minin/|title=Nevada's 20th century economy a tale of water, mining, casinos|date=2000-01-03|website=LasVegasSun.com|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref> It was through millions of dollars in capital flowing into new casino resorts that laid the foundation for further economic growth.

In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the Mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the [[RICO Act]] a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the Mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/siegel-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-las-vegas|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|last=REVIEW-JOURNAL|first=JEFF GERMAN LAS VEGAS|date=2014-03-09|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n\n===RICO Act===\n[[File:Sammy Gravano (arrest photo - 1990).jpg|thumb|[[Sammy Gravano]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters.

While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. He created the [[Five Families]], each of which would have a [[crime boss|boss]], [[underboss]], [[caporegime|capos]], [[soldato|soldiers]], and associates, would be composed of only full-blooded Italian Americans, while associates could come from any background.<ref name=\"A Chronicle of Bloodletting\">{{cite news|title=A Chronicle of Bloodletting|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,902999-1,00.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=July 12, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2010|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345523570|pages=384\u2013386}}</ref><ref name=\"FiveFamilies\"/> All inducted members of the Mafia are called [[Made man|\"made\" men]]. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a ''caporegime'' (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the [[chain of command]]. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated, providing [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader [[Vincent Gigante]].\n* '''Boss''' \u2013 The [[Crime boss|boss]] is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or \"Godfather\". The boss receives a cut of every operation. Operations are taken on by every member of the family and of the region's occupying family.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003.</ref> Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\">Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia''. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002</ref> In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of [[John Gotti]] in 1986. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.\n* '''Underboss''' \u2013 The [[underboss]], usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.\n* '''Consigliere''' \u2013 The [[consigliere]] is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's \"right-hand man\". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.\n* '''Caporegime''' (or capo) \u2013 A [[caporegime]] (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10\u201320 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like [[Anthony Corallo]] they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.\n* '''Soldier''' (Soldato in Italian) \u2013 A [[Soldato|soldier]] is a member of the family, and traditionally can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.\n\n[[File:Meyer Lansky NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish associate [[Meyer Lansky]]'s (right) work with [[Lucky Luciano]] made him an important figure in developing the American Mafia.]]\n* '''Associate''' \u2013 An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters (\"connected guys\") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt [[labor union]] delegate or businessman.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\"/> Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italians like [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Murray Humphreys]], [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Gus Alex]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Frank Sheeran]], [[Gerard Ouimette]], and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Rituals and customs==\nThe [[Mafia initiation ritual]] to become a [[made man]] in the Mafia emerged from various sources, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] confraternities and [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]] in mid-19th century Sicily.<ref name=\"initiation\">\"Mafia's arcane rituals, and much of the organization's structure, were based largely on those of the Catholic confraternities and even Freemasonry, colored by Sicilian familial traditions and even certain customs associated with military-religious orders of chivalry like the Order of Malta.\" [http://www.bestofsicily.com/mafia.htm The Mafia] from [http://www.bestofsicily.com bestofsicily.com]</ref> At the initiation ceremony, the inductee would have his finger pricked with a needle by the officiating member; a few drops of blood are spilled on a card bearing the likeness of a saint; the card is set on fire; finally, while the card is passed rapidly from hand to hand to avoid burns, the novice takes an oath of loyalty to the Mafia family.

In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate [[Dutch Schultz]] was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill [[New York City]] prosecutor [[Thomas Dewey]] and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer [[Joe Petrosino]] was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily. A statue of him was later erected across the street from a Lucchese hangout.<ref>''Five Families: The Rise, Decline, and Resurgence of America's Most Powerful Mafia Empires''</ref>\n\n===Kefauver Committee===\nIn 1951, a U.S. Senate [[Select or special committee (United States Congress)|special committee]], chaired by Democratic Tennessee Senator [[Estes Kefauver]], determined that a \"sinister criminal organization\" known as the Mafia operated around the United States. The [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce]] (known as the \"Kefauver Hearings\"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the \"Top Hoodlum Program\". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Using Intel to Stop the Mob, Pt. 2 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=1963-10-01 |accessdate=2011-01-26

The organization's name is derived from the original ''Mafia'' or ''Cosa nostra'', the [[Sicilian Mafia]], with \"American Mafia\" originally referring simply to Mafia groups from Sicily operating in America, as the organization originally emerged as an offshoot of the Sicilian Mafia; however, the organization eventually encompassed or absorbed other Italian-American [[gangster]]s and Italian crime groups (such as the [[Camorra in New York|American Camorra]]) living in the United States and Canada that were not of [[Sicily|Sicilian]] origin. It is often colloquially referred to as the '''Italian Mafia''' or '''Italian Mob''', though these terms may also apply to the separate yet related Sicilian Mafia or other [[Organized crime in Italy|organized crime groups in Italy]].\n\nThe Mafia in the United States emerged in impoverished [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrant]] [[Little Italy|neighborhoods or ghettos]] in New York's [[East Harlem]] (or [[Italian Harlem]]), the [[Lower East Side]], and [[Brooklyn]]. It also emerged in other areas of the [[East Coast of the United States]] and several other major metropolitan areas (such as [[New Orleans]]<ref>{{cite book|author=Mike Dash|author-link=Mike Dash|year=2009|title=First Family|url=https://archive.org/details/firstfamilyterro00dash|url-access=registration}}</ref> and [[Chicago]]) during the late 19th century and early 20th century, following waves of Italian immigration especially from [[Sicily]] and other regions of [[Southern Italy]]. It has its roots in the Sicilian Mafia but is a separate organization in the United States. [[Campania|Neapolitan]], [[Calabria]]n, and other Italian criminal groups in the U.S., as well as independent Italian-American criminals, eventually merged with Sicilian Mafiosi to create the modern pan-Italian Mafia in North America. Today, the American Mafia cooperates in various criminal activities with [[Italian organized crime]] groups, such as the Sicilian Mafia, the [[Camorra]] of [[Naples]], and the [['Ndrangheta]] of [[Calabria]]. The most important unit of the American Mafia is that of a \"[[Crime family|family,]]\" as the various criminal organizations that make up the Mafia are known.

In reference to a man, ''mafiusu'' (''mafioso'' in Italian) in 19th century [[Sicily]] signified \"fearless\", \"enterprising\", and \"proud\", according to scholar [[Diego Gambetta]].<ref name=\"mafiusu\">This etymology is based on the books ''Che cosa \u00e8 la mafia?'' by [[Gaetano Mosca]], ''Mafioso'' by Gaia Servadio, ''The Sicilian Mafia'' by Diego Gambetta, ''Mafia & Mafiosi'' by Henner Hess, and ''Cosa Nostra'' by John Dickie (see [[#Books|Books]] below).</ref> In reference to a woman, however, the feminine-form adjective ''mafiusa'' means 'beautiful' or 'attractive'.\n\n==History==\n\n===Origins: The Black Hand===\n{{Main|Black Hand (extortion)}}\n[[File:Paul Kelly-2.jpg|thumb|Paolo Antonio Vaccarelli (also known as [[Paul Kelly (criminal)|Paul Kelly]]), founder of the [[Five Points Gang]]]]\nThe first published account of what became the Mafia in the United States dates to the spring of 1869.

The Black Hand was a name given to an [[extortion]] method used in Italian neighborhoods at the turn of the 20th century. It has been sometimes mistaken for the Mafia itself, which it is not. The Black Hand was a criminal society, but there were many small Black Hand gangs. Black Hand extortion was often (wrongly) viewed as the activity of a single organization because Black Hand criminals in Italian communities throughout the United States used the same methods of extortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sagepub.com/lippmanstudy/articles/Lombardo.pdf |title=Sagepub.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-21}}</ref>\n\n[[Giuseppe Morello]] was the first known Mafia member to immigrate to the United States.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He and six other Sicilians fled to New York after murdering eleven wealthy landowners, and the chancellor and a vice chancellor of a Sicilian province.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> He was arrested in [[New Orleans]] in 1881 and extradited to Italy.<ref name=\"FBI\"/>\n\nNew Orleans was also the site of the first possible Mafia incident in the United States that received both national and international attention.<ref name=\"FBI\"/> On October 15, 1890, New Orleans Police Superintendent [[David Hennessy]] was murdered execution-style.

Despite these bans, there was still a very high demand for it from the public. This created an atmosphere that tolerated crime as a means to provide liquor to the public, even among the police and city politicians.

They created schemes to keep the money that they owed in taxes after the sale of millions of dollars' worth of wholesale petroleum. This allowed them to sell more gasoline at even lower prices. [[Michael Franzese]], also known as the Yuppie Don, ran and organized a gas scandal and stole over $290 million in gasoline taxes by evading the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) and shutting down the gas station before government officials could make him pay what he owed.

This tactic helped them grow in power and influence in many cities with big labor unions such as New York, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit and many others. Many members of the Mafia were enlisted in unions and even became union executives. [[La Cosa Nostra]] was a Mafia group that rose to [[economic power]] through their heavy involvement in unions.

A large concentration of Mafia owned restaurants were in New York City. Not only were they the setting of many killings and important meetings, but they were also an effective means of smuggling of drugs and other illegal goods.

In 1969, the Nevada State Legislature passed a law that made it easier for corporations to own casinos. This brought new investors to the local economy to buy casinos from the Mafia. The U.S. Congress passed the [[RICO Act]] a year later. This law gave more authority to law enforcement to pursue the Mafia for its illegal activities. There was a sharp decline in the mob involvement in Las Vegas in the 1980s. Through the RICO law, many in the Mafia were convicted and imprisoned.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/nevada-150/siegel-spilotro-mafia-influenced-gambling-regulation-las-vegas|title=From Siegel to Spilotro, Mafia influenced gambling, regulation in Las Vegas|last=REVIEW-JOURNAL|first=JEFF GERMAN LAS VEGAS|date=2014-03-09|website=Las Vegas Review-Journal|access-date=2016-06-23}}</ref>\n\n===RICO Act===\n[[File:Sammy Gravano (arrest photo - 1990).jpg|thumb|[[Sammy Gravano]]]]\n\nWhen the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO Act) became federal law in 1970, it became a highly effective tool in prosecuting mobsters.

While similar to its Sicilian origins, the American Mafia's modern organizational structure was created by Salvatore Maranzano in 1931. He created the [[Five Families]], each of which would have a [[crime boss|boss]], [[underboss]], [[caporegime|capos]], [[soldato|soldiers]], and associates, would be composed of only full-blooded Italian Americans, while associates could come from any background.<ref name=\"A Chronicle of Bloodletting\">{{cite news|title=A Chronicle of Bloodletting|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,902999-1,00.html|accessdate=31 October 2012|newspaper=[[Time Magazine]]|date=July 12, 1971}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Dash|first=Mike|title=The First Family: Terror, Extortion, Revenge, Murder, and the Birth of the American Mafia|year=2010|publisher=Ballantine Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0345523570|pages=384\u2013386}}</ref><ref name=\"FiveFamilies\"/> All inducted members of the Mafia are called [[Made man|\"made\" men]]. This signifies that they are untouchable in the criminal underworld and any harm brought to them will be met with retaliation. With the exception of associates, all mobsters are \"made\" official members of a crime family. The three highest positions make up the administration. Below the administration, there are factions each headed by a ''caporegime'' (captain), who lead a crew of soldiers and associates. They report to the administration and can be seen as equivalent to managers in a business. When a boss makes a decision, he rarely issues orders directly to workers who would carry it out, but instead passed instructions down through the [[chain of command]]. This way, the higher levels of the organization are insulated from law enforcement attention if the lower level members who actually commit the crime should be captured or investigated, providing [[plausible deniability]].\n\nThere are occasionally other positions in the family leadership. Frequently, ruling panels have been set up when a boss goes to jail to divide the responsibility of the family (these usually consist of three or five members). This also helps divert police attention from any one member. The family messenger and street boss were positions created by former Genovese family leader [[Vincent Gigante]].\n* '''Boss''' \u2013 The [[Crime boss|boss]] is the head of the family, usually reigning as a dictator, sometimes called the Don or \"Godfather\". The boss receives a cut of every operation. Operations are taken on by every member of the family and of the region's occupying family.<ref>Abadinsky, Howard. Organized Crime. 7th ed. Belmont, California: Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, 2003.</ref> Depending on the family, the boss may be chosen by a vote from the caporegimes of the family. In the event of a tie, the underboss must vote. In the past, all the members of a family voted on the boss, but by the late 1950s, any gathering such as that usually attracted too much attention.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\">Capeci, Jerry. ''The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Mafia''. Indianapolis: Alpha Books, 2002</ref> In practice, many of these elections are seen as having an inevitable result, such as that of [[John Gotti]] in 1986. According to [[Sammy Gravano]], a meeting was held in a basement during which all capos were searched and Gotti's men stood ominously behind them. Gotti was then proclaimed boss.\n* '''Underboss''' \u2013 The [[underboss]], usually appointed by the boss, is the second in command of the family. The underboss often runs the day-to-day responsibilities of the family or oversees its most lucrative rackets. He usually gets a percentage of the family's income from the boss's cut. The underboss is usually first in line to become acting boss if the boss is imprisoned, and is also frequently seen as a logical successor.\n* '''Consigliere''' \u2013 The [[consigliere]] is an advisor to the family and sometimes seen as the boss's \"right-hand man\". He is used as a mediator of disputes and often acts as a representative or aide for the family in meetings with other families, rival criminal organizations, and important business associates. In practice, the consigliere is normally the third ranking member of the administration of a family and was traditionally a senior member carrying the utmost respect of the family and deeply familiar with the inner-workings of the organization. A boss will often appoint a trusted close friend or personal advisor as his official consigliere.\n* '''Caporegime''' (or capo) \u2013 A [[caporegime]] (also captain or skipper) is in charge of a crew, a group of soldiers who report directly to him. Each crew usually contains 10\u201320 soldiers and many more associates. A capo is appointed by the boss and reports to him or the underboss. A captain gives a percentage of his (and his underlings') earnings to the boss and is also responsible for any tasks assigned, including murder. In labor racketeering, it is usually a capo who controls the infiltration of union locals. If a capo becomes powerful enough, he can sometimes wield more power than some of his superiors. In cases like [[Anthony Corallo]] they might even bypass the normal Mafia structure and lead the family when the boss dies.\n* '''Soldier''' (Soldato in Italian) \u2013 A [[Soldato|soldier]] is a member of the family, and traditionally can only be of full Italian background (although today many families require men to be of only half Italian descent, on their father's side). Once a member is made he is untouchable, meaning permission from a soldier's boss must be given before he is murdered. When the books are open, meaning that a family is accepting new members, a made man may recommend an up-and-coming associate to be a new soldier. Soldiers are the main workers of the family, usually committing crimes like assault, murder, extortion, intimidation, etc. In return, they are given profitable rackets to run by their superiors and have full access to their family's connections and power.\n\n[[File:Meyer Lansky NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|Jewish associate [[Meyer Lansky]]'s (right) work with [[Lucky Luciano]] made him an important figure in developing the American Mafia.]]\n* '''Associate''' \u2013 An associate is not a member of the Mafia, but works for a crime family nonetheless. Associates can include a wide range of people who work for the family. An associate can have a wide range of duties from virtually carrying out the same duties as a soldier to being a simple errand boy. This is where prospective mobsters (\"connected guys\") start out to prove their worth. Once a crime family is accepting new members, the best associates are evaluated and picked to become soldiers. An associate can also be a criminal who serves as a go-between or sometimes deals in drugs to keep police attention off the actual members, or they can be people the family does business with (restaurant owners, etc.) In other cases, an associate might be a corrupt [[labor union]] delegate or businessman.<ref name=\"Capeci, Jerry Alpha Books, 2002\"/> Non-Italians will never go any further than this, although many non-Italians like [[Meyer Lansky]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], [[Murray Humphreys]], [[Mickey Cohen]], [[Gus Alex]], [[Bumpy Johnson]], [[Frank Sheeran]], [[Gerard Ouimette]], and [[James Burke (gangster)|James Burke]] wielded extreme power within their respective crime families and carried the respect of actual Mafia members. {{citation needed|date=September 2017}}\n\n==Rituals and customs==\nThe [[Mafia initiation ritual]] to become a [[made man]] in the Mafia emerged from various sources, such as [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] confraternities and [[Freemasonry|Masonic Lodges]] in mid-19th century Sicily.<ref name=\"initiation\">\"Mafia's arcane rituals, and much of the organization's structure, were based largely on those of the Catholic confraternities and even Freemasonry, colored by Sicilian familial traditions and even certain customs associated with military-religious orders of chivalry like the Order of Malta.\" [http://www.bestofsicily.com/mafia.htm The Mafia] from [http://www.bestofsicily.com bestofsicily.com]</ref> At the initiation ceremony, the inductee would have his finger pricked with a needle by the officiating member; a few drops of blood are spilled on a card bearing the likeness of a saint; the card is set on fire; finally, while the card is passed rapidly from hand to hand to avoid burns, the novice takes an oath of loyalty to the Mafia family.

In some rare strict cases, conspiring to commit such a murder is punishable by death. Jewish mobster and Mafia associate [[Dutch Schultz]] was reportedly killed by his Italian peers out of fear that he would carry out a plan to kill [[New York City]] prosecutor [[Thomas Dewey]] and thus bring unprecedented police attention to the Mafia. However, the Mafia has carried out hits on law enforcement, especially in its earlier history. New York police officer [[Joe Petrosino]] was shot by Sicilian mobsters while on duty in Sicily.

The [[United States Senate Special Committee to Investigate Crime in Interstate Commerce]] (known as the \"Kefauver Hearings\"), televised nationwide, captured the attention of the American people and forced the FBI to recognize the existence of organized crime. In 1953, the FBI initiated the \"Top Hoodlum Program\". The purpose of the program was to have agents collect information on the mobsters in their territories and report it regularly to Washington to maintain a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fbi.gov/page2/august07/mobintel080907.htm |title=FBI \u2014 Using Intel to Stop the Mob, Pt. 2 |publisher=Fbi.gov |date=1963-10-01 |accessdate=2011-01-26

{"title_page": "AberFest", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2015}}\n'''AberFest''' is a Celtic cultural festival celebrating all things Cornish and Breton that takes place every second year in Cornwall, UK, around Easter. The AberFest Festival alternates with the Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival which is held in [[Brandivy]] or [[Bignan]] in [[Brittany]], alternating between those two Breton locations.\n\nBoth festivals are unusual in that the main focus of the events is on families and individuals from one country staying with families and individuals from the other, against a wide background of cultural activities.\n\nAn AberFest was last held at Easter 2016. The next AberFest will be 31 March to 2 April 2018.\n\n== Background ==\n[[Cornwall]] and [[Brittany]] have [[Celt]]ic links going back centuries and have closely related [[Celtic languages]] and many other traditions that are practised in both countries. Both AberFest and the Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival celebrate these cultures in their traditional and more recent forms.\n\n5th\u20137th centuries saw a mass emigration of Cornish people to \"Armorica.\"  These people were to become the Breton people of modern Brittany. Their language was the [[Brythonic languages|Brythonic]] Celtic language that was to become [[Breton language]] (Brezhoneg) in Brittany, the Cornish language ([[Kernewek]]) in Cornwall and the Welsh language ([[Cymraeg]]) in Wales. Although they are separate languages today they remain closely related.\n\nThroughout the centuries since the first emigrations, there have been continued links and movements of people, up to and including the [[World War II|Second World War]], when small numbers of Breton people escaped German-occupied Brittany to live in Cornwall.\n\nWhile the practical working lives of ordinary fishermen were a common sight in ports in both Cornwall and Brittany in the 1960s and later, other links have gone through periods of popularity, including [[Cornish wrestling|Cornish]] and Breton wrestling. This saw regular exchange competitions in the inter war years and sporadic interest ever since.\n\n== The modern era ==\nThe late 1970s and 1980s saw a great deal of interest in Inter Celtic organisations and activities. The International [[Celtic Congress]] had been very active in the Celtic world through much of the 20th Century, but saw a new  enthusiasm in Cornwall as the \"Cornish movement\" looked to other Celtic countries for support and ideas in facing the decline in cultural self-confidence that was very evident at that time. Around the same time the Pan Celtic Festivals had led to the establishment of an independent Inter Celtic festival, \"Lowender Peran\"  in Perranporth, Cornwall each October.\n\nAs visitors to this Festival, Katrine Pasco and her husband Patrick Lorho, travelled to Cornwall and made friends with a wide number of people with loose involvement with the Cornish movement including Ron Williams (Ronnie) from Falmouth. After several years of visiting Lowender Peran and strengthening links, Pasco and Lorho, organised the first \"Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival\" in 1987 (Breizh being Breton for Brittany and Kernow being Cornish for Cornwall) in [[Brandivy]], in the [[Morbihan]] region of Brittany.\n\n== Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival ==\nThe Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival was started with the intention of it being at the Breton part of a Festival alternating between Brittany and Cornwall. The Breizh \u2013 Kernow festival was then held most years in Brandivy and later included Bignan. This one sided arrangement persisted until 2002.\n\nThe main reason that the festival was not held in Cornwall was that there was a community of like minded people in more or less one geographical location in Brandivy. In Cornwall the links were less involved with a location and more to do with individuals that were spread geographically across Cornwall without a clear location that could be realistically identified as suitable location, nor was there anyone willing to take on the task without such a generally accepted suitable location.\n\n== Ron Williams ==\n[[File:Cornish pasty.jpeg|thumb|A Cornish pasty]]\nRon Williams had been a very active individual with many voluntary organisations in Falmouth ( a founder of the Falmouth Youth Club,) and throughout Cornwall and was widely known and respected.\n\nFrom 1987 onwards, the friendship between Williams and  Pasco, Lorho and their increasing family grew stronger with Williams spending more and more time in his retirement, living with Castel Guen, Brandivy. He also became  an increasingly well known  and popular figure in Brandivy itself.\n\n== Ronnie Fest ==\nRon Williams died on 7 December 2001.\n\nAs a memorial, in particular for Bretons the \"Ronnie Fest\" took place in Falmouth at Easter 2002. Supported by groups such as Cornish dance team \"Ros Keltek\" the day filled the weekend.\n\nThis was a day of celebration of Ron's life and included organisations and groups with which Ron had worked, in some cases for 40\u201350 years. Due to the good will towards Ron Williams, in the Falmouth venues, and time were given for free. This included the Easter Sunday afternoon at the Royal Polytechniic Society, and the British Legion Club on the Easter Sunday evening 31 March 2002.\n\n== The first AberFest ==\nAfter a return to Brittany at Easter 2003, the Festival returned to Cornwall as \"AberFest\u201904\" and again in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 as AberFest\u201906, AberFest'08, AberFest'10, AberFest'12 and AberFest'14.\n\n== Festival philosophy ==\nCentral to the aims of both Breizh \u2013 Kernow and AberFest Festivals is the arrangement whereby individuals and families are hosted  by  families from the respective countries. People visiting the festival from one Celtic country stay with families from the host Celtic country.\n\nWhile there are public events that form the \"public\" side of the festivals, it is hosting and being hosted with families that is the core of the success of both the festivals. Through this arrangement, lifelong friendships have developed outside the confines of either festival.\n\nThe personal friendships between individuals and families form a strength and commitment to the relationship between the two festivals. The importance of the personal relationships has not been understood by some who have seen the more public events as of the prime importance and have mistakenly viewed the way to strengthening the festivals, and AberFest in particular, through greater commercialisation of the events.\n\nToday the basic philosophy continues that performers are not paid and perform for free, putting performers on an equal footing and providing a platform for new and in particular younger performers.\n\nA significant contrast between the two festivals is a reflection on the Cultural strengths within both countries. While Breton culture in Brittany is well established, accepted as part of their regional identity and is not under exceptional pressures within the French State, the situation within Cornwall remains different.\n\nThe burgeoning cultural revival within Cornwall now enjoys a greater confidence than in the 1970s or 1980s but it is not universally recognised or accepted, often remaining opaque to those outside the movement.\n\n== AberFest Festival format ==\nAlthough AberFest is a relatively new event, it has established a general event Format:-\n\nGood Friday     Breton guests arrive at suitable Rendezvous via the Roscoff \u2013 Plymouth Ferry, by car and bus, in the late evening. They meet their hosts and travel to their homes. A welcoming event includes music by the groups involved in the festival.\n\nEaster Saturday\tFree Public performances and processions through Falmouth. A combined dance/concert event featuring Breton Fest Noz and Cornish Ceili, known as the AberFest-Noz takes place in the evening.\n\nEaster Sunday\tMorning and lunch with host families followed by a public event at a particular location in West/mid Cornwall. ( previous locations have included Godolphin House and St. Michael's Mount. )  Workshops in various cultural activities ( these were held on the Saturday in previous years)\n\nEaster Monday: known as Rons Day: morning with families. Afternoon group event. Evening, Group party and Miracle.\n\n== Bryl and Bryl Byghan ==\n\nThe icon used for the festival is that of a Mackerel. This has been embodied in various large \"mascot\" mackerel that have become part of the festival in their own right. Mackerel are fish common to the coasts of both Cornwall and Brittany. The word ''mackerel'' also has certain sexual connotations in both cultures.\n\nAt the end of each Festival a mackerel known as \"Bryl Byghan\" (Cornish for \"small mackerel\") is \"born\" in a ceremony called \"The Miracle.\" Bryl Byghan is about 2 feet (70&nbsp;cm) long. After the end of the festival, Bryl Byghan is taken back to Brittany and is passed from family to family during the following year. The following Easter,( approximately 12 months after the Miracle) the festival is held in Brittany. At the end of the Breizh-Kernow festival, Bryl Byghan returns to spend most of the next year circulating with families in Cornwall.\n\nAbout 2 weeks before the following AberFest, Bryl Byghan drops out of sight to reappear at the start of AberFest as Bryl (Cornish for \"mackerel\") The \"grown up\" mascot mackerel is about 4 foot (1.5&nbsp;m) long and becomes the focus of the festival, passing from person to person and it is taken to all events. Bryl is also used as a flag to identify where AberFest host families are during the Festival. In more recent AberFests Byl's appearance has been greeted by the singing of \"you are my mackerel\" to the tune of [[you are my sunshine]].\n\nAs the festival draws to a close, Bryl \"dies\" in a special \"funeral\" (Mort de Bryl) As the festival ends, the \"dead\" Bryl is given to a Breton, selected by previous \"dead\" Bryl receiving Bretons, who are known as \"The Guardians of Bryl.\" The Guardians of Bryl are also responsible for Bryl's well being during the festival.\nThe Bryl \"funeral\" ends with the \"miracle\" of a \"new\" Bryl Byghan being \"born\" to be passed to the Breton families for the next cycle of festivals in Brittany and Cornwall.\n\nBryl Byghan's adventures with families in Brittany and Cornwall have become events in their own right. Bryl Byghan has become a Facebook member with his own Facebook profile and friends. Regular updates and photographs are posted during the year between festivals.\n\nThe success of Bryl and Bryl Byghan has led to the Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival in Brittany adopting a \"Cock\" as their \"mascot.\" So far the Cock's adventures remain in Bryl Byghan's shadow. Rumours of a Bryl / Cock offspring have led to the anticipation of events in 2011 at the next Breizh \u2013 Kernow festival in Brittany.\n\n==Cornish and Breton cultural activities==\nCornish and Breton cultural activities and workshops in previous AberFest festivals have included:-\nDance\nMusic\nSinging, ( individual, group and Choir)\nWrestling\t( Breton Gouwren and Cornish Wrestling )\nBombard and Pipes (Bagpipes)\nCooking and \nLanguage\t( Brezhoneg and Kernewek)\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Cornwall}}\n*[[List of topics related to Cornwall]]\n*[[Cornish language]]\n*[[Cornish people]]\n*[[List of Cornish people]]\n*[[Cornish Assembly]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/2141794.Celtic festival enjoyed by all/ Celtic festival enjoyed by all \u2013 Falmouth Packet Newspapers 24 March 2008 ]\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/711494.Ambitious_events_for_festival/   Ambitious events for festival \u2013 Falmouth Packet Newspapers 22 March 2006]\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/707126.Bretons_to_be_welcomed_in_Cornwall/  Bretons to be welcomed in Cornwall Falmouth Packet Newspapers 15 March 2006]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aberfest.org/ AberFest official website]\n*[http://www.cornwallinformation.co.uk/daily-pics/march/26th-march.html photos of Aberfest'08]\n{{Culture of Cornwall}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aberfest}}\n[[Category:Festivals in Cornwall|*]]\n[[Category:Celtic festivals]]\n[[Category:Cornish festivals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2015}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2015}}\n'''AberFest''' is a Celtic cultural festival celebrating all things Cornish and Breton that takes place every second year in Cornwall, UK, around Easter.

This included the Easter Sunday afternoon at the Royal Polytechniic Society, and the British Legion Club on the Easter Sunday evening 31 March 2002.\n\n== The first AberFest ==\nAfter a return to Brittany at Easter 2003, the Festival returned to Cornwall as \"AberFest\u201904\" and again in 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 as AberFest\u201906, AberFest'08, AberFest'10, AberFest'12 and AberFest'14.\n\n== Festival philosophy ==\nCentral to the aims of both Breizh \u2013 Kernow and AberFest Festivals is the arrangement whereby individuals and families are hosted  by  families from the respective countries. People visiting the festival from one Celtic country stay with families from the host Celtic country.\n\nWhile there are public events that form the \"public\" side of the festivals, it is hosting and being hosted with families that is the core of the success of both the festivals. Through this arrangement, lifelong friendships have developed outside the confines of either festival.\n\nThe personal friendships between individuals and families form a strength and commitment to the relationship between the two festivals. The importance of the personal relationships has not been understood by some who have seen the more public events as of the prime importance and have mistakenly viewed the way to strengthening the festivals, and AberFest in particular, through greater commercialisation of the events.\n\nToday the basic philosophy continues that performers are not paid and perform for free, putting performers on an equal footing and providing a platform for new and in particular younger performers.\n\nA significant contrast between the two festivals is a reflection on the Cultural strengths within both countries. While Breton culture in Brittany is well established, accepted as part of their regional identity and is not under exceptional pressures within the French State, the situation within Cornwall remains different.\n\nThe burgeoning cultural revival within Cornwall now enjoys a greater confidence than in the 1970s or 1980s but it is not universally recognised or accepted, often remaining opaque to those outside the movement.\n\n== AberFest Festival format ==\nAlthough AberFest is a relatively new event, it has established a general event Format:-\n\nGood Friday     Breton guests arrive at suitable Rendezvous via the Roscoff \u2013 Plymouth Ferry, by car and bus, in the late evening. They meet their hosts and travel to their homes. A welcoming event includes music by the groups involved in the festival.\n\nEaster Saturday\tFree Public performances and processions through Falmouth. A combined dance/concert event featuring Breton Fest Noz and Cornish Ceili, known as the AberFest-Noz takes place in the evening.\n\nEaster Sunday\tMorning and lunch with host families followed by a public event at a particular location in West/mid Cornwall. ( previous locations have included Godolphin House and St. Michael's Mount. )  Workshops in various cultural activities ( these were held on the Saturday in previous years)\n\nEaster Monday: known as Rons Day: morning with families. Afternoon group event. Evening, Group party and Miracle.\n\n== Bryl and Bryl Byghan ==\n\nThe icon used for the festival is that of a Mackerel. This has been embodied in various large \"mascot\" mackerel that have become part of the festival in their own right. Mackerel are fish common to the coasts of both Cornwall and Brittany. The word ''mackerel'' also has certain sexual connotations in both cultures.\n\nAt the end of each Festival a mackerel known as \"Bryl Byghan\" (Cornish for \"small mackerel\") is \"born\" in a ceremony called \"The Miracle.\" Bryl Byghan is about 2 feet (70&nbsp;cm) long. After the end of the festival, Bryl Byghan is taken back to Brittany and is passed from family to family during the following year. The following Easter,( approximately 12 months after the Miracle) the festival is held in Brittany. At the end of the Breizh-Kernow festival, Bryl Byghan returns to spend most of the next year circulating with families in Cornwall.\n\nAbout 2 weeks before the following AberFest, Bryl Byghan drops out of sight to reappear at the start of AberFest as Bryl (Cornish for \"mackerel\") The \"grown up\" mascot mackerel is about 4 foot (1.5&nbsp;m) long and becomes the focus of the festival, passing from person to person and it is taken to all events. Bryl is also used as a flag to identify where AberFest host families are during the Festival. In more recent AberFests Byl's appearance has been greeted by the singing of \"you are my mackerel\" to the tune of [[you are my sunshine]].\n\nAs the festival draws to a close, Bryl \"dies\" in a special \"funeral\" (Mort de Bryl) As the festival ends, the \"dead\" Bryl is given to a Breton, selected by previous \"dead\" Bryl receiving Bretons, who are known as \"The Guardians of Bryl.\" The Guardians of Bryl are also responsible for Bryl's well being during the festival.\nThe Bryl \"funeral\" ends with the \"miracle\" of a \"new\" Bryl Byghan being \"born\" to be passed to the Breton families for the next cycle of festivals in Brittany and Cornwall.\n\nBryl Byghan's adventures with families in Brittany and Cornwall have become events in their own right. Bryl Byghan has become a Facebook member with his own Facebook profile and friends. Regular updates and photographs are posted during the year between festivals.\n\nThe success of Bryl and Bryl Byghan has led to the Breizh \u2013 Kernow Festival in Brittany adopting a \"Cock\" as their \"mascot.\" So far the Cock's adventures remain in Bryl Byghan's shadow. Rumours of a Bryl / Cock offspring have led to the anticipation of events in 2011 at the next Breizh \u2013 Kernow festival in Brittany.\n\n==Cornish and Breton cultural activities==\nCornish and Breton cultural activities and workshops in previous AberFest festivals have included:-\nDance\nMusic\nSinging, ( individual, group and Choir)\nWrestling\t( Breton Gouwren and Cornish Wrestling )\nBombard and Pipes (Bagpipes)\nCooking and \nLanguage\t( Brezhoneg and Kernewek)\n\n==See also==\n*[[Portal:Cornwall|The Wikipedia Cornwall Portal]]\n*[[List of topics related to Cornwall]]\n*[[Cornish language]]\n*[[Cornish people]]\n*[[List of Cornish people]]\n*[[Cornish Assembly]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/2141794.Celtic festival enjoyed by all/ Celtic festival enjoyed by all \u2013 Falmouth Packet Newspapers 24 March 2008 ]\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/711494.Ambitious_events_for_festival/   Ambitious events for festival \u2013 Falmouth Packet Newspapers 22 March 2006]\n* [http://www.thisisthewestcountry.co.uk/search/707126.Bretons_to_be_welcomed_in_Cornwall/  Bretons to be welcomed in Cornwall Falmouth Packet Newspapers 15 March 2006]\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.aberfest.org/ AberFest official website]\n*[http://www.cornwallinformation.co.uk/daily-pics/march/26th-march.html photos of Aberfest'08]\n{{Culture of Cornwall}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Aberfest}}\n[[Category:Festivals in Cornwall|*]]\n[[Category:Celtic festivals]]\n[[Category:Cornish festivals]]\n", "name_user": "Gazamp", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSee also:AddedPortal:Cornwall", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AberFest"}
