A second version describes Henri claiming that his uncle was [[Joachim Murat]]. Forced to leave France by the Bourbon kings, Henri escaped to Germany, and found employment at Katrina's father's estate. After Henri and Katrina married, they sailed for the U.S. in 1848.{{sfn|Fetter|2004|p=39-42}} \n* Talbot (1896) states that \"Catherine\" married Hienrich, Count Murat in 1846.{{sfn|Talbot|1896|p=250}}\n* Summers (2011) recounts from a 1901 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article that she married Count Henri Murat in 1848, that he was a great nephew of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], and that they came to the U.S. in 1852.<ref name=\"Summers2011\" />\n\n==Countess Murat==\nShortly after their marriage, Count and Countess Murat honeymooned in Europe, and while there, purchased a red [[merino]] [[petticoat]].{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1917|p=82-83}} Joining the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]], the Murats settled in [[Montana City, Colorado]] (or [[Aurora, Colorado]]) in 1848. The mining camps of [[California]], [[Montana]], and [[Nevada]] were visited by the party of which she and her husband were members during those days when the gold fever was an epidemic, and when the vaguest rumors sufficed to draw the entire population of one camp to another, however distant. The journeys were usually made in \"prairie schooners\" drawn by oxen.{{sfn|Talbot|1896|p=250}}\n\nDuring an interval of two years, the Murats visited Europe, the trip being made overland from Colorado to [[New Orleans]], thence to [[Le Havre]] via [[New York City]]. In 1858, they returned to Colorado,{{sfn|Talbot|1896|p=250}} and the following year, with a partner named David Smoke, they became proprietors of the Eldorado Hotel in [[Auraria, Denver]], selling the business after three months. They then moved to the Denver side of [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]] where they made a living operating a bakery, a barbershop, and a laundry.{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1917|p=82-83}} His occupations were barber, dentist, gambler, and innkeeper.<ref name=\"Summers2011\" /> \n\nMurat received a commission to make the first American flag for Colorado, which flew from the Eldorado's 50-foot flagpole on May 1, 1859, and was stolen after four days.<ref name=\"Summers2011\" /> The Murats left for [[California]] on horseback, but returned to Denver with more than {{USD|50000}} in a [[stagecoach]]. They bought a saloon, Criterion Hall, but left Colorado again in 1863 for [[Virginia City, Nevada]], where they established the Continental Restaurant. There were other trips to Europe and California before, in later years, settling in [[Palmer Lake, Colorado]]. Their financial resources declined after 1876, and she divorced Henri in 1881. Drinking heavily, he died broke,{{sfn|Fetter|2004|p=39-42}} in the County Hospital in Denver.{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1917|p=82-83}}\n\n==Later years, death, legacy==\nCountess Murat, as she was known in the pioneer days of Colorado, dependent upon herself, became a washerwoman and took in summer boarders. With her own earnings, she built a little, white frame cottage at Palmer Lake's Glen Park,{{sfn|Talbot|1896|p=250}} which was her last home.{{sfn|Daughters of the American Revolution|1917|p=82-83}} She received a pension of {{USD|10}} per month from the Pioneer Ladies Aid Society,<ref name=\"Summers2011\" /> in her last nineteen years.{{sfn|Fetter|2004|p=39-42}} By 1900, he was known to have developed [[rheumatism]] and [[erysipelas]].

Wapolah aided in sewing the stripes, while Murat arranged the placing of the stars. The significance of the flag was grasped only partially by Wapolah. She thought it applied more to the [[POTUS|President]] than to the country, for she often said, while regarding it: \"for the great Father at [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]].\" Later, Wapolah heeded the call of her own people, returned to the Dakotahs, and was lost sight of. A pole was brought from the foothills and the flag raised by means of rope and pulley, amidst a throng of spectators.
