The network operates across the Philippine archipelago through the [[ABS-CBN Regional]] division which controls 80 television stations.<ref name=\"ABS-CBN\"/><ref>{{cite press release|last=Cerrado|first=Aldrin|url=http://www.pse.com.ph/resource/corpt/2013/ABS_A17A_Dec2012_1.pdf|title=ABS-CBN Corporation Amended 2012 SEC Form 17-A|date=June 5, 2013|work=Philippine Stock Exchange}}</ref> Its programs are also available outside the Philippines through the global subscription television channel [[The Filipino Channel]] (TFC) which is now available in over three million paying households worldwide as well as terrestrially in [[Guam]] through [[KEQI-LP]]. Since 2011, the network is on test broadcast for [[digital terrestrial television]] using the Japanese standard [[ISDB-T]] in select areas in the Philippines. On October 3, 2015, ABS-CBN started to broadcast in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] through its affiliate direct-to-home cable and satellite television providers.\n\n==History==\nABS-CBN traces its history to the first Philippine television station [[DZAQ-TV]], owned by Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC) which was later renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).\n\nJames Lindenberg, the owner of BEC, was the first to apply for a license to the [[Philippine Congress]] to establish a television station in 1949. His request was granted on June 14, 1950, under Republic Act No. 511. Because of the strict import controls and the lack of raw materials needed to open a TV station in the Philippines during the mid-20th century, Lindenberg branched to radio broadcasting instead.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|last=Anastacio|first=Ellen Joy|last2=Badiola|first2=Janine Natalie|title=The History of Philippine Television|url=http://pinoytv.blogspot.com/|publisher=UP-CMC Broadcast Department|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJudge Antonio Quirino, brother of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]], also tried to apply for a license to Congress, but was denied. He later purchased stocks from BEC and subsequently consummated the controlling stock to rename the company from BEC to Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).\n\nDZAQ-TV began commercial television operations on October 23, 1953; the first fully licensed commercial television station in the Philippines. The first program to air was a garden party at the Quirino residence in Sitio Alto, San Juan. After the premiere telecast, the station followed a four-hour-a-day schedule, from six to ten in the evening.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1955, ''[[Manila Chronicle]]'' owner [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.]] and former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Fernando Lopez]], acquired a radio-TV franchise from the [[Philippine Congress|Congress]] and immediately established Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1956, which initially focused only on radio broadcasting. On February 24, 1957, Lopez invited Judge Quirino to his house for breakfast and ABS was bought under a contract written on a table napkin. The corporate name was reverted to Bolinao Electronics Corporation immediately after the purchase of ABS.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nWith the establishment of DZXL-TV 9 of CBN in April 19 (or July<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tkRaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2897%2C15772132</ref>), 1958,<ref name=\"history\"/> the Lopez brothers controlled both television channels in the archipelago, culminating in the first wave of expansion. The monopoly in television was broken in 1960, when [[DZTV-TV|DZTV-TV 13]] was established by the Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]) (IBC), owned by Dick Baldwin. In 1961, BEC launched [[DYCB-TV|the nation's first regional and provincial television station]] in [[Cebu City]].<ref name=\"history\"/> In the same year, BEC merged ABS and CBN to form the ABS-CBN network, a brand name that would become official in a few years.\n\nIn 1966, ABS-CBN became the first TV network to broadcast certain shows in color by using the American [[NTSC]] standard and by December 18, 1968, ABS-CBN opened its present-day Broadcast Center complex in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City, moving from its Roxas Boulevard studios that was opened in 1958. It was among the most advanced broadcasting facility of its kind in Asia. Full-color broadcasts began in 1971 (8 hours a day) on ABS-CBN 2 with the availability of more color television sets around Manila and neighboring municipalities and cities.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1967, the company was renamed ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. This company became the formal merger of the two stations DZAQ-TV 3 (ABS) and DZXL-TV 9 (CBN).\n\nIn 1969, DZAQ-TV transferred to channel 2 (which remains as the current positioning frequency of the flagship station in Metro Manila), while its sister station DZXL-TV transferred to channel 4. This frequency adjustment was done to make room for Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now [[Radio Philippines Network]]) to occupy the channel 9 frequency. ABS-CBN also sold its headquarters and studios in Roxas Boulevard to KBS.\n\n[[File:Abscbn broadcast center.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in Diliman, [[Quezon City]], the headquarters of ABS-CBN]]\nWhen then-[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared]] [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law]] in 1972, the station was forced, along with its regional stations and other television networks to shut down, with the company was seized from the Lopez brothers. Its newly built headquarters was renamed as the \"Broadcast Plaza\", and it became the home of the three TV stations that were controlled by the [[Marcos regime]]. The first TV station that took over the facility was the Kanlaon Broadcasting System or [[DZKB-TV|KBS-9]] (later renamed as [[Radio Philippines Network]] or RPN-9 in 1975), after its headquarters and studios at Roxas Boulevard (which ironically previously used by ABS-CBN before moving to Broadcast Center and sold to KBS-9) was destroyed by fire in 1973. KBS-9 was owned by  [[Marcos crony]] [[Roberto Benedicto]] and was the only TV network that was never shut down by the government in the wake of martial law declaration. In 1974, Benedicto-owned [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] or BBC-2, with call sign changed to DWWX-TV, and the state-run [[People's Television Network|Government Television]] or [[DWGT-TV|GTV-4]] (later renamed as Maharlika Broadcasting System or MBS-4), with call sign changed to DWGT-TV, soon also took over the Broadcast Plaza. Both TV stations were previously used by ABS-CBN during the pre-Martial Law era. BBC and RPN were relocated to the [[Broadcast City]] compound in Old Balara, Quezon City (along with then-sister station [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] or IBC) in 1978.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAs the [[People Power Revolution]] (commonly known as EDSA Revolution) broke out in the eighties, and Marcos' grip on power debilitated, the reformists in the military contended the broadcasting network would be a vital asset for victory. Thus, at 10 AM on February 24, 1986, they attacked and took the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center that was then the home of MBS-4 <ref name=\"history\"/> and the long hibernation of the station ended in March.\n\nWhen Marcos was deposed, the network was sequestered and returned Channel 2 to the Lopezes but not Channel 4. On September 14, 1986, ABS-CBN went back on the air, broadcasting from what used to be their main garage at the revived Broadcast Center in the pre-Martial Law days. The network was forced to share space in the building that was rightfully their own with the government TV station Channel 4. At the time, money had been scarce while resources were limited; offices were used as dressing rooms and other equipment such as chairs, tables, and phones were in short supply.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn late 1986, the network was faltering, ranking last among the five stations in the Philippines and was suffering heavy losses. [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.|Eugenio \"Geny\" Lopez Jr.]] by early 1987 brought in programming whiz and ABS-CBN veteran Freddie Garcia, then working for [[GMA Network]], and set him loose to work his magic touch.\n\nSix months later on March 1, 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, \"The Star Network: ''Ang Pagbabalik Ng Bituin''\" (The Return of the Star), and produced a slew of new locally produced programs that composed 85% of its programming lineup then. The relaunch successfully gave the station a boost in the ratings, and by 1988, ABS-CBN became the Philippines' number one TV network, a position it has maintained ever since.\n\nLater that year, the station launched nationwide domestic satellite programming and by 1994, expanded its operations worldwide. In 1999, Channel 2 launched its 120-kilowatt [[Millennium Transmitter]], resulting in improved signal quality throughout Mega Manila.\n\nIn 2005, ABS-CBN re-upgraded its transmitter into a very high capacity of 346.2 kilowatts resulting in a much clearer signal in Metro Manila.\n\nDuring the historic [[2010 Philippine presidential election|presidential election]], in response to the first automation of the election in the country, ABS-CBN utilized a technology from [[Ormat Industries#Orad|Orad Hi Tech Systems Ltd.]] that utilizes the principles of [[augmented reality]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Rowena Joy|title=TV networks war over holograms and virtual presence|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/257307/tv-networks-war-over-holograms-and-virtual-presence|newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> The technology uses real-time image processing system for live broadcasts of 3D [[computer-generated imagery]] against a real set or background.

It was only until the 1960s that television became common and at that time, although [[audience measurement]] has not yet invented, ABS-CBN was favored by giant companies such as [[Procter and Gamble]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[Unilever]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[PepsiCo]] and [[Caltex]]. ABS-CBN was the only Philippine television network to air commercials and was only the advertising partner of [[Colgate-Palmolive]] products until 2015, when other networks returned to air the Colgate-Palmolive commercials such as rival [[GMA Network]]. When the martial law was declared, ABS-CBN and other television networks (except [[Radio Philippines Network]], then as Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS) were forced to shut-down and held control by the Government. When it was re-established in 1986 as a commercial television, it had failed to regain its glory days and was ranked behind among the five television networks. It was not until 1987, when it was re-branded as \"The Star Network\" that it had slowly regained its foothold in TV ratings. In 1992, [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]] was founded and a new pace in television history was introduced. In 2007, TNS Philippines started to offer media research through [[Kantar Media Philippines]] (formerly Kantar/TNS). In 2008, AGB Nielsen Philippines released the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Philippines|all-time highest rating shows in the Philippines]], with 7 of the top 10 highest rating shows all from ABS-CBN with the shows like ''The Battle: Pacquiao vs. Morales'', ''[[Rosalinda (TV series)|Rosalinda]]'', ''[[Esperanza (Philippine TV series)|Esperanza]]'', ''[[Meteor Garden]]'', ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'', ''[[Miss Universe 1994]]'', and ''[[Mar\u00eda Mercedes (Mexican TV series)|Maria Mercedes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan|title=30 All-Time Highest-rated Philippine TV shows based from the overnight ratings tabulation of AGB Nielsen Philippines in Mega Manila as of February 2008|url=http://kuwaderno.com/30-all-time-highest-rated-philippine-tv-shows-based-from-the-overnight-ratings-tabulation-of-agb-nielsen-philippines-in-mega-manila-as-of-february-2008.html|publisher=Kwuaderno|date=March 17, 2008|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> At the turn of the first decade of the century, competition was up against its closest competitor [[GMA Network]] and [[5 (TV channel)|5]].

The network is headquartered at the [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in [[Quezon City]], with additional offices and production facilities in 25 major cities including [[Baguio City|Baguio]], [[Naga, Camarines Sur|Naga]], [[Bacolod]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], and [[Davao City|Davao]]. ABS-CBN is formally referred to as \"'''The ''Kapamilya'' Network'''\"; ''kapamilya'' is a [[Filipino language|Filipino]] term which means a member of a family. This was originally introduced in 1999 and was officially introduced in 2003 during the celebration of its 50th anniversary. It is the largest television network in the country in terms of revenues, assets, and international coverage.\n\nABS-CBN is the oldest television broadcaster in [[Southeast Asia]] and one of the oldest commercial television broadcasters in [[Asia]].

It is also the first television network in Southeast Asia to broadcast in color, the first television network in the Philippines to formally launch a digital terrestrial television service, and the first broadcast television network in the Philippines to formally launch in high-definition.\n\nToday, the flagship [[television station]] of ABS-CBN is [[DWWX-TV]] (ABS-CBN TV-2 Manila). The network operates across the Philippine archipelago through the [[ABS-CBN Regional]] division which controls 80 television stations.<ref name=\"ABS-CBN\"/><ref>{{cite press release|last=Cerrado|first=Aldrin|url=http://www.pse.com.ph/resource/corpt/2013/ABS_A17A_Dec2012_1.pdf|title=ABS-CBN Corporation Amended 2012 SEC Form 17-A|date=June 5, 2013|work=Philippine Stock Exchange}}</ref> Its programs are also available outside the Philippines through the global subscription television channel [[The Filipino Channel]] (TFC) which is now available in over three million paying households worldwide as well as terrestrially in [[Guam]] through [[KEQI-LP]]. Since 2011, the network is on test broadcast for [[digital terrestrial television]] using the Japanese standard [[ISDB-T]] in select areas in the Philippines. On October 3, 2015, ABS-CBN started to broadcast in [[high-definition television|high-definition]] through its affiliate direct-to-home cable and satellite television providers.\n\n==History==\nABS-CBN traces its history to the first Philippine television station [[DZAQ-TV]], owned by Bolinao Electronics Corporation (BEC) which was later renamed Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).\n\nJames Lindenberg, the owner of BEC, was the first to apply for a license to the [[Philippine Congress]] to establish a television station in 1949. His request was granted on June 14, 1950, under Republic Act No. 511. Because of the strict import controls and the lack of raw materials needed to open a TV station in the Philippines during the mid-20th century, Lindenberg branched to radio broadcasting instead.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|last=Anastacio|first=Ellen Joy|last2=Badiola|first2=Janine Natalie|title=The History of Philippine Television|url=http://pinoytv.blogspot.com/|publisher=UP-CMC Broadcast Department|date=January 1, 2010|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}</ref>\n\nJudge Antonio Quirino, brother of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]], also tried to apply for a license to Congress, but was denied. He later purchased stocks from BEC and subsequently consummated the controlling stock to rename the company from BEC to Alto Broadcasting System (ABS).\n\nDZAQ-TV began commercial television operations on October 23, 1953; the first fully licensed commercial television station in the Philippines. The first program to air was a garden party at the Quirino residence in Sitio Alto, San Juan. After the premiere telecast, the station followed a four-hour-a-day schedule, from six to ten in the evening.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1955, ''[[Manila Chronicle]]'' owner [[Eugenio Lopez, Sr.]] and former [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Fernando Lopez]], acquired a radio-TV franchise from the [[Philippine Congress|Congress]] and immediately established Chronicle Broadcasting Network (CBN) in 1956, which initially focused only on radio broadcasting. On February 24, 1957, Lopez invited Judge Quirino to his house for breakfast and ABS was bought under a contract written on a table napkin. The corporate name was reverted to Bolinao Electronics Corporation immediately after the purchase of ABS.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nWith the establishment of DZXL-TV 9 of CBN in April 19 (or July<ref>https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=tkRaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ZSUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=2897%2C15772132</ref>), 1958,<ref name=\"history\"/> the Lopez brothers controlled both television channels in the archipelago, culminating in the first wave of expansion. The monopoly in television was broken in 1960, when [[DZTV-TV|DZTV-TV 13]] was established by the Inter-Island Broadcasting Corporation (now [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]]) (IBC), owned by Dick Baldwin. In 1961, BEC launched [[DYCB-TV|the nation's first regional and provincial television station]] in [[Cebu City]].<ref name=\"history\"/> In the same year, BEC merged ABS and CBN to form the ABS-CBN network, a brand name that would become official in a few years.\n\nIn 1966, ABS-CBN became the first TV network to broadcast certain shows in color by using the American [[NTSC]] standard and by December 18, 1968, ABS-CBN opened its present-day Broadcast Center complex in Bohol Avenue, Quezon City, moving from its Roxas Boulevard studios that was opened in 1958. It was among the most advanced broadcasting facility of its kind in Asia. Full-color broadcasts began in 1971 (8 hours a day) on ABS-CBN 2 with the availability of more color television sets around Manila and neighboring municipalities and cities.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn 1967, the company was renamed ABS-CBN Broadcasting Corporation. This company became the formal merger of the two stations DZAQ-TV 3 (ABS) and DZXL-TV 9 (CBN).\n\nIn 1969, DZAQ-TV transferred to channel 2 (which remains as the current positioning frequency of the flagship station in Metro Manila), while its sister station DZXL-TV transferred to channel 4. This frequency adjustment was done to make room for Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS (now [[Radio Philippines Network]]) to occupy the channel 9 frequency. ABS-CBN also sold its headquarters and studios in Roxas Boulevard to KBS.\n\n[[File:Abscbn broadcast center.jpg|thumb|right|330px|The [[ABS-CBN Broadcasting Center]] in Diliman, [[Quezon City]], the headquarters of ABS-CBN]]\nWhen then-[[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] [[Proclamation No. 1081|declared]] [[Martial law in the Philippines|martial law]] in 1972, the station was forced, along with its regional stations and other television networks to shut down, with the company was seized from the Lopez brothers. Its newly built headquarters was renamed as the \"Broadcast Plaza\", and it became the home of the three TV stations that were controlled by the [[Marcos regime]]. The first TV station that took over the facility was the Kanlaon Broadcasting System or [[DZKB-TV|KBS-9]] (later renamed as [[Radio Philippines Network]] or RPN-9 in 1975), after its headquarters and studios at Roxas Boulevard (which ironically previously used by ABS-CBN before moving to Broadcast Center and sold to KBS-9) was destroyed by fire in 1973. KBS-9 was owned by  [[Marcos crony]] [[Roberto Benedicto]] and was the only TV network that was never shut down by the government in the wake of martial law declaration. In 1974, Benedicto-owned [[Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation]] or BBC-2, with call sign changed to DWWX-TV, and the state-run [[People's Television Network|Government Television]] or [[DWGT-TV|GTV-4]] (later renamed as Maharlika Broadcasting System or MBS-4), with call sign changed to DWGT-TV, soon also took over the Broadcast Plaza. Both TV stations were previously used by ABS-CBN during the pre-Martial Law era. BBC and RPN were relocated to the [[Broadcast City]] compound in Old Balara, Quezon City (along with then-sister station [[Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation]] or IBC) in 1978.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nAs the [[People Power Revolution]] (commonly known as EDSA Revolution) broke out in the eighties, and Marcos' grip on power debilitated, the reformists in the military contended the broadcasting network would be a vital asset for victory. Thus, at 10 AM on February 24, 1986, they attacked and took the ABS-CBN Broadcast Center that was then the home of MBS-4 <ref name=\"history\"/> and the long hibernation of the station ended in March.\n\nWhen Marcos was deposed, the network was sequestered and returned Channel 2 to the Lopezes but not Channel 4. On September 14, 1986, ABS-CBN went back on the air, broadcasting from what used to be their main garage at the revived Broadcast Center in the pre-Martial Law days. The network was forced to share space in the building that was rightfully their own with the government TV station Channel 4. At the time, money had been scarce while resources were limited; offices were used as dressing rooms and other equipment such as chairs, tables, and phones were in short supply.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\nIn late 1986, the network was faltering, ranking last among the five stations in the Philippines and was suffering heavy losses. [[Eugenio Lopez Jr.|Eugenio \"Geny\" Lopez Jr.]] by early 1987 brought in programming whiz and ABS-CBN veteran Freddie Garcia, then working for [[GMA Network]], and set him loose to work his magic touch.\n\nSix months later on March 1, 1987, Channel 2 was relaunched with the live musical special, \"The Star Network: ''Ang Pagbabalik Ng Bituin''\" (The Return of the Star), and produced a slew of new locally produced programs that composed 85% of its programming lineup then. The relaunch successfully gave the station a boost in the ratings, and by 1988, ABS-CBN became the Philippines' number one TV network, a position it has maintained ever since.\n\nLater that year, the station launched nationwide domestic satellite programming and by 1994, expanded its operations worldwide. In 1999, Channel 2 launched its 120-kilowatt [[Millennium Transmitter]], resulting in improved signal quality throughout Mega Manila.\n\nIn 2005, ABS-CBN re-upgraded its transmitter into a very high capacity of 346.2 kilowatts resulting in a much clearer signal in Metro Manila.\n\nDuring the historic [[2010 Philippine presidential election|presidential election]], in response to the first automation of the election in the country, ABS-CBN utilized a technology from [[Ormat Industries#Orad|Orad Hi Tech Systems Ltd.]] that utilizes the principles of [[augmented reality]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Sanchez|first=Rowena Joy|title=TV networks war over holograms and virtual presence|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/257307/tv-networks-war-over-holograms-and-virtual-presence|newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=July 2, 2012}}</ref> The technology uses real-time image processing system for live broadcasts of 3D [[computer-generated imagery]] against a real set or background.

It was only until the 1960s that television became common and at that time, although [[audience measurement]] has not yet invented, ABS-CBN was favored by giant companies such as [[Procter and Gamble]], [[Colgate-Palmolive]], [[Unilever]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[PepsiCo]] and [[Caltex]]. ABS-CBN was the only Philippine television network to air commercials and was only the advertising partner of [[Colgate-Palmolive]] products until 2015, when other networks returned to air the Colgate-Palmolive commercials such as rival [[GMA Network]]. When the martial law was declared, ABS-CBN and other television networks (except [[Radio Philippines Network]], then as Kanlaon Broadcasting System or KBS) were forced to shut-down and held control by the Government. When it was re-established in 1986 as a commercial television, it had failed to regain its glory days and was ranked behind among the five television networks. It was not until 1987, when it was re-branded as \"The Star Network\" that it had slowly regained its foothold in TV ratings. In 1992, [[AGB Nielsen Philippines]] was founded and a new pace in television history was introduced. In 2007, TNS Philippines started to offer media research through [[Kantar Media Philippines]] (formerly Kantar/TNS). In 2008, AGB Nielsen Philippines released the [[List of most watched television broadcasts#Philippines|all-time highest rating shows in the Philippines]], with 7 of the top 10 highest rating shows all from ABS-CBN with the shows like ''The Battle: Pacquiao vs. Morales'', ''[[Rosalinda (TV series)|Rosalinda]]'', ''[[Esperanza (Philippine TV series)|Esperanza]]'', ''[[Meteor Garden]]'', ''[[Pangako Sa 'Yo]]'', ''[[Miss Universe 1994]]'', and ''[[Mar\u00eda Mercedes (Mexican TV series)|Maria Mercedes]]''.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nathan|title=30 All-Time Highest-rated Philippine TV shows based from the overnight ratings tabulation of AGB Nielsen Philippines in Mega Manila as of February 2008|url=http://kuwaderno.com/30-all-time-highest-rated-philippine-tv-shows-based-from-the-overnight-ratings-tabulation-of-agb-nielsen-philippines-in-mega-manila-as-of-february-2008.html|publisher=Kwuaderno|date=March 17, 2008|accessdate=July 1, 2012}}</ref> At the turn of the first decade of the century, competition was up against its closest competitor [[GMA Network]] and [[5 (TV channel)|5]].

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling. You can access to ATMs around the world as well as shop at anywhere where visa is accepted. Supported currencies include Australian Dollar (AUD), Canadian Dollar (CAD), Euro (EUR), Pound Sterling (GBP), Hong Kong Dollar (HKD), Japanese Yen (JPY), New Zealand Dollar (NZD), Singapore Dollar (SGD), Thai Baht (THB), US Dollar (USD) and South African Rand (ZAR). You also earn 1 Velocity Point per $1 spent overseas and 1 point per $2 spent in Australia.\n\nIn 2015, Velocity Frequent Flyer won the 'Program of the Year\" in the Middle East & Asia/Oceania District category at the Freddie Awards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freddieawards.com/2015-annual-freddie-awards-27th/ |title=2015 Annual Freddie Awards (27th) Results |publisher=Freddie Awards |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n* In 2003, a man with a disability and having incomplete [[quadriplegia]] was removed from a Virgin Blue flight because staff thought he was drunk or a terrorist.

This aircraft is now in Virgin Australia livery.]]\nThe timing of Virgin Blue's entry into the Australian market was fortunate as it was able to fill the vacuum created by the failure of [[Ansett Australia]] in September 2001. Ansett's failure allowed Virgin to grow rapidly to become Australia's second domestic carrier, rather than staying just a cut-price alternative to the established players. It also gave Virgin access to terminal space without which growth would have been significantly limited. Delays in negotiating access to the former Ansett terminal at [[Sydney Airport]] however, forced Virgin to use its original terminal there\u2014a collection of prefabricated buildings without [[Jet bridge|aerobridges]]\u2014longer than was needed. As the airline grew, it acquired new equipment, enabling it to phase-out its older 737-400s in favour of [[Boeing 737 Next Generation|737-700 and \u2212800]] series aircraft with modern glass cockpits, winglets and greater fuel efficiency.\n\nVirgin Group's holding in Virgin Australia has since been reduced, initially via a sale of a half interest to Australian logistics conglomerate [[Patrick Corporation]], and later by a public [[Initial Public Offering|float]]. In early 2005 Patrick launched a hostile takeover for Virgin Blue. Patrick had been unhappy for some time with the company's direction. By the closure of the offer, Patrick held 62% of the company, giving it control. Virgin Group retains a 25% share.\n\nIn May 2006 [[Toll Holdings]] acquired Patrick and became the majority owner of Virgin Blue. In July 2008 Toll sold its majority holding via a special dividend to hold 1.7% of the company. In June 2013 Air New Zealand owned 23% of the company.<ref name=Australian6Jun13>[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/aviation/air-nz-revealed-as-buyer-of-3pc-additional-virgin-stake/story-e6frg95x-1226658272262 Air NZ revealed as buyer of 3pc additional Virgin stake] ''The Australian'' 6 June 2013</ref>\n\n[[File:Virgin Blue Boeing 737-800 PER Monty-3.jpg|thumb|[[Boeing 737 Next Generation|Boeing 737\u2013800]] in the old Virgin Blue red livery at [[Perth Airport]] in 2004]]\nVirgin Blue previously used a familiar formula pioneered by airlines such as [[Southwest Airlines]] and [[Ryanair]] of eliminating costs such as included [[airline meal|in-flight meals]] and printed tickets in favour of selling food on-board and using telephone and internet booking systems.

Originally this was called ''The Blue Room'' and provided facilities to members and guests on a pay-as-you-go basis. Many of these facilities became available when Virgin relocated into the former [[Ansett Australia|Ansett]] terminals across the country, with the defunct ''Golden Wing club'' lounges left behind being used as Blue Room lounges, complete with furnishings.\n\nIn 2006, Virgin revamped the lounge facilities and re-launched the product as ''The Lounge'', which offered all-inclusive facilities on a membership fee or casual fee basis. Upgraded facilities provided included [[buffet]] food and refreshments, newspapers, showers, computers, and [[WiFi]] internet access for travellers.\n\nIn May 2011, Virgin again renamed the lounge simply referring to it as ''Virgin Australia lounge'' \u2013 designed to be a premium experience, with spaces designed for specific uses and 'moods'.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Access===\nMembership can be purchased online by logging into a passenger's Velocity Frequent Flyer account. Membership fees vary depending on the elite status level. Lifetime memberships are also available for purchase.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/experience/at-the-airport/lounge/#prices-and-membership |title=Virgin Australia Lounge Membership Prices |publisher=Virginaustralia.com |date=31 December 2011 |accessdate=3 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Velocity Frequent Flyer Program==\n{{main|Velocity Frequent Flyer}}\nVirgin Australia launched its [[frequent-flyer program]] Velocity Rewards in 2005, with partner [[National Australia Bank]] offering a companion credit card. By 2007, points collected from selected [[Westpac]], [[American Express]] and [[Diners Club]] cards could be transferred to Velocity Rewards, and effective September 2008, ANZ reward visa card points as well. The program reached 4 million members by the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginaustralia.com/au/en/about-us/media/2014/VEL__FOUR_MILLION_MEMBERS/ |title=Velocity Frequent Flyer reaches four million members |publisher=Virgin Australia |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref>\n\nStatus levels were introduced to the program in late 2007 as part of continued efforts to attract business travellers. Alongside the entry-level \"red\" status, frequent travellers were given the opportunity to attain \"silver\" and \"gold\" status, each with its own set of benefits.\n\nInitially, Velocity was different from most other frequent flyer programs, as points were earned relative to the cost of a flight, rather than distance. Velocity members originally earned 6 points per dollar spent on Virgin Australia flights. This was later altered due to the introduction of status levels; Red members now earned 5 points per dollar, Silver members remained at 6 points, and Gold members earned 7. Points accrual on V Australia, as well as the majority of Velocity's airline partners, have always based on distance.\n\nVelocity was the first frequent flyer program in Australia to offer \"any seat, any time\" reward flight availability. The number of points required to redeem an award seat directly corresponds to the current fare of that seat, allowing any seat currently available to be redeemed. [[Qantas]] introduced a similar feature to their frequent flyer program in May 2008.\n\nIn August 2011, the program was relaunched as \"Velocity Frequent Flyer\" and a platinum status level was introduced, among other changes.\n\nIn July 2013, Velocity introduced the Global Wallet function, which was the first prepaid traveller card in Australia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ausbt.com.au/virgin-australia-s-new-global-wallet-travel-money-card |title=Virgin Australia's new Global Wallet travel money card |publisher=Australian Business Traveller |accessdate=15 August 2015}}</ref> The key feature of this card is it allows you to load your money and store it in other supported currencies before travelling.

[[Switzerland]]'s military isolationism largely put an end to organized mercenary activity; the principal remnant of the practice is the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act IV, Scene 5, Swiss mercenaries are called \"Switzers\" (''Switzer'' is actually what the Swiss were called in English until the 19th century, hence Switzerland).\n\n== Ascendancy ==\n\nDuring the Late Middle Ages, mercenary forces grew in importance in Europe, as veterans from the [[Hundred Years War]] and other conflicts came to see soldiering as a profession rather than a temporary activity, and commanders sought long-term professionals rather than temporary feudal levies to fight their wars. Swiss mercenaries (''Reisl\u00e4ufer'')  were valued throughout [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval Europe]] for the power of their determined mass attack in deep columns with the [[spear]], the [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] and [[halberd]]. Hiring them was made even more attractive because entire ready-made Swiss mercenary contingents could be obtained by simply contracting with their local governments, the various [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]\u2014the cantons had a form of militia system in which the soldiers were bound to serve and were trained and equipped to do so. Some Swiss also hired themselves out individually or in small bands.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe warriors of the Swiss cantons had gradually developed a reputation throughout Europe as skilled soldiers, due to their successful defense of their liberties against their Austrian [[Habsburg]] overlords, starting as early as the late thirteenth century, including remarkable upset victories over heavily armoured knights at [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]]. This was furthered by later successful campaigns of regional expansion (mainly into [[Italy]]). By the fifteenth century they were greatly valued as mercenary soldiers, particularly following their series of notable victories in the [[Burgundy Wars|Burgundian Wars]] in the latter part of the century. The standing mercenary army of king [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] ([[Black Army of Hungary]] 1458\u20131490) also contained Swiss pikemen units, who were held in high honour by the king.<ref>http://aregmultajelenben.shp.hu/hpc/web.php?a=aregmultajelenben&o=a_fekete_sereg_eloadas_6Tj</ref> The native term ''Reisl\u00e4ufer'' literally means \"one who goes to war\" and is derived from Middle High German ''Reise,'' meaning \"military campaign\".\n\nThe Swiss, with their head-down attack in huge columns with the long pike, refusal to take prisoners, and consistent record of victory, were greatly feared and admired\u2014for instance, [[Machiavelli]] addresses their system of combat at length in chapter 12 of ''[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm#link2HCH0012 The Prince]''. The [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] Kings of France, in fact, considered it a virtual impossibility to take the field of battle without Swiss pikemen as the infantry core of their armies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  (Although often referred to as \"pikemen\", the Swiss mercenary units also contained [[halberd]]iers as well until several decades into the sixteenth century, as well as a small number of skirmishers armed with bows and [[crossbow]]s or crude [[firearm]]s to precede the rapid advance of the attack column.)\n\nThe young men who went off to fight, and sometimes die, in foreign service had several incentives\u2014limited economic options in the still largely rural cantons; adventure; pride in the reputation of the Swiss as soldiers; and finally what military historian [[Sir Charles William Chadwick Oman|Sir Charles Oman]] describes as a pure love of combat and warfighting in and of itself, forged by two centuries of conflict.\n\n== Landsknechts and the Italian Wars ==\n\nUntil roughly 1490, the Swiss had a virtual monopoly on pike-armed mercenary service. However, after that date, the Swiss mercenaries were increasingly supplanted by imitators, chiefly the ''[[Landsknecht]]s''. Landsknechts were Germans (at first largely from [[Swabia]]) and became proficient at Swiss tactics, even surpassing them with their usage of the ''[[Zweih\u00e4nder]]'' to crush opposing pike formations.{{citation needed|reason=Not supported by historical accounts|date=April 2016}} This produced a force that filled the ranks of European armies with mercenary regiments for decades. After 1515 the Swiss pledged themselves to neutrality, other than regarding Swiss soldiers serving in the ranks of the Royal [[France|French]] army. The ''Landsknecht'', however, would continue to serve any paymaster, even, at times, enemies of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (and ''Landsknechts'' at times even fought each other on the battlefield). The ''Landsknecht'' often assumed the multi-coloured and striped clothing of the Swiss.\n\n[[File:Bad-war.jpg|thumb|''Bad War'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe Swiss were not flattered by the imitation, and the two bodies of mercenaries immediately became bitter rivals over employment and on the battlefield, where they were often opposed during the major European conflict of the early sixteenth century, the [[Italian Wars|Great Italian Wars]]. Although the Swiss generally had a significant edge in a simple \"[[push of pike]]\", the resulting combat was nonetheless quite savage, and known to Italian onlookers as \"bad war\". Period artists such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] attest to the fact that two such huge pike columns crashing into each other could result in a maelstrom of battle, with very many dead and wounded on both sides.\n\nDespite the competition from the ''Landsknechts'', and imitation by other armies (most notably the Spanish, which adopted pike-handling as one element of its ''[[tercio]]s''), the Swiss fighting reputation reached its zenith between 1480 and 1525, and indeed the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]], fought by Swiss mercenaries, is seen by some as the perfect Swiss battle. Even the close defeat at the terrible [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515, the \"Battle of Giants\", was seen as an achievement of sorts for Swiss arms due to the ferocity of the fighting and the good order of their withdrawal.\n\nNonetheless, the repulse at Marignano presaged the decline of the Swiss form of [[pike square|pike warfare]]\u2014eventually, the two-century run of Swiss victories ended in 1522 with disaster at the [[Battle of Bicocca]] when combined Spanish ''tercios'' and ''Landsknecht'' forces decisively defeated them using superior tactics, fortifications, artillery, and new technology (i.e. [[Arquebus|handguns]]). At Bicocca, the Swiss mercenaries, serving the French king, attempted repeatedly to storm an impregnable defensive position without artillery or missile support, only to be mown down by small-arms and artillery fire. Never before had the Swiss suffered such heavy losses while being unable to inflict much damage upon their foe.\n\n== Organization and tactics ==\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|The Swiss (on the left) assault the ''Landsknecht'' mercenaries in the French lines at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\nThe early contingents of Swiss mercenary pikemen organized themselves rather differently than the cantonal forces. In the cantonal forces, their armies were usually divided into the ''Vorhut'' ([[vanguard]]), ''Gewalthut'' (center) and ''Nachhut'' ([[rearguard]]), generally of different sizes. In mercenary contingents, although they could conceivably draw up in three similar columns if their force was of sufficient size, more often they simply drew up in one or two huge columns which deployed side by side, forming the center of the army in which they served. Likewise, their tactics were not very similar to those used by the Swiss cantons in their brilliant tactical victories of the [[Burgundian Wars]] and [[Swabian War]], in which they relied on maneuver at least as much as the brute force of the attack columns. In mercenary service they became much less likely to resort to outmaneuvering the enemy and relied more on a straightforward steamroller assault.\n\nSuch deep pike columns could crush lesser infantry in close combat and were invulnerable to the effects of a cavalry charge, but they were vulnerable to firearms if they could be immobilized (as seen in the [[Battle of Marignano]]). The Swiss mercenaries did deploy bows, crossbows, [[handgun]]s and artillery of their own, however these always remained very subsidiary to the pike and halberd square. Despite the proven armour-penetration capability of firearms, they were also very inaccurate, slow-loading, and susceptible to damp conditions, and did not fit well with the fast-paced attack tactics used by the Swiss mercenary pike forces.\n\nThe Swiss remained primarily pikemen throughout the sixteenth century, but after that period they adopted similar infantry formations and tactics to other units in the armies in which they served. Accordingly, they began to deviate from their previously unique tactics, and they took a normal place in the battle line amongst the other infantry units.\n\n== End of military ascendancy ==\n[[File:Battle of Ravenna (1512).JPG|thumb|left|[[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]], (woodcut by unknown artist, 16th century)]]\nIn the end, as proven at Marignano and Bicocca, the mass pike attack columns of the Swiss mercenaries proved to be too vulnerable to gunpowder weapons as firearms technology advanced, especially [[arquebusier]]s and artillery deployed on prepared ground (e.g., earthworks) and properly supported by other arms. These ''arquebusiers'' and heavy cannons scythed down the close-packed ranks of the Swiss squares in bloody heaps\u2014at least, as long as the Swiss attack could be bogged down by earthworks or cavalry charges, and the vulnerable arquebusiers were backed up by melee infantry\u2014pikemen, halberdiers, and/or swordsmen (Spanish sword-and-buckler men or the Doppels\u00f6ldner wielding the Zweih\u00e4nder)\u2014to defend them if necessary from the Swiss in close combat.\n\nOther stratagems could also take the Swiss pikemen at a disadvantage. For instance, the Spanish ''[[rodeleros]]'', also known as sword-and-buckler men, armed with steel rodelas and ''[[side-sword|espadas]]'' and often wearing a helmet and a breastplate, were much better armed and armored for man-to-man close quarters combat. Accordingly, they could defeat the Swiss pike square by dashing under their unwieldy pikes and stabbing them. However, this tactic operated in support of allied pike squares and thus required the opposing pike square to be fully engaged in the chaos of the [[push of pike]]. Swiss pike columns that retained good formation were often able to beat back Spanish ''rodeleros'' with impunity, such as in the [[Battle of Seminara]], in which the Spanish pike were heavily outnumbered.\n\n== After the Battle of Pavia ==\nDespite the end of their supremacy circa 1525, the Swiss pike-armed mercenaries continued to be amongst the most capable close order infantry in Europe throughout the remainder of the sixteenth century. This was demonstrated by their battlefield performances in the service of the French monarchy during the [[French Wars of Religion]], in particular at the [[Battle of Dreux]], where a block of Swiss pikemen held the [[Huguenot]] army until the Catholic cavalry were able to counterattack.\n\n=== Service in the French army ===\n[[File:Gardes Suisses Marbot.jpg|thumb|Soldier and officer of the [[Swiss Guards]] in French service in 1757]]\n{{main|Swiss Guards}} {{main|List of Royal French foreign regiments}}\nSwiss soldiers continued to serve as valued mercenaries with a number of European armies from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, in spite of extensive changes in tactics, drill and weapons. The most consistent and largest-scale employer of these troops was the French army, where the Swiss formed an elite part of the infantry. The [[Swiss Guards]] regiment, the most senior of the twelve Swiss mercenary regiments in French service, was essentially identical to the [[French Guards]] in organization and equipment, other than wearing a red uniform as opposed to the blue coats of the French corps. The Swiss adopted the musket in increasingly large numbers as the seventeenth century wore on, and abandoned the pike, their ancient trademark, altogether at around the same time as other troops in the French army, circa 1700. They also served in the New World: [[Samuel De Champlain]]'s map of the \u00cele Sainte-Croix ([[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]]) settlement shows a barracks for the Swiss.<ref>[[Morison, Samuel Eliot]], ''Samuel De Champlain, Father of New France'', 1972, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe Swiss mercenaries were recruited according to contracts (capitulations) between the French Monarchy and Swiss cantons or individual noble families. By 1740 more than 12,000 Swiss soldiers were in French service. During the remainder of the eighteenth century, Swiss numbers varied according to need, reaching a peak of 20,000 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian War of Succession]] and falling to 12,300 after 1763.<ref>Rene Chartrand, page 6 \"Louis XV's Infantry \u2013 Foreign Infantry\" {{ISBN|1-85532-623-X}}</ref> In addition to the direct military value of employing Swiss in French service, a political purpose was achieved through the extension of French diplomatic and commercial influence over the neighbouring cantons.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher J.|last=Tozzi|page=29|title=Nationalizing France's Army|ISBN=9780813938332}}</ref>\n\nThe Swiss soldier was paid at a higher level than his French counterpart but was subject to a harsher disciplinary code, administered by his own officers. The basis of recruitment varied according to regiment \u2013 in some units recruits were drawn exclusively from the Swiss inhabitants of specific cantons while in others German or French volunteers were accepted to make up shortfalls in the number of available Swiss. During the latter part of the 18th century, increasing reliance was placed on recruiting from the \"children of the regiment\" \u2013 the sons of Swiss soldiers who had married French women and stayed in France after their term of service had ended. The effect was to partially break down barriers between the Swiss and the French population amongst whom they were garrisoned. On the eve of the [[French Revolution]] the log-book of one Swiss regiment expressed concern that Franco-Swiss recruits were becoming prone to desertion as general discontent spread. French-speaking Swiss soldiers were generally to prove more susceptible to revolutionary propaganda than their German-speaking colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|first=Didier|last=Davin|page=5|title=Officers and Soldiers of Allied Swiss Troops in French Service 1785-1815|ISBN=978-2-35250-235-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lionmonumentlucerne.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Lion Monument]]'' in Lucerne, Switzerland, commemorates [[10 August (French Revolution)|the sacrifice of the Swiss Guards]] at the Tuileries in 1792.]]\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution the Swiss troops were, as at least nominal foreigners, still considered more reliable than their French counterparts in a time of civil unrest. Accordingly, Swiss regiments made up a significant proportion of the royal troops summoned to Paris by [[Louis XVI]] in early July 1789. A detachment of Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment was sent to reinforce the garrison of the [[Bastille]] prison shortly before it was [[Storming of the Bastille|besieged by the mob]]. The Swiss and other royal troops were subsequently withdrawn to their frontier garrisons. Another Swiss regiment, the Chateauvieux, played a major part in the [[Nancy affair]] (mutiny) of 1790<ref>Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 58-59 \"Nationalizing France's Army.

Over three thousand Swiss soldiers transferred individually to French units and continued in service.<ref>Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 82-83 and 119 \"Nationalizing France's Army.

However, recruitment proved difficult and by May 1799 only a quarter of the intended establishment of 18,000 had been raised.<ref>D. Greentree & D. Campbell, pages 6\u20137 \"Napoleon's Swiss Troops\", {{ISBN|978-1-84908-678-3}}</ref> [[Napoleon]] authorized the recruitment of a Swiss infantry regiment for French service in July 1805. A further three infantry regiments were created in October 1807, each including an artillery company.

During the [[retreat from Moscow]] Swiss losses amounted to 80% of their original numbers.

Upon Napoleon's return from Elba in 1815 the serving Swiss units were recalled to Switzerland on the grounds that a new contract signed with the government of Louis XVIII had now been rendered void. However, one composite regiment of Napoleon's Swiss veterans fought at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]] during the [[Hundred Days]].<ref>D. Greentree & D. Campbell, page 41 \"Napoleon's Swiss Troops \", {{ISBN|978-1-84908-678-3}}</ref> Upon the second restoration of the monarchy in 1815 two regiments of Swiss infantry were recruited as part of the Royal Guard, while a further four served as line troops. All six Swiss units were disbanded in 1830 following the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\n=== Service in the Spanish Army ===\n[[File:Regimiento Suizo de Reding n\u00ba 3.jpg|thumb|left|Historial reenactment of the [[3rd Swiss Regiment Reding]] in Spanish service]]\nAnother major employer of Swiss mercenaries from the later 16th century on was [[Spain]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], Switzerland was split along religious lines between [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] cantons. Swiss mercenaries from the Catholic cantons were thereafter increasingly likely to be hired for service in the armies of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] superpower in the later 16th century. The first regularly embodied Swiss regiment in the Spanish army was that of Walter Roll of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] (a Catholic canton) in 1574, for service in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], and by the middle of the 17th century there were a dozen Swiss regiments fighting for the Spanish army. From the latter part of the 17th century these could be found serving in Spain itself or in its overseas possessions. \n\nThe Swiss units saw active service against Portugal, against rebellions in Catalonia, in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[War of the Polish Succession]], [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (in the fighting in Italy), and against Britain in the [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]]. By the 1790s there were about 13,000 men making up the Swiss contingents in a total Spanish army of 137,000. Their final role in Spanish service was against the French in the [[Peninsular War]], in which the five Swiss regiments (''Ruttiman, Yann, Reding, Schwaler'' and ''Courten'') <ref>Rene Chartrand, page 20, \"Spanish Army of the Napoleonic Wars 1793\u20131808\", {{ISBN|1-85532-763-5}}</ref> mostly stayed loyal to their Spanish employers. At the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]], the Swiss regiments pressed into French service defected back to the [[3rd Swiss Regiment Reding|Spanish Army]] under [[Theodor von Reding|Reding]]. The year 1823 finally saw the end of Swiss mercenary service with the Spanish army.\n\nThe Swiss fighting in the ranks of the Spanish army generally followed its organization, tactics and dress. The Swiss regiments were however distinguished by their blue coats, in contrast to the white uniforms of the Spanish line infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=Otto von|last=Pivka|page=22|title=Spanish Armies of the Napoleonic Wars|ISBN=0-85045-243-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Service in the Dutch Army ===\nThe Dutch employed many Swiss units at various dates during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>An old Dutch saying is: \"Geen geld, geen Zwitsers\", from the French \"point d'argent, point de Suisse\"; it translates to: \"No money, no Swiss [mercenaries]\", meaning that you need money in order to wage war.</ref> In the early 18th century there were four regiments, and a ceremonial company of \"Cent Suisses\". They were mostly employed as garrison troops in peacetime, although the Republic sent Swiss regiments to Scotland in 1715 and 1745; in 1745, three battalions of the Swiss Hirtzel Regiment formed part of the Dutch contingent sent to serve in England as allies at the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising]] in Scotland that year.<ref>Stuart Reid, pages 22\u201323 \"Cumberland's Culloden Army 1745\u201346, {{ISBN|978 1 84908 846 6}}</ref> With the threat of a French invasion in 1748, four additional regiments were taken into service, but that year, the [[War of Austrian Succession]] ended and three of these additional regiments were retired from service. In 1749 a regiment of \"Zwitserche Guardes\" (''Swiss Guards'') was raised, the recruits coming from the ranks of the existing Swiss infantry regiments; in 1787, these six regiments numbered a total of 9,600 men.<ref>\"Les Suisses dans l'Arm\u00e9e N\u00e9erlandaise dus XVIe au XXe sci\u00e8cle\"\nNumber of officers and men in the various regiments (peacetime establishment): Regiment \"Zwitsersche Guardes\", 800 men; Regiment \"De Stuerler\", 1,800 men; Regiment \"De May\", 1,800; Regiment \"Schmidt-Gr\u00fcnegg\", 1,800; Regiment \"Hirzel\", 1,800; Regiment \"De Stockar\", 1,800.</ref>\n\nSwiss regiments were employed by both the Dutch Republic and the [[Dutch East India Company]] for service in the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[East Indies]]. In 1772, the Regiment Fourgeoud was sent to Surinam to serve against the Marrons in the Surinam jungle. A narrative of this campaign written by [[John Gabriel Stedman]], was later published. In 1781, the [[Regiment de Meuron|Regiment De Meuron]] was hired for Dutch service and in 1784 the Regiment Waldner. De Meurons' regiment was captured by the British in Ceylon, than taken into British service and sent to Canada, where it fought in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nWith the abdication of the [[Stadhouder]] in 1795 and the forming of the [[Batavian Republic]], the six Swiss regiments were disbanded in 1796. After the return of the [[Prince of Orange]] in 1813, four regiments of Swiss infantry, numbered 29 to 32 in the line, were raised, of which the 32nd Regiment served as a guard regiment performing guard duties at the Royal Palace in [[Amsterdam]] after 1815; however, these regiments were also disbanded in 1829.<ref>Rinaldo D.

Under British service, they fought in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War|Mysore Campaign]] of 1799, the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|Mediterranean]] and [[Peninsular War|Peninsula Campaigns]]. After being stationed in Britain the regiment was posted to Canada, where it served in the [[War of 1812]]. It was finally disbanded in 1816.\n\nThe [[De Watteville's Regiment|Regiment de Watteville]] was a Swiss regiment founded by [[Louis de Watteville]] and recruited from regiments that served between 1799 and 1801 in the Austrian army but in British pay. The Swiss soldiers were then transferred to British service. They fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), mainly around the Mediterranean. They were based in [[Malta]] and then in [[Egypt]] from 1801 to 1803, fighting in [[Sicily]] and [[Naples]]. The regiment fought in the [[Battle of Maida]] in Italy in July 1806. Kept up to strength by Spanish and Portuguese recruits from 1811 to 1813, De Watteville's Regiment was involved in the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain, defending C\u00e1diz during the [[Siege of C\u00e1diz]]. The regiment sailed to Canada in 1813 to fight in the War of 1812. It saw service at Fort Erie and Oswego, before being disbanded in 1816.<ref>Major R. M. Barnes, page 84 \"Military Uniforms of Britain & the Empire\", Sphere Books London, 1972</ref>\n\n== Capitulations and treaties ==\nDuring the period of formalization of the employment of Swiss mercenaries in organized bodies from the late 16th century on, customary [[Capitulation (treaty)|capitulation]]s existed between employing powers and the Swiss cantons or noble families assembling and supplying these troops. Such contracts would generally cover specific details such as the numbers, quality, pay rates and equipment of recruits. Provisions were commonly made that Swiss soldiers would only serve under officers of their own nationality, would be subject to Swiss laws, would carry their own flags and would not be employed in campaigns that would bring them into conflict with Swiss in the service of another country.<ref>Page 619 \"Cambridge Modern History, Volume 1: The Renaissance\"</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that such contracts might also contain a commitment that Swiss units would be returned if the confederation came under attack.<ref name=\"mcphee19831031\">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=1983-10-31 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}</ref> However, surviving capitulations from the 16th and 17th centuries are not known to contain provisions to this effect.\n\nWith the passing of the amendment to the Swiss Constitution of 1874 banning the recruitment of Swiss citizens by foreign states, such contractual relations ceased. Military alliances had already been banned under the Swiss constitution of 1848, though troops still served abroad when obliged by treaties. One such example were the Swiss regiments serving under [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]], who [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|defended Gaeta in 1860]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand|Italian War of Unification]]. This marked the end of an era.\n\n== Modern times ==\nSince 1859, only one mercenary unit has been permitted, the Vatican's [[Pontifical Guard|Swiss Guard]], which has been protecting the Pope for the last five centuries, dressed in colourful uniforms, supposedly drawn by [[Michelangelo]], reminiscent of the Swiss mercenary's heyday. Despite its being prohibited, individual Swiss citizens carried on the tradition of foreign military service into the twentieth century. This included 800 Swiss volunteers who fought with the Republican [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], incurring heavy losses.<ref>Clive H. Church, page 210 \"A Concise History of Switzerland\", Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-14382-0}}</ref>\n\nSwiss citizens also served in the German [[Wehrmacht]] during the Second World War, although purely on an individual and voluntary basis. At least 2,000 Swiss fought for Germany during the war, mostly from the German-speaking cantons of [[Bern (canton)|Bern]] and [[Zurich (canton)|Zurich]], and many of them had dual German nationality. Besides the Wehrmacht some also joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], particularly the [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|6th mountain division]]. Due to Switzerland's neutral status, their allegiances were considered illegal and in 1943 the government decided that those who cooperated with Germany would be deprived of their nationality.

Their service as [[mercenaries]] was at its peak during the [[Renaissance]], when their proven battlefield capabilities made them sought-after mercenary troops. There followed a period of decline, as technological and organizational advances counteracted the Swiss' advantages. [[Switzerland]]'s military isolationism largely put an end to organized mercenary activity; the principal remnant of the practice is the [[Pontifical Swiss Guard]] at the [[Vatican City|Vatican]].\n\nIn [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]]'', Act IV, Scene 5, Swiss mercenaries are called \"Switzers\" (''Switzer'' is actually what the Swiss were called in English until the 19th century, hence Switzerland).\n\n== Ascendancy ==\n\nDuring the Late Middle Ages, mercenary forces grew in importance in Europe, as veterans from the [[Hundred Years War]] and other conflicts came to see soldiering as a profession rather than a temporary activity, and commanders sought long-term professionals rather than temporary feudal levies to fight their wars. Swiss mercenaries (''Reisl\u00e4ufer'')  were valued throughout [[Late Middle Ages|Late Medieval Europe]] for the power of their determined mass attack in deep columns with the [[spear]], the [[Pike (weapon)|pike]] and [[halberd]]. Hiring them was made even more attractive because entire ready-made Swiss mercenary contingents could be obtained by simply contracting with their local governments, the various [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss]] [[cantons of Switzerland|cantons]]\u2014the cantons had a form of militia system in which the soldiers were bound to serve and were trained and equipped to do so. Some Swiss also hired themselves out individually or in small bands.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe warriors of the Swiss cantons had gradually developed a reputation throughout Europe as skilled soldiers, due to their successful defense of their liberties against their Austrian [[Habsburg]] overlords, starting as early as the late thirteenth century, including remarkable upset victories over heavily armoured knights at [[Battle of Morgarten|Morgarten]] and [[Battle of Laupen|Laupen]]. This was furthered by later successful campaigns of regional expansion (mainly into [[Italy]]). By the fifteenth century they were greatly valued as mercenary soldiers, particularly following their series of notable victories in the [[Burgundy Wars|Burgundian Wars]] in the latter part of the century. The standing mercenary army of king [[Matthias Corvinus|Matthias Corvinus of Hungary]] ([[Black Army of Hungary]] 1458\u20131490) also contained Swiss pikemen units, who were held in high honour by the king.<ref>http://aregmultajelenben.shp.hu/hpc/web.php?a=aregmultajelenben&o=a_fekete_sereg_eloadas_6Tj</ref> The native term ''Reisl\u00e4ufer'' literally means \"one who goes to war\" and is derived from Middle High German ''Reise,'' meaning \"military campaign\".\n\nThe Swiss, with their head-down attack in huge columns with the long pike, refusal to take prisoners, and consistent record of victory, were greatly feared and admired\u2014for instance, [[Machiavelli]] addresses their system of combat at length in chapter 12 of ''[https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/m/machiavelli/niccolo/m149p/complete.html#chapter12 The Prince]''. The [[Valois Dynasty|Valois]] Kings of France, in fact, considered it a virtual impossibility to take the field of battle without Swiss pikemen as the infantry core of their armies.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}  (Although often referred to as \"pikemen\", the Swiss mercenary units also contained [[halberd]]iers as well until several decades into the sixteenth century, as well as a small number of skirmishers armed with bows and [[crossbow]]s or crude [[firearm]]s to precede the rapid advance of the attack column.)\n\nThe young men who went off to fight, and sometimes die, in foreign service had several incentives\u2014limited economic options in the still largely rural cantons; adventure; pride in the reputation of the Swiss as soldiers; and finally what military historian [[Sir Charles William Chadwick Oman|Sir Charles Oman]] describes as a pure love of combat and warfighting in and of itself, forged by two centuries of conflict.\n\n== Landsknechts and the Italian Wars ==\n\nUntil roughly 1490, the Swiss had a virtual monopoly on pike-armed mercenary service. However, after that date, the Swiss mercenaries were increasingly supplanted by imitators, chiefly the ''[[Landsknecht]]s''. Landsknechts were Germans (at first largely from [[Swabia]]) and became proficient at Swiss tactics, even surpassing them with their usage of the ''[[Zweih\u00e4nder]]'' to crush opposing pike formations.{{citation needed|reason=Not supported by historical accounts|date=April 2016}} This produced a force that filled the ranks of European armies with mercenary regiments for decades. After 1515 the Swiss pledged themselves to neutrality, other than regarding Swiss soldiers serving in the ranks of the Royal [[France|French]] army. The ''Landsknecht'', however, would continue to serve any paymaster, even, at times, enemies of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (and ''Landsknechts'' at times even fought each other on the battlefield). The ''Landsknecht'' often assumed the multi-coloured and striped clothing of the Swiss.\n\n[[File:Bad-war.jpg|thumb|''Bad War'', by [[Hans Holbein the Younger]]]]\nThe Swiss were not flattered by the imitation, and the two bodies of mercenaries immediately became bitter rivals over employment and on the battlefield, where they were often opposed during the major European conflict of the early sixteenth century, the [[Italian Wars|Great Italian Wars]]. Although the Swiss generally had a significant edge in a simple \"[[push of pike]]\", the resulting combat was nonetheless quite savage, and known to Italian onlookers as \"bad war\". Period artists such as [[Hans Holbein the Younger|Hans Holbein]] attest to the fact that two such huge pike columns crashing into each other could result in a maelstrom of battle, with very many dead and wounded on both sides.\n\nDespite the competition from the ''Landsknechts'', and imitation by other armies (most notably the Spanish, which adopted pike-handling as one element of its ''[[tercio]]s''), the Swiss fighting reputation reached its zenith between 1480 and 1525, and indeed the [[Battle of Novara (1513)|Battle of Novara]], fought by Swiss mercenaries, is seen by some as the perfect Swiss battle. Even the close defeat at the terrible [[Battle of Marignano]] in 1515, the \"Battle of Giants\", was seen as an achievement of sorts for Swiss arms due to the ferocity of the fighting and the good order of their withdrawal.\n\nNonetheless, the repulse at Marignano presaged the decline of the Swiss form of [[pike square|pike warfare]]\u2014eventually, the two-century run of Swiss victories ended in 1522 with disaster at the [[Battle of Bicocca]] when combined Spanish ''tercios'' and ''Landsknecht'' forces decisively defeated them using superior tactics, fortifications, artillery, and new technology (i.e. [[Arquebus|handguns]]). At Bicocca, the Swiss mercenaries, serving the French king, attempted repeatedly to storm an impregnable defensive position without artillery or missile support, only to be mown down by small-arms and artillery fire. Never before had the Swiss suffered such heavy losses while being unable to inflict much damage upon their foe.\n\n== Organization and tactics ==\n[[File:Marignano.jpg|thumb|The Swiss (on the left) assault the ''Landsknecht'' mercenaries in the French lines at the [[Battle of Marignano]]]]\nThe early contingents of Swiss mercenary pikemen organized themselves rather differently than the cantonal forces. In the cantonal forces, their armies were usually divided into the ''Vorhut'' ([[vanguard]]), ''Gewalthut'' (center) and ''Nachhut'' ([[rearguard]]), generally of different sizes. In mercenary contingents, although they could conceivably draw up in three similar columns if their force was of sufficient size, more often they simply drew up in one or two huge columns which deployed side by side, forming the center of the army in which they served. Likewise, their tactics were not very similar to those used by the Swiss cantons in their brilliant tactical victories of the [[Burgundian Wars]] and [[Swabian War]], in which they relied on maneuver at least as much as the brute force of the attack columns. In mercenary service they became much less likely to resort to outmaneuvering the enemy and relied more on a straightforward steamroller assault.\n\nSuch deep pike columns could crush lesser infantry in close combat and were invulnerable to the effects of a cavalry charge, but they were vulnerable to firearms if they could be immobilized (as seen in the [[Battle of Marignano]]). The Swiss mercenaries did deploy bows, crossbows, [[handgun]]s and artillery of their own, however these always remained very subsidiary to the pike and halberd square. Despite the proven armour-penetration capability of firearms, they were also very inaccurate, slow-loading, and susceptible to damp conditions, and did not fit well with the fast-paced attack tactics used by the Swiss mercenary pike forces.\n\nThe Swiss remained primarily pikemen throughout the sixteenth century, but after that period they adopted similar infantry formations and tactics to other units in the armies in which they served. Accordingly, they began to deviate from their previously unique tactics, and they took a normal place in the battle line amongst the other infantry units.\n\n== End of military ascendancy ==\n[[File:Battle of Ravenna (1512).JPG|thumb|left|[[Battle of Ravenna (1512)|Battle of Ravenna]], (woodcut by unknown artist, 16th century)]]\nIn the end, as proven at Marignano and Bicocca, the mass pike attack columns of the Swiss mercenaries proved to be too vulnerable to gunpowder weapons as firearms technology advanced, especially [[arquebusier]]s and artillery deployed on prepared ground (e.g., earthworks) and properly supported by other arms. These ''arquebusiers'' and heavy cannons scythed down the close-packed ranks of the Swiss squares in bloody heaps\u2014at least, as long as the Swiss attack could be bogged down by earthworks or cavalry charges, and the vulnerable arquebusiers were backed up by melee infantry\u2014pikemen, halberdiers, and/or swordsmen (Spanish sword-and-buckler men or the Doppels\u00f6ldner wielding the Zweih\u00e4nder)\u2014to defend them if necessary from the Swiss in close combat.\n\nOther stratagems could also take the Swiss pikemen at a disadvantage. For instance, the Spanish ''[[rodeleros]]'', also known as sword-and-buckler men, armed with steel rodelas and ''[[side-sword|espadas]]'' and often wearing a helmet and a breastplate, were much better armed and armored for man-to-man close quarters combat. Accordingly, they could defeat the Swiss pike square by dashing under their unwieldy pikes and stabbing them. However, this tactic operated in support of allied pike squares and thus required the opposing pike square to be fully engaged in the chaos of the [[push of pike]]. Swiss pike columns that retained good formation were often able to beat back Spanish ''rodeleros'' with impunity, such as in the [[Battle of Seminara]], in which the Spanish pike were heavily outnumbered.\n\n== After the Battle of Pavia ==\nDespite the end of their supremacy circa 1525, the Swiss pike-armed mercenaries continued to be amongst the most capable close order infantry in Europe throughout the remainder of the sixteenth century. This was demonstrated by their battlefield performances in the service of the French monarchy during the [[French Wars of Religion]], in particular at the [[Battle of Dreux]], where a block of Swiss pikemen held the [[Huguenot]] army until the Catholic cavalry were able to counterattack.\n\n=== Service in the French army ===\n[[File:Gardes Suisses Marbot.jpg|thumb|Soldier and officer of the [[Swiss Guards]] in French service in 1757]]\n{{main|Swiss Guards}} {{main|List of Royal French foreign regiments}}\nSwiss soldiers continued to serve as valued mercenaries with a number of European armies from the seventeenth to the nineteenth centuries, in spite of extensive changes in tactics, drill and weapons. The most consistent and largest-scale employer of these troops was the French army, where the Swiss formed an elite part of the infantry. The [[Swiss Guards]] regiment, the most senior of the twelve Swiss mercenary regiments in French service, was essentially identical to the [[French Guards]] in organization and equipment, other than wearing a red uniform as opposed to the blue coats of the French corps. The Swiss adopted the musket in increasingly large numbers as the seventeenth century wore on, and abandoned the pike, their ancient trademark, altogether at around the same time as other troops in the French army, circa 1700. They also served in the New World: [[Samuel De Champlain]]'s map of the \u00cele Sainte-Croix ([[Saint Croix Island, Maine|Saint Croix Island]]) settlement shows a barracks for the Swiss.<ref>[[Morison, Samuel Eliot]], ''Samuel De Champlain, Father of New France'', 1972, p. 44.</ref>\n\nThe Swiss mercenaries were recruited according to contracts (capitulations) between the French Monarchy and Swiss cantons or individual noble families. By 1740 more than 12,000 Swiss soldiers were in French service. During the remainder of the eighteenth century, Swiss numbers varied according to need, reaching a peak of 20,000 during the [[War of the Austrian Succession|Austrian War of Succession]] and falling to 12,300 after 1763.<ref>Rene Chartrand, page 6 \"Louis XV's Infantry \u2013 Foreign Infantry\" {{ISBN|1-85532-623-X}}</ref> In addition to the direct military value of employing Swiss in French service, a political purpose was achieved through the extension of French diplomatic and commercial influence over the neighbouring cantons.<ref>{{cite book|first=Christopher J.|last=Tozzi|page=29|title=Nationalizing France's Army|ISBN=9780813938332}}</ref>\n\nThe Swiss soldier was paid at a higher level than his French counterpart but was subject to a harsher disciplinary code, administered by his own officers. The basis of recruitment varied according to regiment \u2013 in some units recruits were drawn exclusively from the Swiss inhabitants of specific cantons while in others German or French volunteers were accepted to make up shortfalls in the number of available Swiss. During the latter part of the 18th century, increasing reliance was placed on recruiting from the \"children of the regiment\" \u2013 the sons of Swiss soldiers who had married French women and stayed in France after their term of service had ended. The effect was to partially break down barriers between the Swiss and the French population amongst whom they were garrisoned. On the eve of the [[French Revolution]] the log-book of one Swiss regiment expressed concern that Franco-Swiss recruits were becoming prone to desertion as general discontent spread. French-speaking Swiss soldiers were generally to prove more susceptible to revolutionary propaganda than their German-speaking colleagues.<ref>{{cite book|first=Didier|last=Davin|page=5|title=Officers and Soldiers of Allied Swiss Troops in French Service 1785-1815|ISBN=978-2-35250-235-7}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Lionmonumentlucerne.jpg|thumb|right|The ''[[Lion Monument]]'' in Lucerne, Switzerland, commemorates [[10 August (French Revolution)|the sacrifice of the Swiss Guards]] at the Tuileries in 1792.]]\nAt the outbreak of the French Revolution the Swiss troops were, as at least nominal foreigners, still considered more reliable than their French counterparts in a time of civil unrest. Accordingly, Swiss regiments made up a significant proportion of the royal troops summoned to Paris by [[Louis XVI]] in early July 1789. A detachment of Swiss grenadiers from the Salis-Samade Regiment was sent to reinforce the garrison of the [[Bastille]] prison shortly before it was [[Storming of the Bastille|besieged by the mob]]. The Swiss and other royal troops were subsequently withdrawn to their frontier garrisons. Another Swiss regiment, the Chateauvieux, played a major part in the [[Nancy affair]] (mutiny) of 1790<ref>Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 58-59 \"Nationalizing France's Army. Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831, {{ISBN|978-0-8139-3833-2}}</ref> and 23 of its soldiers were executed, after trial by their own Swiss officers.<ref>Terry Courcelle, page 11 \"French Revolutionary Infantry 1789\u20131802\", {{ISBN|1-84176-660-7}}</ref> The Swiss Guard however remained loyal and was massacred on 10 August 1792, when the mob attacked the [[Tuileries Palace]], although [[Louis XVI]] had already left the building. The eleven Swiss regiments of line infantry were disbanded under a decree passed by the French Assembly on 20 August 1792. Over three thousand Swiss soldiers transferred individually to French units and continued in service.<ref>Christopher J. Tozzi, pages 82-83 and 119 \"Nationalizing France's Army. Foreign, Black and Jewish Troops in the French Military, 1715-1831, {{ISBN|978-0-8139-3833-2}}</ref>  However, many of the rank and file returned to Switzerland, where measures had to be taken to provide them with relief and reintegration into the rural society from which most had been drawn.\n\n[[File:Regiments Suisses GA.jpg|thumb|left|Swiss soldiers during the [[Napoleonic Wars]]]]\nFollowing the occupation of Switzerland by French revolutionary forces in 1798, a project to raise six [[demi-brigade]]s of Swiss infantry for French service was initiated. However, recruitment proved difficult and by May 1799 only a quarter of the intended establishment of 18,000 had been raised.<ref>D. Greentree & D. Campbell, pages 6\u20137 \"Napoleon's Swiss Troops\", {{ISBN|978-1-84908-678-3}}</ref> [[Napoleon]] authorized the recruitment of a Swiss infantry regiment for French service in July 1805. A further three infantry regiments were created in October 1807, each including an artillery company. He specified that this newly raised Swiss Corps should comprise only citizens of Switzerland without \"mingling in deserters or other foreigners\".<ref>Philip Haythornthwaite, page 127 \"Uniforms of the Retreat from Moscow 1812\", {{ISBN|0-88254-421-7}}</ref> The Swiss regiments fought well both in Spain (where they clashed at the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]] with Swiss troops in the Spanish Army) and in Russia. During the [[retreat from Moscow]] Swiss losses amounted to 80% of their original numbers. The Swiss were allowed to keep the distinctive red coats which had distinguished them prior to 1792, with different [[facings]] identifying each regiment.\n\n[[File:Louvre 1830.jpg|thumb|Soldiers of a Swiss regiment in French service during the [[July Revolution|Revolution of 1830]].]]\nDuring the first Bourbon restoration of 1814\u201315, the grenadier companies of the by now under-strength four Swiss regiments undertook ceremonial guard duties in Paris. Upon Napoleon's return from Elba in 1815 the serving Swiss units were recalled to Switzerland on the grounds that a new contract signed with the government of Louis XVIII had now been rendered void. However, one composite regiment of Napoleon's Swiss veterans fought at [[Battle of Wavre|Wavre]] during the [[Hundred Days]].<ref>D. Greentree & D. Campbell, page 41 \"Napoleon's Swiss Troops \", {{ISBN|978-1-84908-678-3}}</ref> Upon the second restoration of the monarchy in 1815 two regiments of Swiss infantry were recruited as part of the Royal Guard, while a further four served as line troops. All six Swiss units were disbanded in 1830 following the final overthrow of the Bourbon monarchy.\n\n=== Service in the Spanish Army ===\n[[File:Regimiento Suizo de Reding n\u00ba 3.jpg|thumb|left|Historial reenactment of the [[3rd Swiss Regiment Reding]] in Spanish service]]\nAnother major employer of Swiss mercenaries from the later 16th century on was [[Spain]]. After the [[Protestant Reformation]], Switzerland was split along religious lines between [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] cantons. Swiss mercenaries from the Catholic cantons were thereafter increasingly likely to be hired for service in the armies of the [[Habsburg Spain|Spanish Habsburg]] superpower in the later 16th century. The first regularly embodied Swiss regiment in the Spanish army was that of Walter Roll of [[Canton of Uri|Uri]] (a Catholic canton) in 1574, for service in the [[Spanish Netherlands]], and by the middle of the 17th century there were a dozen Swiss regiments fighting for the Spanish army. From the latter part of the 17th century these could be found serving in Spain itself or in its overseas possessions. \n\nThe Swiss units saw active service against Portugal, against rebellions in Catalonia, in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], [[War of the Polish Succession]], [[War of the Austrian Succession]] (in the fighting in Italy), and against Britain in the [[Spain in the American Revolutionary War|American Revolutionary War]]. By the 1790s there were about 13,000 men making up the Swiss contingents in a total Spanish army of 137,000. Their final role in Spanish service was against the French in the [[Peninsular War]], in which the five Swiss regiments (''Ruttiman, Yann, Reding, Schwaler'' and ''Courten'') <ref>Rene Chartrand, page 20, \"Spanish Army of the Napoleonic Wars 1793\u20131808\", {{ISBN|1-85532-763-5}}</ref> mostly stayed loyal to their Spanish employers. At the [[Battle of Bail\u00e9n]], the Swiss regiments pressed into French service defected back to the [[3rd Swiss Regiment Reding|Spanish Army]] under [[Theodor von Reding|Reding]]. The year 1823 finally saw the end of Swiss mercenary service with the Spanish army.\n\nThe Swiss fighting in the ranks of the Spanish army generally followed its organization, tactics and dress. The Swiss regiments were however distinguished by their blue coats, in contrast to the white uniforms of the Spanish line infantry.<ref>{{cite book|first=Otto von|last=Pivka|page=22|title=Spanish Armies of the Napoleonic Wars|ISBN=0-85045-243-0}}</ref>\n\n=== Service in the Dutch Army ===\nThe Dutch employed many Swiss units at various dates during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>An old Dutch saying is: \"Geen geld, geen Zwitsers\", from the French \"point d'argent, point de Suisse\"; it translates to: \"No money, no Swiss [mercenaries]\", meaning that you need money in order to wage war.</ref> In the early 18th century there were four regiments, and a ceremonial company of \"Cent Suisses\". They were mostly employed as garrison troops in peacetime, although the Republic sent Swiss regiments to Scotland in 1715 and 1745; in 1745, three battalions of the Swiss Hirtzel Regiment formed part of the Dutch contingent sent to serve in England as allies at the time of the [[Jacobite rising of 1745|Jacobite rising]] in Scotland that year.<ref>Stuart Reid, pages 22\u201323 \"Cumberland's Culloden Army 1745\u201346, {{ISBN|978 1 84908 846 6}}</ref> With the threat of a French invasion in 1748, four additional regiments were taken into service, but that year, the [[War of Austrian Succession]] ended and three of these additional regiments were retired from service. In 1749 a regiment of \"Zwitserche Guardes\" (''Swiss Guards'') was raised, the recruits coming from the ranks of the existing Swiss infantry regiments; in 1787, these six regiments numbered a total of 9,600 men.<ref>\"Les Suisses dans l'Arm\u00e9e N\u00e9erlandaise dus XVIe au XXe sci\u00e8cle\"\nNumber of officers and men in the various regiments (peacetime establishment): Regiment \"Zwitsersche Guardes\", 800 men; Regiment \"De Stuerler\", 1,800 men; Regiment \"De May\", 1,800; Regiment \"Schmidt-Gr\u00fcnegg\", 1,800; Regiment \"Hirzel\", 1,800; Regiment \"De Stockar\", 1,800.</ref>\n\nSwiss regiments were employed by both the Dutch Republic and the [[Dutch East India Company]] for service in the [[Cape Colony]] and the [[East Indies]]. In 1772, the Regiment Fourgeoud was sent to Surinam to serve against the Marrons in the Surinam jungle. A narrative of this campaign written by [[John Gabriel Stedman]], was later published. In 1781, the [[Regiment de Meuron|Regiment De Meuron]] was hired for Dutch service and in 1784 the Regiment Waldner. De Meurons' regiment was captured by the British in Ceylon, than taken into British service and sent to Canada, where it fought in the [[War of 1812]].\n\nWith the abdication of the [[Stadhouder]] in 1795 and the forming of the [[Batavian Republic]], the six Swiss regiments were disbanded in 1796. After the return of the [[Prince of Orange]] in 1813, four regiments of Swiss infantry, numbered 29 to 32 in the line, were raised, of which the 32nd Regiment served as a guard regiment performing guard duties at the Royal Palace in [[Amsterdam]] after 1815; however, these regiments were also disbanded in 1829.<ref>Rinaldo D. D'Ami, page 30 \"World Uniforms in Colour \u2013 Volume 1: The European Nations\", SBN 85059 031 0</ref>\n\n=== Service in the British Army ===\n[[File:Regiment suisse de Meuron.png|thumb|Flag of the regiment de Meuron]]\nIn 1781, [[Charles-Daniel de Meuron]], a former colonel of the French Swiss Guard, founded his own mercenary regiment under the name [[Regiment de Meuron]], first serving the Dutch East India Company, and from 1796, the [[British East India Company]]. Under British service, they fought in the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War|Mysore Campaign]] of 1799, the [[Mediterranean campaign of 1798|Mediterranean]] and [[Peninsular War|Peninsula Campaigns]]. After being stationed in Britain the regiment was posted to Canada, where it served in the [[War of 1812]]. It was finally disbanded in 1816.\n\nThe [[De Watteville's Regiment|Regiment de Watteville]] was a Swiss regiment founded by [[Louis de Watteville]] and recruited from regiments that served between 1799 and 1801 in the Austrian army but in British pay. The Swiss soldiers were then transferred to British service. They fought in the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1803\u20131815), mainly around the Mediterranean. They were based in [[Malta]] and then in [[Egypt]] from 1801 to 1803, fighting in [[Sicily]] and [[Naples]]. The regiment fought in the [[Battle of Maida]] in Italy in July 1806. Kept up to strength by Spanish and Portuguese recruits from 1811 to 1813, De Watteville's Regiment was involved in the [[Peninsular War]] in Spain, defending C\u00e1diz during the [[Siege of C\u00e1diz]]. The regiment sailed to Canada in 1813 to fight in the War of 1812. It saw service at Fort Erie and Oswego, before being disbanded in 1816.<ref>Major R. M.

Such contracts would generally cover specific details such as the numbers, quality, pay rates and equipment of recruits. Provisions were commonly made that Swiss soldiers would only serve under officers of their own nationality, would be subject to Swiss laws, would carry their own flags and would not be employed in campaigns that would bring them into conflict with Swiss in the service of another country.<ref>Page 619 \"Cambridge Modern History, Volume 1: The Renaissance\"</ref>\n\nIt has been claimed that such contracts might also contain a commitment that Swiss units would be returned if the confederation came under attack.<ref name=\"mcphee19831031\">{{cite news | url=http://archives.newyorker.com/default.aspx?iid=16248&startpage=page0000103#folio=050 | title=La Place de la Concorde Suisse-I | work=The New Yorker | date=1983-10-31 | accessdate=22 July 2013 | author=McPhee, John | pages=50}}</ref> However, surviving capitulations from the 16th and 17th centuries are not known to contain provisions to this effect.\n\nWith the passing of the amendment to the Swiss Constitution of 1874 banning the recruitment of Swiss citizens by foreign states, such contractual relations ceased. Military alliances had already been banned under the Swiss constitution of 1848, though troops still served abroad when obliged by treaties. One such example were the Swiss regiments serving under [[Francis II of the Two Sicilies]], who [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|defended Gaeta in 1860]] during the [[Expedition of the Thousand|Italian War of Unification]]. This marked the end of an era.\n\n== Modern times ==\nSince 1859, only one mercenary unit has been permitted, the Vatican's [[Pontifical Guard|Swiss Guard]], which has been protecting the Pope for the last five centuries, dressed in colourful uniforms, supposedly drawn by [[Michelangelo]], reminiscent of the Swiss mercenary's heyday. Despite its being prohibited, individual Swiss citizens carried on the tradition of foreign military service into the twentieth century. This included 800 Swiss volunteers who fought with the Republican [[International Brigades]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], incurring heavy losses.<ref>Clive H. Church, page 210 \"A Concise History of Switzerland\", Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-14382-0}}</ref>\n\nSwiss citizens also served in the German [[Wehrmacht]] during the Second World War, although purely on an individual and voluntary basis. At least 2,000 Swiss fought for Germany during the war, mostly from the German-speaking cantons of [[Bern (canton)|Bern]] and [[Zurich (canton)|Zurich]], and many of them had dual German nationality. Besides the Wehrmacht some also joined the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], particularly the [[6th SS Mountain Division Nord|6th mountain division]]. Due to Switzerland's neutral status, their allegiances were considered illegal and in 1943 the government decided that those who cooperated with Germany would be deprived of their nationality. By 1945, there were only 29 such cases. A number of Swiss citizens were taken prisoner by the Soviet Union while fighting on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].<ref>[https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/the-hidden-past-of-swiss-nazi-era-volunteers/7135628 The hidden past of Swiss Nazi-era volunteers].

At the appropriate time, he passed to the Coll\u00e8ge de Harcourt, where thanks to the misdirected efforts of a teacher who was an enthusiast for Aristotle, Polignac adopted the opposite view and became a [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]]. His thesis in Theology at the [[College of Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] (1683) discussed the Kings of Judah who had destroyed the \"high places\". He was either prescient, or aware of discussion around Louis XIV which led in two years to the revocation of the [[Edict of Nantes]] (1685) and the removal of the [[Huguenot]] \"high places\". He had somehow attracted the patronage of the [[Cardinal de Bouillon|Cardinal Emmanuel de la Tour d'Auvergne de Bouillon]], who took Polignac with him when he went to Rome for the Conclave following the death of Pope [[Innocent XI]] on August 12, 1689. Bouillon chose Polignac as one of his Conclavists.<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' (Turin 1870) vol. 20, p. 4; Giovanni Mario Crescimbeni,  ''Vite degli Arcadi illustri''  V (Roma 1750), 206</ref> When the new Pope, [[Alexander VIII]] (Ottoboni) was elected, he assisted Cardinal de Bouillon and the French Ambassador, the Duc de Chaulnes, in attempting to improve relations between Louis XIV and the Holy See. Polignac was sent back to France to report to Louis, who immediately sent him back to Rome with further instructions. He was still in Rome when Alexander VIII died after less than sixteen months on the throne, and was again Conclavist of Cardinal de Bouillon in the Conclave of 1691 that elected [[Innocent XII]] (Pignatelli).<ref>''Bullarium Romanum'' Vol. 20 (Turin edition 1870), p. 170.</ref>\n\nAt an early age he achieved recognition as a diplomat. In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to [[Poland]], where he worked with Cardinal [[Michal Stefan Radziejowski|Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski]], the [[Primate of Poland]] and nephew of King John III Sobieski, to bring about the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti]] as successor to [[John Sobieski]] (1697). The other candidate, [[Augustus the Strong]] of Saxony, however, was supported by Austria and Russia, and was elected over the French candidate. The subsequent failure of this intrigue led to Polignac's temporary disgrace, and retirement to his Abbey of Bon-Port, but in 1702 he was restored to favour. In 1709 he was sent along with Nicholas du Bl\u00e9, Mar\u00e9chal d'Huxelles, as plenipotentiaries to conduct negotiations toward peace at the Dutch town of [[Geertruidenberg]], but thanks to the obstinacy of Louis XIV, they were unsuccessful. Polignac left Getruidenberg on July 25, 1710, and had an interview with Louis XIV at Versailles on July 31.<ref>Faucher, II, 4-98.</ref> In 1712 he was sent, again along with the Mar\u00e9chal d'Huxelles, as a [[plenipotentiary]] of [[Louis XIV of France]], to the [[Congress of Utrecht]], and this time a peace was concluded.\n\n==Character portrait==\n\nThe [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]] provides a character portrait of the Abbe de Polignac around the end of 1705, as he was trying to restart his career and climb back into the notice of the French government, in particular the Duc de Bourbon\u2014a portrait full of Saint-Simon's usual snobbery and malevolence:<ref>''Memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon'' (tr. K.P. Wormeley) I (Boston 1899), 311-313.</ref>\n\n\"The Abbe de Polignac, after his adventures in Poland and the exile which followed them, came back to the surface. He was a tall man, very well made, with a handsome face, much cleverness, and above all, grace and polished manners; all kinds of knowledge, a most agreeable way of expressing himself, a touching voice, a gentle eloquence, insinuating, manly, exact in terms, charming in style, a gift of speech that was wholly his own; all about him was original and persuasive; amusing in narratives; possessed of a smattering of all the arts, all the manufactures, all the professions. In whatever belonged to his own, that is, learning and the ecclesiastical calling, he was rather less versed. \u2026 In other respects he was wholly occupied with his own ambition, without friendship, without gratitude, without any feeling except for himself; false, lax, indifferent to the means of success; without restraint from God or man, but always with a cloak of delicacy which gave him dupes; above all, a libertine, more from facility, coquetry, ambition, than from natural debauchery; so that while the heart was false and the soul not upright, his judgment was nil, his actions erroneous, his mind inaccurate, which, in spite of the most gracious and deceptive exterior, caused the failure in his hands of every enterprise intrusted to him.\n\n\"With a face and talents so fitted to impress others, he was aided by his birth, to which, however, his property did not respond; but that fact dispelled all envy and conciliated favour and good will. The most amiable ladies of the Court, those even of advanced age, the men most distinguished for place or reputation, the persons of both sexes who chiefly set the tone,\u2014he won them all. Even the King succumbed to him through M. du Maine, to whose wife he was devoted. He was on all the Marly trips, end every one was eager to enjoy his charms; he had them for all sorts of conditions, persons, and minds....\"\n\n==Literary prestige==\n\nOn May 26, 1704, Abbe de Polignac was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]], to the seat once held by Bossuet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/melchior-de-polignac?fauteuil=37&election=26-05-1704|title=Melchior de POLIGNAC {{!}} Acad\u00e9mie fran\u00e7aise|website=www.academie-francaise.fr|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> His inauguration speech survives.<ref>His address to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise on his inauguration is printed in the ''Eloge'' by M. de Boze, in M. de Genoude, ''La Raison de Christianit\u00e9'' Tome second (Paris 1841, 220-231, at pp. 227-229).</ref> In 1715 he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences]], and was its President several times. In 1717, he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]].\n\nHe left unfinished a refutation of [[Lucretius]], written in Latin verse,<ref>Melchior de Polignac, ''Anti-Lucretius, sive De Deo et natura, libri novem (C. d'Orl\u00e9ans de Rothelin cur\u00e2 & studio ed. mandatum)''  2 vols.

Polignac's poem was very popular in the eighteenth century and translated several times: for example, [[Jean-Pierre de Bougainville]] translated it into French prose in 1749,<ref>''L'anti-Lucrece, po\u00e8me sur la religion naturelle, compos\u00e9 par M. le cardinal de Polignac; traduit par M. de Bougainville, de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Belles-Lettres,''  (Paris 1749).</ref> and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9rardier de Bataut]] translated it in French verse in 1786.  It was translated into English by [[George Canning]] in 1766 in a self-published tome. It is now forgotten.\n\n==Ecclesiastical career==\n\nPope [[Clement XI]] (Altieri) had been watching Polignac's career. On May 17, 1706, he showed his favor by naming Polignac an Auditor of the Rota (one of the Church's highest courts), a post made vacant by the promotion of Msgr. Joseph-Emmanuel de la Tr\u00e9moille to the cardinalate.<ref>Pierre La Croix and Jean Arnaud, ''M\u00e9moire historique sur les Institutions de la France \u00e0 Rome'' (Rome 1892),  p. 33.</ref> He spent the next three years in Rome.<ref>\"Eloge\", '' Histoire de l' Acad\u00e9mie des sciences'' (1744), p. 186-187.</ref>  In 1712, he was created a [[Cardinal Deacon]] by Pope Clement XI (Altieri) on May 18, 1712, but the nomination was made ''in pectore'', that is, his appointment was not made public at the time; it was only announced on January 30, 1713. At the time Polignac was a negotiator residing in a Protestant country, and it was deemed inadvisable to disrupt the course of events or cause offense by making his elevation public. While in Holland, he met and conversed with the famous Protestant philosophe, [[Pierre Bayle]], who had begun publishing the Dictionnaire in 1697. Once the Peace was concluded, he was presented with the red biretta at Versailles by Louis XIV on June 6, 1713. He did not go to Rome for the induction ceremonies, and thus had no deaconry assigned to him for many years. He did not attend the Conclave of April\u2013May 1721, which elected [[Innocent XIII]] (de' Conti), having been forbidden to travel to Rome by the French Regent, Philippe d' Orleans. But he was present at the Conclave of 1724, though he made a very late appearance on April 23, after the Conclave had been in progress for seven weeks.<ref>[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1724.html Conclave of 1724 (J.P. Adams)].</ref> He was eligible to participate, since he had finally been ordained deacon and priest, on September 8 and September 19 of 1722, by Msgr. Pierre Sabatier, the [[Bishop of Amiens]].<ref>E. A. Escallier, ''L' Abbaye d' Anchin, 1079-1792'' (Lille 1852), pp. 487-488.</ref> After the Conclave, on September 27, the new Pope named him Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Porticu. Polignac immediately wrote an account of the Conclave and sent it off to the new First Minister of [[Louis XV]], [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon]].<ref>Faucher, II, pp. 99-100.</ref> The Duke was so highly impressed by the report, both in content and style, that he had the King name Polignac French [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] to the [[Holy See]], a post he held until 1732.<ref>Pierre La Croix and Jean Arnaud, ''M\u00e9moire historique sur les Institutions de la France \u00e0 Rome'' (Rome 1892),  p. 160.</ref> He was thus absent from France for eight years.\n\nOn November 20, [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (Orsini) promoted him to being [[Cardinal Priest]] of S. Maria in Via. On December 19, 1725, he transferred to the title of S. Maria degli Angeli. These promotions were conditioned, to be sure, by his appointment as Charg\u00e9 d'affaires. Also in 1724, Polignac was elected a member of the Roman Arcadian Academy, founded in 1692 in memory of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]]; his academy name was Teodosso Cesisio.<ref>Pier Antonio Corsignani, \"Vita del Cardinale Melchiorre di Polignac,\" in G. M. Crescimbeni, ''Vite degli illustri Arcadi'' V, 203-224, at 214.</ref> In 1730 he was in Rome and participated in the four-month-long Conclave which elected [[Clement XII]] (Corsini).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1730.html|title=SEDE VACANTE 1730|website=www.csun.edu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> He did not, at the age of 78, travel to Rome for the Conclave of 1740.\n\n==His position in French society==\n\nDuring the last years of Louis XIV, Abb\u00e9 de Polignac enjoyed the position of Master of the King's Chapel (1713-1716).<ref>\"Eloge\", '' Histoire de l' Acad\u00e9mie des sciences'' (1744), p. 189.</ref> But during the Regency Polignac became involved in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]], which attempted to dislodge Philippe d'Orleans from the Regency, and replace him with [[Philip V of Spain]], uncle of the young King Louis XV. Polignac was relegated to [[Flanders]] and confined to his Abbey d'Anchin for three years.<ref>E. A. Escallier,  ''L' Abbaye d' Anchin, 1079-1792'' (Lille 1852), pp. 488-489.</ref> As soon as Louis XV attained his majority, however, he had Polignac rehabilitated and restored to his positions.

In 1693 he was sent as ambassador to [[Poland]], where he worked with Cardinal [[Michal Stefan Radziejowski|Augustyn Michal Stefan Radziejowski]], the [[Primate of Poland]] and nephew of King John III Sobieski, to bring about the election of [[Fran\u00e7ois-Louis de Bourbon, prince de Conti]] as successor to [[John Sobieski]] (1697). The other candidate, [[Augustus the Strong]] of Saxony, however, was supported by Austria and Russia, and was elected over the French candidate. The subsequent failure of this intrigue led to Polignac's temporary disgrace, and retirement to his Abbey of Bon-Port, but in 1702 he was restored to favour. In 1709 he was sent along with Nicholas du Bl\u00e9, Mar\u00e9chal d'Huxelles, as plenipotentiaries to conduct negotiations toward peace at the Dutch town of [[Geertruidenberg]], but thanks to the obstinacy of Louis XIV, they were unsuccessful. Polignac left Getruidenberg on July 25, 1710, and had an interview with Louis XIV at Versailles on July 31.<ref>Faucher, II, 4-98.</ref> In 1712 he was sent, again along with the Mar\u00e9chal d'Huxelles, as a [[plenipotentiary]] of [[Louis XIV of France]], to the [[Congress of Utrecht]], and this time a peace was concluded.\n\n==Character portrait==\n\nThe [[Louis de Rouvroy, duc de Saint-Simon|Duc de Saint-Simon]] provides a character portrait of the Abbe de Polignac around the end of 1705, as he was trying to restart his career and climb back into the notice of the French government, in particular the Duc de Bourbon\u2014a portrait full of Saint-Simon's usual snobbery and malevolence:<ref>''Memoirs of the Duc de Saint-Simon'' (tr. K.P. Wormeley) I (Boston 1899), 311-313.</ref>\n\n\"The Abbe de Polignac, after his adventures in Poland and the exile which followed them, came back to the surface. He was a tall man, very well made, with a handsome face, much cleverness, and above all, grace and polished manners; all kinds of knowledge, a most agreeable way of expressing himself, a touching voice, a gentle eloquence, insinuating, manly, exact in terms, charming in style, a gift of speech that was wholly his own; all about him was original and persuasive; amusing in narratives; possessed of a smattering of all the arts, all the manufactures, all the professions. In whatever belonged to his own, that is, learning and the ecclesiastical calling, he was rather less versed. \u2026 In other respects he was wholly occupied with his own ambition, without friendship, without gratitude, without any feeling except for himself; false, lax, indifferent to the means of success; without restraint from God or man, but always with a cloak of delicacy which gave him dupes; above all, a libertine, more from facility, coquetry, ambition, than from natural debauchery; so that while the heart was false and the soul not upright, his judgment was nil, his actions erroneous, his mind inaccurate, which, in spite of the most gracious and deceptive exterior, caused the failure in his hands of every enterprise intrusted to him.\n\n\"With a face and talents so fitted to impress others, he was aided by his birth, to which, however, his property did not respond; but that fact dispelled all envy and conciliated favour and good will. The most amiable ladies of the Court, those even of advanced age, the men most distinguished for place or reputation, the persons of both sexes who chiefly set the tone,\u2014 he won them all. Even the King succumbed to him through M. du Maine, to whose wife he was devoted. He was on all the Marly trips, end every one was eager to enjoy his charms; he had them for all sorts of conditions, persons, and minds....\"\n\n==Literary prestige==\n\nOn May 26, 1704, Abbe de Polignac was elected to the [[Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise]], to the seat once held by Bossuet.<ref>[http://www.academie-francaise.fr/les-immortels/melchior-de-polignac?fauteuil=37&election=26-05-1704 Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise-Polignac]</ref> His inauguration speech survives.<ref>His address to the Acad\u00e9mie Fran\u00e7aise on his inauguration is printed in the ''Eloge'' by M. de Boze, in M. de Genoude, ''La Raison de Christianit\u00e9'' Tome second (Paris 1841, 220-231, at pp. 227-229).</ref> In 1715 he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie royale des sciences]], and was its President several times. In 1717, he became a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres]].\n\nHe left unfinished a refutation of [[Lucretius]], written in Latin verse,<ref>Melchior de Polignac, ''Anti-Lucretius, sive De Deo et natura, libri novem (C. d'Orl\u00e9ans de Rothelin cur\u00e2 & studio ed. mandatum)''  2 vols.

Polignac's poem was very popular in the eighteenth century and translated several times: for example, [[Jean-Pierre de Bougainville]] translated it into French prose in 1749,<ref>''L'anti-Lucrece, po\u00e8me sur la religion naturelle, compos\u00e9 par M. le cardinal de Polignac; traduit par M. de Bougainville, de l'Acad\u00e9mie Royale des Belles-Lettres,''  (Paris 1749).</ref> and [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph B\u00e9rardier de Bataut]] translated it in French verse in 1786.  It was translated into English by [[George Canning]] in 1766 in a self-published tome. It is now forgotten.\n\n==Ecclesiastical career==\n\nPope [[Clement XI]] (Altieri) had been watching Polignac's career. On May 17, 1706, he showed his favor by naming Polignac an Auditor of the Rota (one of the Church's highest courts), a post made vacant by the promotion of Msgr. Joseph-Emmanuel de la Tr\u00e9moille to the cardinalate.<ref>Pierre La Croix and Jean Arnaud, ''M\u00e9moire historique sur les Institutions de la France \u00e0 Rome'' (Rome 1892),  p. 33.</ref> He spent the next three years in Rome.<ref>\"Eloge\", '' Histoire de l' Acad\u00e9mie des sciences'' (1744), p. 186-187.</ref>  In 1712, he was created a [[Cardinal Deacon]] by Pope Clement XI (Altieri) on May 18, 1712, but the nomination was made ''in pectore'', that is, his appointment was not made public at the time; it was only announced on January 30, 1713. At the time Polignac was a negotiator residing in a Protestant country, and it was deemed inadvisable to disrupt the course of events or cause offense by making his elevation public. While in Holland, he met and conversed with the famous Protestant philosophe, [[Pierre Bayle]], who had begun publishing the Dictionnaire in 1697. Once the Peace was concluded, he was presented with the red biretta at Versailles by Louis XIV on June 6, 1713. He did not go to Rome for the induction ceremonies, and thus had no deaconry assigned to him for many years. He did not attend the Conclave of April\u2013May 1721, which elected [[Innocent XIII]] (de' Conti), having been forbidden to travel to Rome by the French Regent, Philippe d' Orleans. But he was present at the Conclave of 1724, though he made a very late appearance on April 23, after the Conclave had been in progress for seven weeks.<ref>[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1724.html Conclave of 1724 (J.P. Adams)].</ref> He was eligible to participate, since he had finally been ordained deacon and priest, on September 8 and September 19 of 1722, by Msgr. Pierre Sabatier, the [[Bishop of Amiens]].<ref>E. A. Escallier, ''L' Abbaye d' Anchin, 1079-1792'' (Lille 1852), pp. 487-488.</ref> After the Conclave, on September 27, the new Pope named him Cardinal Deacon of S. Maria in Porticu. Polignac immediately wrote an account of the Conclave and sent it off to the new First Minister of [[Louis XV]], [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon]].<ref>Faucher, II, pp. 99-100.</ref> The Duke was so highly impressed by the report, both in content and style, that he had the King name Polignac French [[Charg\u00e9 d'affaires]] to the [[Holy See]], a post he held until 1732.<ref>Pierre La Croix and Jean Arnaud, ''M\u00e9moire historique sur les Institutions de la France \u00e0 Rome'' (Rome 1892),  p. 160.</ref> He was thus absent from France for eight years.\n\nOn November 20, [[Pope Benedict XIII|Benedict XIII]] (Orsini) promoted him to being [[Cardinal Priest]] of S. Maria in Via. On December 19, 1725, he transferred to the title of S. Maria degli Angeli. These promotions were conditioned, to be sure, by his appointment as Charg\u00e9 d'affaires. Also in 1724, Polignac was elected a member of the Roman Arcadian Academy, founded in 1692 in memory of Queen [[Christina of Sweden]]; his academy name was Teodosso Cesisio.<ref>Pier Antonio Corsignani, \"Vita del Cardinale Melchiorre di Polignac,\" in G. M. Crescimbeni, ''Vite degli illustri Arcadi'' V, 203-224, at 214.</ref> In 1730 he was in Rome and participated in the four-month-long Conclave which elected [[Clement XII]] (Corsini).<ref>[http://www.csun.edu/~hcfll004/SV1730.html Conclave of 1730 (J. P. Adams)]</ref> He did not, at the age of 78, travel to Rome for the Conclave of 1740.\n\n==His position in French society==\n\nDuring the last years of Louis XIV, Abb\u00e9 de Polignac enjoyed the position of Master of the King's Chapel (1713-1716).<ref>\"Eloge\", '' Histoire de l' Acad\u00e9mie des sciences'' (1744), p. 189.</ref> But during the Regency Polignac became involved in the [[Cellamare Conspiracy]], which attempted to dislodge Philippe d'Orleans from the Regency, and replace him with [[Philip V of Spain]], uncle of the young King Louis XV. Polignac was relegated to [[Flanders]] and confined to his Abbey d'Anchin for three years.<ref>E. A. Escallier,  ''L' Abbaye d' Anchin, 1079-1792'' (Lille 1852), pp. 488-489.</ref> As soon as Louis XV attained his majority, however, he had Polignac rehabilitated and restored to his positions. In 1726, he received the [[Archdiocese of Auch|Archbishopric of Auch]].<ref>L.-C. de Brugules, ''Chroniques ecclesiastiques du diocese d' Auch'' (Toulouse 1746), pp. 174-175.</ref>  He was consecrated in Rome by Pope Benedict XIII. In 1728 he was granted the Collar of the [[Order of the Holy Spirit]].\n\n==Death==\n\nHe died at his home in what is now 80-88 [[rue Bonaparte]] in the 6th Arondissement in [[Paris]] (also known as the ''H\u00f4tel Polignac''), on November 20, 1742, at the age of 80, of \"hydropsie\". He was buried in the Church of S. Sulpice in Paris.<ref>Guarnacci, p. 253.</ref>  At the time of his death, he was also Abbot of Begars, Mouron, and Corbie; and Prior of Montdidier, Voute-sur-Loire, and Nagent le Rotron.<ref>L.-C. de Brugules, ''Chroniques ecclesiastiques du diocese d' Auch'' (Toulouse 1746), p. 174.</ref>  After his death [[Frederick the Great]] bought his acclaimed collection of marble statues, which he had collected through his archaeological work in Rome.<ref>A.

The battle was fought on Phou Pha Thi mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], [[Laos]], on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, and derives its name from the mountaintop where it was fought or from the designation of a {{convert|700|ft|sp=us}} landing strip in the valley below, and was the largest single ground combat loss of United States Air Force members during the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War and the Laotian Civil War, Phou Pha Thi mountain was an important strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, the [[United States Ambassador to Laos]] [[William H. Sullivan]] approved a plan by the USAF to construct a [[TACAN]] site atop Phou Pha Thi; at the time they lacked a navigation site with sufficient range to guide US bomber aircraft to their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather [[Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central|AN/TSQ-81]] radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night, and in all types of weather, an operation code-named [[1st Combat Evaluation Group#Laos|Commando Club]]. Despite US efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included \"sheep-dipping\" of the airmen involved, US operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the PAVN and Pathet Lao forces.\n\nToward the end of 1967, PAVN units increased the tempo of their operations around Phou Pha Thi, and by 1968 several attacks were launched against Lima Site 85. In the final assault on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, elements of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion attacked the facility, with support from the VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion. The Hmong and Thai forces defending the facility were overwhelmed by the combined PAVN and Pathet Lao forces.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also| Lima Site 85}}\n\nPhou Pha Thi is a remote mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], northeastern [[Laos]]. The mountain, which is about {{convert|1,700|m|sp=us}} high, is located within the former [[Royal Lao Army]]'s Military Region 2, and about {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} from the border of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and {{convert|48|km|sp=us}} away from [[Sam Neua]], the Pathet Lao capital. For the local [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Yao people|Yao]] tribes that lived in the area, Phou Pha Thi was a place of religious significance. They believed it was inhabited by spirits possessing supernatural powers to exercise control over their lives. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) saw Phou Pha Thi as an ideal location for installing a radar navigation system to assist US pilots in their [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing campaigns]] in North Vietnam, and along the [[Operation Barrel Roll|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] inside Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 22\">Chauhan, p. 22</ref>\n\nLaos was a neutral country according to the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]] signed on 23&nbsp;July&nbsp;1962. Therefore, the US was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had to be approved by the US Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]]. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that [[Prime Minister of Laos|Laotian Prime Minister]] Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by US military personnel.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\">Thompson, p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:Phou Pha Thi.gif|thumb|Phou Pha Thi, in northeastern [[Laos]], the site of a U.S. TACAN facility known as Lima Site 85.]]\n\nIn August 1966, the USAF installed a [[TACAN]] System, an autonomous radio transmitter that provided pilots and navigators with distance and bearing relative to the station on Phou Pha Thi. In 1967, under the code name ''Heavy Green'', the facility was upgraded with the TSQ-81<!-- when using AN/ nomenclature, it is common practice to use AN/ initially, then drop it until encounter a different AN/ item-->, which could direct and control attacking jet fighters and bombers to their targets and provide them with precise bomb release points. It began operating in late November 1967 as Operation Commando Club.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\">{{cite web|url=http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |title=Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85 |author=Edward Vallentiny |date=9 August 1968 |publisher=HQ PACAF Directorate, Tactical Evaluation CHECO Division |accessdate=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102828/http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> To operate the equipment within the limitations imposed by the Laotian Prime Minister, USAF personnel assigned to work at the installation had to sign paperwork that temporarily released them from military service, and to work in the guise of civilian technicians from [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]]<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/>&nbsp;\u2014 a process euphemistically called \"sheep-dipping.\" In reality, they operated as members of the USAF Circuit Rider teams from the [[1st Combat Communications Squadron|1st Mobile Communications Group]] based at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] who rotated to the site every seven days.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\">Chauhan, p. 23</ref>\n\nPersonnel working at the TACAN site were supplied by weekly flights of the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]], based at Udorn RTAFB in northeastern Thailand operating under the code name [[Operation Pony Express]], using Lima Site 85, the {{convert|700|m|sp=us}} airstrip constructed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the valley below. Hmong General [[Vang Pao]], who spearheaded the allied war effort against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in Military Region 2, was entrusted with the task of guarding the facility using the Hmong Clandestine Army alongside CIA-funded Thai [[Border Patrol Police#Border Patrol Police Aerial Resupply Unit|Border Patrol Police]] forces.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/> Though substantial resources were invested to maintain the facility, the USAF command doubted Vang Pao's ability to defend the installation. Accordingly, all equipment had explosives attached so that if the site was overrun, it could be quickly destroyed.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/> By late 1967, Lima Site 85's radar directed 55% of all bombing operations against North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nAs USAF ground controllers were able to guide attacking aircraft against North Vietnamese targets in all types of weather, installation of the TSQ-81 radar system on Phou Pha Thi was considered to have been extremely successful during the final months of 1967. Yet a formerly top-secret after-action report credited Commando Club with guiding the following sorties:<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n::\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Major [[Richard Secord]], who was responsible for the security of Lima Site 85, was concerned about the safety of the unarmed USAF technicians working there dressed as civilians. He requested [[Green Berets]] be assigned as on-site security. Ambassador Sullivan turned down the request. Sullivan repeatedly insisted the \"civilian personnel\" at Lima Site 85 should not be armed, but Secord decided to equip the technicians with weapons. [[M16 rifle]]s, fragmentation grenades, concussion grenades, and other [[small arms]] were then brought in.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178</ref> Secord said that given the site's meager defenses, he felt the site could not be held against a serious assault.<ref>Secord, Wurts, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nSecord's fears were justified, as USAF reconnaissance aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 revealed that the paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road construction activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected [[Dien Bien Phu]] in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/>\n\nRealizing the PAVN would try to destroy the installation, Secord advised the US Embassy in [[Vientiane]] to evacuate all US personnel. However, high-ranking US officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped save the lives of US pilots every day it remained operational.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15&nbsp;December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both PAVN and [[Pathet Lao]] battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\">Chauhan, p. 24</ref>\n\nOn 16&nbsp;December, two Pathet Lao companies overran Phou Den Din, only {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} east of Lima Site 85. Shortly afterwards, Hmong units recaptured the village.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> Toward the end of 1967, US controllers at Lima Site 85 directed [[F-4 Phantom|F-4]], [[F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]] and [[A-1 Skyraider|A-1]] fighter-bombers based in Thailand and South Vietnam in air strikes against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao formations that were massing around the US facility at Phou Pha Thi. [[A-26 Invader]]s were called in for night missions, targeting movements of the enemy ground troops on Route 6 and Route 19. On 14&nbsp;January&nbsp;1968, the situation in northeastern Laos continued to worsen, as an estimated four PAVN infantry battalions captured the Laotian government's stronghold at Nam Bac. Despite the growing threat from North Vietnamese forces, the US military was still not permitted to reinforce the installation on Phou Pha Thi Mountain due to political sensitivities.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Image:Painting lima85.jpg|thumb|\"An Air Combat First\"&nbsp;\u2013 CIA painting of Air America helicopter engaging 2 VPAF An-2 biplanes]]\n\nThe defense of Lima Site 85 was assigned to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\">Chauhan, p. 25</ref> In the first week of 1968, the combined PAVN and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10&nbsp;January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, US technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\nOn 12&nbsp;January, CIA spotters reported a four-aircraft formation flying in the direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made [[Antonov An-2]] biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\"/> The [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120&nbsp;mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57&nbsp;mm rockets mounted on the wing pods.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p.180</ref> As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and US controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. As he pulled alongside, flight mechanic Glenn Woods armed with an [[AK-47]] assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no2/iac/an-air-combat-first.html|title=An Air Combat First \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining An-2s had observed the attack from a distance and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, had been killed by the communist attack. The TSQ-81 radar and associated equipment were undamaged.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\"/> Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the [[That Luang]] Monument, Vientiane's most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom.<ref>Goldstein, p. 310</ref> Despite the attack, the US Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the US military took no steps to strengthen the defenses.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\">Chauhan, p. 26</ref> In late February, a [[Combat Controller]], [[Technical Sergeant]] James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes.<ref>Castle, pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.<ref>Castle, pp. 100\u2013101, 286\u2013287</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===North Vietnamese plan and preparations===\nOn 18&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, a PAVN artillery survey team was ambushed near Lima Site 85 by Hmong reconnaissance teams, killing a PAVN officer in the process. The dead officer, who was a major, carried a notebook which revealed a plan to attack Phou Pha Thi by using three PAVN battalions and one Pathet Lao battalion.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\"/> Consequently, US personnel at Lima Site 85 directed 342 air strikes within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of their own facility to disrupt their opponent's build-up during 20\u201329 February.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\"/> Unknown to the USAF, the PAVN had also drawn up their plan to capture Lima Site 85 by deploying a [[Special Forces]] unit. The task of capturing the US facility was entrusted to a [[platoon]] from the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion, led by First Lieutenant Truong Muc. The platoon numbered 33 soldiers, and they were reinforced by a nine-man sapper squad and a communications and cryptography squad.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\">Do, p. 185</ref>\n\nPrior to the mission, Muc's soldiers had undergone nine months of special training, mainly focused on mountain fighting techniques and jungle operations. They also conducted physical conditioning, to improve their physical fitness and stamina to undertake operations in the most extreme conditions in Laotian territory. On 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;1967, following their intensive training, soldiers of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion launched the first phase of their operation by conducting terrain reconnaissance and watching activities on Lima Site 85 to learn their opponent's routines. As part of the second phase, commenced on 22 January 1968, six PAVN sappers were sent out to climb Phou Pha Thi, to pinpoint opposing positions in and around Lima Site 85, as well as routes of withdrawal.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> On 28&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, the PAVN Special Forces completed their preparations, and they began marching towards their assembly point on 1&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 186\">Do, p. 186</ref>\n\nTo maintain secrecy and surprise, Muc was ordered to avoid contact with local civilians and opposing military forces. In the event they were engaged by opposing forces, the PAVN would deploy a small force to deal with the situation while the main formation would continue moving to their objective on Phou Pha Thi. Once the PAVN formation had arrived at their assembly area, they were to be divided into two assault groups. The first assault group, under Muc's direct command, was divided into five \"cells\" to attack key targets at Lima Site 85. Cells 1 and 2 were given the mission of capturing the communications center, with the latter given the secondary role of supporting Cell 3, which was given the main mission of seizing the TACAN site and eliminating all US personnel. Cell 4 was to capture the airstrip, and Cell 5 was placed in reserve. Second Lieutenant Nguyen Viet Hung was given responsibility to lead the second assault group with the mission of neutralizing the Thai positions. The attack would commence during the early hours of 9&nbsp;or&nbsp;10&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\">Do, p. 187</ref>\n\nTo capture Lima Site 85, the PAVN Special Forces were equipped with three Chinese-made [[K-54]] pistols, 23 AK-47 assault rifles, four 7.62mm carbines and three [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled grenade launchers.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> They carried 200 rounds of ammunition for each AK-47, six rounds for each RPG, {{convert|400|g|sp=us}} of explosives, and six hand grenades. The weapons load, in addition to 15 days of rations and other personal items, required each soldier to pack between {{convert|42|kg|sp=us}} to {{convert|45|kg|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> Shortly after the PAVN Special Forces arrived at the assembly point, they moved off to an undisclosed location for two days to test-fire all their weapons, and to ensure their explosives were in working order. Then, in an attempt to fool Hmong and US intelligence, the North Vietnamese made diversionary movements against Muong Son to cover their main assault. On 9 March, elements of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion arrived in the vicinity of Phou Pha Thi, where they made final preparations for their assault.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lima Site 85===\nBy 9&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, the US facility atop Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by PAVN and Pathet Lao units. The PAVN 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite the gravity of the situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of US personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10&nbsp;March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\">Chauhan, p. 27</ref><ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183</ref> Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the PAVN Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> Inside the facility, US technicians grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, abandoning the equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the US technicians returned to their positions.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/>\n\nThe TSQ-81 antenna received minor damage during the attack, and the US suffered no casualties. The only 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, which was operated by the Hmongs, received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the US commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, on the basis that the situation had become critical.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\"/> About 20 minutes later, the 33-man PAVN platoon began climbing towards the US facility at Lima Site 85.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\">Do, p. 188</ref> At 21:15 Sullivan considered evacuating all US personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the [[Seventh Air Force]] contacted the US Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thi was no longer under their control.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\">Chauhan, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:LimaSite85-descriptions.jpg|thumb|The configuration of Lima Site 85.]]\n\nAt 21:21 the PAVN resumed their artillery attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the PAVN 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan to order the evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 US personnel.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> Starting at 01:00 on 11&nbsp;March, the PAVN moved into their assigned positions to launch their attack.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> About 02:00, a US adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with US technicians at Lima Site 85 was cut off.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> Afterwards, Secord briefed US A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of US personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184</ref>\n\nAbout 03:00 Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|150|m|sp=us}} of their objective, with Cell 5 positioned behind them. At the same time, the commander of Cell 4 decided to maneuver his unit to the west side of the airstrip instead of the east side as originally planned, because the terrain on the east side was higher and was covered by buildings. Precisely at 03:45, Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of the communications center, when they bumped into a Hmong outpost. Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly after, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the TACAN antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1's RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the TACAN installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electric generators.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/>\n\nUpon hearing the noise of explosions, the on-duty US technicians rushed out the front door of their operations building where they were met by PAVN gunfire. Blanton, the US commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other US technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to the west side of the mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the US technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M16s and hand grenades.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the US technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\">Do, p. 189</ref>\n\n[[Raven Forward Air Controllers]] at [[Lima Site 20A]], being the nearest available American support, were awakened by a radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn.<ref>Robbins, p. 57</ref> At 05:15 Sullivan, from the US Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85. He gave a signal to US pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. Sullivan did not realize that US technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\"/> Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against PAVN positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the PAVN held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the PAVN fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\nAt first light Air America helicopters hovered over Lima Site 85 to start the evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the US technicians that help was coming.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185</ref> In response, the PAVN Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/> While US fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\"/> Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead US personnel on Lima Site 85, along with a number of wounded Hmong soldiers.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\">Chauhan, p. 29</ref> By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14&nbsp;March when they withdrew from the area.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJust before midday on 11&nbsp;March, the USAF turned their attention (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, along with all the documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12\u201318&nbsp;March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19&nbsp;March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also have had the effect of obliterating the bodies of US personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that US technicians operating there should have been evacuated on 10&nbsp;March, when it became amply clear the PAVN were preparing to launch an assault.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/>\n\nFor the USAF, the loss at Phou Pha Thi was not a result of intelligence failure, because it had been provided with accurate information from the very start. Instead, it was clearly a failure of command and control, as the US personnel and their Hmong allies were not permitted to freely organize their own defense to hold the radar facility.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/> The Battle of Lima Site 85 resulted in the largest single ground combat loss of USAF personnel during the Vietnam War.<ref>Marrett, p. 26</ref> A total of 12 US personnel went missing or were killed in the fighting on Phou Pha Thi; 11 were killed or missing on the ground and one was shot dead during the evacuation.<ref>Chauhan, pp. 28\u201329</ref><ref>The single fatality occurring during the evacuation was 1043rd Radar Evaluation Squadron member Air Force [[Chief Master Sergeant]] [[Richard Etchberger]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously in September 2010 for his role in helping four injured airmen into the evacuation helicopter lift sling.}</ref><ref name=Warner233>Warner, pp 233\u2013235</ref> In addition a USAF A-1 searching for survivors was shot down and the pilot killed.\n\nThe total casualty figures for PAVN, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed a total of 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, and a number of others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the PAVN, including one 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, one 85&nbsp;mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and vast amounts of ammunition.<ref name=\"Do, p. 201\">Do, p. 201</ref> The PAVN victory proved to be a significant one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damage to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructure.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\">Chauhan, p. 30</ref>\n\nThe fight at Phou Pha Thi, which was part of a larger military campaign waged by the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\"/> Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the US Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1&nbsp;November&nbsp;1968, Pao launched [[Operation Pigfat]] in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Lao Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.<ref>Robbins, p. 105</ref>\n\nAlthough airpower was to be a major factor in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without limitations and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November&nbsp;1967 to 11&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF effort, it was not crippling.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n\n[[File:1st mob patch.gif|thumb|The patch of the 1st AACS Mobile Communications Group present at Lima Site 85.]]\nEleven of the twelve USAF personnel lost on the day of the battle were listed first as [[missing in action]] (MIA), then later as [[killed in action|KIA]]/body not recovered.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p. 186</ref> Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/news/news_releases/2004/documents/AFMIA10705.pdf|title= Air Force Sergeant MIA from the Vietnam War is identified|date= 7 December 2005|publisher=Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> In 2002 two of the former PAVN soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.<ref name=\"The Fall of Lima Site 85\">{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2006/April%202006/0406lima.aspx|title= The Fall of Lima Site 85|author= John T.

The battle was fought on Phou Pha Thi mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], [[Laos]], on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, and derives its name from the mountaintop where it was fought or from the designation of a {{convert|700|ft|sp=us}} landing strip in the valley below, and was the largest single ground combat loss of United States Air Force members during the Vietnam War.\n\nDuring the Vietnam War and the Laotian Civil War, Phou Pha Thi mountain was an important strategic outpost which had served both sides at various stages of the conflict. In 1966, the [[United States Ambassador to Laos]] [[William H. Sullivan]] approved a plan by the USAF to construct a [[TACAN]] site atop Phou Pha Thi; at the time they lacked a navigation site with sufficient range to guide US bomber aircraft to their targets in North Vietnam. In 1967 the site was upgraded with the air-transportable all-weather [[Reeves AN/MSQ-77 Bomb Directing Central|AN/TSQ-81]] radar bombing control system. This enabled American aircraft to bomb North Vietnam and Laos at night, and in all types of weather, an operation code-named [[1st Combat Evaluation Group#Laos|Commando Club]]. Despite US efforts to maintain the secrecy of the installation, which included \"sheep-dipping\" of the airmen involved, US operations at the facility did not escape the attention of the PAVN and Pathet Lao forces.\n\nToward the end of 1967, PAVN units increased the tempo of their operations around Phou Pha Thi, and by 1968 several attacks were launched against Lima Site 85. In the final assault on 10&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, elements of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion attacked the facility, with support from the VPA 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion. The Hmong and Thai forces defending the facility were overwhelmed by the combined PAVN and Pathet Lao forces.\n\n==Background==\n{{see also| Lima Site 85}}\n\nPhou Pha Thi is a remote mountain in [[Houaphanh Province]], northeastern [[Laos]]. The mountain, which is about {{convert|1,700|m|sp=us}} high, is located within the former [[Royal Lao Army]]'s Military Region 2, and about {{convert|24|km|sp=us}} from the border of the [[Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and {{convert|48|km|sp=us}} away from [[Sam Neua]], the Pathet Lao capital. For the local [[Hmong people|Hmong]] and [[Yao people|Yao]] tribes that lived in the area, Phou Pha Thi was a place of religious significance. They believed it was inhabited by spirits possessing supernatural powers to exercise control over their lives. The [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) saw Phou Pha Thi as an ideal location for installing a radar navigation system to assist US pilots in their [[Operation Rolling Thunder|bombing campaigns]] in North Vietnam, and along the [[Operation Barrel Roll|Ho Chi Minh Trail]] inside Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 22\">Chauhan, p. 22</ref>\n\nLaos was a neutral country according to the [[International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos]] signed on 23&nbsp;July&nbsp;1962. Therefore, the US was prohibited from openly conducting military operations in the kingdom. Activities undertaken by the USAF in Laos had to be approved by the US Ambassador to Laos [[William H. Sullivan]]. When the plan to install a navigation system on Phou Pha Thi Mountain was proposed, Sullivan initially opposed it as he thought that [[Prime Minister of Laos|Laotian Prime Minister]] Prince [[Souvanna Phouma]] would not allow his country to be involved in an aerial offensive against North Vietnam. Souvanna Phouma did permit the installation, on the condition that it not be manned by US military personnel.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\">Thompson, p. 102</ref>\n\n[[File:Phou Pha Thi.gif|thumb|Phou Pha Thi, in northeastern [[Laos]], the site of a U.S. TACAN facility known as Lima Site 85.]]\n\nIn August 1966, the USAF installed a [[TACAN]] System, an autonomous radio transmitter that provided pilots and navigators with distance and bearing relative to the station on Phou Pha Thi. In 1967, under the code name ''Heavy Green'', the facility was upgraded with the TSQ-81<!-- when using AN/ nomenclature, it is common practice to use AN/ initially, then drop it until encounter a different AN/ item-->, which could direct and control attacking jet fighters and bombers to their targets and provide them with precise bomb release points. It began operating in late November 1967 as Operation Commando Club.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\">{{cite web|url=http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |title=Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85 |author=Edward Vallentiny |date=9 August 1968 |publisher=HQ PACAF Directorate, Tactical Evaluation CHECO Division |accessdate=24 July 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717102828/http://combat-skyspot.tripod.com/commandoclub.htm |archivedate=17 July 2011 }}</ref> To operate the equipment within the limitations imposed by the Laotian Prime Minister, USAF personnel assigned to work at the installation had to sign paperwork that temporarily released them from military service, and to work in the guise of civilian technicians from [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed]]<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/>&nbsp;\u2014 a process euphemistically called \"sheep-dipping.\" In reality, they operated as members of the USAF Circuit Rider teams from the [[1st Combat Communications Squadron|1st Mobile Communications Group]] based at [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] who rotated to the site every seven days.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\">Chauhan, p. 23</ref>\n\nPersonnel working at the TACAN site were supplied by weekly flights of the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]], based at Udorn RTAFB in northeastern Thailand operating under the code name [[Operation Pony Express]], using Lima Site 85, the {{convert|700|m|sp=us}} airstrip constructed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in the valley below. Hmong General [[Vang Pao]], who spearheaded the allied war effort against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao forces in Military Region 2, was entrusted with the task of guarding the facility using the Hmong Clandestine Army alongside CIA-funded Thai [[Border Patrol Police#Border Patrol Police Aerial Resupply Unit|Border Patrol Police]] forces.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/> Though substantial resources were invested to maintain the facility, the USAF command doubted Vang Pao's ability to defend the installation. Accordingly, all equipment had explosives attached so that if the site was overrun, it could be quickly destroyed.<ref name=\"Thompson, p. 102\"/> By late 1967, Lima Site 85's radar directed 55% of all bombing operations against North Vietnam.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182</ref>\n\n==Prelude==\nAs USAF ground controllers were able to guide attacking aircraft against North Vietnamese targets in all types of weather, installation of the TSQ-81 radar system on Phou Pha Thi was considered to have been extremely successful during the final months of 1967. Yet a formerly top-secret after-action report credited Commando Club with guiding the following sorties:<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n::\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Major [[Richard Secord]], who was responsible for the security of Lima Site 85, was concerned about the safety of the unarmed USAF technicians working there dressed as civilians. He requested [[Green Berets]] be assigned as on-site security. Ambassador Sullivan turned down the request. Sullivan repeatedly insisted the \"civilian personnel\" at Lima Site 85 should not be armed, but Secord decided to equip the technicians with weapons. [[M16 rifle]]s, fragmentation grenades, concussion grenades, and other [[small arms]] were then brought in.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178</ref> Secord said that given the site's meager defenses, he felt the site could not be held against a serious assault.<ref>Secord, Wurts, pp. 75\u201377</ref>\n\nSecord's fears were justified, as USAF reconnaissance aircraft regularly flying over northeastern Laos in 1967 revealed that the paved roads constructed by the North Vietnamese were obviously approaching Phou Pha Thi. Road construction activities were observed along Routes 6 and 19, which connected [[Dien Bien Phu]] in North Vietnam with Phou Pha Thi and Nam Bac in Laos.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 23\"/>\n\nRealizing the PAVN would try to destroy the installation, Secord advised the US Embassy in [[Vientiane]] to evacuate all US personnel. However, high-ranking US officials insisted that Lima Site 85 should operate as long as possible, as it helped save the lives of US pilots every day it remained operational.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> In December 1967, a communist military offensive in the region was signalled by a series of skirmishes. On 15&nbsp;December, CIA-led Hmong reconnaissance patrols detected both PAVN and [[Pathet Lao]] battalions moving against Nam Bac, at the time the stronghold of the Royal Lao Army.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\">Chauhan, p. 24</ref>\n\nOn 16&nbsp;December, two Pathet Lao companies overran Phou Den Din, only {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} east of Lima Site 85. Shortly afterwards, Hmong units recaptured the village.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 178\"/> Toward the end of 1967, US controllers at Lima Site 85 directed [[F-4 Phantom|F-4]], [[F-105 Thunderchief|F-105]] and [[A-1 Skyraider|A-1]] fighter-bombers based in Thailand and South Vietnam in air strikes against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao formations that were massing around the US facility at Phou Pha Thi. [[A-26 Invader]]s were called in for night missions, targeting movements of the enemy ground troops on Route 6 and Route 19. On 14&nbsp;January&nbsp;1968, the situation in northeastern Laos continued to worsen, as an estimated four PAVN infantry battalions captured the Laotian government's stronghold at Nam Bac. Despite the growing threat from North Vietnamese forces, the US military was still not permitted to reinforce the installation on Phou Pha Thi Mountain due to political sensitivities.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\n[[Image:Painting lima85.jpg|thumb|\"An Air Combat First\"&nbsp;\u2013 CIA painting of Air America helicopter engaging 2 VPAF An-2 biplanes]]\n\nThe defense of Lima Site 85 was assigned to two CIA paramilitary officers who led about 1,000 Hmong soldiers, with 200 men guarding the ridge line and the remaining 800 in the valley below. They were reinforced by a Thai Border Patrol Police battalion of 300 men.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\">Chauhan, p. 25</ref> In the first week of 1968, the combined PAVN and Pathet Lao forces probed Royal Laos Army positions in the area by launching several artillery attacks. On 10&nbsp;January, a Pathet Lao patrol was driven from the area by the Hmong soldiers. Fearing the explosives attached to their equipment could be detonated by incoming artillery rounds, US technicians dismantled the charges and threw them over the cliff.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 24\"/>\n\nOn 12&nbsp;January, CIA spotters reported a four-aircraft formation flying in the direction of Lima Site 85. They were Soviet-made [[Antonov An-2]] biplanes. Two aircraft continued towards Lima Site 85, while the others turned away.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 25\"/> The [[Vietnam People's Air Force]], in one of its few air attacks during the conflict, tried to destroy the radar at Lima Site 85. The An-2s flew over Phou Pha Thi, and their crewmen dropped 120&nbsp;mm mortar shells through the aircraft's floor and then strafed their targets with 57&nbsp;mm rockets mounted on the wing pods.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p.180</ref> As they repeatedly attacked the facility, ground fire heavily damaged one AN-2, and it crashed into a mountainside. By now, CIA officers and US controllers at Lima Site 85 had managed to contact an [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] helicopter, which was faster than the Soviet-made biplanes. The Huey pilot Captain Ted Moore sighted the remaining An-2, and promptly gave chase. As he pulled alongside, flight mechanic Glenn Woods armed with an [[AK-47]] assault rifle opened fire and caused the biplane to crash into a ridge.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol52no2/iac/an-air-combat-first.html|title=An Air Combat First \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|website=www.cia.gov|access-date=2016-07-02}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining An-2s had observed the attack from a distance and managed to escape without damage. Four Hmongs, two men and two women, had been killed by the communist attack. The TSQ-81 radar and associated equipment were undamaged.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 181\"/> Shortly afterwards, what remained of one of the An-2 biplanes was put on display in front of the [[That Luang]] Monument, Vientiane's most important Buddhist shrine, as proof of North Vietnamese military activities in the kingdom.<ref>Goldstein, p. 310</ref> Despite the attack, the US Embassy in Vientiane and the USAF refused to alter their strategy for defending Lima Site 85. [[Lieutenant-Colonel]] Clarence F. Blanton, commander of USAF personnel at the facility, was given no authority to supervise his own perimeter or to order a retreat if they again came under attack. Throughout January and February, intelligence collected by the Hmongs confirmed that a major assault on Lima Site 85 was being prepared, but Sullivan and the US military took no steps to strengthen the defenses.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\">Chauhan, p. 26</ref> In late February, a [[Combat Controller]], [[Technical Sergeant]] James Gary, arrived to augment the defenses by directing air strikes.<ref>Castle, pp. 94\u201395</ref> He was replaced in this duty by Sergeant Roger D. Huffman on about 4 March.<ref>Castle, pp. 100\u2013101, 286\u2013287</ref>\n\n==Battle==\n\n===North Vietnamese plan and preparations===\nOn 18&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, a PAVN artillery survey team was ambushed near Lima Site 85 by Hmong reconnaissance teams, killing a PAVN officer in the process. The dead officer, who was a major, carried a notebook which revealed a plan to attack Phou Pha Thi by using three PAVN battalions and one Pathet Lao battalion.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 26\"/> Consequently, US personnel at Lima Site 85 directed 342 air strikes within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of their own facility to disrupt their opponent's build-up during 20\u201329 February.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 182\"/> Unknown to the USAF, the PAVN had also drawn up their plan to capture Lima Site 85 by deploying a [[Special Forces]] unit. The task of capturing the US facility was entrusted to a [[platoon]] from the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion, led by First Lieutenant Truong Muc. The platoon numbered 33 soldiers, and they were reinforced by a nine-man sapper squad and a communications and cryptography squad.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\">Do, p. 185</ref>\n\nPrior to the mission, Muc's soldiers had undergone nine months of special training, mainly focused on mountain fighting techniques and jungle operations. They also conducted physical conditioning, to improve their physical fitness and stamina to undertake operations in the most extreme conditions in Laotian territory. On 18&nbsp;December&nbsp;1967, following their intensive training, soldiers of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion launched the first phase of their operation by conducting terrain reconnaissance and watching activities on Lima Site 85 to learn their opponent's routines. As part of the second phase, commenced on 22 January 1968, six PAVN sappers were sent out to climb Phou Pha Thi, to pinpoint opposing positions in and around Lima Site 85, as well as routes of withdrawal.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> On 28&nbsp;February&nbsp;1968, the PAVN Special Forces completed their preparations, and they began marching towards their assembly point on 1&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 186\">Do, p. 186</ref>\n\nTo maintain secrecy and surprise, Muc was ordered to avoid contact with local civilians and opposing military forces. In the event they were engaged by opposing forces, the PAVN would deploy a small force to deal with the situation while the main formation would continue moving to their objective on Phou Pha Thi. Once the PAVN formation had arrived at their assembly area, they were to be divided into two assault groups. The first assault group, under Muc's direct command, was divided into five \"cells\" to attack key targets at Lima Site 85. Cells 1 and 2 were given the mission of capturing the communications center, with the latter given the secondary role of supporting Cell 3, which was given the main mission of seizing the TACAN site and eliminating all US personnel. Cell 4 was to capture the airstrip, and Cell 5 was placed in reserve. Second Lieutenant Nguyen Viet Hung was given responsibility to lead the second assault group with the mission of neutralizing the Thai positions. The attack would commence during the early hours of 9&nbsp;or&nbsp;10&nbsp;March.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\">Do, p. 187</ref>\n\nTo capture Lima Site 85, the PAVN Special Forces were equipped with three Chinese-made [[K-54]] pistols, 23 AK-47 assault rifles, four 7.62mm carbines and three [[RPG-7]] rocket propelled grenade launchers.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> They carried 200 rounds of ammunition for each AK-47, six rounds for each RPG, {{convert|400|g|sp=us}} of explosives, and six hand grenades. The weapons load, in addition to 15 days of rations and other personal items, required each soldier to pack between {{convert|42|kg|sp=us}} to {{convert|45|kg|sp=us}}.<ref name=\"Do, p. 185\"/> Shortly after the PAVN Special Forces arrived at the assembly point, they moved off to an undisclosed location for two days to test-fire all their weapons, and to ensure their explosives were in working order. Then, in an attempt to fool Hmong and US intelligence, the North Vietnamese made diversionary movements against Muong Son to cover their main assault. On 9 March, elements of the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion arrived in the vicinity of Phou Pha Thi, where they made final preparations for their assault.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/>\n\n===Fall of Lima Site 85===\nBy 9&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968, the US facility atop Phou Pha Thi was surrounded by PAVN and Pathet Lao units. The PAVN 766th Regiment and one Pathet Lao battalion totalled more than 3,000 men. Despite the gravity of the situation, Sullivan did not issue an order for the evacuation of US personnel from Phou Pha Thi. At around 18:00 on 10&nbsp;March, Lima Site 85 was subjected to a series of artillery barrages.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\">Chauhan, p. 27</ref><ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183</ref> Under the cover of the artillery bombardment, the PAVN Special Forces sent a small team up the mountain to defuse mines and quick-fuse grenades, and to establish their routes of infiltration.<ref name=\"Do, p. 187\"/> Inside the facility, US technicians grabbed their weapons and ran into trenches and bunkers, abandoning the equipment which could enable them to call for air support. At 19:45 the barrage stopped, and the US technicians returned to their positions.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/>\n\nThe TSQ-81 antenna received minor damage during the attack, and the US suffered no casualties. The only 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, which was operated by the Hmongs, received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the US commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, on the basis that the situation had become critical.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 27\"/> About 20 minutes later, the 33-man PAVN platoon began climbing towards the US facility at Lima Site 85.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\">Do, p. 188</ref> At 21:15 Sullivan considered evacuating all US personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the [[Seventh Air Force]] contacted the US Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thi was no longer under their control.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\">Chauhan, p. 28</ref>\n\n[[File:LimaSite85-descriptions.jpg|thumb|The configuration of Lima Site 85.]]\n\nAt 21:21 the PAVN resumed their artillery attack on Phou Pha Thi, followed by several infantry assaults by the PAVN 766th Regiment, which prompted Sullivan to order the evacuation of six technicians by 08:15 the next morning, from a contingent of 19 US personnel.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> Starting at 01:00 on 11&nbsp;March, the PAVN moved into their assigned positions to launch their attack.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> About 02:00, a US adviser at the airstrip reported to Secord and CIA officers at Udorn that he heard gunfire on top of Phou Pha Thi, and communication with US technicians at Lima Site 85 was cut off.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 183\"/> Afterwards, Secord briefed US A-1 Skyraider pilots in Thailand on the situation at Lima Site 85, to familiarize them with friendly positions around the facility, so they could cover the evacuation of US personnel and support the Hmong counterattack.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184</ref>\n\nAbout 03:00 Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|150|m|sp=us}} of their objective, with Cell 5 positioned behind them. At the same time, the commander of Cell 4 decided to maneuver his unit to the west side of the airstrip instead of the east side as originally planned, because the terrain on the east side was higher and was covered by buildings. Precisely at 03:45, Cell 1 moved to within {{convert|30|m|sp=us}} of the communications center, when they bumped into a Hmong outpost. Both sides exchanged fire, and the outpost was destroyed by a grenade while the Hmong soldier guarding the post retreated. Shortly after, a soldier from Cell 1 fired an RPG-7 grenade which destroyed the TACAN antenna. Within 15 minutes, Cells 1 and 2 had secured the communications site. Signaled by the explosion of Cell 1's RPG-7 round, Cell 3 immediately attacked the TACAN installation by firing one of their own RPG-7s, which destroyed the electric generators.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/>\n\nUpon hearing the noise of explosions, the on-duty US technicians rushed out the front door of their operations building where they were met by PAVN gunfire. Blanton, the US commander at Lima Site 85, was killed alongside two other US technicians. Those who were not killed retreated to the west side of the mountain, where they hid on the edge of the cliff. From their hideout, the US technicians fired on the North Vietnamese with their M16s and hand grenades.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 28\"/> At 04:15, in response to the gunfire from the US technicians, Muc ordered Cell 5 to reinforce Cell 3, and they captured the TACAN installation at 04:30 after 45 minutes of fighting.<ref name=\"Do, p. 188\"/> Meanwhile, Cell 4 had great difficulties in their attempt to seize the airstrip, where they were blocked by a Hmong mortar position. Le Ba Chom, the commander of Cell 4, was isolated from the other three soldiers of his cell. To avoid being captured alive by the numerically superior Hmong forces, Chom and his soldiers held onto their position and fought till daybreak.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\">Do, p. 189</ref>\n\n[[Raven Forward Air Controllers]] at [[Lima Site 20A]], being the nearest available American support, were awakened by a radio call about 04:00. They flew in the dark to Lima Strip 36 at Na Khang to position themselves at the airstrip closest to LS85. The Ravens took up station over LS85 at dawn.<ref>Robbins, p. 57</ref> At 05:15 Sullivan, from the US Embassy in Vientiane, decided to evacuate Lima Site 85. He gave a signal to US pilots at Udorn to begin the operation, which was due to start at 07:15. Sullivan did not realize that US technicians were no longer in control of their TSQ-81 equipment.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 184\"/> Starting around 06:00, Pao's Hmong soldiers launched a counterattack against PAVN positions at the communication center, which was guarded by Cells 1 and 2, but their attacks were repelled and the PAVN held their positions. With the final Hmong counterattack on the communication site defeated at 06:25, Cell 2 was ordered to support Cells 3 and 5 in their fight at the main TACAN installation. By 06:35, the PAVN fully controlled the TACAN site. At the airstrip, Cell 4 was encircled by an estimated two Hmong platoons, but Chom and his unit were able to fight their way out by taking full advantage of rough terrain which favored them. Later, Cell 4 linked up with other units at the TACAN site.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\nAt first light Air America helicopters hovered over Lima Site 85 to start the evacuation, which was covered by USAF A-1 Skyraiders. Immediately, Hmong soldiers and their CIA commanders rushed the TACAN site and shouted to the US technicians that help was coming.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\">Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185</ref> In response, the PAVN Special Forces organized a defense around the TACAN site, and hid their dead and wounded comrades under the large rocks which dotted Phou Pha Thi.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/> While US fighter-bombers strafed the TACAN site, the Air America helicopter landed on the airstrip and they picked up two CIA officers, one forward air-controller, and five technicians who hid during the firefight.<ref name=\"Hamilton-Merritt, p. 185\"/> Later in the day, Air America was able to recover or account for eight of the dead US personnel on Lima Site 85, along with a number of wounded Hmong soldiers.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\">Chauhan, p. 29</ref> By midday, Lima Site 85 was fully controlled by the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion, and they held the facility until 14&nbsp;March when they withdrew from the area.<ref name=\"Do, p. 189\"/>\n\n==Aftermath==\nJust before midday on 11&nbsp;March, the USAF turned their attention (recon) from looking for their missing personnel to that of destroying the captured radar, along with all the documentation and operation information left behind at Lima Site 85. Between 12\u201318&nbsp;March, the USAF conducted a total of 95 strike sorties against the radar site, and on 19&nbsp;March an A-1 fighter-bomber destroyed every building at the facility. In addition to the destruction of their radar equipment, the USAF bombing of Lima Site 85 may also have had the effect of obliterating the bodies of US personnel left behind at the site (2 remains found in 2013). In the days following the loss of Phou Pha Thi, Sullivan reflected on the disaster at Lima Site 85 and commented that US technicians operating there should have been evacuated on 10&nbsp;March, when it became amply clear the PAVN were preparing to launch an assault.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/>\n\nFor the USAF, the loss at Phou Pha Thi was not a result of intelligence failure, because it had been provided with accurate information from the very start. Instead, it was clearly a failure of command and control, as the US personnel and their Hmong allies were not permitted to freely organize their own defense to hold the radar facility.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 29\"/> The Battle of Lima Site 85 resulted in the largest single ground combat loss of USAF personnel during the Vietnam War.<ref>Marrett, p. 26</ref> A total of 12 US personnel went missing or were killed in the fighting on Phou Pha Thi; 11 were killed or missing on the ground and one was shot dead during the evacuation.<ref>Chauhan, pp. 28\u201329</ref><ref>The single fatality occurring during the evacuation was 1043rd Radar Evaluation Squadron member Air Force [[Chief Master Sergeant]] [[Richard Etchberger]] who was awarded the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously in September 2010 for his role in helping four injured airmen into the evacuation helicopter lift sling.}</ref><ref name=Warner233>Warner, pp 233\u2013235</ref> In addition a USAF A-1 searching for survivors was shot down and the pilot killed.\n\nThe total casualty figures for PAVN, Pathet Lao, Hmong, and Thai units are unknown. According to official Vietnamese history, the PAVN 41st Special Forces Battalion lost one soldier killed and two wounded in their fight for Lima Site 85. Against those losses, the Vietnamese claimed a total of 42 Hmong and Thai soldiers were killed, and a number of others were wounded. A large number of weapons were captured by the PAVN, including one 105&nbsp;mm howitzer, one 85&nbsp;mm artillery piece, four recoilless rifles, four heavy mortars, nine heavy machine guns, and vast amounts of ammunition.<ref name=\"Do, p. 201\">Do, p. 201</ref> The PAVN victory proved to be a significant one, as they had succeeded in knocking out a major asset of the USAF, which had inflicted heavy damage to North Vietnam's limited industrial infrastructure.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\">Chauhan, p. 30</ref>\n\nThe fight at Phou Pha Thi, which was part of a larger military campaign waged by the North Vietnamese and their Pathet Lao allies, marked the beginning of the Communist dry-season offensive against Laotian Government forces in northeastern Laos. By September 1968, the strength of PAVN and Pathet Lao forces in the Sam Neua area were estimated to have numbered more than 20 battalions.<ref name=\"Chauhan, p. 30\"/> Against such heavy odds, General Vang Pao insisted on recapturing Phou Pha Thi, which the US Embassy believed unnecessary. On 1&nbsp;November&nbsp;1968, Pao launched [[Operation Pigfat]] in attempt to retake Phou Pha Thi, but the operation quickly turned into a rout of the Royal Lao Army and the Hmong guerrillas and Phou Pha Thi was never retaken.<ref>Robbins, p. 105</ref>\n\nAlthough airpower was to be a major factor in the defense of Lima Site 85, it could not be applied without limitations and restrictions. The defense of Lima Site 85 was not the sole focus of limited air resources at the time. During this period, the 1968 [[Tet Offensive]] was underway in South Vietnam, the Marine outpost at [[Khe Sanh Combat Base]] was under siege, and there existed an unprecedented flow of enemy logistical traffic which had to be interdicted. Lima Site 85 had provided direction to about a quarter of the USAF missions over North Vietnam and Barrel Roll from November&nbsp;1967 to 11&nbsp;March&nbsp;1968. No other facility existed to provide a similar coverage over these areas. While this loss was a serious blow to the USAF effort, it was not crippling.<ref name=\"Project CHECO Report Fall of Site 85\"/>\n\n[[File:1st mob patch.gif|thumb|The patch of the 1st AACS Mobile Communications Group present at Lima Site 85.]]\nEleven of the twelve USAF personnel lost on the day of the battle were listed first as [[missing in action]] (MIA), then later as [[killed in action|KIA]]/body not recovered.<ref>Hamilton-Merritt, p. 186</ref> Between 1994 and 2004, 11 investigations were conducted by both [[Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command]] (JPAC) and unilaterally by Lao and Vietnamese investigators on both sides of the border.<ref name=\"dtic.mil\">{{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dpmo/news/news_releases/2004/documents/AFMIA10705.pdf|title= Air Force Sergeant MIA from the Vietnam War is identified|date= 7 December 2005|publisher=Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office|accessdate=25 July 2011}}</ref> In 2002 two of the former PAVN soldiers who had taken part in the attack told investigators that they threw the bodies of the Americans off the mountain after the attack as they were unable to bury them on the rocky surface.<ref name=\"The Fall of Lima Site 85\">{{cite web |url= http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2006/April%202006/0406lima.aspx|title= The Fall of Lima Site 85|author= John T.

Areas where land meets large bodies of water are called [[coast|coastal zones]]. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The [[demarcation line]] between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A [[maritime boundary]] is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock [[landform]]s are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n{{original research section|date=March 2018}}\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe word 'land' is derived from Middle English ''land'', ''lond'' and [[Old English]] ''land'', ''lond'' (\u201cearth, land, soil, ground; defined piece of land, territory, realm, province, district; landed property; country (not town); ridge in a ploughed field\u201d), from Proto-Germanic ''*land\u0105'' (\u201cland\u201d), and from Proto-Indo-European ''*lend\u02b0-'' (\u201cland, heath\u201d). Cognate with Scots ''land'' (\u201cland\u201d), West Frisian ''l\u00e2n'' (\u201cland\u201d), Dutch ''land'' (\u201cland\u201d), German ''Land'' (\u201cland, country, state\u201d), Swedish ''land'' (\u201cland, country, shore, territory\u201d), Icelandic ''land'' (\u201cland\u201d). Non-Germanic cognates include Old Irish ''lann'' (\u201cheath\u201d), Welsh ''llan'' (\u201cenclosure\u201d), Breton ''lann'' (\u201cheath\u201d), Old Church Slavonic ''l\u0119d\u043e'' from Proto-Slavic ''*lenda'' (\u201cheath, wasteland\u201d) and Albanian ''l\u00ebndin\u00eb'' (\u201cheath, grassland\u201d) from ''l\u00ebnd\u00eb'' (\u201cmatter, substance\u201d).\n\nA continuous area of land surrounded by ocean is called a \"landmass\". Although it may be most often written as one word to distinguish it from the usage \"[[Land#Land mass|land mass]]\"\u2014the measure of land area\u2014it is also used as two words. Landmasses include [[supercontinent]]s, [[continent]]s, and [[island]]s.

The Jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.<ref group=note>The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one another. \"Cosmology.\" Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012.

[[Bhumi Devi|Bhuma Devi]] is the goddess of Earth in [[Hinduism]], influenced by [[Graha]]. In [[Norse mythology]], the Earth giantess [[J\u00f6r\u00f0]] was the mother of [[Thor]] and the daughter of [[Annar]]. [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egyptian mythology]] is different from that of other cultures because Earth ([[Geb]]) is male and sky ([[Nut (goddess)|Nut]]) is female.\n\nIn the past, there were varying levels of belief in a [[flat Earth]]. The Jewish conception of a flat earth is found in both biblical and post-biblical times.<ref group=note>The picture of the universe in Talmudic texts has the Earth in the center of creation with heaven as a hemisphere spread over it. Biblical writings, such as the Genesis creation story and the various Psalms that extol the firmament, the stars, the sun, and the earth, give similar explanations. The Hebrews saw the earth as an almost flat surface consisting of a solid and a liquid part and the sky as the realm of light in which heavenly bodies move. The earth rested on cornerstones and could not be moved except by Jehovah (as in an earthquake). According to the Hebrews, the sun and the moon were only a short distance from one another. \"Cosmology.\" Encyclopedia Americana. Grolier Online, 2012.
