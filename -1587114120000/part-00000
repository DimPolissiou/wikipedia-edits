In some later periods, it was regarded as good or proper Latin, with following versions viewed as debased, degenerate, vulgar, or corrupted. The word ''Latin'' is now understood by default to mean \"Classical Latin\"; for example, modern Latin textbooks almost exclusively teach Classical Latin.\n\n[[Cicero]] and his contemporaries of the late republic used {{lang|la|lingua latina}} and ''sermo latinus'' versions of the Latin language. Conversely, the Greeks used [[Vulgar Latin]] (''sermo vulgaris'' and ''sermo vulgi'') in their [[vernacular]], written as {{lang|la|latinitas}},{{NoteTag|When rarely used in English, the term is capitalized: ''Latinitas''. In Latin it was written all in uppercase: ''LATINITAS'', as were all words in Latin.}} or \"Latinity\" (which implies \"good\") when combined. It was also called {{lang|la|sermo familiaris}} (\"speech of the good families\"), ''sermo urbanus (''\"speech of the city\"), and in rare cases ''sermo nobilis (''\"noble speech\"). Besides ''latinitas'', it was mainly called ''latine'' (adverb for \"in good Latin\"), or ''latinius'' (comparative adverb for \"in better Latin\").\n\n''Latinitas'' was spoken and written. It was the language taught in schools. [[prescriptive grammar|Prescriptive]] rules therefore applied to it, and when special subjects like [[poetry]] or [[rhetoric]] were taken into consideration, additional rules applied. Since spoken ''Latinitas'' has become extinct (in favor of subsequent registers), the rules of ''politus'' (polished) texts may give the appearance of an artificial language. However, ''Latinitas'' was a form of ''sermo'' (spoken language), and as such, retains spontaneity. No texts by Classical Latin authors are noted for the type of rigidity evidenced by stylized art, with the exception of repetitious abbreviations and stock phrases found on inscriptions. For example, \"IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\" (\"Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum\") was the [[wikt:titulus|titulus]] written on the placard above [[Jesus]]' head on the [[Cross]], and is a rather famous example of Classical Latin.\n\n==Philological constructs==\n\n===Classical===\n\"Good Latin\" in [[philology]] is known as \"classical\" [[Latin literature]]. The term refers to the canonical relevance of literary works written in Latin in the late [[Roman Republic]], and early to middle [[Roman Empire]]. \"[T]hat is to say, that of belonging to an exclusive group of authors (or works) that were considered to be emblematic of a certain genre.\"{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 204}} The term ''classicus'' (masculine plural ''classici'') was devised by the Romans to translate Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (encrithentes), and \"select\" which refers to authors who wrote in a form of Greek that was considered model. Before then, the term ''classis'', in addition to being a naval fleet, was a social class in one of the diachronic divisions of Roman society in accordance with property ownership under the Roman constitution.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 205}} The word is a transliteration of Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (cl\u0113sis, or \"calling\") used to rank army draftees by property from first to fifth class.\n\n''Classicus'' refers to those in the ''primae classis (''\"first class\"), such as the authors of polished works of ''Latinitas'', or ''sermo urbanus''. It contains nuances of the certified and the authentic, or ''testis classicus (''\"reliable witness\"). It was under this construct that [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (an [[Africa]]n-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] lawyer and language teacher) used ''scriptores classici'' (\"first-class\" or \"reliable authors\") in the second century AD. Their works were be viewed as models of good Latin.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 206 | ps =, reported in [[Aulus Gellius]], 9.8.15.}} This is the first known reference (possibly innovated during this time) to Classical Latin applied by authors, evidenced in the authentic language of their works.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 207}}\n\n===Canonical===\n[[File:David Ruhnken - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|left|David Ruhnken]]\nImitating Greek grammarians, Romans such as [[Quintilian]] drew up lists termed ''indices'' or ''ordines'' modeled after the ones created by the Greeks, which where called ''pinakes''. The Greek lists were considered classical, or ''recepti scriptores'' (\"select writers\"). [[Aulus Gellius]] includes authors like [[Plautus]], who are considered writers of [[Old Latin]] and not strictly in the period of classical Latin. The classical Romans distinguished Old Latin as ''prisca Latinitas'' and not ''sermo vulgaris''. Each author's work in the Roman lists were considered equivalent to one in the Greek. In example, [[Ennius]] was the Latin [[Homer]], [[Aeneid]] was the equivalent of [[Iliad]], etc. The lists of classical authors were as far as the Roman grammarians went in developing a [[philology]]. The topic remained at that point while interest in the ''classici scriptores'' declined in the medieval period as the best form of the language yielded to [[medieval Latin]], inferior to classical standards.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw a revival in Roman culture, and with it, the return of Classic (\"the best\") Latin. [[Thomas S\u00e9billet]]'s ''Art Po\u00e9tique'' (1548), \"les bons et classiques po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ois,\" refers to [[Jean de Meun]] and [[Alain Chartier]], who the first modern application of the words.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to [[Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'']], the term classical (from ''classicus)'' entered modern English in 1599, some 50 years after its re-introduction to the continent. In Governor [[William Bradford (Plymouth Colony governor)|William Bradford]]'s ''Dialogue'' (1648), he referred to [[synod]]s of a [[separatist]] church as \"classical meetings,\" defined by meetings between \"young men\" from New England and \"ancient men\" from Holland and England.<ref>{{Cite book|first=William|last=Bradford|contribution=Gov.

In doing so, Ruhnken had secular [[catechism]] in mind.<ref>{{cite book |page=51|title=The making of the modern canon: genesis and crisis of a literary idea|first=Jan |last=Gorak|location=London|publisher=Athlone|year=1991}}</ref>\n\n===Ages of Latin===\n[[File:Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel]]\nIn 1870, [[Wilhelm Siegmund Teuffel|Wilhelm Sigismund Teuffel]]'s ''Geschichte der R\u00f6mischen Literatur'' (''A History of Roman Literature'') defined the philological notion of classical Latin based on the metaphoric uses of the ancient myth, [[Ages of Man]]. It was viewed as a universal standard, marking the Golden and Silver Ages of classical Latin. Shortly after Wilhem Wagner published Teuffel's work in German, he translated it to English (1873). Teuffel's classification divides the chronology of classical Latin authors into several periods according to political events rather than by style. His work (with modifications) is still in use today.\n\nTeuffel went on to publish other editions, but the English translation of ''A History of Roman Literature'' gained immediate success. In 1877, [[Charles Thomas Cruttwell]] produced a similar work in English. In his preface, Cruttwell notes, \"Teuffel's admirable history, without which many chapters in the present work could not have attained completeness.\" He also credits Wagner.\n\nCruttwell adopts the time periods found in Teuffel's work, but he presents a detailed analysis of style, whereas Teuffel was more concerned with history. Like Teuffel, Cruttwell encountered issues while attempting to condense the voluminous details of time periods in an effort to capture the meaning of phases found in their various writing styles. Like Teuffel, he has trouble finding a name for the first of the three periods (the current [[Old Latin]] phase), calling it \"from [[Lucius Livius Andronicus|Livius]] to [[Sulla]].\" He says the language \"is marked by immaturity of art and language, by a vigorous but ill-disciplined imitation of Greek poetical models, and in prose by a dry sententiousness of style, gradually giving way to a clear and fluent strength...\" These abstracts have little meaning to those not well-versed in Latin literature. In fact, Cruttwell admits \"The ancients, indeed, saw a difference between [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius|Accius]], but it may be questioned whether the advance would be perceptible by us.\"\n\nIn time, some of Cruttwell's ideas become established in Latin philology. While praising the application of rules to classical Latin (most intensely in the Golden Age, he says \"In gaining accuracy, however, classical Latin suffered a grievous loss. It became cultivated as distinct from a natural language... Spontaneity, therefore, became impossible and soon invention also ceased... In a certain sense, therefore, Latin was studied as a dead language, while it was still a living.\"{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 3}}\n\nAlso problematic in Teuffel's scheme is its appropriateness to the concept of classical Latin. Cruttwell addresses the issue by altering the concept of the classical. The \"best\" Latin is defined as \"golden\" Latin, the second of the three periods. The other two periods (considered \"classical\") are left hanging. By assigning the term \"pre-classical\" to Old Latin and implicating it to post-classical (or post-Augustan) and silver Latin, Cruttwell realized that his construct was not accordance with ancient usage and assertions: \"[T]he epithet classical is by many restricted to the authors who wrote in it [golden Latin]. It is best, however, not to narrow unnecessarily the sphere of classicity; to exclude [[Terence]] on the one hand or [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] on the other, would savour of artificial restriction rather than that of a natural classification.\" The contradiction remains\u2014Terence is, and is not a classical author, depending on context.{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 142}}\n\n==Authors of the Golden Age==\n[[File:Bakalovich at Maecenas' reception.jpg|thumb|''At Maecenas' Reception'', oil, [[Stepan Bakalovich]], 1890. An artist's view of the classical. Maecenas knew and entertained everyone literary in the Golden Age, especially Augustus.]]\nTeuffel's definition of the \"First Period\" of Latin was based on inscriptions, fragments, and the literary works of the earliest known authors. Though he does use the term \"Old Roman\" at one point, most of these findings remain unnamed. Teuffel presents the Second Period in his major work, ''das goldene Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur'' (''Golden Age of Roman Literature''), dated 671\u2013767 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (83 BC \u2013 14 AD), according to his own recollection. The timeframe is marked by the dictatorship of [[Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix]] and the death of the emperor [[Augustus]].{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1870 | p = 216 }}{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1873 | p = 226 }} Wagner's translation of Teuffel's writing is as follows:\n\n{{quote |The golden age of the Roman literature is that period in which the climax was reached in the perfection of form, and in most respects also in the methodical treatment of the subject-matters. It may be subdivided between the generations, in the first of which (the Ciceronian Age) prose culminated, while poetry was principally developed in the Augustan Age.}}\n\nThe Ciceronian Age was dated 671\u2013711 AUC (83\u201343 BC), ending just after the death of Marcus Tullius Cicero. The Augustan 711\u201367 AUC (43 BC \u2013 14 AD) ends with the death of Augustus. The Ciceronian Age is further divided by the consulship of Cicero in 691 AUC (63 BC) into a first and second half. Authors are assigned to these periods by years of principal achievements.\n\nThe Golden Age had already made an appearance in German philology, but in a less-systematic way. In a translation of Bielfeld's ''Elements of universal erudition'' (1770):\n\nThe Second Age of Latin began about the time of Caesar [his ages are different from Teuffel's], and ended with Tiberius. This is what is called the Augustan Age, which was perhaps of all others the most brilliant, a period at which it should seem as if the greatest men, and the immortal authors, had met together upon the earth, in order to write the Latin language in its utmost purity and perfection...{{Sfn|Bielfeld|Hooper|1770|p=244}} and of Tacitus, his conceits and sententious style is not that of the golden age...{{Sfn|Bielfeld|Hooper|1770|p=345}}\n\nEvidently, Teuffel received ideas about golden and silver Latin from an existing tradition and embedded them in a new system, transforming them as he thought best.\n\nIn Cruttwell's introduction, the Golden Age is dated 80 BC \u2013 14 AD (from [[Cicero]] to [[Ovid]]), which corresponds to Teuffel's findings. Of the \"Second Period,\" Cruttwell paraphrases Tueffel by saying it \"represents the highest excellence in prose and poetry.\" The Ciceronian Age (known today as the \"Republican Period\") is dated 80\u201342 BC, marked by the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Cruttwell omits the first half of Teuffel's Ciceronian, and starts the Golden Age at Cicero's consulship in 63 BC\u2014an error perpetuated in Cruttwell's second edition. He likely meant 80 BC, as he includes Varro in Golden Latin. Teuffel's Augustan Age is Cruttwell's Augustan Epoch (42 BC \u2013 14 AD).\n\n=== Republican ===\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], after whom Teuffel named his Ciceronian period of the Golden Age]]\n[[File:Giulio-cesare-enhanced 1-800x1450.jpg|thumb|upright|Julius Caesar]]\nThe literary histories list includes all authors from Canonical to the Ciceronian Age\u2014even those whose works are fragmented or missing altogether. With the exception of a few major writers, such as Cicero, Caesar, Virgil and Catullus, ancient accounts of Republican literature praise jurists and orators whose writings, and analyses of various styles of language cannot be verified because there are no surviving records. The reputations of Aquilius Gallus, [[Quintus Hortensius Hortalus]], [[Lucullus|Lucius Licinius Lucullus]], and many others who gained notoriety without readable works, are presumed by their association within the Golden Age.

In the wars that followed, a generation of Republican literary figures were lost. Marcus Tullius Cicero was beheaded in the streets as he inquired among his litter about a disturbance.{{Citation needed|reason=contradicts the article on Cicero|date=July 2013}} Cicero and his contemporaries were replaced by a new generation who spent their formidable years under the old constructs, and forced to make their mark under the watchful eye of a new emperor. The demand for great orators had ceased,{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1873 | p = 385 | ps =, \"Public life became extinct, all political business passed into the hands of the monarch...\"}} shifting to an emphasis on poetry. Other than the historian [[Livy]], the most remarkable writers of the period were the poets [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]. Although Augustus evidenced some toleration to republican sympathizers, he exiled Ovid, and imperial tolerance ended with the continuance of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].\n\nAugustan writers include:\n* [[Virgil|Publius Vergilius Maro]] (Virgil, spelled also as Vergil; 70\u201319 BC),\n* [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] (Horace; 65\u20138 BC), known for lyric poetry and satires\n* [[Sextus Propertius|Sextus Aurelius Propertius]] (50\u201315 BC), poet\n* [[Albius Tibullus]] (54\u201319 BC), elegiac poet\n* [[Publius Ovidius Naso]] (Ovid; 43 BC \u2013 AD 18), poet\n* [[Livy|Titus Livius]] (Livy; 64 BC \u2013 AD 12), historian\n* [[Grattius Faliscus]] (a contemporary of Ovid), poet\n* [[Marcus Manilius]] (1st century BC and AD), astrologer, poet\n* [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (64 BC \u2013 AD 17), librarian, poet, mythographer\n* [[Marcus Verrius Flaccus]] (55 BC \u2013 AD 20), grammarian, philologist, calendarist\n* [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] (80-70 BC \u2014 after 15 BC), engineer, architect\n* [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d.

He also changed his dating scheme from AUC to modern BC/AD. Though he introduces ''das silberne Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur'', (The Silver Age of Roman Literature) <ref>Teuffel (1870) p. 526.</ref> from the death of Augustus to the death of [[Trajan]] (14\u2013117 AD), he also mentions parts of a work by [[Seneca the Elder]], a ''wenig Einfluss der silbernen Latinit\u00e4t'' (a slight influence of silver Latin). It's clear that his mindset had shifted from Golden and Silver Ages to Golden and Silver Latin, also to include ''Latinitas'', which at this point must be interpreted as Classical Latin. He may have been influenced in that regard by one of his sources E. Opitz, who in 1852 had published ''specimen lexilogiae argenteae latinitatis'', which includes Silver Latinity.{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1870 | p = 530}} Though Teuffel's First Period was equivalent to [[Old Latin]] and his Second Period was equal to the Golden Age, his Third Period ''die r\u00f6mische Kaiserheit'' encompasses both the Silver Age and the centuries now termed [[Late Latin]], in which the forms seemed to break loose from their foundation and float freely. That is, men of literature were confounded about the meaning of \"good Latin.\" The last iteration of Classical Latin is known as Silver Latin. The Silver Age is the first of the Imperial Period, and is divided into ''die Zeit der julischen Dynastie (''14\u201368); ''die Zeit der flavischen Dynastie'' (69\u201396), and ''die Zeit des Nerva und Trajan (''96\u2013117). Subsequently, Teuffel goes over to a century scheme: 2nd, 3rd, etc., through 6th. His later editions (which came about towards the end of the 19th century) divide the Imperial Age into parts: 1st century (Silver Age), 2nd century ( the [[Hadrian]] and the [[Antonines]]), and the 3rd through 6th centuries. Of the Silver Age proper, Tueffel points out that anything like freedom of speech had vanished with [[Tiberius]]:{{Sfn | Teuffel | Schwabe | 1892 | pp = 4\u20135 }}\n\n{{quote | ...the continual apprehension in which men lived caused a restless versatility...  Simple or natural composition was considered insipid; the aim of language was to be brilliant...  Hence it was dressed up with abundant tinsel of epigrams, rhetorical figures and poetical terms...  [[Mannerism]] supplanted style, and bombastic pathos took the place of quiet power.}}\n\nThe content of new literary works was continually proscribed by the emperor, who exiled or executed existing authors and played the role of literary man, himself (typically badly). Artists therefore went into a repertory of new and dazzling mannerisms, which Teuffel calls \"utter unreality.\" Cruttwell picks up this theme:{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 6}}\n\n{{quote | The foremost of these [characteristics] is unreality, arising from the extinction of freedom...  Hence arose a declamatory tone, which strove by frigid and almost hysterical exaggeration to make up for the healthy stimulus afforded by daily contact with affairs. The vein of artificial rhetoric, antithesis and epigram... owes its origin to this forced contentment with an uncongenial sphere. With the decay of freedom, taste sank...}}\n\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|thumb|upright|right|[[Marcus Aurelius]], emperor over the last generation of classicists and himself a classicist.]]\nIn Cruttwell's view (which had not been expressed by Teuffel), Silver Latin was a \"rank, weed-grown garden,\" a \"decline.\"{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 341}} Cruttwell had already decried what he saw as a loss of spontaneity in Golden Latin. Teuffel regarded the Silver Age as a loss of natural language, and therefore of spontaneity, implying that it was last seen in the Golden Age. Instead, Tiberius brought about a \"sudden collapse of letters.\" The idea of a decline had been dominant in English society since [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''. Once again, Cruttwell evidences some unease with his stock pronouncements: \"The ''Natural History'' of Pliny shows how much remained to be done in fields of great interest.\" The idea of Pliny as a model is not consistent with any sort of decline. Moreover, Pliny did his best work under emperors who were as tolerant as Augustus had been. To include some of the best writings of the Silver Age, Cruttwell extended the period through the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (180 AD). The philosophic prose of a good emperor was in no way compatible with either Teuffel's view of unnatural language, or Cruttwell's depiction of a decline. Having created these constructs, the two philologists found they could not entirely justify them. Apparently, in the worst implication of their views, there was no such thing as Classical Latin by the ancient definition, and some of the very best writing of any period in world history was deemed stilted, degenerate, unnatural language.\n\nThe Silver Age furnishes the only two extant Latin novels: Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' and Petronius's ''[[Satyricon]]''.\n\nPerhaps history's best-known example of Classical Latin was written by [[Pontius Pilate]] on the placard placed above [[Jesus]]' Cross: [[Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum]], which translates to ''Jesus the Nazarean the King of the Judeans'' (Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews).\n\nWriters of the Silver Age include:\n\n===From the Ides of March to Trajan===\n[[File:Germanicus1914.jpg|thumb|125px|Germanicus Caesar]]\n[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|125px|Ancient bust of Seneca, part of a [[Double Herm of Socrates and Seneca|double herm]] ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]\n\n* [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]] (died AD 25), historian\n* [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] (19 BC \u2013 31 AD), military officer, historian\n* [[Valerius Maximus]] (1st century AD), rhetorician\n* [[Masurius Sabinus]] (1st century AD), jurist\n* [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (15 BC \u2013 AD 50), fabulist\n* [[Germanicus Julius Caesar]] (15 BC \u2013 AD 19), royal family, imperial officer, translator\n* [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (25 BC \u2013 AD 50), physician, encyclopedist\n* [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] (1st century AD), historian\n* [[Cornelius Bocchus]] (1st century AD), natural historian\n* [[Pomponius Mela]] (d.

The latter provides unity, allowing it to be referenced under a single name. Thus Old Latin, Classical Latin, [[Vulgar Latin]], etc., are not considered different languages, but are all referenced under the term, [[Latin]]. This is an ancient practice continued by moderns rather than a philological innovation of recent times. That Latin had case endings is a fundamental feature of the language. Whether a given form of speech prefers to use prepositions such as ''ad'', ''ex'', ''de,'' for \"to,\" \"from\" and \"of\" rather than simple case endings is a matter of style. Latin has a large number of styles. Each and every author has a style, which typically allows his prose or poetry to be identified by experienced Latinists. Problems in comparative literature have risen out of group styles finding similarity by period, in which case one may speak of Old Latin, Silver Latin, Late Latin as styles or a phase of styles.\n\nThe ancient authors themselves first defined style by recognizing different kinds of ''sermo'', or \"speech.\" By valuing Classical Latin as \"first class,\" it was better to write with ''Latinitas'' selected by authors who were attuned to literary and upper-class languages of the city as a standardized style. All ''sermo'' that differed from it was a different style. Thus, in rhetoric, Cicero was able to define sublime, intermediate, and low styles within Classical Latin. St. Augustine recommend low style for sermons.<ref>{{Cite book|page= 33|first= Erich|last= Auerbach |title= Literary Language and its Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages|publisher= Pantheon Books|year= 1965|origyear= 1958|series= Bollingen Series LXXIV|first2= Ralph (Translator) | last2 =Mannheim}}</ref> Style was to be defined by deviation in speech from a standard.

In some later periods, it was regarded as good or proper Latin, with following versions viewed as debased, degenerate, vulgar, or corrupted. The word ''Latin'' is now understood by default to mean \"Classical Latin\"; for example, modern Latin textbooks almost exclusively teach Classical Latin.\n\n[[Cicero]] and his contemporaries of the late republic used {{lang|la|lingua latina}} and ''sermo latinus'' versions of the Latin language. Conversely, the Greeks used [[Vulgar Latin]] (''sermo vulgaris'' and ''sermo vulgi'') in their [[vernacular]], written as {{lang|la|latinitas}},{{NoteTag|When rarely used in English, the term is capitalized: ''Latinitas''. In Latin it was written all in uppercase: ''LATINITAS'', as were all words in Latin.}} or \"Latinity\" (which implies \"good\") when combined. It was also called {{lang|la|sermo familiaris}} (\"speech of the good families\"), ''sermo urbanus (''\"speech of the city\"), and in rare cases ''sermo nobilis (''\"noble speech\"). Besides ''latinitas'', it was mainly called ''latine'' (adverb for \"in good Latin\"), or ''latinius'' (comparative adverb for \"in better Latin\").\n\n''Latinitas'' was spoken and written. It was the language taught in schools. [[prescriptive grammar|Prescriptive]] rules therefore applied to it, and when special subjects like [[poetry]] or [[rhetoric]] were taken into consideration, additional rules applied. Since spoken ''Latinitas'' has become extinct (in favor of subsequent registers), the rules of ''politus'' (polished) texts may give the appearance of an artificial language. However, ''Latinitas'' was a form of ''sermo'' (spoken language), and as such, retains spontaneity. No texts by Classical Latin authors are noted for the type of rigidity evidenced by stylized art, with the exception of repetitious abbreviations and stock phrases found on inscriptions. For example, \"IESVS NAZARENVS REX IVDAEORVM\" (\"Jesus Nazarenus Rex Judaeorum\") was the [[wikt:titulus|titulus]] written on the placard above [[Jesus]]' head on the [[Cross]], and is a rather famous example of Classical Latin.\n\n==Philological constructs==\n\n===Classical===\n\"Good Latin\" in [[philology]] is known as \"classical\" [[Latin literature]]. The term refers to the canonical relevance of literary works written in Latin in the late [[Roman Republic]], and early to middle [[Roman Empire]]. \"[T]hat is to say, that of belonging to an exclusive group of authors (or works) that were considered to be emblematic of a certain genre.\"{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 204}} The term ''classicus'' (masculine plural ''classici'') was devised by the Romans to translate Greek \u1f10\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03b9\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 (encrithentes), and \"select\" which refers to authors who wrote in a form of Greek that was considered model. Before then, the term ''classis'', in addition to being a naval fleet, was a social class in one of the diachronic divisions of Roman society in accordance with property ownership under the Roman constitution.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 205}} The word is a transliteration of Greek \u03ba\u03bb\u1fc6\u03c3\u03b9\u03c2 (cl\u0113sis, or \"calling\") used to rank army draftees by property from first to fifth class.\n\n''Classicus'' refers to those in the ''primae classis (''\"first class\"), such as the authors of polished works of ''Latinitas'', or ''sermo urbanus''. It contains nuances of the certified and the authentic, or ''testis classicus (''\"reliable witness\"). It was under this construct that [[Marcus Cornelius Fronto]] (an [[Africa]]n-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]] lawyer and language teacher) used ''scriptores classici'' (\"first-class\" or \"reliable authors\") in the second century AD. Their works were be viewed as models of good Latin.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 206 | ps =, reported in [[Aulus Gellius]], 9.8.15.}} This is the first known reference (possibly innovated during this time) to Classical Latin applied by authors, evidenced in the authentic language of their works.{{Sfn | Citroni | 2006 | p = 207}}\n\n===Canonical===\n[[File:David Ruhnken - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|left|David Ruhnken]]\nImitating Greek grammarians, Romans such as [[Quintilian]] drew up lists termed ''indices'' or ''ordines'' modeled after the ones created by the Greeks, which where called ''pinakes''. The Greek lists were considered classical, or ''recepti scriptores'' (\"select writers\"). [[Aulus Gellius]] includes authors like [[Plautus]], who are considered writers of [[Old Latin]] and not strictly in the period of classical Latin. The classical Romans distinguished Old Latin as ''prisca Latinitas'' and not ''sermo vulgaris''. Each author's work in the Roman lists were considered equivalent to one in the Greek. In example, [[Ennius]] was the Latin [[Homer]], [[Aeneid]] was the equivalent of [[Iliad]], etc. The lists of classical authors were as far as the Roman grammarians went in developing a [[philology]]. The topic remained at that point while interest in the ''classici scriptores'' declined in the medieval period as the best form of the language yielded to [[medieval Latin]], inferior to classical standards.\n\nThe [[Renaissance]] saw a revival in Roman culture, and with it, the return of Classic (\"the best\") Latin. [[Thomas S\u00e9billet]]'s ''Art Po\u00e9tique'' (1548), \"les bons et classiques po\u00e8tes fran\u00e7ois,\" refers to [[Jean de Meun]] and [[Alain Chartier]], who the first modern application of the words.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} According to [[Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary|Merriam Webster's ''Collegiate Dictionary'']], the term classical (from ''classicus)'' entered modern English in 1599, some 50 years after its re-introduction to the continent.

It was viewed as a universal standard, marking the Golden and Silver Ages of classical Latin. Shortly after Wilhem Wagner published Teuffel's work in German, he translated it to English (1873). Teuffel's classification divides the chronology of classical Latin authors into several periods according to political events rather than by style. His work (with modifications) is still in use today.\n\nTeuffel went on to publish other editions, but the English translation of ''A History of Roman Literature'' gained immediate success. In 1877, [[Charles Thomas Cruttwell]] produced a similar work in English. In his preface, Cruttwell notes, \"Teuffel's admirable history, without which many chapters in the present work could not have attained completeness.\" He also credits Wagner.\n\nCruttwell adopts the time periods found in Teuffel's work, but he presents a detailed analysis of style, whereas Teuffel was more concerned with history. Like Teuffel, Cruttwell encountered issues while attempting to condense the voluminous details of time periods in an effort to capture the meaning of phases found in their various writing styles. Like Teuffel, he has trouble finding a name for the first of the three periods (the current [[Old Latin]] phase), calling it \"from [[Lucius Livius Andronicus|Livius]] to [[Sulla]].\" He says the language \"is marked by immaturity of art and language, by a vigorous but ill-disciplined imitation of Greek poetical models, and in prose by a dry sententiousness of style, gradually giving way to a clear and fluent strength...\" These abstracts have little meaning to those not well-versed in Latin literature. In fact, Cruttwell admits \"The ancients, indeed, saw a difference between [[Ennius]], [[Pacuvius]], and [[Lucius Accius|Accius]], but it may be questioned whether the advance would be perceptible by us.\"\n\nIn time, some of Cruttwell's ideas become established in Latin philology. While praising the application of rules to classical Latin (most intensely in the Golden Age, he says \"In gaining accuracy, however, classical Latin suffered a grievous loss. It became cultivated as distinct from a natural language... Spontaneity, therefore, became impossible and soon invention also ceased... In a certain sense, therefore, Latin was studied as a dead language, while it was still a living.\"{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 3}}\n\nAlso problematic in Teuffel's scheme, is its appropriateness to the concept of classical Latin. Cruttwell addresses the issue by altering the concept of the classical. The \"best\" Latin is defined as \"golden\" Latin, the second of the three periods. The other two periods (considered \"classical\") are left hanging. By assigning the term \"pre-classical\" to Old Latin and implicating it to post-classical (or post-Augustan) and silver Latin, Cruttwell realized that his construct was not accordance with ancient usage and assertions: \"[T]he epithet classical is by many restricted to the authors who wrote in it [golden Latin]. It is best, however, not to narrow unnecessarily the sphere of classicity; to exclude [[Terence]] on the one hand or [[Tacitus]] and [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] on the other, would savour of artificial restriction rather than that of a natural classification.\" The contradiction remains\u2014Terence is, and is not a classical author, depending on context.{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 142}}\n\n==Authors of the Golden Age==\n[[File:Bakalovich at Maecenas' reception.jpg|thumb|''At Maecenas' Reception'', oil, [[Stepan Bakalovich]], 1890. An artist's view of the classical. Maecenas knew and entertained everyone literary in the Golden Age, especially Augustus.]]\nTeuffel's definition of the \"First Period\" of Latin was based on inscriptions, fragments, and the literary works of the earliest known authors. Though he does use the term \"Old Roman\" at one point, most of these findings remain unnamed. Teuffel presents the Second Period in his major work, ''das goldene Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur'' (''Golden Age of Roman Literature''), dated 671\u2013767 [[Ab urbe condita|AUC]] (83 BC \u2013 14 AD), according to his own recollection.

The Augustan 711\u201367 AUC (43 BC \u2013 14 AD) ends with the death of Augustus. The Ciceronian Age is further divided by the consulship of Cicero in 691 AUC (63 BC) into a first and second half. Authors are assigned to these periods by years of principal achievements.\n\nThe Golden Age had already made an appearance in German philology, but in a less-systematic way. In a translation of Bielfeld's ''Elements of universal erudition'' (1770):\n\nThe Second Age of Latin began about the time of Caesar [his ages are different from Teuffel's], and ended with Tiberius. This is what is called the Augustan Age, which was perhaps of all others the most brilliant, a period at which it should seem as if the greatest men, and the immortal authors, had met together upon the earth, in order to write the Latin language in its utmost purity and perfection...{{Sfn|Bielfeld|Hooper|1770|p=244}} and of Tacitus, his conceits and sententious style is not that of the golden age...{{Sfn|Bielfeld|Hooper|1770|p=345}}\n\nEvidently, Teuffel received ideas about golden and silver Latin from an existing tradition and embedded them in a new system, transforming them as he thought best.\n\nIn Cruttwell's introduction, the Golden Age is dated 80 BC \u2013 14 AD (from [[Cicero]] to [[Ovid]]), which corresponds to Teuffel's findings. Of the \"Second Period,\" Cruttwell paraphrases Tueffel by saying it \"represents the highest excellence in prose and poetry.\" The Ciceronian Age (known today as the \"Republican Period\") is dated 80\u201342 BC, marked by the [[Battle of Philippi]]. Cruttwell omits the first half of Teuffel's Ciceronian, and starts the Golden Age at Cicero's consulship in 63 BC\u2014an error perpetuated in Cruttwell's second edition. He likely meant 80 BC, as he includes Varro in Golden Latin. Teuffel's Augustan Age is Cruttwell's Augustan Epoch (42 BC \u2013 14 AD).\n\n=== Republican ===\n[[File:CiceroBust.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cicero|Marcus Tullius Cicero]], after whom Teuffel named his Ciceronian period of the Golden Age]]\n[[File:Giulio-cesare-enhanced 1-800x1450.jpg|thumb|upright|Julius Caesar]]\nThe literary histories list includes all authors from Canonical to the Ciceronian Age\u2014even those whose works are fragmented or missing altogether.

In the wars that followed, a generation of Republican literary figures were lost. Marcus Tullius Cicero was beheaded in the streets as he inquired among his litter about a disturbance.{{Citation needed|reason=contradicts the article on Cicero|date=July 2013}} Cicero and his contemporaries were replaced by a new generation who spent their formidable years under the old constructs, and forced to make their mark under the watchful eye of a new emperor. The demand for great orators had ceased,{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1873 | p = 385 | ps =, \"Public life became extinct, all political business passed into the hands of the monarch...\"}} shifting to an emphasis on poetry. Other than the historian [[Livy]], the most remarkable writers of the period were the poets [[Virgil]], [[Horace]], and [[Ovid]]. Although Augustus evidenced some toleration to republican sympathizers, he exiled Ovid, and imperial tolerance ended with the continuance of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]].\n\nAugustan writers include:\n* [[Virgil|Publius Vergilius Maro]] (Virgil, spelled also as Vergil; 70\u201319 BC),\n* [[Horace|Quintus Horatius Flaccus]] (Horace; 65\u20138 BC), known for lyric poetry and satires\n* [[Sextus Propertius|Sextus Aurelius Propertius]] (50\u201315 BC), poet\n* [[Albius Tibullus]] (54\u201319 BC), elegiac poet\n* [[Publius Ovidius Naso]] (Ovid; 43 BC \u2013 AD 18), poet\n* [[Livy|Titus Livius]] (Livy; 64 BC \u2013 AD 12), historian\n* [[Grattius Faliscus]] (a contemporary of Ovid), poet\n* [[Marcus Manilius]] (1st century BC and AD), astrologer, poet\n* [[Gaius Julius Hyginus]] (64 BC \u2013 AD 17), librarian, poet, mythographer\n* [[Marcus Verrius Flaccus]] (55 BC \u2013 AD 20), grammarian, philologist, calendarist\n* [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] (80-70 BC \u2014 after 15 BC), engineer, architect\n* [[Marcus Antistius Labeo]] (d.

He also changed his dating scheme from AUC to modern BC/AD. Though he introduces ''das silberne Zeitalter der r\u00f6mischen Literatur'', (The Silver Age of Roman Literature) <ref>Teuffel (1870) p. 526.</ref> from the death of Augustus to the death of [[Trajan]] (14\u2013117 AD), he also mentions parts of a work by [[Seneca the Elder]], a ''wenig Einfluss der silbernen Latinit\u00e4t'' (a slight influence of silver Latin). It's clear that his mindset had shifted from Golden and Silver Ages to Golden and Silver Latin, also to include ''Latinitas'', which at this point must be interpreted as Classical Latin. He may have been influenced in that regard by one of his sources E. Opitz, who in 1852 had published ''specimen lexilogiae argenteae latinitatis'', which includes Silver Latinity.{{Sfn | Teuffel | 1870 | p = 530}} Though Teuffel's First Period was equivalent to [[Old Latin]] and his Second Period was equal to the Golden Age, his Third Period ''die r\u00f6mische Kaiserheit'' encompasses both the Silver Age and the centuries now termed [[Late Latin]], in which the forms seemed to break loose from their foundation and float freely. That is, men of literature were confounded about the meaning of \"good Latin.\" The last iteration of Classical Latin is known as Silver Latin. The Silver Age is the first of the Imperial Period, and is divided into ''die Zeit der julischen Dynastie (''14\u201368); ''die Zeit der flavischen Dynastie'' (69\u201396), and ''die Zeit des Nerva und Trajan (''96\u2013117). Subsequently, Teuffel goes over to a century scheme: 2nd, 3rd, etc., through 6th. His later editions (which came about towards the end of the 19th century) divide the Imperial Age into parts: 1st century (Silver Age), 2nd century ( the [[Hadrian]] and the [[Antonines]]), and the 3rd through 6th centuries. Of the Silver Age proper, Tueffel points out that anything like freedom of speech had vanished with [[Tiberius]]:{{Sfn | Teuffel | Schwabe | 1892 | pp = 4\u20135 }}\n\n{{quote | ...the continual apprehension in which men lived caused a restless versatility...  Simple or natural composition was considered insipid; the aim of language was to be brilliant...  Hence it was dressed up with abundant tinsel of epigrams, rhetorical figures and poetical terms...  [[Mannerism]] supplanted style, and bombastic pathos took the place of quiet power.}}\n\nThe content of new literary works was continually proscribed by the emperor, who exiled or executed existing authors and played the role of literary man, himself (typically badly). Artists therefore went into a repertory of new and dazzling mannerisms, which Teuffel calls \"utter unreality.\" Cruttwell picks up this theme:{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 6}}\n\n{{quote | The foremost of these [characteristics] is unreality, arising from the extinction of freedom...  Hence arose a declamatory tone, which strove by frigid and almost hysterical exaggeration to make up for the healthy stimulus afforded by daily contact with affairs. The vein of artificial rhetoric, antithesis and epigram... owes its origin to this forced contentment with an uncongenial sphere. With the decay of freedom, taste sank...}}\n\n[[File:Marcus Aurelius Metropolitan Museum.png|thumb|upright|right|[[Marcus Aurelius]], emperor over the last generation of classicists and himself a classicist.]]\nIn Cruttwell's view (which had not been expressed by Teuffel), Silver Latin was a \"rank, weed-grown garden,\" a \"decline.\"{{Sfn | Cruttwell | 1877 | p = 341}} Cruttwell had already decried what he saw as a loss of spontaneity in Golden Latin. Teuffel regarded the Silver Age as a loss of natural language, and therefore of spontaneity, implying that it was last seen in the Golden Age. Instead, Tiberius brought about a \"sudden collapse of letters.\" The idea of a decline had been dominant in English society since [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire''. Once again, Cruttwell evidences some unease with his stock pronouncements: \"The ''Natural History'' of Pliny shows how much remained to be done in fields of great interest.\" The idea of Pliny as a model is not consistent with any sort of decline. Moreover, Pliny did his best work under emperors who were as tolerant as Augustus had been. To include some of the best writings of the Silver Age, Cruttwell extended the period through the death of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (180 AD). The philosophic prose of a good emperor was in no way compatible with either Teuffel's view of unnatural language, or Cruttwell's depiction of a decline. Having created these constructs, the two philologists found they could not entirely justify them. Apparently, in the worst implication of their views, there was no such thing as Classical Latin by the ancient definition, and some of the very best writing of any period in world history was deemed stilted, degenerate, unnatural language.\n\nThe Silver Age furnishes the only two extant Latin novels: Apuleius's ''[[The Golden Ass]]'' and Petronius's ''[[Satyricon]]''.\n\nPerhaps history's best-known example of Classical Latin was written by [[Pontius Pilate]] on the placard placed above [[Jesus]]' Cross: [[Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum]], which translates to ''Jesus the Nazarean the King of the Judeans'' (Jesus of Nazareth the King of the Jews).\n\nWriters of the Silver Age include:\n\n===From the Ides of March to Trajan===\n[[File:Germanicus1914.jpg|thumb|125px|Germanicus Caesar]]\n[[File:Seneca-berlinantikensammlung-1.jpg|thumb|125px|Ancient bust of Seneca, part of a [[Double Herm of Socrates and Seneca|double herm]] ([[Antikensammlung Berlin]])]]\n\n* [[Aulus Cremutius Cordus]] (died AD 25), historian\n* [[Marcus Velleius Paterculus]] (19 BC \u2013 31 AD), military officer, historian\n* [[Valerius Maximus]] (1st century AD), rhetorician\n* [[Masurius Sabinus]] (1st century AD), jurist\n* [[Phaedrus (fabulist)|Phaedrus]] (15 BC \u2013 AD 50), fabulist\n* [[Germanicus Julius Caesar]] (15 BC \u2013 AD 19), royal family, imperial officer, translator\n* [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] (25 BC \u2013 AD 50), physician, encyclopedist\n* [[Quintus Curtius Rufus]] (1st century AD), historian\n* [[Cornelius Bocchus]] (1st century AD), natural historian\n* [[Pomponius Mela]] (d.

The latter provides unity, allowing it to be referenced under a single name. Thus Old Latin, Classical Latin, [[Vulgar Latin]], etc., are not considered different languages, but are all referenced under the term, [[Latin]]. This is an ancient practice continued by moderns rather than a philological innovation of recent times. That Latin had case endings is a fundamental feature of the language. Whether a given form of speech prefers to use prepositions such as ''ad'', ''ex'', ''de,'' for \"to,\" \"from\" and \"of\" rather than simple case endings is a matter of style. Latin has a large number of styles. Each and every author has a style, which typically allows his prose or poetry to be identified by experienced Latinists. Problems in comparative literature have risen out of group styles finding similarity by period, in which case one may speak of Old Latin, Silver Latin, Late Latin as styles or a phase of styles.\n\nThe ancient authors themselves first defined style by recognizing different kinds of ''sermo'', or \"speech.\" By valuing Classical Latin as \"first class,\" it was better to write with ''Latinitas'' selected by authors who were attuned to literary and upper-class languages of the city as a standardized style. All ''sermo'' that differed from it was a different style. Thus, in rhetoric, Cicero was able to define sublime, intermediate, and low styles within Classical Latin. St. Augustine recommend low style for sermons.<ref>{{Cite book|page= 33|first= Erich|last= Auerbach |title= Literary Language and its Public in Late Latin Antiquity and in the Middle Ages|publisher= Pantheon Books|year= 1965|origyear= 1958|series= Bollingen Series LXXIV|first2= Ralph (Translator) | last2 =Mannheim}}</ref> Style was to be defined by deviation in speech from a standard.

Furthermore, the genus contains a species (''P. physaloides'' \u2013 recorded in older literature under the synonyms ''Hyoscyamus physalodes'', ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' and ''Scopolia physaloides'') formerly used as an [[entheogen]] in Siberia (re. which see translation of [[Johann Georg Gmelin|Gmelin's]] account of such use below).<ref>R\u00e4tsch, Christian, ''The Encyclopedia of Psychoactive Plants: Ethnopharmacology and Its Applications'' pub.

Hist.'' (an abbreviation of the alternative title ''A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants'') and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'' L. and ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' M. Bieb. \u2013 the latter published by Baron [[Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein]] in his ''Flora taurico-caucasica'' of 1808.\n\n==Common names==\nNot being native to Western Europe, plants belonging to the genus ''Physochlaina'' have no common name of any antiquity in English, nor have they acquired a more recent common name among English-speaking gardeners, despite the passage of two centuries since their introduction to cultivation in the U.K.\n\n[[Robert Sweet (botanist)|Robert Sweet]] coined the English name ''Oriental Henbane'' for ''P. orientalis'' in his work ''The British Flower Garden'' in 1823, but this is simply a translation of the ( now obsolete ) name ''Hyoscyamus orientalis''. He further coins the name ''Purple-flowered Henbane'' for the Siberian species ''P. physaloides'', but this adds to the confusion, as, not only is the species in question no longer classified as a Henbane ( i.e. ''Hyoscyamus'' ) , but there are also a number of ( true ) ''Hyoscyamus'' spp. which bear purple flowers \u2013 e.g. [[Hyoscyamus muticus]].\n\nThere is, however, a common name (age unknown) for ''Physochlaina'' in [[Russian (language)|Russian]], namely \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 (''Puzeernitsa'') \u2013 '[[Pig bladder|bladder]] / [[Bubble (physics)|bubble]] plant', qualified \u041f\u0443\u0437\u044b\u0440\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430 \u0424\u0438\u0437\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0441\u043e\u0432\u0430\u044f (''Puzeernitsa Phizalisovaya'') \u2013 ''Physalis-like Bladder plant'' in the case of ''P. physaloides ''.<ref>YouTube.com Physochlaina videos produced by \u0412\u043e\u043a\u0440\u0443\u0433 \u0421\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0430 (Vokrug Sveta) TV and \u0414\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0443\u0442\u0443\u0513\u0430 (Dmitriy Sutula).</ref> The [[Swedish language|Swedish]] common name for the genus \u2013 ''V\u00e5rbolm\u00f6rt'' \u2013 translates as '[[Spring (season)|Spring]](-flowering) [[Henbane]]',<ref>Glosbe online Swedish dictionary.</ref> while the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] common name ''Kievarinyrtti'' means '[[Inn]] Herb'<ref>Google translate: Finnish to English.</ref> and the Estonian common name is ''Ida-vullrohu'', meaning 'Eastern Henbane'.<ref>Facebook page for Tartu \u00dcllikooli botaanikaaed (= [[University of Tartu Botanical Gardens]] )</ref>\n\nIn [[Turkey (country)|Turkey]], where the species ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is native to the region abutting the easternmost stretch of Turkey's [[Black Sea]] coast, the common name given to the plant is ''Ta\u015f Banotu'', meaning ''Stone Henbane'' i.e. \"the henbane that grows on/out of, stone\" in reference to the plant's ability to thrive in rock crevices [see section below on ''P. orientalis'' with accompanying image of wild specimen growing in crevices in volcanic rock].<ref>https://www.bizimbitkiler.org.tr/v2/sonuc.php?i=Vm0xMFlWbFdWWGhVYmtwUFZsWndUMVl3Vm1GV01XeHpWMjVrV2xadGVIcFhhMUpQVkcxS1NHVkdhRmhXUlRWMldWVmFXbVF4WkhOalJtUlhaV3hhVFZkV1ZtRlhiVlowVW10c1ZXSklRazlaYkZWM1RWWmFWbGRyV2xCV2EwcFRWVVpSZDFCUlBUMD0= Retrieved at 1.30am on 12/2/20</ref><ref>http://www.bizimcicekler.org.tr/gallery.php?taxonID=12831 Retrieved at 2.10am on 12/2/20</ref> The late Professor [[Turhan Baytop]] lists the Turkish common name ''Yalanc\u0131 Banotu'' (= \"False Henbane\") for the plant in his 1963 work on the medicinal and poisonous plants of Turkey.

This Ossetian common name for the plant is thus very similar in meaning to the Russian ''Puzeernitsa'', but it is not clear whether it arose independently or is simply a translation of the Russian name for the plant. This said, [[Vasily Abaev|Abaev]] lists a second meaning (prevalent particularly in the [[Digor dialect]]) of the Ossetian word ''typpyr'', namely '[[kurgan]]' (burial mound), in which the primary sense of 'swelling' is applied specifically to a swelling in the landscape i.e. a [[tumulus]] or small artificial hill. It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds. Such a meaning for this compound would be compatible with a native Ossetian provenance - not unlikely in regard to the name of a plant native to the Caucasus (see below re.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use.

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]].

The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

Gauthier de la Peyronie 1793.</ref>\nAfter accepting a professorship at the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|St Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] offered him by Empress [[Catherine the Great]], Pallas led an expedition lasting from 1768 to 1774, which took him from the central provinces of Russia far to the east - all the way to the lands beyond [[Lake Baikal]]. It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed. (2004). Human: The Definitive Visual Guide. New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal. Entheogens, as their name suggests, are generally used in a ritual or religious setting,<ref>Furst, Peter T. ''Hallucinogens and Culture'' pub.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers.

In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

V) BHL285489.jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' (listed in text as 'Hyoscyamus physalodes') : plate 5 in ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants') pub. [[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

Sansom).]]\n[[File:Physochlaina orientalis mid shot.jpg|thumb|''P. orientalis'' flowering in [[Oxford Botanic Garden]] on the 25th of March 2017.]]\nGeorge Don notes of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in his ' ''A General History...'' ' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

It is thus possible that the compound ''Typpyrgerdeg'' is translateable as ''grave-grass'' i.e. a fodder plant associated in some way with grave mounds.

' of 1838 : <blockquote>'The species of ''Physochlaina'' are extremely desirable plants; being early flowerers, and elegant when in blossom. They will grow in any soil, and are readily propagated by divisions of the root, or by seed. They are well adapted for decorating borders in early spring'.</blockquote>\n\nIn regard to the soil type favoured by wild populations, volume 22 of ''Linnaea'' (in surprisingly geological vein) provides the observation that ''Physochlaina orientalis'' is to be found growing on soils underlain by [[trachyte]]s ([[volcanic rock]]s of a type notably rich in the chemical element [[potassium]], a plant macronutrient essential for the production of flowers and fruit and, in a specifically Solanaceous context, the main ingredient of liquid feed for [[tomato]] plants).\n\n==Use in traditional Chinese medicine==\n[[File:Physochlaina infundibularis single flower.jpg|thumb|Single flower of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' Kuang \u2013 the 'hot ginseng' of [[Mount Hua]], [[Shaanxi]] province.]]\nAt least three species of ''Physochlaina'' are currently used in [[traditional Chinese medicine]] : ''P. infundibularis'', ''P. physaloides'' and ''P. praealta''.\n\n=== ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' ===\n\u6f0f\u6597\u6ce1\u56ca\u8349 ''Lou-dou Pao-nang-ts'ao'' / ''lou dou pao nang cao'' (= 'Funnel-shaped ''Physochlaina'' '). The inhabitants of the neighbouring provinces of [[Shaanxi]] (rendered formerly 'Shensi') and [[Henan]] hold ''P. infundibularis'' in high esteem as a medicinal plant, regarding it as a kind of [[ginseng]] : most unusually for a toxic [[Solanaceae|Solanaceous]] plant (totally unrelated botanically to the [[Araliaceae|Araliaceous]] ginseng genus [[Panax]]) it is considered to be a 'general tonic' ( = [[adaptogen]]). The Chinese element \u53c2 ''shen'' (= ''ginseng'') forms a part of two of the common names for the plant, namely \u534e\u5c71\u53c2 ''Hua-shan-shen'' (= ''ginseng of [[Mount Hua]]'') and ''Je-shen'' (= ''hot ginseng'' \u2013 from its hot, sweet, slightly bitter and astringent taste).\n\nAs with Panax, it is the fleshy root of ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' that forms the drug : the fresh, raw roots are first peeled and then boiled in a sugar solution containing small quantities of three other herbal drugs, before being dried, ready for storage and use. The three drugs added to the boiling solution are the root of ''[[Glycyrrhiza uralensis]]'', the [[rhizome]] of ''[[Ophiopogon japonicus]]'' and the fruits of ''[[Gardenia jasminoides]]''. This peeling, boiling and addition of 'cooling', [[yin and yang|'yin']] drugs is undertaken to mitigate the 'heat' / toxicity of the ''Physochlaina infundibularis'' roots.\n\nIn addition to its use as an adaptogen, ''P. infundibularis'' is used (in traditional Chinese medicine) in the treatment of [[asthma]], [[Bronchitis#Chronic bronchitis|chronic bronchitis]], [[abdominal pain]], [[palpitations]] and [[insomnia]] and as a [[sedative]]. The drug is also used to treat [[diarrhea]] of the kind considered in traditional Chinese medicine to be 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold'.<ref>Peigen, Xiao and Liyi, He ''Ethnopharmacologic investigation on tropane-containing drugs in Chinese Solanaceous plants'' in ''Journal of Ethnopharmacology'' Volume 8 No. 1 July (1983) pub. Elsevier.</ref>\n\nThe nomenclatural association of ''P. infundibularis'' with Mount Hua \u2013 'West Great Mountain' of the [[Sacred Mountains of China|Five Great Mountains of China]] of [[Taoism]] \u2013  is an interesting one and merits further study : in common with other mountains regarded in China as [[numinous]]/[[Xian ling]], Mount Hua (a precipitous assemblage of five (counted anciently only as three) peaks in the [[Qin Mountains|Qin range]]) is held to be a source of rare medicinal plants and life-prolonging [[Elixir of life|elixirs]]. Furthermore, at the foot of the West Peak of Mount Hua (known as Lianhua Feng (\u84ee\u82b1\u5cf0) or Furong Feng (\u8299\u84c9\u5cf0), both meaning [[Lotus Flower]] Summit) stood, from as early as the second century BCE, a [[Taoist temple]] which was the site of [[Shamanism|shamanic]] practices undertaken by [[Tongji (spirit medium)|spirit mediums]] (see also [[Wu (shaman)]]) to contact an (unnamed) God of the [[Diyu|Underworld]] and his minions, believed to dwell in the heart of the mountain.(See also [[Chinese folk religion]]).<ref>Goossaert, Vincent. \"Huashan.\" in Fabrizio Pregadio, ed., The Encyclopedia of Taoism (London: Routledge, 2008), 481\u2013482.</ref> Tropane-containing, Solanaceous plants (such as ''[[Datura]]'' and ''[[Hyoscyamus]]'' spp.) have a long history of use as entheogens in shamanic practices<ref>Harner, Michael J., ''Hallucinogens and Shamanism'', pub.

In the traditional systems of medicine in China and Mongolia it is considered to have the effects of 'combatting weakness', 'warming up the [[stomach]]', 'soothing the mental condition' and relieving asthma. It is also used for treating 'diarrhea due to deficiency of vital energy with symptoms of cold' and 'cough or asthma caused by excessive [[phlegm]] or [[neurasthenia]]'.\nNote : the medical concept neurasthenia \u2013 now largely abandoned in Western medicine \u2013 is expressed in Chinese as ''shenjing shuairuo'' (simplified Chinese: \u795e\u7ecf\u8870\u5f31), a compound of ''shenjing'' 'nervous' and ''shuairuo'' 'weakness', and the Chinese condition so described is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] encompassing debility, emotional turmoil, excitement, tension-induced pain and sleep disturbances, caused by a depletion of [[qi]] ('vital energy') and impaired functioning of the [[Zang-fu#Five System|''wuzang'']] (= 'five vital organs').<ref>Schwartz, Pamela Yew (September 2002). \"Why is neurasthenia important in Asian cultures?\".

When they had returned to their senses, they named these falls The Drunken Rapids and, because one suffers a [[headache]] after such a [[Binge drinking|debauch]], they named the falls that they encountered next Pokhmelnoy Porog [ Russian: \u041f\u043e\u0445\u043c\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u041f\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0433 : The [[Hangover|Hungover]] Rapids ].</Blockquote>\nHis curiosity aroused, Gmelin investigated, and discovered an attractive new species :\n<Blockquote>This account has given me the opportunity to reveal the identity of the beautiful plant involved, which was unknown to any botanist before me : '' Hyoscyamus foliis integerrimis calicibus inflatis subglobosis '' [Botanical Latin : 'The Henbane having simple, untoothed leaves and (fruiting ) calyces that are more or less round and inflated' [ i.e. like those of a [[Physalis]] ]] Linn. h. Ups. 44. 2.</Blockquote>\nHaving identified the ( Linnaean ) genus Hyoscyamus to which the intoxicating plant of The Drunken Rapids ( since moved by Don to the genus Physochlaina ) belonged, Gmelin went on to quiz his local guides and learned the following concerning its intentional consumption :\n<blockquote>If one steeps the leaves or even the finely-chopped roots of this plant in brewed beer \u2013 or, better yet, in beer that is still undergoing [[Ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] \u2013 then it takes but a single glass of such beer to make a man exceedingly foolish : it is surely a strange draught that he quaffs, for he is robbed of all his senses, or at least finds his senses grossly disordered, [[Macropsia|mistaking tiny things for huge ones]] : a straw for the thickest of [[Beam (structure)|beams]], a drop of water for a mighty ocean and a mouse for an elephant. Wherever he goes he encounters [ what he imagines to be ] insurmountable obstacles. He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him, and, as it seems, all this fills him with despair, because his senses are withering away; thus, should one such drunkard go to step over a beam, he will take a great stride out of all proportion to the actual size of it, while another will see deep water in front of him [ where there is only shallow ] such that he dare not venture into it.</blockquote>\nIn conclusion, Gmelin then adds, concerning the plant itself : \n<blockquote>The local inhabitants often use these roots when they want to play a [[practical joke|prank]] upon each other. The Russian merchants often bring these roots back with them when they return to Russia, because they maintain them to be a sovereign remedy for bleeding [[haemorrhoids]] and also against the [[haematuria]] \u2013 a claim which I have been unable to verify.<ref>[[Johann Georg Gmelin]], ''Reise durch Sibirien'' von dem Jahre 1738 bis zum ende 1740, Bd. 3 & 4 , Vandenhoeck, G\u00f6ttingen, 1752.</ref></blockquote>\n\nGmelin's ''Reise durch Sibirien'' \u2013  with its evocative account of his findings concerning the plant now known to science as ''Physochlaina physaloides'' \u2013  received a translation into French which was published as part of Volume 18 of [[Abb\u00e9 Pr\u00e9vost]]'s monumental ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale des voyages'' \u2013 a compendium of eighteenth century exploration by land and sea, continued beyond the original fifteen volumes, by other authors following the death of Pr\u00e9vost in 1763.

Gmelin and Krasheninnikov's accounts of the effects of intoxication by the plant and mushroom in question both derive from their participation in the extraordinary [[Great Northern Expedition]] (known also as the Second [[Kamchatka Peninsula|Kamchatka]] Expedition). As described above, they were travelling together in Central Siberia in the summer of 1738 on the occasion of Gmelin's discovery of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' and learning from the Evenk of the curious effects produced by the beer which they prepared from it. Gmelin was, at the time, one of three professors heading the Academic Group of the expedition, and his particular area of expertise within that group concerned the animal, vegetable and mineral kingdoms, his brief being to document the fauna, flora and mineral wealth of Siberia encountered in their travels. After many adventures, including the encounter with ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on the Angara river near [[Yeniseysk]], Professors Gmelin and [[Gerhard Friedrich M\u00fcller|M\u00fcller]], student Krasheninnikov and many other expedition members gathered at [[Vitus Bering]]'s base at [[Yakutsk]]. It was from here that Gmelin sent Krasheninnikov ahead to [[Okhotsk]] and Kamchatka to reconnoitre, make preliminary observations and prepare accommodation, and it was thus that he came to be the member of the expedition with the most extensive knowledge of the Kamchatka peninsula,<ref>Hintzsche / Nickol, Die Gro\u00dfe Nordische Expedition</ref> publishing his observations in 1755 in the work ''\u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438'' (''Description of the Land of Kamchatka'') \u2013 from Chapter 14 of which the following passage is translated: \n<blockquote>...persons thus intoxicated [by ''Amanita muscaria''] have hallucinations, as if in a fever; they are subject to various visions, terrifying or felicitous, depending on differences in temperament, owing to which some jump, some dance, others cry and suffer great terrors, while some might deem a small crack to be as wide as a door, and a tub of water as deep as the sea.<ref>Krasheninnikov, Stepan \u041e\u043f\u0438\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u043b\u0438 \u041a\u0430\u043c\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0438 (''Opisanie Zemli Kamchatki'' - Description of the Land of Kamchatka), pub.

Harvest/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich - from an edition of 1949 edited under the auspices of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTo the above may readily be compared Gmelin's ''mistaking a drop of water for a mighty ocean'' and ''He pictures continually to himself the cruellest and most dreadful imaginings of an inevitable death awaiting him''.\nThe phenomenon, described in similar terms by Gmelin and Krasheninnikov in their respective accounts, is that of [[macropsia]] - whereby small objects are perceived as being enormous - a symptom of (among other conditions, both natural and self-inflicted) the use of psychoactive drugs<ref>Unnithan SB, Cutting JC. The cocaine experience: Refuting the concept of a model psychosis? Psychopathol 1992; 25: 71-78.</ref> (see also [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome|dysmetropsia]]).\nIt is not clear, in this context, whether the similarity between the two accounts is due simply to the fungal and the plant drug eliciting similar symptoms or whether there has been a borrowing of phraseology from one author to another (in which direction it is hard to say). The inference would likely be that any borrowing were from the Physochlaina account to the Amanita account, were it not for the fact that accounts of macropsia caused by tropane-containing Solanaceae are rare, while those of macropsia caused by ''Amanita muscaria'' are common (or perhaps merely oft-repeated, from a few early sources).\nTo this question one may further adduce the account of ''Amanita muscaria''-induced macropsia in another early source, namely that of [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]], which seems as close in tone to Gmelin's account as does that of Krasheninnikov:\n<blockquote>The nerves are highly stimulated, and in this state the slightest effort of will produces very powerful effects. Consequently, if one wishes to step over a small stick or straw, he steps and jumps as though the obstacles were tree trunks. If a man is ordinarily talkative...he involuntarily blurts out secrets, fully conscious of his actions and aware of his secret but unable to hold his nerves in check. The muscles are controlled by an uncoordinated activity of the nerves themselves, uninfluenced by and unconnected with the higher willpower of the brain, and thus it has occasionally happened that persons in this stage of intoxication found themselves driven irresistibly into ditches, streams, ponds and the like, seeing the impending danger before their eyes but unable to avoid certain death except by the assistance of friends who rushed to their aid.<ref>von Langsdorff, Georg Heinrich ''Einige Bemerkungen, die Eigenschaften des Kamtschadalischen Fliegenschwammes betreffend'' (''Some Remarks Concerning the Properties of the Fly Agaric of Kamchatka'') ''Wetterauischen Gesellschaft f\u00fcr die gesammte Naturkunde.

One recalls also the reference to the danger (or fear) of falling into deep water. Furthermore it is possible that the phrase 'he speaks continually without knowing what he is saying' which has crept into the Pr\u00e9vost ' ''Histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale...'' ' version of Gmelin's account may have influenced von Langsdorff's description of the compulsive blabbering of the Amanita-intoxicated individual.\n\nThe northern Tungusic peoples, such as the Evens of eastern Siberia and the Evenks of central Siberia (encountered by Gmelin), have occasionally been reported to have used ''Amanita muscaria'' as an intoxicant, although with nothing like the frequency of certain other ethnolinguistic groups, such as, for instance, the [[Itelmens]] and [[Koryaks]] encountered by Krasheninnikov.<ref name=\"nyberg1\">{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71\u201380|pages=71\u201380|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf|doi=10.29203/ka.1992.294}}</ref>\nThe use of ''Amanita muscaria'' by the Tungus (Evenki) as an additional ingredient to their ''Physochlaina'' beer would furnish yet a third explanation for the similarities in the reported effects of the Tungus drink and the Fly Agaric, but Gmelin makes no mention of such a fungal ingredient and, given that the use of ''Physochlaina'' as an intoxicant appears to have ceased among the Tungus of the Angara river region, no more information on the subject is likely to be forthcoming.\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and the narcotic \"coffee\" of Dauria==\n[[File:Pallas PS by Tardier grey.jpg|thumb|18th century [[Prussia]]n botanist, zoologist and [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peter Simon Pallas]], the first to document [[Transbaikalia|Daurian]] Tungus use of the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' to brew a narcotic \"coffee\".]]\n[[File:John-Tallis-1851-Tibet-Mongolia-and-Manchuria-NE.jpg|thumb|John Tallis's 1851 map of [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]], Mongolia and Manchuria, showing (top left, south of the (then) regional capital [[Nerchinsk]]) \"Tchindat\" (= Chindanturuk) on the river [[Onon River|Onon]], near its confluence with the [[Borzya River|Borzya]] where Pallas encountered ''Physochlaina physaloides'' on Crane Rock (Tungus: ''Kiro\u00e9'').]]\n[[File:Ecoregion PA0804.png|thumb|Daurian forest steppe ecoregion (shaded purple), east of [[Lake Baikal]], west of [[Hulun Lake|Lake Hulun]] and straddling the border between Russia and Mongolia.]]\n[[File:\u0421\u043e\u043f\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430 \u0441\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0435 \u043e\u0437\u0435\u0440\u0430 \u0417\u0443\u043d-\u0422\u043e\u0440\u0435\u0439.jpg|thumb|Daurian landscape: the salt lake Zuun-Torey (Pallas's \"Zagan Nuur\"), [[Borzinsky District]], lying just to the south of the [[Borzya River]], a tributary of the Onon.]]\n[[File:Linguistic map of the Tungusic languages (en).png|thumb|Distribution of speakers of Tungusic languages, 2011.

It was here in [[Transbaikalia|Dauria]] (a.k.a. \"Dahuria\") - where the eastern extremity of Mongolia meets southern Siberia and western [[Manchuria]] - that he encountered, not only the [[Daur people]] for whom the region is named, but also certain Tungusic tribes who prepared a curious intoxicating drink. The following passage is translated from de la Peyronie\u2019s French edition of 1793.\n<blockquote>1772. 31 May. The road to Chindanturuk never leaves the river ([[Onon]]) with its charming bed. The banks presented a delightful prospect of Spring flowers...At a distance of twenty-seven [[verst]]s from the stream Udagata\u00ef, one finds rising from the shallows of the river a great steep and craggy rock which the Tungus call ''Kiro\u00e9'' (\"[[Crane (bird)|crane]]\" in their language), lying near to the [ junction of the Onon with the river] [[Borzya River|Borsa]]...I observed growing among the [[Urtica|nettles]] which surround the base of this rock the [[Physalis]]-like henbane (''Hyoscyamus physaloides''). The Tungus make use of its narcotic seed; they roast it like [[coffee]] and drink the decoction with their dinner.<ref name= \"Pallas Voyages\"/></blockquote>\nA second account (later in publication date than the ''Reisen...'' but earlier than the ''Voyages...'') of the relevant part of Pallas's expedition by an anonymous anthologist of eighteenth century travel writing provides some further details absent from the French translation and derived possibly from Pallas's original German text.\n<blockquote>The lowlands lead onward to the outpost of Udagatai, and, farther yet to Chindanturuk, where one sees growing in abundance, beneath the nettles which grow beside the rocks, ''Hyosciamus physalodes'' [sic], a rare plant, the intoxicating seed (which ripens toward the end of July) of which the Tungus roast thoroughly in a frying pan, as one roasts coffee, and boil to make a beverage which they drink with their dinner.<ref>[Author anonymous] ''Histoire des Decouvertes faites par divers savans voyageurs dans plusieurs contr\u00e9es de la Russie & de la Perse, relativement \u00e0 l'Histoire civile & naturelle \u00e0 l'\u00c9conomie rurale, au commerce &c''. pub. Aberne, chez Fran\u00e7ois Seizer et Comp., 1787.</ref></blockquote>\nThe question naturally arises as to which Tungusic people (or peoples) it was that Pallas encountered in Dauria. The Daurs themselves are speakers of the [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic language]] [[Dagur language|Daur]] (a.k.a. Dagur), but there are three Daurian ethnic groupings of Tungus affiliation, namely the [[Oroqen people|Oroqen]], [[Solon people|Solon]] and [[Hamnigan]] (spelled also \"Khamnigan\"). These three have all been considered subgroups of the [[Evenks]], but the Solon and, more especially the Khamnigan have interacted closely with the Mongolic Daur, [[Buryats|Buryat]] and [[Khalkha Mongols|Khalkha]] peoples to the extent that they are ethnically quite distinct from the Evenki of the Yenissei, encountered by Gmelin.<ref>Winston, Robert, ed.

New York: Dorling Kindersley. p. 428. {{ISBN|0-7566-0520-2}}.</ref>\nScholar of eastern Asiatic languages Professor [[Juha Janhunen]] of the [[University of Helsinki]] is of the opinion that the Khamnigan (with whom he has personally undertaken fieldwork) are of Mongolic rather than Tungusic ethnic affiliation and that, of the remaining two groups (Oroqen and Solon), the Oroqen are the closest to the Evenki proper (which group includes the Evenki of the Yenisei basin).<ref>Janhunen, Juha (1996), ''Manchuria: an ethnic history'', Volume 222 of Suomalais-ugrilaisen Seuran toimituksia, Suomalais-ugrilainen Seura, Finno-Ugrian Society</ref> If this is indeed the case, then it may have been the Oroqen who were preparing a narcotic drink from roasted Physochlaina seed, assuming that Physochlaina use was a peculiarly North Tungusic culture trait - as manifested also in the brewing of Physochlaina beer by the Evenki of the Yenisei.\n\nThere remain questions concerning the Tungus \"coffee\" itself: to guess at its effects one would need to know the average tropane alkaloid content of seeds and also to what extent - if any - the roasting or dry-frying of this seed would diminish such content.\n\nA comparison of Gmelin's vivid description of the effects of the Yeniseian Physochlaina beer and such meagre information as is given in Pallas's account of the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of Dauria is instructive: the former paints a picture of an intoxication so strong as to be terrifying rather than pleasurable and accompanied by the profoundly disorientating symptom of macropsia, while the latter suggests almost a Tungus version of a coffee morning or dinner party where a mild [[stimulant]] like coffee or a mild intoxicant like wine is consumed to promote [[Drinking culture|conviviality]]: judging from the testimony of Gmelin, one doubts whether a consumer of Physochlaina beer could muster the coordination to eat at all, let alone converse coherently during a meal.

This said, there is nothing in the Gmelin account that smacks of the religious (although it is not known if he ever witnessed Physochlaina intoxication at first hand) and there do not appear to be any surviving accounts of the use of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' in shamanic practices - if, indeed, any such ever existed.\n\n[[Carl Hartwich]] mentions thus the Physochlaina \"coffee\" of the Tungus on page 327 of his monumental ''Die Menschlichen Genussmittel'':\n<blockquote> Hyoscyamus sp. Die ger\u00f6steten samen werden in Sibirien bei den Tungusen benutzt. Die d\u00fcrften stark narkotisch sein. (Welter S. 427)) (Translation: Hyoscyamus sp. The roasted seeds are used by the Tungus in Siberia. They are likely to be very narcotic (Welter S. 427)).<ref name= \"Hartwich Menschlichen\"/></blockquote>\nAs is the case with his note on Tungus Physochlaina beer, Hartwich quotes as a reference, not a primary source in German from the work of an 18th-century explorer, but a secondary French source - in this case a work devoted to coffee and its substitutes by one Henri Welter.,<ref>Welter, Henri, ''Essaie sur l'histoire du Caf\u00e9'', pub. Paris 1868.</ref> page 427 of which bears the note:\n<blockquote>Les [[Kalmuks|Kalmouks]] et les Tongouses de la Sib\u00e9rie se pr\u00e9pare des boissons semblables au caf\u00e9, les premiers avec les graines de ''l'Erable de Tartarie'' (''Acer tartaricum'', L.) et les seconds avec celles d'une esp\u00e8ce de ''jusquiame''.\n(Translation: The Kalmuks and Tungus of Siberia prepare for themselves drinks similar to coffee, the former with the seeds of the Tartar Maple (''Acer tartaricum'' L.) and the latter with those of a species of ''henbane''). </blockquote>\nIt will be seen from the above that the comment concerning the narcotic potential of \"Hyoscyamus\" seed (meaning, in this context, the seed of ''Physochlaina physaloides'')\nis absent from the Welter source and has been added by the more ethnobotanically-literate Hartwich. Welter's essay on the history of coffee unfortunately lacks a bibliography, but the source of his information is almost certainly Pallas, who makes plain that the plant intended is specifically that now known not as ''Hyoscyamus physaloides'', but as ''Physochlaina physaloides''. Welter and Hartwich mention, respectively, in this context \"a species of ''henbane''\" and \"Hyoscyamus sp.\"\n\n==Chemistry==\n''Physochlaina'' species have yielded a variety of [[tropane alkaloids]], including not only the [[hyoscyamine]] and [[hyoscine|scopolamine]] present also in better-known Solanaceous genera such as [[Atropa]], [[Hyoscyamus]] and [[Scopolia]], but also the new ([[eponymous]]) base physochlaine, first isolated from the aerial parts of the Central Asian species ''Physochlaina alaica'' Korotkova ex Kovalevsk.<ref>Mirzamatov R., Luftullin K., Mallikov V. and Yunusov, S.

( Compare also a similar penchant for growing in rock crevices on the part of the Xinjiang species ''Physochlaina capitata'' \u2013 see above ).\n\nThe plant's country of origin is given in von Bieberstein's original description of ' ''Hyoscyamus orientalis'' ' (now ''Physochlaina orientalis'') as Caucasian [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]]  \u2013 a former kingdom, the heartland of which is the modern [[Georgia (Caucasus)|Georgian]] province of [[Kartli]]. The Caucasian Kingdom of Iberia also encompassed parts of [[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], southern [[Russia]] and eastern Turkey.\n\n[[Flora Iranica]] is in agreement on this range of occurrence for ''P. orientalis'', adding also to the list of territories not only north-western Iran but also 'Syr Darja' \u2013 the latter being referable to lands traversed by the river [[Syr Darya]] and, more especially the historic [[Syr-Darya Oblast]] and hence modern [[Uzbekistan]]. Uzbekistan lies outside the area encompassed by Flora Iranica, but parts of neighbouring [[Turkmenistan]] do not. Either way, Flora Iranica is unequivocal in describing the range of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' as extending eastward into [[Central Asia]].\n\n===Physochlaina alaica - an endangered medicinal plant of Central Asia===\nIn this context, it may be noted that Phillips and Rix include in their work on garden perennials a photograph of a second, (not universally accepted) ''Physochlaina'' species of unequivocally Central Asian provenance, namely ''P. alaica'' Korotk. ex Kovalevsk, recorded as growing in the [[Pamir-Alay]], a Central Asian mountain range taking in parts not only of Uzbekistan, but also of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]]. ''Physochlaina alaica'' differs from ''P. orientalis'' in having flowers of a beige or yellowish-buff colour and corolla 'throats' veined within in a contrasting dark brown. As is to be expected of a plant native to the [[Pamirs]], this species is extremely hardy, if grown in dry (i.e. well-drained) conditions.<ref name= \"Perennials 1991\"/> Its common name in the [[Uzbek language]] is ''Oloy xiyoli'',\nof which the first word ''Oloy'' signifies (like the Latin specific name ''alaica'') \"of the Alay mountains\" while the second element ''xiyoli'' appears to bear some relation to the Arabic loan-word ''xiyol'' [pronounced \"khiyol\"] translatable possibly in this context as \"short-lived\" - in reference to the plant's short growing season and quick flowering as a desert ephemeral, fuelled by food reserves stored in its fleshy roots.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\">Mamatqulova (Yuldasheva), Gulzira, (2016), ''Ekologik Omillarni O'zbekiston Hududida Tarqalgan Noyob O'simliklarga Ta'siri va Ularni Muhofaza Qilish'' (Translation: \"The Impact of Ecological Factors upon some Unique Plants found within the Territory of [[Uzbekistan]] and Measures Needed for their Protection\"), paper submitted for the degree of BSc, Dept. of Biology and Ecology in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, [[Andijan State University]], Republic of Uzbekistan.

According to her account, the plant is endemic to the Alay and [[Turkestan Range|Turkestan mountains]] of the [[Fergana Region]] (see also [[Fergana Valley]]). In this context she also mentions the Alay Ridge and the basins of the Shohimardon and [[Sokh River|Sokh]] rivers. [Note: there is no page \"Shohimardon River\" on either English or Uzbek Wikipedias, but see page [[Shohimardon]] (village)]. In neighbouring Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, she again mentions the Turkestan range, within which she singles out the villages of [[Vorukh]] and [[Khojabakkir]]. Habitat: the plant is to be found at altitudes between 1,800 and 2,000m, usually in the shade of rocks, bushes or [[Juniper|juniper trees]], but also in open ground. Mamatqulova estimates that there are only some 8,000 plants of this species remaining in the wild. She attributes the increasing rarity of the plant and shrinkage of its range to its over-collection (along with other local species of medicinal plant, such as [[Ungernia|Ungernia victoris]]) for medicinal purposes by the indigenous peoples of the area. The plant is included in the [[IUCN Red List|Red Book]] for the area, despite which no special safeguards have yet been put in place to halt its worrying decline. ''Physochlaina alaica'' has been in cultivation in the [[Botanical Garden of the Academy of Sciences of the Republic of Uzbekistan]], [[Tashkent]] since 1973.<ref name= \"Mamatqulova 2016\"/>\n\n===A Glimpse of the Ethnobotany of ''Physochlaina orientalis'' in the extreme NW of Iran===\nIn contrast to the case of its Siberian relative ''Physochlaina physaloides'', ethnobotanical data concerning the [[Western Asia]]n ''P. orientalis'' is somewhat sparse. A recent report from [[Urmia County]] and [[Silvaneh District]] in the Iranian province of [[West Azerbaijan Province|West Azerbaijan]] is thus of particular interest. In 2014 the [[Iranian Students News Agency]] published an online report from the manager of the medicinal plants group of [[Urmia University]] concerning the 'detection' of medicinal properties in two plant species of the West Azerbaijani flora - one of which was ''Physochlaina orientalis''. The locality given for the plants in question is 'Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoy' but is not clear from the context whether plant material from the locality  was collected and analysed for active constituents and/or information was gathered concerning the plants from a local informant with knowledge of the plants' properties. The I.S.N.A. article quotes from an interview with (Dr. ?) Abbas Siami, head of the Zarineh Khoi Institute of Higher Education in which he states the following:\n<blockquote>Thanks to the efforts of researchers at Zarineh Khoi University, the plant ''Physochlaina orientalis'' [was found at] Khoi Heights. It was discovered 'in therapeutic use' [?] at the Heights of Dalampur, Urmia. The Urmia University Department of Medicinal Plants, in describing the therapeutic properties of the plant said: \"This plant is a sedative, nerve stimulant, analgesic, poison and hallucinogen\".</blockquote>\n\nTransliterations of place names in the various languages of Iran from the original [[Persian alphabet|Perso-Arabic script]] forms into Latin script can often yield a confusing number of variant spellings - as is apparent in the variant forms ''Khoi'' and ''Khoy'' and the still more divergent ''Dalampur'', ''Dalampir'' and \n(with a variant medial consonant as well as vowel) ''Dalanpar'' ''Dalanper'' etc.\n''Khoy'' / ''Khoi'' University likely refers to the Khoy campus of Urmia University, while the Heights of ''Dalampur'' (etc.) appears to designate an area of natural beauty and Iranian domestic  tourism encompassing a peak (37\u00b09\u2032N 44\u00b047\u2032E) which forms the [[tripoint]] of Iran, [[Iraq]] and Turkey, lying some 50km from the city of [[Urmia]].<ref>\u06a9\u0634\u0641 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0635 \u062f\u0627\u0631\u0648\u064a\u064a \u062f\u0648 \u06af\u064a\u0627\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0639\u0627\u062a \u062f\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0648\u0645\u064a\u0647 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u064a (Translation: ''Detection of Medicinal Properties of Two Plants at Dalampir Heights of Urmia and Khoi'') - article in  I.S.N.A. web archive dated Monday September 21, 2014 1.50pm.

[[Leiden University|Leyden University]] 1775 by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] - who also engraved the coloured plates.]]\nAn early botanical illustration - possibly the first such to be made - of ''Physochlaina physaloides'' is that engraved by [[Nicolaas Meerburgh]] (then ''hortulanus'' (director) of the [[Hortus Botanicus Leiden]]) for his work of 1775 ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' (= 'Pictures of Rare Plants').\nThe drawing rendered in the engraving is a depiction of a living specimen created when the plant was in flower in the Spring - a realistic portrayal of an outlying portion of an established clump of the plant, uprooted when in full growth for the purposes of illustration, rather than during the more appropriate period (for propagation by division) of the plant's Summer dormancy.\nClearly visible are the tuberous rootstock, with attached roots, and three attached dead stems (two still bearing withered scale leaves) from the previous season's aerial growth. [See image below].\nVan Meerburgh is at great pains to establish in the short preface to his work the richness in rare species and impeccable Linnaean credentials of the Leiden botanic garden and the need he felt to exist to provide accurate botanical illustrations to supplement dry, botanical descriptions.\n\n<blockquote>... experience had taught me daily how difficult it is to distinguish a great many plants, not hitherto well-known, one from another - even those described accurately by Linnaeus and other eminent botanists - and such descriptions may now profitably be compared with actual images of the plants: a better opportunity so to do than I have today could hardly arise, since the Botanic Garden of this University (which need bow to none other in Europe) boasts a great many beautiful species of plant, which one would be hard-pressed to find in many a garden, thanks to the great Linnaeus...and which have - so far as I am aware - been properly depicted nowhere else.<ref>van Meerburgh, Nicolaas, ''Afbeeldingen van zeldzaame gewassen'' pub. University of Leiden 1775.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn the second page following his introduction, van Meerburgh states thus that the plant depicted in plate 5 of his work is 'Hyoscyamus physalodes' (i.e. the plant now known correctly as ''Physochlaina physaloides'')  :\n\n<blockquote>HYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) TAB. V.\nHYOSCYAMUS (physalodes) foliis ovatis integerrimis,\ncalycibus inflatis subglobosis Linn. Sp. pl. p. 258</blockquote>\n\n- text incorporating the description in [[Species Plantarum]] and deriving from volume one of Linnaeus's earlier work [[Hortus Upsaliensis]] of 1748,in which a binomial was assigned the plant discovered by Gmelin [see section above].\nAll the above noted, because of the time of year at which the Leiden specimen was drawn, no ripe fruiting calyces were available for depiction. Furthermore the flowers of the specimen display exserted pistils and stamens and the leaves have pointed tips and sinuate margins - all of which suggest an identity compatible more with the Caucasian ''Physochlaina orientalis'' rather than the Siberian ''P. physaloides''. The question could be resolved by recourse to actual plant material held (or grown) by the herbarium and/or garden of Lieden's Hortus Botanicus at the present time.\n\n[Note: the butterfly species depicted in the plate is a Parnassius - possibly ''[[Parnassius mnemosyne]]'', the Clouded Apollo].\n\n==''Physochlaina physaloides'' and ''P. orientalis''==\n[[File:Comparison fruiting calyces Physochlaina orientalis and P. physaloides.jpg|thumb|Contrast between ripe fruiting calyces of ''P. orientalis'' and ''P. physaloides'' - marked enough probably to justify maintaining these as distinct species: calyx of ''P. orientalis'' resembles a squat, pyriform version of the (rigid) fruiting calyx of ''Hyoscyamus'', while that of ''P. physaloides'' resembles (as the specific name suggests) the (papery / bladder-like) fruiting calyx of ''Physalis''.]]\n[[File:Curtis's botanical magazine (No. 852) (8469918743).jpg|thumb|''Physochlaina physaloides'' in Curtis's botanical magazine, 1805, (No. 852) (8469918743).

' entry on his new genus :\n\n<blockquote>This is very like ''P. physaloides''; but differs in the higher stature, and more robust habit; in the herb being pale green, and more downy; the calyx being longer; and in the tube of the corolla widening gradually to the top; in the genitals being usually exserted; and in the calyx being less inflated, and hardly twice as long as the capsule.</blockquote >\n\nHeight, robustness and also, to an extent, stem and foliage colour being omitted from the discussion as functions of genetic strain, habitat and nutrition, one is left with relative pubescence, flower shape, exsertion of style and stamens and length and degree of inflation of the fruiting calyx as means of differentiating Don's original two species. To this list may be added the texture of the respective fruiting calyces - as referenced in the common names in Russian of the two species [see above].\n\nIf Physochlaina orientalis were to be demoted to a subspecies of P. physaloides, one would be left with a single, rather variable species, found over an immense range stretching thousands of kilometers from Eastern Turkey through Iran, Central Asia, China and Mongolia all the way to southeastern Siberia.\n\nGiven the Central Asiatic provenance of the not-universally-accepted species ''Physochlaina alaica'' and ''P. semenowii'' and the assertion in ''Flora Iranica'' that P. orientalis may be found in Central Asia, it may be that more than one Physochlaina species will be subsumed in the concept of a variable and very wide-ranging P. physaloides.\n\nSuch variability and wide distribution bear comparison with those of a much better-known Solanaceous plant : ''[[Atropa belladonna]]'', which a consultation of the literature will reveal to have acquired a relatively large number of specific and subspecific names now largely reduced to synonymy with ''A. belladonna'' as local varieties of a single very variable species found from the U.K. in the West to northern Iran in the East.<ref>http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/search?q=Atropa</ref>\n\n==Gallery I==\nShoot development and anthesis in Physochlaina orientalis \n<gallery>\nFile:IMG 4391 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : shoot from tuberous rootstock at first emergence from soil,showing strong, purple pigmentation of new growth.\nFile:IMG 4403 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after four days displaying silvery pubescence and purple venation of young foliage.\nFile:IMG 4428 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis : same shoot after nine days, bearing developing flower buds displaying imbricate corolla aestivation.\nFile:IMG 4450 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (ten days) emergent corollae displaying incipient purple pigmentation.\nFile:IMG 4464 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (eleven days) emergent corollae fully pigmented.\nFile:IMG 4465 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (twelve days) corollae unfurl to reveal contrasting purple styles and white stigmas.\nFile:IMG 4566 Physochlaina orientalis Shoot.jpg|Physochlaina orientalis shoot (thirteen days) Majority of corollae now fully mature and infundibuliform.\n</gallery>\n\n==Gallery II==\nFruiting calyces\n<gallery>\nFile:Physochlaina orientalis, interior fruiting calyx, mature operculum.jpg|Close-up of mature fruiting calyces of ''Physochlaina orientalis'', one angled to show operculum within, shortly before dehiscence of pyxidial seed capsule.

Fighting [[kidnapping]] and [[terrorism]] are part of their duties, as well as protection and [[emergency evacuation|evacuation]] of [[United States nationality law|U.S. citizens]] out of crisis areas and training of personnel in foreign countries.\n\nMSD also augments other DSS agents in high-threat or high-profile protection missions.\n\nMSD is based in [[Dunn Loring, Virginia]] and consists of a headquarters element, tactical medical staff, training cadre, logistic staff, and 12 operational teams with six agents each.  The team's three primary missions are:\n*'''Mobile Training Teams''' ('''MTT'''), hold classes for local law enforcement at embassies and consulates, [[Marine Corps Security Guard|U.S. Marine Corps Security Guards (MSG)]]  and select foreign personnel.\n[[File:U.S. Dept. of State Mobile Security Deployment Special Agents at work (2).jpg|thumb|U.S. Dept. of State DSS Mobile Security Deployments Special Agents]]\n*'''Security Support Teams''' ('''SST''') are trained for counterattacks on U.S. embassies or threats against diplomatic personnel.  SSTs react to international crises or threats on short notice in order to enhance and ensure security of U.S. Department of State personnel and facilities, and assist in evacuations if necessary.\n*'''Tactical Support Teams''' ('''TST''') were established in the 1990s and are typically assigned as a heavily armed reaction force in support of the protective service details assigned to high profile protectees, such as the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]].  TSTs typically shadow such protective details.\n\nMSD cooperates closely with other [[Government agency|federal agencies]], such as the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], the [[Fleet Antiterrorism Security Team]]s of the [[United States Marine Corps]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] and local [[law enforcement agency|law enforcement agencies]], both domestic and foreign.\n\n==Selection and training==\nMSD agents are selected from DSS agents who voluntarily want to join the specialized unit.  These agents are expected to maintain more stringent shooting standards than their peers in DS.  Beginning with an initial assessment, the training duration is six months and is held in and around the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC) in [[Northern Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]]. The curriculum is based upon advanced weapon handling and Close Quarters Battle (CQB) tactics, counter-terror and off-road car handling, advanced navigation, [[precision shooting]], [[first aid]] and [[Military tactics|tactics]].  The training culminates in an elaborate detention and personal security scenario.  Throughout their three-year tour at MSD, agents continue to train at DS schools, and specialized tactics schools all over the United States.  MSD also participates in joint military exercises to ensure interoperability in many places where the [[U.S. Department of State]] and [[U.S. Military]] work together.  Upon completion of their tour, MSD agents return to DSS posts in the U.S. and overseas.\n\n==Air capability==\nMSD trains in helicopter operations, but does not have its own dedicated air assets.  Rather, MSD uses the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s globally deployed contract air assets as well as U.S. military air in certain theatres.\n\n[[File:Bahamas Msd UH60.jpg|thumb|MSD agent aboard a UH-60 during a crisis response mission in the Bahamas]]\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Garment]]s, [[weapon]]s and [[communication]] devices of the MSD are always [[state of the art]].<ref name=DOSMSD>[http://www.specwarnet.net/taclink/Federal/dos_msd.htm US Department of State Mobile Security Division]</ref> MSD [[uniform]]s are tailored to the mission, and may comprise a [[Crye Precision]] or other battle dress, uniform (BDU), or low-profile civilian clothing, the latter of which is more commonly used in SST and MTT missions.  MSD agents use advanced combat helmets, ballistic protective glasses such as [[Oakley, Inc.|Oakley]]s, [[body armor]], [[gas mask]]s, radio [[transceiver]]s with [[headphones]], tactical [[first aid]] kits, [[ballistic vest]]s, various hydration systems, current-generation [[night vision goggles]] and [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] handheld devices such as [[Garmin]] 60cx, and other geolocation equipment.  MSD agents stay current in military and DSS communications systems in order to remain interoperable with other agencies and military units.  Since 2009, MSD has made equipment upgrades based on experiences in the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Weaponry==\nMSD's primary rifle is the Mk18 type 2 carbine with the Aimpoint T-1 Micro combat optic and AN/PEQ-15 ATPIAL. MSD also qualifies with the Colt submachine gun, different [[Heckler & Koch MP5]] [[submachine gun]] variants, [[Remington 870]] shotguns while [[SIG Sauer P226#P228|SIG Sauer]], [[Glock]] and [[Beretta]] pistols are assigned as sidearms.\n\nMSD agents are trained to use and deploy with U.S. Military weapons, including the [[M249]], [[M240]], and [[M2 Browning|M2]] machine guns, [[M203]] and [[Mk 19 grenade launcher|Mk 19]] grenade launchers, and precision fire rifles such as the Mk11 Mod 1 and Mk12 SPR.\n\nMSD agents are also trained to use less-than-lethal weaponry include OC, or [[pepper spray]], [[Club (weapon)|extendable batons]] and [[Hand grenade#Stun|stun grenades]].\n\n==Assignments==\nDiplomatic Security MSD agents were involved in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Liberia]]<ref name=DOSMSD/> protecting U.S. [[diplomatic mission]]s and arresting terrorists, as well as the investigation of terrorists [[bombing]]s in a [[United States Army]] [[barracks]] in [[Dhahran]], [[Saudi Arabia]] in 1996 and the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] in [[Tanzania]] and [[Kenya]].

They are all medium-sized [[deciduous]] trees reaching {{convert|15|\u2013|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. In North America, it is referred to as Quaking Aspen or Trembling Aspen because the leaves \"quake\" or tremble in the wind. This is due to their flattened [[petiole (botany)|petiole]]s which reduces [[aerodynamic drag]] on the trunk and branches.\n[[File:Aspen trees along the high dirt road leading to Crested Butte, Colorado, from the distant Crystal River Valley LCCN2015633794.tif|thumb|Aspen trees near Crested Butte, Colorado]]\nAspens typically grow in environments that are otherwise dominated by [[conifer|coniferous]] tree species, and which are often lacking other large deciduous tree species. Aspens have evolved several adaptations that aid their survival in such environments. One is the flattened leaf petiole, which reduces aerodynamic drag during high winds and decreases the likelihood of trunk or branch damage. Dropping leaves in the winter (like most but not all other deciduous plants) also helps to prevent damage from heavy winter snow. Additionally, the bark is photosynthetic, meaning that growth is still possible after the leaves have been dropped. The bark also contains [[lenticel]]s that serve as pores for gas exchange (similar to the [[stomata]] on leaves).\n\nAspens are also aided by the [[rhizome|rhizomatic]] nature of their root systems. Most aspens grow in large [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]], derived from a single seedling, and spread by means of [[basal shoot|root suckers]]; new stems in the colony may appear at up to {{convert|30|\u2013|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the parent tree. Each individual tree can live for 40\u2013150 years above ground, but the [[root]] system of the colony is long-lived. In some cases, this is for thousands of years, sending up new trunks as the older trunks die off above ground. For this reason, it is considered to be an indicator of ancient woodlands. One such colony in Utah, given the nickname of [[Pando (Quaking Aspen)|\"Pando\"]], is estimated to be 80,000 years old,<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/brca/naturescience/quakingaspen.htm Quaking Aspen] by the [[Bryce Canyon]] [[National Park Service]]</ref> making it possibly the [[list of long-living organisms|oldest living colony]] of aspens. Some aspen colonies become very large with time, spreading about {{convert|1|m|ft|abbr=on}} per year, eventually covering many hectares. They are able to survive [[wildfire|forest fires]], because the roots are below the heat of the fire, and new sprouts appear after the fire burns out. The high stem turnover rate combined with the clonal growth leads to proliferation in aspen colonies. The high stem turnover regime supports a diverse herbaceous understory. \n\nAspens do not thrive in the shade, and it is difficult for seedlings to grow in an already mature aspen stand. Fire indirectly benefits aspen trees, since it allows the saplings to flourish in open sunlight in the burned landscape, devoid of other competing tree species. Aspens have increased in popularity as a forestry cultivation species, mostly because of their fast growth rate and ability to regenerate from sprouts. This lowers the cost of [[reforestation]] after harvesting since no planting or [[sowing]] is required.\n\nRecently, aspen populations have been declining in some areas. This may be due to several different factors, such as [[climate change]], which exacerbates drought and modifies precipitation patterns. Recruitment failure from herbivory or grazing prevents new trees from coming up after old trees die. Additionally, successional replacement by conifers due to fire suppression alters forest diversity and creates conditions where aspen may be at less of an advantage. Sudden aspen death is also occurring more often as a result of drought stress.\n\nIn contrast with many trees, aspen [[Bark (botany)|bark]] is [[Base-richness|base-rich]], meaning aspens are important hosts for [[bryophytes]]<ref>''[http://www.cairngorms.co.uk/resource/docs/publications/05042007/CNPA.Paper.440.Aspen%20Report.txt The Biodiversity and Management of Aspen woodlands: Proceedings of a one-day conference held in Kingussie, Scotland, on 25th May 2001]''</ref> and act as food plants for the [[larvae]] of butterfly ([[Lepidoptera]]) species\u2014see [[List of Lepidoptera that feed on poplars]].\n\nYoung aspen bark is an important seasonal forage for the [[European hare]] and other animals in early spring.
