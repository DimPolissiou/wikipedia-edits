The conflict lasted between 38 and 45 minutes, marking it as the shortest recorded war in history.<ref>{{citation |title= Guinness World Records 2008 |year= 2007 |publisher= [[Guinness World Records]] |location= London |isbn= 978-1-904994-19-0 |page= 118 |editor-first=Craig |editor-last=Glenday |url= https://archive.org/details/guinnessworldre000guin }}</ref> The immediate cause of the war was the death of the pro-British [[Sultan]] [[Hamad bin Thuwaini of Zanzibar|Hamad bin Thuwaini]] on 25 August 1896 and the subsequent succession of [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Sultan Khalid bin Barghash]]. The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]]. The main island, [[Unguja]] (or Zanzibar Island), had been under the nominal control of the [[Sultan of Oman|Sultans of Oman]] since 1698 when they expelled the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers who had claimed it in 1499.<ref name=\"hernon397\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=397}}.</ref> Sultan [[Majid bin Said of Zanzibar|Majid bin Said]] declared the island independent of Oman in 1858, which was recognised by Great Britain, and split the sultanate from that of Oman.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]], the second sultan and Khalid's father, had been forced by British ultimatum and a threat of blockade to abolish the slave trade in June 1873, though it was later discovered that instructions from London would have prohibited aggressive action being taken immediately if that ultimatum had been rejected.<ref>Christopher Lloyd, ''The Navy and the Slave Trade: The Suppression of the African Slave Trade in the Nineteenth Century'', 1968, pp 264-268</ref>\n\nThe subsequent sultans established their capital and seat of government at [[Zanzibar Town]] where a palace complex was built on the sea front. By 1896, this consisted of the palace itself; the Beit al-Hukm, an attached [[harem]]; and the [[Beit al-Ajaib]] or \"House of Wonders\"\u2014a ceremonial palace said to be the first building in East Africa to be provided with electricity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|pp=156\u2013157}}.</ref> The complex was mostly constructed of local timber and was not designed as a defensive structure.<ref name=\"hernon402\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=402}}.</ref> All three main buildings were adjacent to one another in a line, and linked by wooden covered bridges above street height.<ref name=\"hoyle160\">{{Harvnb|Hoyle|2002|p=160}}.</ref>\n\nBritain had recognised Zanzibar's [[sovereignty]] and its sultanate in 1886, after a long period of friendly interaction, and generally maintained good relations with the country and its sultans.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref name=\"hernon397\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=131\u2013132}}.</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|pp=146\u2013147}}.</ref> However, [[Germany]] was also interested in East Africa, and the two powers vied for control of trade rights and territory in the area throughout the late 19th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|pp=124\u2013131}}.</ref> Sultan [[Khalifah bin Said of Zanzibar|Khalifah]] had granted rights to the land of [[Kenya]] to Britain and that of Tanganyika to Germany, a process resulting in the prohibition of slavery in those lands.<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> Many of the [[Arab]] ruling classes were upset by this interruption of a valuable trade, which [[Abushiri Revolt|resulted in some unrest]].<ref name=\"hernon397\"/> In addition, the German authorities in Tanganyika refused to fly the [[flag of the Zanzibar Sultanate]], which led to armed clashes between German troops and the local population.<ref name=\"hernon398\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2003|p=398}}.</ref> One such conflict in [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] claimed the lives of 20 Arabs.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/>\n\nSultan Khalifah sent Zanzibari troops led by Brigadier-General [[Lloyd Mathews]], a former [[Lieutenant]] of the [[Royal Navy]], to restore order in Tanganyika.<ref name=\"Hernon147\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=147}}.</ref> The operation was largely successful, but anti-German feeling among the Zanzibari people remained strong.<ref name=\"hernon398\"/> Further conflicts erupted at [[Bagamoyo]], where 150 natives were killed by German military forces, and at [[Ketwa]], where German officials and their servants were murdered.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Khalifah then granted extensive trade rights to the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] (IBEAC) who, with German assistance, ran a naval blockade to halt the continuing domestic slave trade.<ref name=\"Hernon147\"/> Upon Khalifah's death in 1890 [[Ali bin Said of Zanzibar|Ali bin Said]] ascended to the sultanate.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=165}}.</ref> Sultan Ali banned the domestic slave trade (but not slave ownership), declared Zanzibar a British protectorate and appointed Lloyd Mathews as [[First Minister]] to lead his [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]].

Hamad maintained a close relationship with the British, but there was dissent among his subjects over the increasing British control over the country, the British-led army and the abolition of the valuable slave trade.<ref name=\"hernon399\"/> In order to control this dissent, the British authorities authorised the sultan to raise a Zanzibari palace bodyguard of 1,000 men, but these troops were soon involved in clashes with the British-led police.<ref name=\"Hernon148\">{{Harvnb|Hernon|2000|p=148}}.</ref><ref name=\"Bennett178\">{{Harvnb|Bennett|1978|p=178}}.</ref> Complaints about the bodyguards' activities were also received from the European residents in Zanzibar Town.<ref name=\"hernon399\"/>\n\n=== 25 August ===\nSultan Hamad died suddenly at 11:40 EAT (08:40 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) on 25 August 1896.<ref name=\"hernon399\"/> His 29-year-old nephew [[Khalid bin Barghash of Zanzibar|Khalid bin Bargash]], who was suspected by some of his assassination,<ref name=\"hernon399\"/> moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali.<ref name=\"hernon399\"/> The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed towards them.

The end of the war is usually put at 09:40, when the last shots were fired and the palace flag struck, but some sources place it at 09:45.

The British authorities preferred [[Hamud bin Muhammed of Zanzibar|Hamud bin Muhammed]], who was more favourable to British interests, as sultan. In accordance with a treaty signed in 1886, a condition for [[Enthronement|accession]] to the sultanate was that the candidate obtain the permission of the British [[consul (representative)|consul]], and Khalid had not fulfilled this requirement. The British considered this a ''[[casus belli]]'' and sent an [[ultimatum]] to Khalid demanding that he order his forces to stand down and leave the palace. In response, Khalid called up his palace guard and barricaded himself inside the palace.\n\nThe ultimatum expired at 09:00 [[East Africa Time]] (EAT) on 27 August, by which time the British had gathered three [[cruiser]]s, two [[gunboat]]s, 150 [[Royal Marines|marines]] and sailors, and 900 Zanzibaris in the harbour area. The Royal Navy contingent were under the command of [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear-Admiral]] [[Harry Rawson]] and the pro-Anglo Zanzibaris were commanded by [[Brigadier-General]] [[Lloyd Mathews]] of the Zanzibar army (who was also the [[First Minister]] of Zanzibar). Around 2,800 Zanzibaris defended the palace; most were recruited from the civilian population, but they also included the sultan's palace guard and several hundred of his servants and slaves. The defenders had several artillery pieces and [[machine gun]]s, which were set in front of the palace sighted at the British ships. A bombardment, opened at 09:02, set the palace on fire and disabled the defending artillery. A small naval action took place, with the British sinking the Zanzibari [[royal yacht]] {{ship|HHS|Glasgow}} and two smaller vessels. Some shots were also fired ineffectually at the pro-British Zanzibari troops as they approached the palace. The flag at the palace was shot down and fire ceased at 09:40.\n\nThe sultan's forces sustained roughly 500 casualties, while only one British sailor was injured. Sultan Khalid received asylum in the German consulate before escaping to [[German East Africa]] (in the mainland part of present [[Tanzania]]). The British quickly placed Sultan Hamud in power at the head of a [[puppet government]]. The war marked the end of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Zanzibar Sultanate]] as a [[sovereign state]] and the start of a period of heavy British influence.\n\n== Background ==\n[[File:Anglo-Zanzibar war map.png|thumb|250px|The islands of Zanzibar and the [[Africa|African mainland]]]]\n\nZanzibar was an island country in the [[Indian Ocean]], off the coast of [[Tanganyika]]; today it forms part of [[Tanzania]].

The logbooks of the British ships also suffer from this with ''St George'' indicating that cease-fire was called and Khalid entered the German consulate at 09:35, ''Thrush'' at 09:40, ''Racoon'' at 09:41, and ''Philomel'' and ''Sparrow'' at 09:45.<ref>{{Harvnb|Patience|1994|pp=20\u201326}}.</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=20em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{citation|last=Bakari|first=Mohammed Ali |title= The Democratisation Process in Zanzibar: A Retarded Transition |year=2001 |publisher= [[German Institute of Global and Area Studies|Institut f\u00fcr Afrika-Kunde]] |location= Hamburg |isbn= 978-3-928049-71-9 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9yCSamtUeiAC }}.\n* {{citation|last=Bennett|first=Norman Robert |title= A History of the Arab State of Zanzibar |publisher= [[Methuen Publishing]] |location= London |year=1978|isbn= 978-0-416-55080-1 }}.\n* {{Citation|last= Cohen |first= John |last2= Jacopetti |first2= Gualtiero |last3= Prosperi |first3= Franco |title= Africa Addio |location= New York |publisher= [[Ballantine Books]] |year= 1966 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=vR9BAAAAIAAJ |oclc= 230433}}.\n* {{citation|last= Frankl |first= P.J.L. |title= The Exile of Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash Al-BuSa'idi |journal= British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies |year= 2006 |volume= 33 |issue= 2 |pages= 161\u2013177 |issn= 1469-3542 |doi= 10.1080/13530190600603675}}.\n* {{citation|last=Gordon|first=Philip H. |title= Winning the Right War: The Path to Security for America and the World |publisher= Times Books |year= 2007 |location= New York |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YUm142jq6F8C|isbn= 978-0-8050-8657-7 }}.\n* {{Citation|last= Haws|first= Duncan |last2= Hurst |first2= Alexander Anthony |title= The Maritime History of the World: A Chronological Survey of Maritime Events from 5,000 B.C. until the Present Day |location= Brighton, Sussex |publisher= Teredo Books |year= 1985 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=4iFUAAAAMAAJ |isbn= 978-0-903662-10-9 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Hernon |first= Ian |title= Britain's Forgotten Wars: Colonial Campaigns of the 19th Century |publisher= [[Sutton Publishing]] |year= 2003 |location= Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn= 978-0-7509-3162-5 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Hernon |first= Ian |title= The Savage Empire: Forgotten Wars of the 19th Century |publisher=[[Sutton Publishing]] |year= 2000 |location= Stroud, Gloucestershire |isbn= 978-0-7509-2480-1 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Hoyle|first=Brian |title=Urban Waterfront Revitalization in Developing Countries: The Example of Zanzibar's Stone Town |journal= Geographical Journal |year= 2002 |volume= 168 |issue= 2 |pages= 141\u2013162 |doi=10.1111/1475-4959.00044}}.\n* {{citation|last= Ingrams |first= William H. |title= Zanzibar: Its History and Its People |publisher= Cass |location= London |year= 1967 |oclc= 722777 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Lyne |first= Robert Nunez |title= Zanzibar in Contemporary Times |year= 1905 |publisher= Hurst and Blackett |location= London |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Z9sLAAAAYAAJ&printsec=titlepage |oclc= 251506750 }}.\n* {{citation|last=Owens|first=Geoffrey R.|title= Exploring the Articulation of Governmentality and Sovereignty: The Chwaka Road and the Bombardment of Zanzibar, 1895\u20131896 |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal= [[Journal of Colonialism and Colonial History]] |year= 2007 |volume= 7 |issue= 2 |pages= 1\u201355 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/journal_of_colonialism_and_colonial_history/v008/8.2owens.html |issn=1532-5768|oclc=45037899|doi=10.1353/cch.2007.0036}}.\n* {{citation|last= Patience |first= Kevin |title= Zanzibar and the Shortest War in History |publisher= Kevin Patience |location= Bahrain |year= 1994 |oclc= 37843635 }}.\n* {{citation|last= Thompson |first= Cecil |title= The Sultans of Zanzibar |journal= Tanzania Notes and Records |issue= 94 |year= 1984}}.\n* {{citation|last= Tucker |first= Alfred R. |title= Eighteen Years in Uganda and East Africa |year= 1970 |publisher= [[Negro Universities Press]] |location=Westport, Connecticut |url= https://archive.org/details/eighteenyearsinu00tuck |edition= New |isbn= 978-0-8371-3280-8 }}.\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{citation |editor1-last=Appiah |editor1-first=K.

Any knowledge of his life is derived from his [[hagiography|''vita'']], of which only a copy of a transcription of the original remains and whose historical accuracy is in question. According to that ''vita'', he was the bishop of [[Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on]] in the seventh century, after having acquired a reputation as an ascetic and [[anchorite]] whose prayer and presence cured people and had helped fight off a Viking invasion. When he was elected as bishop, he tried to avoid that responsibility by going to Rome; after intervention by [[Pope Gregory I]] he returned and served for over a decade. He died in [[Rennes]] (on the other side of Brittany from Saint-Pol-de-L\u00e9on), where he was buried in the cathedral. He continued to be venerated in various parts of Brittany, most notably in the small commune of [[Goulven]] and other communes nearby in the ''Pays de L\u00e9on'', the very western part of [[Finist\u00e8re]].\n\n== Biography ==\nAccording to his [[Hagiography|''vita'']], Saint Goulven was the son of immigrants from the [[British Isles]]<ref>[https://catholicsaints.info/book-of-saints-golvinus/ Monks of Ramsgate. \u201cGolvinus\u201d. ''Book of Saints'', 1921. CatholicSaints.Info. 16 July 2013]</ref> who landed in 540 at [[Plouider]]. His father, Glaudan, and his pregnant mother, Gologuenn, landed in [[Ploun\u00e9our-Trez]] Cove (also called Goulven Cove) in Brengorut when night fell; a local farmer, who saw they were poor and in need, refused them lodging. That night Goulven was born, in a place called Odena. The next morning Glaudan asked at a nearby house for water to wash the child and refresh the mother but was rejected. A peasant gave him a bucket and showed him the way to a spring, but Glaudan lost his way in the forest and wandered around all day, until he found himself back with his wife and child. In agony, he prayed, and a spring with sweet water miraculously appeared.<ref>Lobineau, p. 393.</ref> The spring (the ''Feunteun Sant Goulven''), now near the saint's church, still cures people miraculously.<ref>Le Grand, p. 278.</ref>\n\nAfter the news of the appearance of the spring became known, a rich man named Godian, a religious man without an heir, became the godfather and foster father of the child. He named him and took care of his education; from his childhood Goulven practiced abstinence, living mostly on water and bread. Having finished his studies, Goulven retreated into the woods to continue his devotion to God. After his parents died, Godian offered to make him his heir, but Goulven declined, and built a little chapel near the coast, the ''Peneti Sant Goulven'', where all kinds of miracles still happen. The door opened to the north and, being always left open, thus exposed the interior to the cold north wind coming in from the ocean, but Goulven and his guests were as comfortable inside as if in a well-insulated manor.<ref>Le Grand, p. 278.</ref>\n\nMany visited him there, to learn from him and pray, or to find cures, but he would not allow any women in his hermitage or his chapel. He ate water and bread, and only once per day, and left his retreat only once per day, to take a daily journey to [[Stations of the Cross|three stone crosses]] where he would pray at the foot of each one.<ref>Le Grand, p. 279.</ref> When Vikings threatened the area, a local count named Even (a legendary figure, for whom the commune of [[Lesneven]] is named) visited Goulven and asked him to pray for him and his men; they were victorious in fighting off the invaders.<ref>Le Grand, p. 279.</ref> In return, Goulven asked Even to give him some land to start a monastery on, and Even consented. As Goulven walked along the boundaries of the area, the land was miraculously raised on either side of him, creating a boundary that no one could violate; the area was called ''Menehi Sant Goulven'', and became abundantly fertile. He continued his religious life now in the company of a disciple named Maden, and Even had a monastery built, but Goulven remained a hermit and turned down the offer of becoming abbot. The people of L\u00e9on built a chapel dedicated to Goulven at Odena (where he was born), where many miracles happened.<ref>Le Grand, p. 280.</ref>\n\nOne day he sent Maden to a rich peasant, saying the man should give him whatever he was holding in his hands: the man gave Maden the three lumps of earth he was holding. When Maden gave those to Goulven, the dirt turned into gold, from which Goulven ordered three crosses and three bells made. One bell and cross were kept in the church at Goulven, but were lost in subsequent wars; the other bells were kept at Lesneven and [[Rennes]] (with the saint's relics), and a fourth one at the church of Goulven in [[Cornouaille]]. All performed miracles and punished those who swore false oaths.<ref>Le Grand, pp. 280-81.</ref>\n\nIn 602, Goulven was unanimously elected Bishop of L\u00e9on, but chose to escape his election by going to [[Rome]], where God revealed his reputation and purpose to [[Pope Gregory I]]. The people of L\u00e9on had to choose another to take his place, but also informed the pope, who anointed him as bishop himself. He returned to Brittany and assumed his duties with great diligence.<ref>Le Grand, p. 281.</ref> A few years after business called him to [[Rennes]], where God revealed to him that he was to die; he told his disciple Maden that his death was imminent, and that Maden would not be able to take his body back to L\u00e9on. He then fell sick, and died on 1 June 616. He was buried in Rennes' [[:fr:Saint-Melaine|Saint-Melaine]] Abbey.<ref>Le Grand, p. 282.</ref>\n\n==Textual history of the ''vita''; problems and inconsistencies==\n===Textual history===\nA Latin ''vita'' was written likely in the 11th century, during a flurry of activity which was part of a monastic reform in Brittany under the supervision of the great Benedictine abbeys in the Loire Valley. This reform prompted the writing of a large number of ''vitae'' of Breton saints, many of which were written by bishops who produced hagiographies themselves in the absence of a monastic cadre.<ref>Gendry, p. 31.</ref> The account is retained (only) in an 18th-c transcription of a 17th-c copy of an unknown text. The standard edition of that ''vita'' is by [[Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie]], a Breton historian, published in 1891;<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 325.</ref> it was published earlier in [[Albert Le Grand]]'s ''Les vies des saints de la Bretagne Armorique'', where he is listed for 1 July.<ref>Le Grand, p. 277.</ref> Le Grand, in the 17th century, had access to a version of the hagiography that was followed by a list of fifteen miracles that occurred after the saint's death, and he added a summary of those to the life he published.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref> That the ''vita'' was the product of the community of Saint-Pol is made clear by a reference to \"patronus noster\".<ref>Smith, p. 325 n. 68.</ref> The ''vita'' acknowledges that there is no written documentation or oral tradition on the reign of Goulven as a bishop, and is mostly concerned with the places associated with the saint--the spring (or fountain, ''fons Golvini'') and the hermitage (his ''peniti'', or cell, with the ''menihi'', or surrounding land).<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 325.</ref> The ''vita'' explains that his body was at Rennes, though a hand was brought to L\u00e9on; in the absence of relics, the cult of the saint was built on a number of objects associated with him: three golden crosses, a chalice, and three golden bells. The saint's original bell was stolen, but a golden crucifix was still performing miracles by the time the ''vita'' was written.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref>\n\n===Problems and inconsistencies===\nThe ''vita'' says that Goulven's hermitage was ''plebs Desiderii'', but what that reference to [[Saint Didier]] means is not clear. Charles de Calan, in a critique of the saint's account given by de La Borderie, notes there are two possible locations named for Saint Didier: one tradition places it in Rennes, the other in L\u00e9on--but these are on opposite sides of Brittany. De La Borderie aimed to reconcile these two, but de Calan says he did so without textual evidence.<ref>De Calan, pp. 125-26.</ref> In fact, de Calan argues, it is entirely unlikely that a. Goulven's body, if indeed he had been bishop in L\u00e9on, would have been left in Rennes; and b. that Goulven was supposed to be a bishop in L\u00e9on in the first place, not in Rennes. De Calan finds no evidence of any ancient cult of Goulven in L\u00e9on (and he is not found in any of the litanies of the 11th century from the area): the ''vita'' appears to belong to a group of similar hagiographies written and redacted in the 13th and 14th centuries to promote L\u00e9on--this included the ferrying of material about [[Litavis#Brittany|Letavia]] (that is, [[Armorica]]) to Leonia, or L\u00e9on. Other errors, or geographical and etymological errors and problems, suggest that the entire ''vita'' be considered a fable, according to de Calan.<ref>De Calan, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDe Calan thinks likewise that the ''vita''{{'s}} explanation of the election of Goulven as [[:fr:Liste des \u00e9v\u00eaques de L\u00e9on|bishop of the L\u00e9on diocese]] is unlikely, and serves no other purpose then to bring the tenure of Cetomerinus (whose historicity is accepted by scholars<ref>Oheix.</ref>) in agreement with the ''vita''{{'s}} election of Goulven, whose initial refusal or hesitance to serve as bishop thus allowed the hagiography to be reconciled with the history of the bishopric. In reality, says de Calan, these machinations also suggest Goulven was simply inserted into the L\u00e9on history. He may have been bishop of Rennes or, possibly, may have been regarded as having been a bishop of Rennes since it was in the possession of the body of a man who led a saintly life.<ref>De Calan, pp. 126-27.</ref>\n\nA different kind of confusion was noted in 1971 by [[Donatien Laurent]], in an article discussing the many varieties of the Breton poem ''[[Gwerz Skolan]]'': Laurent claims that the main character of that poem became confused with Goulven. A [[gwerz]] is a Breton folk song with epic qualities, and the gwerz's protagonist, Iannic Skolan (also Skolvan, and Gaulish Yscolan; they resemble [[Myrddin Wyllt]], the source for the sorcerer [[Merlin]]<ref>Laurent, pp. 35-38.</ref>), is a legendary murderer and rapist who seeks forgiveness from his mother after coming back from hell.<ref>Laurent, pp. 23-24.</ref> Many versions of the song exist, some collected by [[Th\u00e9odore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9]]; Laurent heard a version sung by a woman from [[Ploun\u00e9v\u00e9zel]] in which Skolan (named \"Skolvam\" in her version) and Golven had merged. In what Laurent calls the \"[[Cornouaille]] tradition\", when Skolvam's mother doubts his identity, a spring miraculously appears;<ref>Laurent, p. 24.</ref> this, and a blessing for Skolvam by the pope in the Ploun\u00e9v\u00e9zel version indicate, according to Laurent, a confusion between the saint and the legendary murderer which also gives rise to a number of local place names that combine elements of both: \"Golven, Kolven, Golban, Eskolvenn, Skolvant, Stolvennig, Skoulvani\".<ref>Laurent, p. 42 n. 9.</ref>\n\n==Cult and legacy, toponymy==\n[[File:259 Cloche \u00e0 main Goulien Mus\u00e9e Land\u00e9vennec.jpg|thumb |200px |The saint's bell, in the Goulven parish church.]]\nAccording to Fran\u00e7ois Plaine, a Benedictine priest who wrote about Goulven's ''vita'' in 1889, Goulven's death led instantly to a cult in Rennes and the larger area of [[Viscounty of L\u00e9on|L\u00e9on]] which had witnessed \"his life, his virtues, and his first miracles\".<ref>Plaine, p. 30.</ref> Herv\u00e9 Martin and Louis Martin, in a study of religious monuments and sacred spaces in Brittany, noted that the three stone crosses were still reported as ''in situ'' in the 19th century,<ref>Martin and Martin, p. 26.</ref> but they consider it most likely that the crosses were part of a program from the [[Carolingian]] period designed to commemorate the saint.<ref>Martin and Martin, pp. 26, 32.</ref>\n\n[[Julia M. H. Smith|Julia Smith]] notes that the miracles associated with the saint did not rely on primary relics, nor do they take place within an organized cult overseen by the clergy. Only one of them is a miraculous cure, which takes place at the saint's fountain.<ref>Smith, p. 326.</ref> Smith notes also that Goulven's life, death, and cult, like those of [[Paul Aurelian]] (whose ''vita'' also featured a spring and crosses), show that the area's religious landscape is one \"where features of the landscape and bells and crosses were the focal points for saints' cults, not bones and shrines\"<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref>--this lack of focus on relics is a particular feature of Breton hagiography, says Smith.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" pp. 335-36.</ref>\n\nThe cult of Goulven survived the Reformation and the French Revolution. He may have lost some of his status, but was retained in the calendars at Rennes and at [[Quimper]], and he likewise retained the patronage of a number of places.<ref>Plaine, p. 30.</ref> Viking attacks in the area forced the monks of Saint-Melaine to move the body of their patron saint, [[Saint Melan]], but they left Goulven's, which remained intact, in its coffin, until 1224, when the bishop of Rennes, [[:fr:Jean I Gicquel|Jean Gicquel]], took off the head to place it in a separate reliquary. In 1336, under the episcopacy of [[:fr:Guillaume Ouvrouin (\u00e9v\u00eaque de Rennes)|Guillaume Ouvrouin]], renovated the cask that kept Goulven's body. In 1533, bishop [[:fr:Yves Mahyeuc|Yves Mahyeuc]] removed an arm and gave it to the [[Goulven]] parish, and doubtlessly, according to Plaine, during this time many other unrecorded gifts of relics must have been made, because by 1743 only the head, divided in two parts, and a number of greater and smaller bones was left. The head disappeared during the French Revolution, but some larger bones were still in the Rennes Cathedral by 1889, and remained the center of Goulven's cult, whose celebration in the Rennes diocese culminates on 9 July.<ref>Plaine, p. 31.</ref>\n\nPlaine, in 1889, described a lively cult in Rennes on the saint's feast day, all the more special since it is a double celebration: the [[Roman Liturgy]] celebrates Goulven with an [[Octave (liturgy)|octave]] beginning on 1 July, and his [[Translation (relic)|translation]] is remembered on 23 August. In public processions, his coffin is carried through the streets.<ref>Plaine, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFrom early on, Goulven was also remembered with double celebrations in the dioceses of Saint-Pol-de-Leon and Quimper, which after the dissolution during the French Revolution were restored (through the [[Concordat of 1801]]) as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quimper]]. By 1889, he was still the patron of two parishes in that diocese and the object of special veneration, according to Plaine: Goulven and [[Goulien]]. In Goulven a fountain is associated with him and the parish has a few small relics, but a femur, formerly thought to be the saint's and given to the parish in 1533, is no longer venerated since its authenticity could not be established. Goulien has a bell associated with the saint.<ref>Plaine, p. 32.</ref> Goulven has a reliquary consisting of an arm made of wood, which contains an arm made of silver, which in turn contains a relic of the saint.<ref>Toscer, p. 292.</ref> \n\n===Places named for the saint===\nPlaces named for the saint are found in the Breton communes of [[Lanvellec]] (St-Goulven), Caurel (St-Golven), [[Lanloup]] (St-Golven), [[Plouider]] (Keroulien), [[Taupont]] (St-Golvin), Feuill\u00e9e  (St- Voulc'hien), [[Bubry]] (Locolven), Inguiniel (Locolven), and [[Locmaria-Plouzan\u00e9]] (Goulven).<ref>Smith, \"Toponymie\", p. 54.</ref> If Goulven is to be identified with the saint Gonvel or Gonval venerated in the commune of [[Landunvez]], as seemed likely to Plaine, then 9 or 10 small chapels and altars there are also to be connected to Saint Goulven.<ref>Plaine, p. 32.</ref> The extensive [[:fr:For\u00eat de Qu\u00e9n\u00e9can|For\u00eat de Qu\u00e9n\u00e9can]] in the middle of Brittany is sometimes named for him: ''lande de Saint Golven''.<ref>Laurent, p. 42 n. 9.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite journal|last=La Borderie |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie |title=Texte de la vie latine ancienne et in\u00e9dite de Saint Goulven avec notes et commentaire historique |journal=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9mulation des C\u00f4tes du Nord M\u00e9moires de l'ann\u00e9e 1891 |pages=214-250 |year=1891 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Bourges |first= A.-Y. |title=Guillaume Le Breton et l'hagiographie bretonne aux 12th - 13th si\u00e8cles |journal=[[:fr:Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l'Ouest|Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l'Ouest]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=35-45}}\n*{{cite book |last=Le Breton |first=H. |title=Un vieux saint breton: saint Goulven ou Golven, \u00e9v\u00eaque de L\u00e9on |location=Rennes |year=1933}}\n*{{cite journal |last=De Calan|first=Charles |title=M\u00e9langes Historiques |journal=[[Revue de Bretagne]] |year=1908 |volume=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lIpNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA126 |pages=121-27 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Gendry |first=Micka\u00ebl|title=Les minihis en Bretagne entre le IXe et le XIIe si\u00e8cle: des territoires monastiques sacralis\u00e9s? |url=http://journals.openedition.org/abpo/1766 |doi=10.4000/abpo.1766 |issn=0399-0826 |pages=25-55 |journal=Annales de Bretagne et des Pays de l'Ouest |year=2010 |volume=117 |issue=2}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Laurent |first=Donatien |authorlink=Donatien Laurent  |title=La gwerz de Skolan et la l\u00e9gende de Merlin |journal=[[Ethnologie fran\u00e7aise]], new series |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |year=1971 |pages=19-54 |language=fr |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40988167}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lobineau |first=Guy Alexis |authorlink=Guy Alexis Lobineau |title=Vies des saints de Bretagne |publisher=M\u00e9quignon Junior |year=1836 |chapter=S.

That night Goulven was born, in a place called Odena. The next morning Glaudan asked at a nearby house for water to wash the child and refresh the mother but was rejected. A peasant gave him a bucket and showed him the way to a spring, but Glaudan lost his way in the forest and wandered around all day, until he found himself back with his wife and child. In agony, he prayed, and a spring with sweet water miraculously appeared.<ref>Lobineau, p. 393.</ref> The spring (the ''Feunteun Sant Goulven''), now near the saint's church, still cures people miraculously.<ref>Le Grand, p. 278.</ref>\n\nAfter the news of the appearance of the spring became known, a rich man named Godian, a religious man without an heir, became the godfather and foster father of the child. He named him and took care of his education; from his childhood Goulven practiced abstinence, living mostly on water and bread. Having finished his studies, Goulven retreated into the woods to continue his devotion to God. After his parents died, Godian offered to make him his heir, but Goulven declined, and built a little chapel near the coast, the ''Peneti Sant Goulven'', where all kinds of miracles still happen. The door opened to the north and, being always left open, thus exposed the interior to the cold north wind coming in from the ocean, but Goulven and his guests were as comfortable inside as if in a well-insulated manor.<ref>Le Grand, p. 278.</ref>\n\nMany visited him there, to learn from him and pray, or to find cures, but he would not allow any women in his hermitage or his chapel. He ate water and bread, and only once per day, and left his retreat only once per day, to take a daily journey to [[Stations of the Cross|three stone crosses]] where he would pray at the foot of each one.<ref>Le Grand, p. 279.</ref> When Vikings threatened the area, a local count named Even (a legendary figure, for whom the commune of [[Lesneven]] is named) visited Goulven and asked him to pray for him and his men; they were victorious in fighting off the invaders.<ref>Le Grand, p. 279.</ref> In return, Goulven asked Even to give him some land to start a monastery on, and Even consented. As Goulven walked along the boundaries of the area, the land was miraculously raised on either side of him, creating a boundary that no one could violate; the area was called ''Menehi Sant Goulven'', and became abundantly fertile. He continued his religious life now in the company of a disciple named Maden, and Even had a monastery built, but Goulven remained a hermit and turned down the offer of becoming abbot. The people of L\u00e9on built a chapel dedicated to Goulven at Odena (where he was born), where many miracles happened.<ref>Le Grand, p. 280.</ref>\n\nOne day he sent Maden to a rich peasant, saying the man should give him whatever he was holding in his hands: the man gave Maden the three lumps of earth he was holding. When Maden gave those to Goulven, the dirt turned into gold, from which Goulven ordered three crosses and three bells made. One bell and cross were kept in the church at Goulven, but were lost in subsequent wars; the other bells were kept at Lesneven and [[Rennes]] (with the saint's relics), and a fourth one at the church of Goulven in [[Cornouaille]]. All performed miracles and punished those who swore false oaths.<ref>Le Grand, pp. 280-81.</ref>\n\nIn 602, Goulven was unanimously elected Bishop of L\u00e9on, but chose to escape his election by going to [[Rome]], where God revealed his reputation and purpose to [[Pope Gregory I]]. The people of L\u00e9on had to choose another to take his place, but also informed the pope, who anointed him as bishop himself. He returned to Brittany and assumed his duties with great diligence.<ref>Le Grand, p. 281.</ref> A few years after business called him to [[Rennes]], where God revealed to him that he was to die; he told his disciple Maden that his death was imminent, and that Maden would not be able to take his body back to L\u00e9on. He then fell sick, and died on 1 June 616. He was buried in Rennes' [[:fr:Saint-Melaine|Saint-Melaine]] Abbey.<ref>Le Grand, p. 282.</ref>\n\n==Textual history of the ''vita''; problems and inconsistencies==\n===Textual history===\nA Latin ''vita'' was written likely in the 11th century, during a flurry of activity which was part of a monastic reform in Brittany under the supervision of the great Benedictine abbeys in the Loire Valley. This reform prompted the writing of a large number of ''vitae'' of Breton saints, many of which were written by bishops who produced hagiographies themselves in the absence of a monastic cadre.<ref>Gendry, p. 31.</ref> The account is retained (only) in an 18th-c transcription of a 17th-c copy of an unknown text. The standard edition of that ''vita'' is by [[Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie]], a Breton historian, published in 1891;<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 325.</ref> it was published earlier in [[Albert Le Grand]]'s ''Les vies des saints de la Bretagne Armorique'', where he is listed for 1 July.<ref>Le Grand, p. 277.</ref> Le Grand, in the 17th century, had access to a version of the hagiography that was followed by a list of fifteen miracles that occurred after the saint's death, and he added a summary of those to the life he published.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref> That the ''vita'' was the product of the community of Saint-Pol is made clear by a reference to \"patronus noster\".<ref>Smith, p. 325 n. 68.</ref> The ''vita'' acknowledges that there is no written documentation or oral tradition on the reign of Goulven as a bishop, and is mostly concerned with the places associated with the saint--the spring (or fountain, ''fons Golvini'') and the hermitage (his ''peniti'', or cell, with the ''menihi'', or surrounding land).<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 325.</ref> The ''vita'' explains that his body was at Rennes, though a hand was brought to L\u00e9on; in the absence of relics, the cult of the saint was built on a number of objects associated with him: three golden crosses, a chalice, and three golden bells. The saint's original bell was stolen, but a golden crucifix was still performing miracles by the time the ''vita'' was written.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref>\n\n===Problems and inconsistencies===\nThe ''vita'' says that Goulven's hermitage was ''plebs Desiderii'', but what that reference to [[Saint Didier]] means is not clear. Charles de Calan, in a critique of the saint's account given by de La Borderie, notes there are two possible locations named for Saint Didier: one tradition places it in Rennes, the other in L\u00e9on--but these are on opposite sides of Brittany. De La Borderie aimed to reconcile these two, but de Calan says he did so without textual evidence.<ref>De Calan, pp. 125-26.</ref> In fact, de Calan argues, it is entirely unlikely that a. Goulven's body, if indeed he had been bishop in L\u00e9on, would have been left in Rennes; and b. that Goulven was supposed to be a bishop in L\u00e9on in the first place, not in Rennes. De Calan finds no evidence of any ancient cult of Goulven in L\u00e9on (and he is not found in any of the litanies of the 11th century from the area): the ''vita'' appears to belong to a group of similar hagiographies written and redacted in the 13th and 14th centuries to promote L\u00e9on--this included the ferrying of material about [[Litavis#Brittany|Letavia]] (that is, [[Armorica]]) to Leonia, or L\u00e9on. Other errors, or geographical and etymological errors and problems, suggest that the entire ''vita'' be considered a fable, according to de Calan.<ref>De Calan, p. 126.</ref>\n\nDe Calan thinks likewise that the ''vita''{{'s}} explanation of the election of Goulven as [[:fr:Liste des \u00e9v\u00eaques de L\u00e9on|bishop of the L\u00e9on diocese]] is unlikely, and serves no other purpose then to bring the tenure of Cetomerinus (whose historicity is accepted by scholars<ref>Oheix.</ref>) in agreement with the ''vita''{{'s}} election of Goulven, whose initial refusal or hesitance to serve as bishop thus allowed the hagiography to be reconciled with the history of the bishopric. In reality, says de Calan, these machinations also suggest Goulven was simply inserted into the L\u00e9on history. He may have been bishop of Rennes or, possibly, may have been regarded as having been a bishop of Rennes since it was in the possession of the body of a man who led a saintly life.<ref>De Calan, pp. 126-27.</ref>\n\nA different kind of confusion was noted in 1971 by [[Donatien Laurent]], in an article discussing the many varieties of the Breton poem ''[[Gwerz Skolan]]'': Laurent claims that the main character of that poem became confused with Goulven. A [[gwerz]] is a Breton folk song with epic qualities, and the gwerz's protagonist, Iannic Skolan (also Skolvan, and Gaulish Yscolan; they resemble [[Myrddin Wyllt]], the source for the sorcerer [[Merlin]]<ref>Laurent, pp. 35-38.</ref>), is a legendary murderer and rapist who seeks forgiveness from his mother after coming back from hell.<ref>Laurent, pp. 23-24.</ref> Many versions of the song exist, some collected by [[Th\u00e9odore Claude Henri, vicomte Hersart de la Villemarqu\u00e9]]; Laurent heard a version sung by a woman from [[Ploun\u00e9v\u00e9zel]] in which Skolan (named \"Skolvam\" in her version) and Golven had merged. In what Laurent calls the \"[[Cornouaille]] tradition\", when Skolvam's mother doubts his identity, a spring miraculously appears;<ref>Laurent, p. 24.</ref> this, and a blessing for Skolvam by the pope in the Ploun\u00e9v\u00e9zel version indicate, according to Laurent, a confusion between the saint and the legendary murderer which also gives rise to a number of local place names that combine elements of both: \"Golven, Kolven, Golban, Eskolvenn, Skolvant, Stolvennig, Skoulvani\".<ref>Laurent, p. 42 n. 9.</ref>\n\n==Cult and legacy, toponymy==\n[[File:259 Cloche \u00e0 main Goulien Mus\u00e9e Land\u00e9vennec.jpg|thumb |200px |The saint's bell, in the Goulven parish church.]]\nAccording to Fran\u00e7ois Plaine, a Benedictine priest who wrote about Goulven's ''vita'' in 1889, Goulven's death led instantly to a cult in Rennes and the larger area of [[Viscounty of L\u00e9on|L\u00e9on]] which had witnessed \"his life, his virtues, and his first miracles\".<ref>Plaine, p. 30.</ref> Herv\u00e9 Martin and Louis Martin, in a study of religious monuments and sacred spaces in Brittany, noted that the three stone crosses were still reported as ''in situ'' in the 19th century,<ref>Martin and Martin, p. 26.</ref> but they consider it most likely that the crosses were part of a program from the [[Carolingian]] period designed to commemorate the saint.<ref>Martin and Martin, pp. 26, 32.</ref>\n\n[[Julia M. H. Smith|Julia Smith]] notes that the miracles associated with the saint did not rely on primary relics, nor do they take place within an organized cult overseen by the clergy. Only one of them is a miraculous cure, which takes place at the saint's fountain.<ref>Smith, p. 326.</ref> Smith notes also that Goulven's life, death, and cult, like those of [[Paul Aurelian]] (whose ''vita'' also featured a spring and crosses), show that the area's religious landscape is one \"where features of the landscape and bells and crosses were the focal points for saints' cults, not bones and shrines\"<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" p. 326.</ref>--this lack of focus on relics is a particular feature of Breton hagiography, says Smith.<ref>Smith, \"Oral and Written,\" pp. 335-36.</ref>\n\nThe cult of Goulven survived the Reformation and the French Revolution. He may have lost some of his status, but was retained in the calendars at Rennes and at [[Quimper]], and he likewise retained the patronage of a number of places.<ref>Plaine, p. 30.</ref> Viking attacks in the area forced the monks of Saint-Melaine to move the body of their patron saint, [[Saint Melan]], but they left Goulven's, which remained intact, in its coffin, until 1224, when the bishop of Rennes, [[:fr:Jean I Gicquel|Jean Gicquel]], took off the head to place it in a separate reliquary. In 1336, under the episcopacy of [[:fr:Guillaume Ouvrouin (\u00e9v\u00eaque de Rennes)|Guillaume Ouvrouin]], renovated the cask that kept Goulven's body. In 1533, bishop [[:fr:Yves Mahyeuc|Yves Mahyeuc]] removed an arm and gave it to the [[Goulven]] parish, and doubtlessly, according to Plaine, during this time many other unrecorded gifts of relics must have been made, because by 1743 only the head, divided in two parts, and a number of greater and smaller bones was left. The head disappeared during the French Revolution, but some larger bones were still in the Rennes Cathedral by 1889, and remained the center of Goulven's cult, whose celebration in the Rennes diocese culminates on 9 July.<ref>Plaine, p. 31.</ref>\n\nPlaine, in 1889, described a lively cult in Rennes on the saint's feast day, all the more special since it is a double celebration: the [[Roman Liturgy]] celebrates Goulven with an [[Octave (liturgy)|octave]] beginning on 1 July, and his [[Translation (relic)|translation]] is remembered on 23 August. In public processions, his coffin is carried through the streets.<ref>Plaine, p. 31.</ref>\n\nFrom early on, Goulven was also remembered with double celebrations in the dioceses of Saint-Pol-de-Leon and Quimper, which after the dissolution during the French Revolution were restored (through the [[Concordat of 1801]]) as the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Quimper]]. By 1889, he was still the patron of two parishes in that diocese and the object of special veneration, according to Plaine: Goulven and [[Goulien]]. In Goulven a fountain is associated with him and the parish has a few small relics, but a femur, formerly thought to be the saint's and given to the parish in 1533, is no longer venerated since its authenticity could not be established. Goulien has a bell associated with the saint.<ref>Plaine, p. 32.</ref> Goulven has a reliquary consisting of an arm made of wood, which contains an arm made of silver, which in turn contains a relic of the saint.<ref>Toscer, p. 292.</ref> \n\n===Places named for the saint===\nPlaces named for the saint are found in the Breton communes of [[Lanvellec]] (St-Goulven), Caurel (St-Golven), [[Lanloup]] (St-Golven), [[Plouider]] (Keroulien), [[Taupont]] (St-Golvin), Feuill\u00e9e  (St- Voulc'hien), [[Bubry]] (Locolven), Inguiniel (Locolven), and [[Locmaria-Plouzan\u00e9]] (Goulven).<ref>Smith, \"Toponymie\", p. 54.</ref> If Goulven is to be identified with the saint Gonvel or Gonval venerated in the commune of [[Landunvez]], as seemed likely to Plaine, then 9 or 10 small chapels and altars there are also to be connected to Saint Goulven.<ref>Plaine, p. 32.</ref> The extensive [[:fr:For\u00eat de Qu\u00e9n\u00e9can|For\u00eat de Qu\u00e9n\u00e9can]] in the middle of Brittany is sometimes named for him: ''lande de Saint Golven''.<ref>Laurent, p. 42 n. 9.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite journal|last=La Borderie |first=Arthur |authorlink=Arthur Le Moyne de La Borderie |title=Texte de la vie latine ancienne et in\u00e9dite de Saint Goulven avec notes et commentaire historique |journal=Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 d'\u00c9mulation des C\u00f4tes du Nord M\u00e9moires de l'ann\u00e9e 1891 |pages=214-250 |year=1891 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite journal|last=Bourges |first= A.-Y. |title=Guillaume Le Breton et l'hagiographie bretonne aux 12th - 13th si\u00e8cles |journal=[[:fr:Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l'Ouest|Annales de Bretagne et des pays de l'Ouest]] |volume=102 |issue=1 |year=1995 |pages=35-45}}\n*{{cite book |last=Le Breton |first=H. |title=Un vieux saint breton: saint Goulven ou Golven, \u00e9v\u00eaque de L\u00e9on |location=Rennes |year=1933}}\n*{{cite journal |last=De Calan|first=Charles |title=M\u00e9langes Historiques |journal=[[Revue de Bretagne]] |year=1908 |volume=31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lIpNAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA126 |pages=121-27 |language=fr}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Gendry |first=Micka\u00ebl|title=Les minihis en Bretagne entre le IXe et le XIIe si\u00e8cle: des territoires monastiques sacralis\u00e9s? |url=http://journals.openedition.org/abpo/1766 |doi=10.4000/abpo.1766 |issn=0399-0826 |pages=25-55 |journal=Annales de Bretagne et des Pays de l'Ouest |year=2010 |volume=117 |issue=2}}\n*{{cite journal |last=Laurent |first=Donatien |authorlink=Donatien Laurent  |title=La gwerz de Skolan et la l\u00e9gende de Merlin |journal=[[Ethnologie fran\u00e7aise]], new series |volume=1 |issue=3/4 |year=1971 |pages=19-54 |language=fr |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/40988167}}\n*{{cite book |last=Lobineau |first=Guy Alexis |authorlink=Guy Alexis Lobineau |title=Vies des saints de Bretagne |publisher=M\u00e9quignon Junior |year=1836 |chapter=S.

In 1982 he recruited Montreal keyboardist and programmer [[Steve Wyatt]] as the second half of the Trans-X duo.

Steve Wyatt left Trans-X sometime in late 1983.\n\nPascal later recruited Montrealer [[Laurie Ann Gill]] as the second half of the Trans-X duo. Gill can be seen in the early videos where she performed backing vocals for synthpop group [[Nudimension]].

With TQ Languirand has been collaborating at least since 2004. However, on the 2010-single \"I Want To Be With You Tonight\", on the ''L. O. V. 2011'' album from 2011 and on the ''Hi-NRG'' album that was released in 2012 in Mexico, Languirand was vocally accompanied by [[Corina Lawrence]], a woman with Argentinian roots. With Lawrence he has been working together since 2008.<ref>[http://elmelomanoescritor.blogspot.de/2016/04/trans-x-en-lima.html ''Trans X en Lima.''

The song became part of TQ's later album ''Out of the shadows'' which was released in late 2014. Although Languirand was involved in singing that song, it was more an offspin than a pure Trans-X project. Over the years, Languirand more and more became interconnected with other artists, and especially after 1986, not solely working for Trans-X, but also letting space for other projects. Sometimes, therein he lent his voice to others, sometimes he worked for others as a producer, etcetera. To a certain extent, \"My Fascination\" is an outcome from such kind of collaborations.\n\nIn 2012, [[Luis Broc]] joined the electronic drummer and in 2014 he joined [[Ram\u00f3n Serratos]] in the SFX, synthesis and as a DJ of the band in the live performances, both of Mexican origin.<br />During 2016, they made a series of tours in South America, reaffirming the taste for the High Energy genre in diverse audiences \u2013 in countries like Chile, Peru and Colombia \u2013 in the initiative of the project \"Discolocos\", a documentary film (of the young filmmaker [[David Davila]]) that reflects the world of \u201ethe followers\u201c of the genre since the 1980's. And that remains to date in Mexico in which Trans X is a protagonist alongside a community that represents a haven of faithful followers and a place where the power of music and its generative capacity resides. From the film, \"Discolocos\" is the original motion soundtrack being created by Pascal Languirand, rooting in classic themes from the 1980s in his tribute to the High Energy and Italo Disco genres, in collaboration with the voices of [[Willie Chambers]], [[Jessica Williams]], [[Claudja Barry]], [[Tobias Bernstrup]], [[Stephan Groth]], [[Cynthia Manley]], [[Eskil Simonsson]], [[Conrad Kaneshiro]], [[Christina Criscione]] and [[J.

'El Mel\u00f3mano Escritor' Event Blog , April 2016 (written in spanish).] Retrieved 30 May 2016.</ref> On the other hand, in 2013, Languirand sang a song together with Truc Quynh, entitled \"My Fascination\", being recorded on audio and video. The song became part of TQ's later album ''Out of the shadows'' which was released in late 2014. Although Languirand was involved in singing that song, it was more an offspin than a pure Trans-X project. Over the years, Languirand more and more became interconnected with other artists, and especially after 1986, not solely working for Trans-X, but also letting space for other projects. Sometimes, therein he lent his voice to others, sometimes he worked for others as a producer, etcetera. To a certain extent, \"My Fascination\" is an outcome from such kind of collaborations.\n\nIn 2012, [[Luis Broc]] joined the electronic drummer and in 2014 he joined [[Ram\u00f3n Serratos]] in the SFX, synthesis and as a DJ of the band in the live performances, both of Mexican origin.<br />During 2016, they made a series of tours in South America, reaffirming the taste for the High Energy genre in diverse audiences \u2013 in countries like Chile, Peru and Colombia \u2013 in the initiative of the project \"Discolocos\", a documentary film (of the young filmmaker [[David Davila]]) that reflects the world of \u201ethe followers\u201c of the genre since the 1980's. And that remains to date in Mexico in which Trans X is a protagonist alongside a community that represents a haven of faithful followers and a place where the power of music and its generative capacity resides. From the film, \"Discolocos\" is the original motion soundtrack being created by Pascal Languirand, rooting in classic themes from the 1980s in his tribute to the High Energy and Italo Disco genres, in collaboration with the voices of [[Willie Chambers]], [[Jessica Williams]], [[Claudja Barry]], [[Tobias Bernstrup]], [[Stephan Groth]], [[Cynthia Manley]], [[Eskil Simonsson]], [[Conrad Kaneshiro]], [[Christina Criscione]] and [[J.

To Stockhausen's specifications Peter Lawo built an apparatus called \"module 69 B\" which was used to perform Stockhausen's composition [[Mantra (Stockhausen)#Structure|Mantra]]. The success of this production led to the founding of the Experimentalstudio of the Heinrich Strobel Foundation of the [[S\u00fcdwestfunk]] in 1971. Together with the first director of this studio, Hans-Peter Haller, Peter Lawo developed the Halaphon. (The name resulted from the names of the developers: HA(ller)-LA(wo)-PHON). This machine became famous when being used in all the later works of composer [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]].\n\nLater, Peter Lawo developed mixing consoles for Stockhausen, whose composition Oktophonie was produced in the [[Studio for Electronic Music (WDR)|Studio for Electronic Music]] of the German Public Broadcaster WDR ([[Westdeutscher Rundfunk]]). For the production of this composition, the automatic recall of very fast fader movements was used\u2014which was made possible by Lawo's hybrid mixing console PTR (\"Programmierbare Ton Regie\" = programmable audio control).\n\nThe company is notable for supplying the audio mixing equipment for the [[2012 London Olympics]] and [[Nine Network]], and for sports events in Asia, North America and Australia.\n\nToday, after 50 years, Lawo is involved in more projects than ever before, the scale and scope of each of these projects is constantly growing, as customers recognize the potential of open-standard IP solutions and seek to leverage the freedom it affords to completely rethink their workflows.\n\nLawo\u2019s IP line-up covers the media production chain from acquisition to playout.

In 1946, the party founded by [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of President-elect [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]'s assassination in 1928 changed its name to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. With the party's presidential choice in 1946, [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], Mexico elected its first civilian president since [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911. The subsequent elections of [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] (1952\u201358) and [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] (1958\u201364), [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] (1964\u201370) there were no political opposition challenges to the government's implementation of economic programs.\n\nDuring the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], there were significant policies in the social and political spheres that had impacts on future economic policies in Mexico, in particular [[Mexican oil expropriation|nationalization of oil]] in 1938, as well as land reform, and nationalization of railways.<ref>Howard F. Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, 1940\u20131960''. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1962, p. 231.</ref> C\u00e1rdenas was succeeded by the politically more moderate [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]], who initiated a program of industrialization in early 1941 with the Law of Manufacturing Industries. One scholar has called the inaugural date of this law \"the birthday of the Institutional Revolution,\" since it was the inception of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref>Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', p. 232.</ref> Further legislation in 1946 under President [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], the Law for Development of New and Necessary Industries, was passed.<ref>Sanford Mosk, ''Industrial Revolution in Mexico''.

Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', revised edition. New York: Atheneum Press, 1962, p. 184.</ref>  Mexico benefited significantly during World War II, by its participation on the side of the Allies. Mexico supplied labor to the U.S. via the [[Bracero Program]], but its most significant contribution was in its supply of material to fight the war. It received cash payments for its material contributions, which meant that following the war the Mexican treasury had robust reserves. Although a participant in the war, like the U.S., Mexico was not a site of combat, so that in the post-war era, Mexico did not need to rebuild damaged infrastructure. However, with the resources available following the war, Mexico embarked on big infrastructure projects.\n\n\u00c1vila Camacho used part of the accumulated savings to pay off foreign debts, so that Mexico's credit standing substantially improved (increasing investors' confidence in the government). With increased revenues coming from the war effort, the government was now in a position to distribute material benefits from the Revolution more widely; he used funds to subsidize food imports that especially affected urban workers. Workers in Mexico received higher salaries during the war, but there was a lack of consumer goods to purchase, so that workers had both personal savings and pent up demand for goods. A key government institution for development, founded under L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas's administration was ''Nacional Financiera'' (abbreviated ''Nafin''), the national development bank, which funded the expansion of the industrial sector.<ref>Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', p. 286.</ref> \n\nGrowth was sustained by the government's increasing commitment to primary education for the general population from the late 1920s through the 1940s. The enrollment rates of the country's youth increased threefold during this period;<ref>Easterlin, R. \"Why Isn't the Whole World Developed?\", Appendix Table 1. ''The Journal of Economic History'' Vol. 41 No. 1, 1981</ref> consequently when this generation was employed by the 1940s their economic output was more productive. Mexico also made investments in higher education that created a generation of scientists, social scientists, and engineers, who enabled Mexican industrial innovation. The founding of the [[Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico Nacional]] (''IPN'') in 1936 as a government-funded institution in the northern part of Mexico City, trained a new generation of Mexicans. In northern Mexico, the [[Monterrey Institute of Technology and Higher Education]], known in Mexico as the ''Tec de Monterrey'' was founded by northern industrialists in 1942, with the programs designed by a former faculty member of the IPN and modeled after the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]. From a small, private inception, the Tec de Monterrey built a major campus inaugurated by President Alem\u00e1n in 1946, and has been a magnet for students from other areas of Latin America.<ref>Cline, ''The United States and Mexico'', p. 301.</ref>\n\n===Import-substitution program and infrastructure projects===\nIn the years following [[World War II]], [[President of Mexico|President]] [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]] (1946\u201352) instituted a full-scale [[import-substitution]] program which stimulated output by boosting internal demand. The government raised import controls on consumer goods but relaxed them on capital goods (such as machinery for Mexican production of consumer goods), which it purchased with international reserves accumulated during the war. The government spent it heavily on infrastructure, including major dam projects to produce [[hydroelectric]] power, supply drinking water to cities and irrigation water to agriculture, and control flooding.<ref>Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', pp. 68\u201381.</ref> By 1950 Mexico's road network had expanded to 21,000 kilometers, of which some 13,600 were paved.<ref>Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', pp. 63\u201366.</ref>\n\nThe economic stability of the country, high [[credit rating]] allowing borrowing, an increasingly educated work force, and savings allowing purchase of consumer goods were excellent conditions for the government's program of import substitution industrialization.  Finished goods previously purchased abroad could be produced domestically with the purchase of machinery. One successful industry was textile production. Foreign transnational companies established branches in Mexico, such as [[Coca-Cola]], [[Pepsi-Cola]], and [[Sears (Mexico)]] under Mexican laws regulating foreign investment.<ref>Daniel James, \"Sears Roebuck's Mexican Revolution,\" ''Harper's Magazine'' (June 1959) 1\u20136.</ref>  The [[automotive industry in Mexico]] already had been established shortly after the end of the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]], with [[Buick]] became the first automobile producer to be officially established in Mexico in 1921. In 1925, [[Ford Motor Company]] was too established and began manufacturing vehicles in the country.  With a growing middle class consumer market for such expensive consumer goods, the industrial base of Mexico expanded to meet the demand. \n\nThe government fostered the development of consumer goods industries directed toward [[domestic market]]s by imposing high protective tariffs and other barriers to [[International trade|imports]]. The share of imports subject to licensing requirements rose from 28 percent in 1956 to an average of more than 60 percent during the 1960s and about 70 percent in the 1970s. Industry accounted for 22 percent of total output in 1950, 24 percent in 1960, and 29 percent in 1970. The share of total output arising from agriculture and other primary activities declined during the same period, while services stayed constant.\n\nThe government promoted industrial expansion through [[Government bond|public investment]] in agricultural, energy, and transportation infrastructure. Cities grew rapidly during these years, reflecting the shift of employment from agriculture to industry and services. The urban population increased at a high rate after 1940. Growth of the urban labor force exceeded even the growth rate of industrial employment, with surplus workers taking low-paying service jobs.\n\n===Economic performance===\nMexico's strong economic performance continued into the 1960s, when [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth averaged about 7 percent overall and about 3 percent per capita. Consumer price inflation averaged only 3 percent annually. [[Manufacturing]] remained the country's dominant growth sector, expanding 7 percent annually and attracting considerable [[Foreign direct investment|foreign investment]]. \n\n[[Mining]] grew at an annual rate of nearly 4 percent, trade at 6 percent, and [[agriculture]] at 3 percent. By 1970 Mexico had diversified its [[export|export base]] and become largely self-sufficient in [[food]] [[crop]]s, [[steel]], and most [[consumer good]]s. Although its imports remained high, most were [[capital good]]s used to expand domestic production.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Economic history of Mexico]]\n* [[Economy of Mexico]]\n* [[La D\u00e9cada Perdida]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Howard F.

In 1946, the party founded by [[Plutarco El\u00edas Calles]] in the wake of President-elect [[\u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n]]'s assassination in 1928 changed its name to the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]]. With the party's presidential choice in 1946, [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], Mexico elected its first civilian president since [[Francisco I. Madero]] in 1911. The subsequent elections of [[Adolfo Ruiz Cortines]] (1952\u201358) and [[Adolfo L\u00f3pez Mateos]] (1958\u201364), [[Gustavo D\u00edaz Ordaz]] (1964\u201370) there were no political opposition challenges to the government's implementation of economic programs.\n\nDuring the presidency of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], there were significant policies in the social and political spheres that had impacts on future economic policies in Mexico, in particular [[Mexican oil expropriation|nationalization of oil]] in 1938, as well as land reform, and nationalization of railways.<ref>Howard F. Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution, 1940\u20131960''. Oxford: Oxford University Press 1962, p. 231.</ref> C\u00e1rdenas was succeeded by the politically more moderate [[Manuel \u00c1vila Camacho]], who initiated a program of industrialization in early 1941 with the Law of Manufacturing Industries. One scholar has called the inaugural date of this law \"the birthday of the Institutional Revolution,\" since it was the inception of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref>Cline, ''Mexico: Revolution to Evolution'', p. 232.</ref> Further legislation in 1946 under President [[Miguel Alem\u00e1n Vald\u00e9s]], the Law for Development of New and Necessary Industries, was passed.<ref>Sanford Mosk, ''Industrial Revolution in Mexico''.

New York: Atheneum Press, 1962, p. 184.</ref>  Mexico benefited significantly during World War II, by its participation on the side of the Allies. Mexico supplied labor to the U.S. via the [[Bracero Program]], but its most significant contribution was in its supply of material to fight the war. It received cash payments for its material contributions, which meant that following the war the Mexican treasury had robust reserves.
