First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters.

First phase was the conventional military warfare \nbetween two organized armies: The US Forces and the First Philippine Republican Army. This was period was from February to November \n1899. The second phase started from November 1899 when the Revolutionary army was dissipated into \"guerrilla\" -style warfare. This was based on smaller organized units of soldiers and local civilian supporters. Leadership became arbitrary with succession of \"generals\" and \"commanders\" based on who was second in command from the hierarchy of the old republic or who has more supporters or people under one's command.

The [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|Prep School]] (children aged 8\u201313) and Dragon Pre-Prep (ages 4\u20137) are both [[co-educational]] schools. The Dragon Prep School was founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School. It takes day pupils and [[boarding school|boarders]].\n\nOriginally established for boys, the Dragon School also accepted a small number of day girls with a close connection to the school, first admitting girls as boarders in 1994. The Dragon School is a feeder school to many independent schools, including [[Eton College]], [[Shrewsbury School]], [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], [[Harrow School]], [[Radley College]], [[Rugby School]], [[Marlborough College]], [[Canford School]], [[St Edward's School, Oxford]] and [[Abingdon School]].\n\nThe Dragon educates children from aged 4 to 13 in two sites in North Oxford: Bardwell Road and Richards Lane. Boarding starts at 8 and there are 10 boarding houses, including one weekly-boarding house.\n\n==History==\n[[File:School House, Dragon School, Oxford.JPG|thumb|240px|School House at the '''Dragon School''', on [[Bardwell Road]] in [[North Oxford]]]]\nThe School was founded by a committee of Oxford [[Don (honorific)#Academia|don]]s, among whom the most active was a Mr George.

The [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|Prep School]] (children aged 8\u201313) and Dragon Pre-Prep (ages 4\u20137) are both [[co-educational]] schools. The Dragon Prep School was founded in 1877 as the Oxford Preparatory School. It takes day pupils and [[boarding school|boarders]].\n\nOriginally established for boys, the Dragon School also accepted a small number of day girls with a close connection to the school, first admitting girls as boarders in 1994. The Dragon School is a feeder school to many independent schools, including [[Eton College]], [[Shrewsbury School]], [[Cheltenham Ladies' College]], [[Harrow School]], [[Radley College]], [[Rugby School]], [[Marlborough College]], [[Canford School]], [[St Edward's School, Oxford]] and [[Abingdon School]].\n\nThe Dragon educates children from aged 4 to 13 in two sites in North Oxford: Bardwell Road and Richards Lane. Boarding starts at 8 and there are 10 boarding houses, including one weekly-boarding house.\n\n==History==\n[[File:School House, Dragon School, Oxford.JPG|thumb|240px|School House at the '''Dragon School''', on [[Bardwell Road]] in [[North Oxford]]]]\nThe School was founded by a committee of Oxford [[Don (honorific)#Academia|don]]s, among whom the most active was a Mr George.

It became the second school to take part in the [[Harrow History Prize]] in 1895, and many of its pupils have won this over the years, an early winner being Miss Kit Lynam.

He was an [[Legitimacy (family law)|illegitimate]] member of the [[Mortimer#Medieval magnates|Mortimer family]], who  were one of the leading noble houses in England and Ireland, and he helped to manage the Mortimer  lands during the minority of the family heir, his nephew [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March|Roger, earl of March]]. Sir Thomas was also a close associate of the [[Lords Appellant]] who opposed the administration  of King Richard II.\n\nSir Thomas took part in the appellants' rebellion in 1387 against the king, and fought at the [[Battle of Radcot Bridge]], during which he killed Sir Thomas Molineux, one of the royal commanders. 10 years later, when the king took his revenge against the rebels, this act ultimately led to his conviction for [[treason]]. He fled for his life and died in [[exile]].\n\n==Background==\n[[Image:Conte de la Marsche.jpg|thumb|150px|Thomas's father, Roger, 2nd Earl of March]]\n\nThomas was an illegitimate son of [[Roger Mortimer, 2nd Earl of March]] (1328\u20131360).{{sfn|Dunn|2003|p=56}} He was described as an esquire in 1367, pointing to a birth date of  around 1350.{{sfn|Isaacson|1913|p=54}} He seems to have been treated by his father and  his brother very much as one of the family. Nothing is known of his mother. By 1380 he had acquired considerable military expertise, and had been [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]]. When his legitimate brother [[Edmund Mortimer, 3rd Earl of March]] was made [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]] in 1379, Thomas went with him to Ireland and acted as his Deputy, holding in his name a Great Council at [[Clonmel]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|p=315}} Edmund was charged with the task of subduing the Gaelic clans in [[Ulster]] and [[Munster]], but he had only limited success in this task.\n\n==Lord Deputy of Ireland==\nEdmund's sudden death in December 1381 left the [[Dublin]] Government in a quandary, since there were very few men willing  or qualified to assume the office of Lord Lieutenant, at a time of exceptional political turbulence in Ireland. Richard Wyre, [[Bishop of Cloyne]], proposed that Thomas Mortimer should be appointed Lord Lieutenant, both for his military experience and his ability to retain the loyalty of his brother's [[retinue]].{{sfn|Otway-Ruthven|1968|pp=315\u20136}} In the event King [[Richard II]] appointed Thomas's nephew, [[Roger Mortimer, 4th Earl of March]], a child of seven, as Lord Lieutenant.

His nephew's [[wardship]] had been entrusted to a group of magnates which included [[Richard FitzAlan, 4th Earl of Arundel]], of whom Thomas was an intimate friend. It was probably Arundel who appointed Thomas to the position of steward of the Mortimer estates during Roger's minority, thus greatly enhancing his political standing.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=162}} As Roger grew older he and his uncle became close, going hunting together and exchanging gifts of wine: Dunn suggests that Thomas was the closest Roger ever knew to a father.{{sfn|Dunn|2002|p=164}}\n\n==The Appellants==\nArundel was a  key member of the group of nobles called the [[Lords Appellant]], who had emerged as opponents of Richard II and the royal favourite [[Robert de Vere, Duke of Ireland]].

It was premiered on 16 October 2012, beginning with episode \"Jon Banega Don\". It focuses on two friends, Motu and Patlu, living in the fictional city Furfuri Nagar.\n\nThe director is Suhas Kadav and the theme music composer is [[Sandesh Shandilya]]. The producers are [[Deepa Sahi]] and Anish JS Mehta. The theme song \"Motu Aur Patlu Ki Jodi\" is sung by [[Sukhwinder Singh]].<ref name=\"motupatlu\" /> It is one of the most popular kids shows in India.<ref name=\"Milligan 2016\">{{cite web | last=Milligan | first=Mercedes | title=Cosmos-Maya Leads Regional Animation Production | website=Animation Magazine | date=19 May 2016 | url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cosmos-maya-leads-regional-animation-production/ | accessdate=16 November 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117063311/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cosmos-maya-leads-regional-animation-production/ | archive-date=17 November 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt received mostly positive reviews, with praise for vocal performance, animation, entertainment value, but criticized direction & runtime.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around Motu and Patlu, two friends living in Furfuri Nagar,<ref>{{cite web|title=living in|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/programmes/motu-patlu/params/tvprogramme/programmeid-30000000549774048|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302140221/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/programmes/motu-patlu/params/tvprogramme/programmeid-30000000549774048|archive-date=2 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the daily activities they would usually do. The show focuses on how the two would be in trouble  and land themselves in comical situations, later rescuing themselves only by sheer luck. [[Samosa]]s are Motu's favourite food, and he frequently tries to steal them from the local ''[[Chaiwala]]'' who makes the best samosas in the city. Motu is mainly the [[black sheep]] of the duo, unintentionally creating problems due to his dumbness while Patlu is the smart one and always tries to them. Sometimes, characters like Ghasitaram,Dr. Jhatka Chingum would help them. However, Ghasitaram at times misdirects and swindles them by making them try Dr. Jhatka's vast repertoire of quirky gadgets and gizmos. After Motu eats samosas, he temporarily gains more energy and strength than he normally has.\n\nThe main antagonist of the series is a criminal named \"John the Don\" who is always accompanied by his two big but weak and dumb henchmen, Number One and Number Two. John intends to become a don, but his plans always fail due to the heroic actions of Motu and Patlu, who trap and expose him and his plans [[Tit for Tat]]. In some episodes John would try to harm them by stealing Dr. Jhatka's gadget and using it on Motu Patlu, But they would soon take help from Dr.Jhatka and giving John a taste of his own medicine.\n\nIn the latest episodes we can see, they started to live in a city named Modern City. Some new characters were introduced.\n\n==Characters==\n{{one source|section|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Motu''': Motu is a plump man who serves as one of the show's central protagonists. He likes to eat [[Samosa|samosas]] which provides him power. He is a gardener. Motu's best friend is Patlu. He often lands in trouble because of his actions. He is always looking for the easiest way to earn money, have fun and get to eat a lot of samosas, even if it means landing himself in trouble. Sometimes he gets over-expressive while celebrating his victory and can do something very foolish, like bringing back a [[piracy|pirate]] into the present who they had sent recently back to the past. He is also shown bragging about something he has never done. But he is a good-natured man who wants to help others. He wears a red tunic with a navy blue (though mostly black) vest, yellow [[pyjamas]], and shoes. His talking accent looks influenced by [[Dara Singh]]. When he eats samosas, he gets extra energy like [[Chhota Bheem]] and can defeat anyone in the world. He is depicted as extremely [[Fear of mice|afraid of mice]]. His father is believed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials from Axar during his search for [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial lifeforms]] in the universe.\n*'''Patlu''': Patlu is a slim man who serves as one of the show's central protagonists. He is often portrayed as the smartest guy in the city. He often gets into trouble along with Motu but he manages to help himself and Motu when they land in trouble. He always advises Motu to be in their normal track and thus lead a \"danger-free\" life, but he can always be coaxed (or forced) by Motu into helping him. He dislikes samosas but loves to read newspapers. It is also believed that his [[Grandparent|grandfather]] was a boxing champion and had a recipe for procuring extraordinary strength, which is later discovered by Motu. He wears a yellow tunic with orange leggings, brown-framed glasses, and brown shoes.\n*'''Dr. Jhatka''': Dr. Jhatka is an eccentric scientist. His accent is like a sardar, so he is referred to as a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]. His inventions are usually very impressive but are of little use to the townspeople. In fact, more times than not they end up landing someone in trouble. He drives a yellow flying car. Jhatka is known by his balding hair, green shirt, violet necktie, and blue jeans. His grandfather is shown to be a millionaire searching for the whereabouts of his grandson in Furfuri Nagar; he almost falls into the sly, pretentious and crafty John's trap, who pretends to be his scientist grandson. His design is a parallel version of Motu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dr-jhatka-who-gave-us-a-shock/article1-1275470.aspx|title=Dr Jhatka, who gave us a shock|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Sometime he tests his gadgets on Motu and Patlu without telling them any information about it and they get into problems because of it. Later he creates an antidote and uses it to make them normal like before. He often gets beaten by Motu and Patlu because of it.\n*'''Ghasitaram''': Ghasitaram has 20 years of experience in every field but only very few of the experience is useful to anyone. He hails from Ghatal located in West Midnapore in West Bengal. Almost like Dr. Jhatka, his so-called \"experiences of 20 years\" often land people, especially Motu and Patlu, in trouble. However, Motu and Patlu do call on him for help in certain episodes. Ghasitaram helps Dr. Jhatka with experiments and coaxing Motu and Patlu to test Dr. Jhatka's inventions. His design is a parallel version of Patlu. He wears a cobalt blue tunic, purple [[dhoti]], dark brown vest, and shoes of the same color.\n*'''Chingum:''' is a [[police]] [[inspector]]. He believes that no criminal can escape from his clutches. However, Chingum manages to catch criminals merely by luck with the help of Motu and Patlu. A Rajinikanth devotee with a strong south Indian accent, Chingum is a solicitous police inspector. He takes pride in the fact that no criminal can ever get away from him. When he fires his gun in the air after telling his dialogue, coconuts fall on his head and make him fall to the ground. He drives a green motor bike and sometimes also drives a police jeep. He is sometimes helped by two constables, Hera and Pheri. As of the movie \"Motu Patlu: Double Trouble\", he is married. Chingum wears a khaki uniform with metals and a nametag on it. He also wears sunglasses most of the time. He likes south Indian food such as Idli, Dosa, Sambhar and Coconut chutney.\n\n===Antagonists===\n*'''Chaiwala''': A man who has a tea-shop near Motu's house. His real home is never revealed in the series. He makes Motu's favorite samosas and Patlu's favorite tea in the city. Motu steals the samosas from his shop and does not give the money to him. Motu gets a lot of power by eating samosas of Chaiwala. After eating samosas he shows aggression and can beat anyone, although the Chaiwala does not like his samosas to be eaten for free. He occasionally rewards Motu by exempting him from the money Motu owes him or even promising him free samosas when he saves him from other residents of Furfuri Nagar. Motu sometimes gets beaten for not giving money to Chaiwala.\n*'''John''': John serves as the main antagonist of the show. John's ambition is to become a Don. But his plans always fail very badly and thus end up in him getting arrested or being taunted by other people. He writes some short poems. Contrary to normal thieves, he is not afraid of Chingum but is instead afraid of Motu and Patlu. He is plump, and short in size and faces discrimination for that. He wears a blue dress shirt with dark blue flower prints, yellow undershirt, brown belt, dark periwinkle pants with blue cuffs, and brown shoes.\n*'''Number 1''': Number 1 is John's goon who serves as one of the supporting antagonists. He likes John's short poems. He has brilliant ideas to trap Motu and Patlu but whenever he tells him John says that his idea is bad and beats him, saying that he has a better plan but repeats the same one. Though he respects John, he is always the first to get beaten by him. He wears a blue French check hat, magenta striped shirt, denim trousers, and a yellow ascot.\n*'''Number 2''': Number 2 is John's goon who rarely speaks. He has a dark mark on his eye and a band-aid on his oversized nose. He has dark brown hair, wears a cyan striped shirt, aquamarine ascot, and brownish-orange pants.\n*'''Boxer''': Motu's neighbour/neighbor who wears red boxing gloves, a white tank top, and red pants with vertical yellow stripes. He is an aggressive man and a teacher in the school they used to attend. His coach is Mr. Thakur. He always wants to help his neighbors but he gets angry and beats them up. He also has an expensive car that gets destroyed by Motu. In \"Boxer's Baby\", it is also shown that he is not a good parent and could not get his son, Sunny, to sleep. Also, he is depicted having a cowardly brother in \"Judwa Boxer\" who becomes bold enough later to free him from Motu and Patlu's captivity.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Bubblegum''': He is the father of Chingum and the commissioner of police of the area comprising Furfuri Nagar and adjoining villages. He once got impressed with Motu and Patlu and even recruited them in the police as Havaldars, but when he came to know that they were not as capable as he had thought, he got annoyed with them and fired them from the police.\n*'''Hera Singh''': He is a Hawaldar of Inspector Chingum. He always tells Chingum, \"Aap to top ho, hindustan ki hop ho\", which means \"You are India's greatest hope\".\n*'''Pheri Lal''': He is a Hawaldar of Inspector Chingum. He always remarks, \"You are very great sir, but born little late sir\".\n*'''Sabziwali''': She sells best vegetables in the whole Furfuri Nagar. Motu can be troublesome to her too at times and also owes her some money. She has got a fiery temper and can also punish Chingum at times whenever his chases harm her vegetables in some or other way. She wears a green [[Sari|saree]] over a black blouse.\n*'''Mayor''': He is the Mayor of Furfuri Nagar, He wears a coat and a white shirt with the coat coloured Pant. He sometimes has a ''Mayor'' named band on his coat.\n*'''Munni''': She is the sister of Motu.\n*'''Chotu''': He is the nephew of Motu, He wears a green T-shirt with a pink pant. Sometimes, he wears a brown shirt with yellow pants.\n*'''Johnny''': He is the big brother of John. In ''Motu Patlu Acchey Insaan'', he is seen to be caught. In Episode ''John Ka Bhai Johnny'', he is seen very rich.\n*'''Virus''': He is a scientist, He always invents something for John. In return, he asks John for money but John somehow fools him and makes his run away. John uses his gadgets as a trial on him and puts Virus in trouble.\n*Additional characters include Chingum's mother, Amma, Chingum's wife, Dharti, and Chingum's uncle, Troublegum.\n\n==Cast==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n{{Missing information|the character that Deepak Kumar voices|date=August 2018}}\n\n* Saurav Chakraborty - Motu, Patlu, Ghasita Ram, Chingum, John and Boxer\n* Omi Sharma - Dr. Jhatka\n* Aanchal Trivedi -  Hera, Pheri\n* Sankalp Rastogi - Chaiwala, Number 1\n* Renu Sharda- Sabziwali\n* Brian D.

There are a few villages and a few neighbouring towns shown in the series, like Kamalpur, Sursuri Nagar and Modern City. Despite being a small town it has its own airport. It is not clearly mentioned where the town is actually located in India, but most of the vehicles carry plate numbers starting with MH, which stands for the state of [[Maharashtra]]. The police force of the town wears uniforms of the [[Maharashtra Police]].\n\nHowever, occasionally, during the new episodes, they had moved to Modern City for unknown reasons. And there were a lot of differences, although there does exist a quick [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] of showcasing new episodes mentioning that.\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Music===\nThe music featured in the series and film is written by [[Sandesh Shandilya]], an Indian film composer.

It was premiered on 16 October 2012, beginning with episode \"Jon Banega Don\". It focuses on two friends, Motu and Patlu, living in the fictional city Furfuri Nagar.\n\nThe director is Suhas Kadav and the theme music composer is [[Sandesh Shandilya]]. The producers are [[Deepa Sahi]] and Anish JS Mehta. The theme song \"Motu Aur Patlu Ki Jodi\" is sung by [[Sukhwinder Singh]].<ref name=\"motupatlu\" /> It is one of the most popular kids shows in India.<ref name=\"Milligan 2016\">{{cite web | last=Milligan | first=Mercedes | title=Cosmos-Maya Leads Regional Animation Production | website=Animation Magazine | date=19 May 2016 | url=http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cosmos-maya-leads-regional-animation-production/ | accessdate=16 November 2016 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117063311/http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/cosmos-maya-leads-regional-animation-production/ | archive-date=17 November 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt received mostly positive reviews, with praise for vocal performance, animation, entertainment value, but criticized direction & runtime.\n\n==Plot==\nThe story revolves around Motu and Patlu, two friends living in Furfuri Nagar,<ref>{{cite web|title=living in|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/programmes/motu-patlu/params/tvprogramme/programmeid-30000000549774048|accessdate=29 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302140221/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tv/programmes/motu-patlu/params/tvprogramme/programmeid-30000000549774048|archive-date=2 March 2017|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the daily activities they would usally do. The show focuses on how the two would be in trouble  and land themselves in comical situations, later rescuing themselves only by sheer luck. [[Samosa]]s are Motu's favourite food, and he frequently tries to steal them from the local ''[[Chaiwala]]'' who makes the best samosas in the city. Motu is mainly the [[black sheep]] of the duo, unintentionally creating problems due to his dumbness while Patlu is the smart one and always tries to them. Sometimes, characters like Ghasitaram,Dr. Jhatka Chingum would help them. However, Ghasitaram at times misdirects and swindles them by making them try Dr. Jhatka's vast repertoire of quirky gadgets and gizmos. After Motu eats samosas, he temporarily gains more energy and strength than he normally has.\n\nThe main antagonist of the series is a criminal named \"John the Don\" who is always accompanied by his two big but weak and dumb henchmen, Number One and Number Two. John intends to become a don, but his plans always fail due to the heroic actions of Motu and Patlu, who trap and expose him and his plans [[Tit for Tat]]. In some episodes John would try to harm them by stealing Dr. Jhatka's gadget and using it on Motu Patlu, But they would soon take help from Dr.Jhatka and giving John a taste of his own medicine.\n\nIn the latest episodes we can see, they started to live in a city named Modern City. Some new characters were introduced.\n\n==Characters==\n{{one source|section|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Main characters===\n*'''Motu''': Motu is a plump man who serves as one of the show's central protagonists. He likes to eat [[Samosa|samosas]] which provides him power. He is a gardener. Motu's best friend is Patlu. He often lands in trouble because of his actions. He is always looking for the easiest way to earn money, have fun and get to eat a lot of samosas, even if it means landing himself in trouble. Sometimes he gets over-expressive while celebrating his victory and can do something very foolish, like bringing back a [[piracy|pirate]] into the present who they had sent recently back to the past. He is also shown bragging about something he has never done. But he is a good-natured man who wants to help others. He wears a red tunic with a navy blue (though mostly black) vest, yellow [[pyjamas]], and shoes. His talking accent looks influenced by [[Dara Singh]]. When he eats samosas, he gets extra energy like [[Chhota Bheem]] and can defeat anyone in the world. He is depicted as extremely [[Fear of mice|afraid of mice]]. His father is believed to have been abducted by extraterrestrials from Axar during his search for [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial lifeforms]] in the universe.\n*'''Patlu''': Patlu is a slim man who serves as one of the show's central protagonists. He is often portrayed as the smartest guy in the city. He often gets into trouble along with Motu but he manages to help himself and Motu when they land in trouble. He always advises Motu to be in their normal track and thus lead a \"danger-free\" life, but he can always be coaxed (or forced) by Motu into helping him. He dislikes samosas but loves to read newspapers. It is also believed that his [[Grandparent|grandfather]] was a boxing champion and had a recipe for procuring extraordinary strength, which is later discovered by Motu. He wears a yellow tunic with orange leggings, brown-framed glasses, and brown shoes.\n*'''Dr. Jhatka''': Dr. Jhatka is an eccentric scientist. His accent is like a sardar, so he is referred to as a [[Punjabi people|Punjabi]]. His inventions are usually very impressive but are of little use to the townspeople. In fact, more times than not they end up landing someone in trouble. He drives a yellow flying car. Jhatka is known by his balding hair, green shirt, violet necktie, and blue jeans. His grandfather is shown to be a millionaire searching for the whereabouts of his grandson in Furfuri Nagar; he almost falls into the sly, pretentious and crafty John's trap, who pretends to be his scientist grandson. His design is a parallel version of Motu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dr-jhatka-who-gave-us-a-shock/article1-1275470.aspx|title=Dr Jhatka, who gave us a shock|accessdate=25 May 2015}}</ref> Sometime he tests his gadgets on Motu and Patlu without telling them any information about it and they get into problems because of it. Later he creates an antidote and uses it to make them normal like before. He often gets beaten by Motu and Patlu because of it.\n*'''Ghasitaram''': Ghasitaram has 20 years of experience in every field but only very few of the experience is useful to anyone. He hails from Ghatal located in West Midnapore in West Bengal. Almost like Dr. Jhatka, his so-called \"experiences of 20 years\" often land people, especially Motu and Patlu, in trouble. However, Motu and Patlu do call on him for help in certain episodes. Ghasitaram helps Dr. Jhatka with experiments and coaxing Motu and Patlu to test Dr. Jhatka's inventions. His design is a parallel version of Patlu. He wears a cobalt blue tunic, purple [[dhoti]], dark brown vest, and shoes of the same color.\n*'''Chingum:''' is a [[police]] [[inspector]]. He believes that no criminal can escape from his clutches. However, Chingum manages to catch criminals merely by luck with the help of Motu and Patlu. A Rajinikanth devotee with a strong south Indian accent, Chingum is a solicitous police inspector. He takes pride in the fact that no criminal can ever get away from him. When he fires his gun in the air after telling his dialogue, coconuts fall on his head and make him fall to the ground. He drives a green motor bike and sometimes also drives a police jeep. He is sometimes helped by two constables, Hera and Pheri. As of the movie \"Motu Patlu: Double Trouble\", he is married. Chingum wears a khaki uniform with metals and a nametag on it. He also wears sunglasses most of the time. He likes south Indian food such as Idli, Dosa, Sambhar and Coconut chutney.\n\n===Antagonists===\n*'''Chaiwala''': A man who has a tea-shop near Motu's house. His real home is never revealed in the series. He makes Motu's favorite samosas and Patlu's favorite tea in the city. Motu steals the samosas from his shop and does not give the money to him. Motu gets a lot of power by eating samosas of Chaiwala. After eating samosas he shows aggression and can beat anyone, although the Chaiwala does not like his samosas to be eaten for free. He occasionally rewards Motu by exempting him from the money Motu owes him or even promising him free samosas when he saves him from other residents of Furfuri Nagar. Motu sometimes gets beaten for not giving money to Chaiwala.\n*'''John''': John serves as the main antagonist of the show. John's ambition is to become a Don. But his plans always fail very badly and thus end up in him getting arrested or being taunted by other people. He writes some short poems. Contrary to normal thieves, he is not afraid of Chingum but is instead afraid of Motu and Patlu. He is plump, and short in size and faces discrimination for that. He wears a blue dress shirt with dark blue flower prints, yellow undershirt, brown belt, dark periwinkle pants with blue cuffs, and brown shoes.\n*'''Number 1''': Number 1 is John's goon who serves as one of the supporting antagonists. He likes John's short poems. He has brilliant ideas to trap Motu and Patlu but whenever he tells him John says that his idea is bad and beats him, saying that he has a better plan but repeats the same one. Though he respects John, he is always the first to get beaten by him. He wears a blue French check hat, magenta striped shirt, denim trousers, and a yellow ascot.\n*'''Number 2''': Number 2 is John's goon who rarely speaks. He has a dark mark on his eye and a band-aid on his oversized nose. He has dark brown hair, wears a cyan striped shirt, aquamarine ascot, and brownish-orange pants.\n*'''Boxer''': Motu's neighbour/neighbor who wears red boxing gloves, a white tank top, and red pants with vertical yellow stripes. He is an aggressive man and a teacher in the school they used to attend. His coach is Mr. Thakur. He always wants to help his neighbors but he gets angry and beats them up. He also has an expensive car that gets destroyed by Motu. In \"Boxer's Baby\", it is also shown that he is not a good parent and could not get his son, Sunny, to sleep. Also, he is depicted having a cowardly brother in \"Judwa Boxer\" who becomes bold enough later to free him from Motu and Patlu's captivity.\n\n===Minor characters===\n*'''Bubblegum''': He is the father of Chingum and the commissioner of police of the area comprising Furfuri Nagar and adjoining villages. He once got impressed with Motu and Patlu and even recruited them in the police as Havaldars, but when he came to know that they were not as capable as he had thought, he got annoyed with them and fired them from the police.\n*'''Hera Singh''': He is a Hawaldar of Inspector Chingum. He always tells Chingum, \"Aap to top ho, hindustan ki hop ho\", which means \"You are India's greatest hope\".\n*'''Pheri Lal''': He is a Hawaldar of Inspector Chingum. He always remarks, \"You are very great sir, but born little late sir\".\n*'''Sabziwali''': She sells best vegetables in the whole Furfuri Nagar. Motu can be troublesome to her too at times and also owes her some money. She has got a fiery temper and can also punish Chingum at times whenever his chases harm her vegetables in some or other way. She wears a green [[Sari|saree]] over a black blouse.\n*'''Mayor''': He is the Mayor of Furfuri Nagar, He wears a coat and a white shirt with the coat coloured Pant. He sometimes has a ''Mayor'' named band on his coat.\n*'''Munni''': She is the sister of Motu.\n*'''Chotu''': He is the nephew of Motu, He wears a green T-shirt with a pink pant. Sometimes, he wears a brown shirt with yellow pants.\n*'''Johnny''': He is the big brother of John. In ''Motu Patlu Acchey Insaan'', he is seen to be caught. In Episode ''John Ka Bhai Johnny'', he is seen very rich.\n*'''Virus''': He is a scientist, He always invents something for John. In return, he asks John for money but John somehow fools him and makes his run away. John uses his gadgets as a trial on him and puts Virus in trouble.\n*Additional characters include Chingum's mother, Amma, Chingum's wife, Dharti, and Chingum's uncle, Troublegum.\n\n==Cast==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n{{Missing information|the character that Deepak Kumar voices|date=August 2018}}\n\n* Saurav Chakraborty - Motu, Patlu, Ghasita Ram, Chingum, John and Boxer\n* Omi Sharma - Dr. Jhatka\n* Aanchal Trivedi -  Hera, Pheri\n* Sankalp Rastogi - Chaiwala, Number 1\n* Renu Sharda- Sabziwali\n* Brian D.

There are a few villages and a few neighbouring towns shown in the series, like Kamalpur, Sursuri Nagar and Modern City. Despite being a small town it has its own airport. It is not clearly mentioned where the town is actually located in India, but most of the vehicles carry plate numbers starting with MH, which stands for the state of [[Maharashtra]]. The police force of the town wears uniforms of the [[Maharashtra Police]].\n\nHowever, occasionally, during the new episodes, they had moved to Modern City for unknown reasons. And there were a lot of differences, although there does exist a quick [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]] of showcasing new episodes mentioning that.\n\n==Production==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Music===\nThe music featured in the series and film is written by [[Sandesh Shandilya]], an Indian film composer.

Renault also had to find a way to distribute its vehicles more efficiently. In 1920, Louis signed one of its first distribution contracts with Gustave Gueudet, an entrepreneur from northern France.\n\nThe pre-First World War cars had a distinctive front shape caused by positioning the [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] behind the engine to give a so-called \"coalscuttle\" [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. This continued through the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1016126 |title=Lot 128 / Sale 5545: 1909 Renault AX |work=christies.com |publisher=[[Christie's]] |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Only in 1930 did all models place the radiator at the front. The bonnet badge changed from circular to the familiar and continuing diamond shape in 1925.\n\nRenault introduced new models at the [[Paris Motor Show]] that was held in September or October of the year. This led to confusion about model years. For example, a \"1927\" model was mostly produced in 1928.\n\nRenault cars ranged from small to very large. For example, in 1928, when Renault produced 45,809 cars, its seven models started with a 6CV, a 10CV, the [[Renault Monasix|Monasix]], 15CV, the [[Renault Vivasix|Vivasix]], the 18/22CV and the [[Renault 40CV|40CV]]. Renault offered eight body styles. The larger chassis were available to [[coachbuilder]]s. The smaller were the most popular while the least produced was the 18/24CV. The most expensive body style in each range was the closed car. Roadsters and tourers (torpedoes) were the cheapest.\n\nThe London operation was important to Renault in 1928. The UK market was quite large and \"colonial\" modified vehicles were dispatched from there to North America. Lifted suspensions, enhanced cooling, and special bodies were common on vehicles sold abroad. Exports to the US by 1928 had declined to near-zero from their high point prior to WWI. A NM 40CV Tourer had a US list price of over $4,600, about the same as a [[Cadillac V-12]]. Closed 7-seat limousines started at $6,000, which was more expensive than a [[Cadillac V-16]].\n\nCars were conservatively engineered and built. The Vivasix, model PG1, was sold as the \"executive sports\" model beginning in 1927. Lighter weight factory steel bodies powered by a 3,180 [[cubic centimetre]] (cc) six-cylinder motor provided a formula that lasted until the [[Second World War]].\n\n\"de Grand Luxe Renaults\", those with a [[wheelbase]] over {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}}, were produced in small numbers in two major types \u2013 six- and eight-cylinder. The 1927 six-cylinder Grand Renault models NM, PI and PZ introduced the new three spring rear suspension that considerably aided stability that was needed since some vehicles surpassed {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 8-cylinder [[Renault Reinastella|Reinastella]] was introduced in 1929 and expanded to a range culminating in 1939 [[Renault Suprastella|Suprastella]]. Coachbuilders included Kellner, Labourdette, J. Rothschild et Fils and Renault bodies. Closed car Renault bodies were often trimmed with interior woodwork by Rothschild.\n\n[[File:Renault Viva Boucher.jpg|[[Renault Viva Grand Sport]] and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boucher]].

The [[Renault Vivastella|Vivastella]]'s and Grand Renaults had upgraded interior fittings and a small star fitted above the front hood logo. This proved to be a winning differentiator and in the 1930s all cars changed to the Stella suffix from the previous two alpha character model identifiers.\n\nThe Grand Renaults were built using a considerable amount of [[aluminium]]. Engines, brakes, transmissions, floor and running boards and all external body panels were aluminium. Of the few that were built, many went to scrap to aid the war effort.\n\nIn 1931, Renault introduced [[diesel engine]]s for its commercial vehicles.<ref name=TT/>\n\nRenault was one of the few French vehicle manufacturers that pursued the production of [[aircraft engine]]s after World War I.

He produced trucks instead. On 3 March 1942, the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) launched 235 low-level bombers at the [[\u00cele Seguin|Billancourt]] plant, the largest number aimed at a single target during the war.<ref>Ben Macintyre, ''Agent Zigzag'', p37, Bloomsbury, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-1-4088-1149-8}})</ref> {{Convert|460|MT|}} of bombs were dropped on the plant and the surrounding area, causing extensive damage along with heavy civilian casualties.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> Renault resolved to rebuild the factory as quickly as possible, but bombardments continued a year later, on 4 April, this time delivered by the Americans, and on 3 and 15 September 1943.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/>\n\nA few weeks after the [[Liberation of Paris]], at the start of September 1944, the factory gates at Renault's Billancourt plant reopened.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> Operations restarted slowly, in an atmosphere poisoned by plotting and political conspiracy.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> In 1936, the Billancourt factory had been the scene of violent political and industrial unrest that had surfaced under [[Leon Blum]]'s [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government. The political jostling and violence that followed liberation ostensibly reflected the rivalries between [[capitalist]] collaboration and [[communist]] resistance, many of the scores settled predated the invasion.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/>\n\nResponding to the chaotic situation at Renault, a 27 September 1944 meeting of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] <small>([[:fr: Conseil des ministres (France)|fr]])</small> took place under [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle's]] presidency. Postwar European politics had quickly become polarised between communists and anti-communists, and in France de Gaulle was keen to resist [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] attempts to monopolise the political dividends available to [[French resistance|resistance]] heroes: politically Billancourt was a communist stronghold. The government decided to \"requisition\" the Renault factories.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> A week later, on 4 October, [[Pierre Lefaucheux]], a resistance leader with a background in engineering and top-level management, was appointed provisional administrator of the firm, assuming his responsibilities at once.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|provisional government]] accused Louis Renault of collaborating with the Germans. In the frenzied atmosphere of those early post-liberation days, with many wild accusations, Renault was advised by his lawyers to present himself to a judge. He appeared before Judge Marcel Martin, on 22 September 1944<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> and was arrested on 23 September 1944, as were several other French automobile-industry leaders.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> Renault's harsh handling of the 1936\u20131938 strikes had left him without political allies and no one came to his aid.<ref name=\"Saltmarsh1\" /> He was incarcerated at [[Fresnes prison]] where he died on 24 October 1944 under unclear circumstances,<ref name=\"shame\">{{cite news| title = Louis Renault and the shame of a nation| work=The Daily Telegraph | author=Ian Morton| date = 14 May 2005| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html| location=London}}</ref> while awaiting trial.<ref name=\"ogre\">{{cite news| title = Foreign News: Was He Murdered?|work=Time Magazine | date = 6 February 1956| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19700107&id=dT0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MCgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5789,2899107|title=The Rise and Fall of Louis Renault|last=Scriba|first=Jay|date=7 January 1970|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=16|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1945, by de Gaulle's decree, the company was posthumously expropriated from Louis Renault.

The car manufacturer Marius Berliet suffered the same fate of expropriation. At his trial in September 1945, Berliet claimed in his defence that his company had produced few cars for the German occupants than any other car producer: 2239 cars for the Germans vs. 6548 for French customers. This compared to Renault which had delivered 32,887 vehicles to the Germans and only 1697 to French clients, a pattern followed by Citroen (32,248 produced for Germans and only 2052 for French clients)(Aron, 1974). Managers at Renault claimed for their part, that they had deliberately slowed down production, producing 7677 fewer vehicles than the target of 41,909 vehicles imposed by the German occupants. The argument, however, cut no ice with the Confederation Generale du Travail (CVT), who maintained that the go-slow had been organised by the workers, not the management. Louis Renault may have been punished more for his attitudes than his actions, which were mirrored by those of many other employers.

Renault debuted its flagship model, the largely conventional 2-litre 4-cylinder [[Renault Fr\u00e9gate]] (1951\u20131960), shortly thereafter. The 4CV proved a capable rival for cars such as the [[Morris Minor]] and [[Volkswagen Beetle]]; its sales of more than half a million ensured its production until 1961.\n\nAfter the success of the 4CV, Lefacheux continued to defy the postwar French [[Paul-Marie Pons|Ministry of Industrial Production]], which had wanted to convert Renault solely to truck manufacture,<ref name=\"50jahre\">{{cite web| title = 50 Jahre Renault Dauphine| publisher=Auto-Motor, 05.10.2006, In German| url = http://www.auto-motor.at/Auto/Oldtimer/Renault-Dauphine.html}}</ref> by directing the development of its successor.

The 1960s had been a decade of aggressive growth: a few months earlier, in October 1969, the manufacturer had launched the [[Renault 12]], combining the engineering philosophy of its hatchbacks with the more conservative \"three-box\" design. The four-door [[Renault 12]] model fit between the [[Renault 6]] and [[Renault 16]].

The energy crisis led Renault to again attempt to attack the North American market. Despite the Dauphine's success in the United States in the late 1950s and an unsuccessful assembly project in [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec]] (1964\u201372), Renault began to disappear from North America at the end of the decade.\n\nOver the decades, Renault had developed a collaborative partnership with [[Nash Motors]] [[Nash Rambler|Rambler]] and its successor [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC). From 1962 to 1967, Renault assembled [[complete knock down]] (CKD) kits of the [[Rambler Classic]] sedans in its factory in Belgium.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.renault.com/fr/passionsport/pages/renault-meconnues.aspx|title=Renault Meconnues|publisher=Renault|accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Renault did not have large or luxury cars in its product line and the \"Rambler Renault\" was positioned as an alternative to the [[Mercedes-Benz Heckflosse|Mercedes-Benz \"Fintail\"]] cars. Later, Renault continued to make and sell a hybrid of AMC's [[Rambler American]] and [[Rambler Classic]] called the [[Renault Torino]] in Argentina (sold through IKA-Renault). Renault partnered with AMC on other projects, such as a rotary concept engine in the late 1960s.\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, the company established subsidiaries in [[Eastern Europe]], most notably [[Dacia (car)|Dacia]] in Romania, and [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|South America]] (many of which remain active) and forged technological cooperation agreements with [[Volvo]] and [[Peugeot]],<ref name=DTI>{{cite journal|date=October 1982|title=Fourth Section: Manufacturer's profile|journal=Transit bus manufacturer profiles|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Urban Mass Transportation Administration, Office of Technical Assistance, Office of Bus and Paratransit Systems|location=Washington DC|pages=128\u2013137|oclc=9384438}}</ref> (for instance, for the development of the [[PRV engine|PRV]] [[V6]] engine, which was used in [[Renault 30]], [[Peugeot 604]], and [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo 260]] in the late 1970s).\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Renault Australia was set up in Melbourne. The company produced and assembled models including the R8, R10, R12, R16, sporty R15, R17 coupes, R18, and R20. The unit closed in 1981. Renault Australia also built and marketed Peugeots.

In 1980, Renault produced 2,053,677 cars and LCVs. The cars at the time were the Renault 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 30; the LCVs were the 4, 5, and 12 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 and the Estafette.

The first Renault model sold through AMC's dealerships was the R5, renamed Renault Le Car. [[Jeep]] was keeping AMC afloat until new products, particularly the [[Jeep XJ|XJ Cherokee]], could be launched. When the bottom fell out of the [[four-wheel drive]] (4\u00d74) truck market in early 1980, AMC was in danger of bankruptcy. To protect its investment, Renault bailed AMC out with cash \u2013 at the price of a controlling 47.5% interest.<ref name=TCAMAIH>{{cite book|last=Cranswick|first=Marc|title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History|year=2011|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/279 279\u2013295]|chapter=Kenosha Serves Cafe au Lait!|url=https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/279}}</ref> Renault replaced some AMC executives, and Jose J.

Part of AMC's overall strategy was to save manufacturing costs by using Renault parts and engineering expertise when practical. This led to the improvement of the venerable [[AMC Straight-6 engine|AMC inline six]] \u2013 a Renault/Bendix-based port electronic [[fuel injection]] system (usually called [[Renix]]) transformed it into a modern, competitive powerplant with a jump from {{convert|110|to|177|hp|abbr=on}} with less displacement (from 4.2 to 4.0 litres). The XJC Cherokee concept, which was conceived in 1983 as a successor to the XJ series, was also a joint collaboration with AMC and Renault engineers until the design was inherited by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in late 1987 after Renault divested AMC \u2013 which debuted in 1989 as the Jeep Concept 1 (evolving into the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] in April 1992).\n\nThe Renault-AMC marketing effort in passenger cars was not successful compared to the popularity of Jeep vehicles. This was because by the time the Renault range was ready, the [[1979 energy crisis|second energy crisis]] was over, taking with it much of the desire for economical, compact cars. One exception was the [[Renault Alliance]] (an Americanised version of the [[Renault 9]]), which debuted for the 1983 model year.

(In 2000, ''Motor Trend'' did away with separate awards for domestic and imported vehicles.) A surprising side effect of the AMC linkup was that Renault felt the effects of the [[Arab League boycott of Israel|Arab League boycott]] of companies doing business with Israel, as AMC built Jeeps there under license.

The second-generation Renault 5, the European Car of the Year-winning [[Renault 9]], and the most luxurious Renault yet, the aerodynamic [[Renault 25|25]], were all released in the early 1980s. At the same time, poor product quality damaged the brand.

However, Renault was losing a billion francs a month totaling \u20a312.5&nbsp;billion in 1984. The government intervened and [[Georges Besse]] was installed as chairman; he set about cutting costs dramatically, selling many of Renault's non-core assets (Volvo stake, [[Gitane]], Eurocar and Renix), withdrawing almost entirely from [[motorsports]], and laying off many employees.<ref name=R1985>{{cite journal |date=2004 |url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/digitalfordism/fordism_materials/Donnelly.pdf |last1=Donnelly |first1=Tom |last2=Donnelly |first2=Tim |last3=Morris |first3=David |title=Renault 1985\u20132000: From bankruptcy to profit |issue=30 |series=Working papers (Caen Innovation March\u00e9 Entreprise) |oclc=799704146 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903080634/http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/digitalfordism/fordism_materials/Donnelly.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This halved the deficit by 1986, but Besse was murdered by the communist [[terrorist]] group ''[[Action Directe (terrorist group)|Action Directe]]'' in November 1986. He was replaced by Raymond L\u00e9vy, who continued Besse's initiatives, slimming the company enough that by the end of 1987, Renault was more or less financially stable. However, while Besse was convinced that Renault needed a presence in the North American market and wanted to push forward with restructuring AMC, L\u00e9vy, facing domestic losses from Renault at home, and losses from AMC in the US, along with the political climate that led to Besse's assassination, decided to sell AMC to [[Chrysler]] that same year.\n\nThe [[Renault 9]], a small four-door family saloon, was voted [[European Car of the Year]] on its 1981 launch. It sold well in [[France]], but was eventually eclipsed by its sister vehicle, the [[Renault 11]] hatchback, as the hatchback body style became more popular on this size of the car. The [[Renault 5]] entered its second generation in 1984 and continued to sell well. The long-running [[Renault 18]] was replaced by the [[Renault 21]] early in 1986, adding a seven-seater estate badged as the Nevada or Savanna depending on where it was sold. Renault's top of the range model in the 1980s was the [[Renault 25]], launched at the end of 1983.\n\nIn 1990, Renault strengthened its collaboration with Volvo by signing an agreement that allowed both companies to reduce vehicle conception costs and purchasing expenses. Renault had access to Volvo expertise in upper market segments and in return, Volvo exploited Renault designs for low and medium segments. In 1993, the two companies announced their intention to merge operations by 1 January 1994 and increased their cross-shareholding. The French accepted the merger, while Volvo shareholders rejected it.<ref name=R1985/>\n\nA revitalised Renault launched successful new cars in the early 1990s, accompanied by an improved marketing effort on European markets,<ref name=R1985/> including the 5 replacement, the [[Renault Clio|Clio]] in May 1990.<ref name=\"IDCH\"/> The Clio was the first new model of a generation that replaced numeric identifiers with traditional nameplates. The Clio was voted [[European Car of the Year]] soon after its launch, and was one of Europe's best-selling cars in the 1990s, proving even more popular than its predecessor. Other important launches included the third-generation [[Renault Espace|Espace]] in 1996 and the innovative [[Renault Twingo|Twingo]] in 1992, the first car to be marketed as a city car MPV.

Renault also had to find a way to distribute its vehicles more efficiently. In 1920, Louis signed one of its first distribution contracts with Gustave Gueudet, an entrepreneur from northern France.\n\nThe pre-First World War cars had a distinctive front shape caused by positioning the [[Radiator (engine cooling)|radiator]] behind the engine to give a so-called \"coalscuttle\" [[Hood (vehicle)|bonnet]]. This continued through the 1920s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1016126 |title=Lot 128 / Sale 5545: 1909 Renault AX |work=christies.com |publisher=[[Christie's]] |accessdate=20 April 2013}}</ref> Only in 1930 did all models place the radiator at the front. The bonnet badge changed from circular to the familiar and continuing diamond shape in 1925.\n\nRenault introduced new models at the [[Paris Motor Show]] that was held in September or October of the year. This led to confusion about model years. For example, a \"1927\" model was mostly produced in 1928.\n\nRenault cars ranged from small to very large. For example, in 1928, when Renault produced 45,809 cars, its seven models started with a 6CV, a 10CV, the [[Renault Monasix|Monasix]], 15CV, the [[Renault Vivasix|Vivasix]], the 18/22CV and the [[Renault 40CV|40CV]]. Renault offered eight body styles. The larger chassis were available to [[coachbuilder]]s. The smaller were the most popular while the least produced was the 18/24CV. The most expensive body style in each range was the closed car. Roadsters and tourers (torpedoes) were the cheapest.\n\nThe London operation was important to Renault in 1928. The UK market was quite large and \"colonial\" modified vehicles were dispatched from there to North America. Lifted suspensions, enhanced cooling, and special bodies were common on vehicles sold abroad. Exports to the US by 1928 had declined to near-zero from their high point prior to WWI. A NM 40CV Tourer had a US list price of over $4,600, about the same as a [[Cadillac V-12]]. Closed 7-seat limousines started at $6,000, which was more expensive than a [[Cadillac V-16]].\n\nCars were conservatively engineered and built. The Vivasix, model PG1, was sold as the \"executive sports\" model beginning in 1927. Lighter weight factory steel bodies powered by a 3,180 [[cubic centimetre]] (cc) six-cylinder motor provided a formula that lasted until the [[Second World War]].\n\n\"de Grand Luxe Renaults\", those with a [[wheelbase]] over {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}}, were produced in small numbers in two major types \u2013 six- and eight-cylinder. The 1927 six-cylinder Grand Renault models NM, PI and PZ introduced the new three spring rear suspension that considerably aided stability that was needed since some vehicles surpassed {{convert|90|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe 8-cylinder [[Renault Reinastella|Reinastella]] was introduced in 1929 and expanded to a range culminating in 1939 [[Renault Suprastella|Suprastella]]. Coachbuilders included Kellner, Labourdette, J. Rothschild et Fils and Renault bodies. Closed car Renault bodies were often trimmed with interior woodwork by Rothschild.\n\n[[File:Renault Viva Boucher.jpg|[[Renault Viva Grand Sport]] and [[H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Boucher]].

The [[Renault Vivastella|Vivastella]]'s and Grand Renaults had upgraded interior fittings and a small star fitted above the front hood logo. This proved to be a winning differentiator and in the 1930s all cars changed to the Stella suffix from the previous two alpha character model identifiers.\n\nThe Grand Renaults were built using a considerable amount of [[aluminium]]. Engines, brakes, transmissions, floor and running boards and all external body panels were aluminium. Of the few that were built, many went to scrap to aid the war effort.\n\nIn 1931, Renault introduced [[diesel engine]]s for its commercial vehicles.<ref name=TT/>\n\nRenault was one of the few French vehicle manufacturers that pursued the production of [[aircraft engine]]s after World War I.

He produced trucks instead. On 3 March 1942, the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) launched 235 low-level bombers at the [[\u00cele Seguin|Billancourt]] plant, the largest number aimed at a single target during the war.<ref>Ben Macintyre, ''Agent Zigzag'', p37, Bloomsbury, 2010 ({{ISBN|978-1-4088-1149-8}})</ref> {{Convert|460|MT|}} of bombs were dropped on the plant and the surrounding area, causing extensive damage along with heavy civilian casualties.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> Renault resolved to rebuild the factory as quickly as possible, but bombardments continued a year later, on 4 April, this time delivered by the Americans, and on 3 and 15 September 1943.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/>\n\nA few weeks after the [[Liberation of Paris]], at the start of September 1944, the factory gates at Renault's Billancourt plant reopened.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> Operations restarted slowly, in an atmosphere poisoned by plotting and political conspiracy.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/> In 1936, the Billancourt factory had been the scene of violent political and industrial unrest that had surfaced under [[Leon Blum]]'s [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] government. The political jostling and violence that followed liberation ostensibly reflected the rivalries between [[capitalist]] collaboration and [[communist]] resistance, many of the scores settled predated the invasion.<ref name=Automobilia1940-46/>\n\nResponding to the chaotic situation at Renault, a 27 September 1944 meeting of the [[Council of Ministers of France|Council of Ministers]] <small>([[:fr: Conseil des ministres (France)|fr]])</small> took place under [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle's]] presidency. Postwar European politics had quickly become polarised between communists and anti-communists, and in France de Gaulle was keen to resist [[French Communist Party|Communist Party]] attempts to monopolise the political dividends available to [[French resistance|resistance]] heroes: politically Billancourt was a communist stronghold. The government decided to \"requisition\" the Renault factories.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> A week later, on 4 October, [[Pierre Lefaucheux]], a resistance leader with a background in engineering and top-level management, was appointed provisional administrator of the firm, assuming his responsibilities at once.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" />\n\nMeanwhile, the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|provisional government]] accused Louis Renault of collaborating with the Germans. In the frenzied atmosphere of those early post-liberation days, with many wild accusations, Renault was advised by his lawyers to present himself to a judge. He appeared before Judge Marcel Martin, on 22 September 1944<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> and was arrested on 23 September 1944, as were several other French automobile-industry leaders.<ref name=\"Automobilia1940-46\" /> Renault's harsh handling of the 1936\u20131938 strikes had left him without political allies and no one came to his aid.<ref name=\"Saltmarsh1\" /> He was incarcerated at [[Fresnes prison]] where he died on 24 October 1944 under unclear circumstances,<ref name=\"shame\">{{cite news| title = Louis Renault and the shame of a nation| work=The Daily Telegraph | author=Ian Morton| date = 14 May 2005| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/motoring/2735296/Louis-Renault-and-the-shame-of-a-nation.html| location=London}}</ref> while awaiting trial.<ref name=\"ogre\">{{cite news| title = Foreign News: Was He Murdered?|work=Time Magazine | date = 6 February 1956| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,893292,00.html}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&dat=19700107&id=dT0aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=MCgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5789,2899107|title=The Rise and Fall of Louis Renault|last=Scriba|first=Jay|date=7 January 1970|work=The Milwaukee Journal|page=16|accessdate=11 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 January 1945, by de Gaulle's decree, the company was posthumously expropriated from Louis Renault.

The car manufacturer Marius Berliet suffered the same fate of expropriation. At his trial in September 1945, Berliet claimed in his defence that his company had produced few cars for the German occupants than any other car producer: 2239 cars for the Germans vs. 6548 for French customers. This compared to Renault which had delivered 32,887 vehicles to the Germans and only 1697 to French clients, a pattern followed by Citroen (32,248 produced for Germans and only 2052 for French clients)(Aron, 1974). Managers at Renault claimed for their part, that they had deliberately slowed down production, producing 7677 fewer vehicles than the target of 41,909 vehicles imposed by the German occupants. The argument, however, cut no ice with the Confederation Generale du Travail (CVT), who maintained that the go-slow had been organised by the workers, not the management. Louis Renault may have been punished more for his attitudes than his actions, which were mirrored by those of many other employers.

The 4CV proved a capable rival for cars such as the [[Morris Minor]] and [[Volkswagen Beetle]]; its sales of more than half a million ensured its production until 1961.\n\nAfter the success of the 4CV, Lefacheux continued to defy the postwar French [[Paul-Marie Pons|Ministry of Industrial Production]], which had wanted to convert Renault solely to truck manufacture,<ref name=\"50jahre\">{{cite web| title = 50 Jahre Renault Dauphine| publisher=Auto-Motor, 05.10.2006, In German| url = http://www.auto-motor.at/Auto/Oldtimer/Renault-Dauphine.html}}</ref> by directing the development of its successor.

Despite the Dauphine's success in the United States in the late 1950s and an unsuccessful assembly project in [[Saint-Bruno-de-Montarville, Quebec]] (1964\u201372), Renault began to disappear from North America at the end of the decade.\n\nOver the decades, Renault had developed a collaborative partnership with [[Nash Motors]] [[Nash Rambler|Rambler]] and its successor [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC).

Later, Renault continued to make and sell a hybrid of AMC's [[Rambler American]] and [[Rambler Classic]] called the [[Renault Torino]] in Argentina (sold through IKA-Renault). Renault partnered with AMC on other projects, such as a rotary concept engine in the late 1960s.\n\nIn the late 1960s and 1970s, the company established subsidiaries in [[Eastern Europe]], most notably [[Dacia (car)|Dacia]] in Romania, and [[Industrias Kaiser Argentina|South America]] (many of which remain active) and forged technological cooperation agreements with [[Volvo]] and [[Peugeot]],<ref name=DTI>{{cite journal|date=October 1982|title=Fourth Section: Manufacturer's profile|journal=Transit bus manufacturer profiles|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Transportation, Urban Mass Transportation Administration, Office of Technical Assistance, Office of Bus and Paratransit Systems|location=Washington DC|pages=128\u2013137|oclc=9384438}}</ref> (for instance, for the development of the [[PRV engine|PRV]] [[V6]] engine, which was used in [[Renault 30]], [[Peugeot 604]], and [[Volvo 200 series|Volvo 260]] in the late 1970s).\n\nIn the mid-1960s, Renault Australia was set up in Melbourne. The company produced and assembled models including the R8, R10, R12, R16, sporty R15, R17 coupes, R18, and R20. The unit closed in 1981. Renault Australia also built and marketed Peugeots. From 1977, they assembled [[Ford Cortina]] station wagons under contract \u2013 the loss of this contract ended the factory.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nWhen Peugeot acquired Citro\u00ebn and formed PSA, the group's collaboration with Renault was reduced, although established joint production projects were maintained. Prior its merging with Peugeot, Citro\u00ebn sold to Renault the truck and bus manufacturer [[Berliet]]<ref name=DTI/> in December 1974,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/automobile/paul-berliet-itineraire-d-un-modeste-geant-10-08-2012-1494758_646.php|title=Paul Berliet : itin\u00e9raire d'un modeste g\u00e9ant|trans-title=Paul Berliet: itinerary of a modest giant|last=Chevallier|first=Jacques|work=Le Point|date=21 August 2012|accessdate=21 September 2018}}</ref> merging it with its subsidiary Saviem in 1978 to create [[Renault Trucks|Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels]], which became the only French manufacturer of heavy commercial vehicles.<ref name=TT/><ref name=CBTT/> In 1976, Renault reorganised the company into four business areas: automobiles (for car and [[light commercial vehicles]] or LCVs), finance and services, commercial vehicles (coaches and trucks over 2.5 [[Metric ton|ton]]s [[Gross vehicle weight rating|GVW]]), and minor operations under an industrial enterprises division (farm machinery, plastics, foundry, etc.). In 1980, Renault produced 2,053,677 cars and LCVs. The cars at the time were the Renault 4, 5, 6, 7, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 30; the LCVs were the 4, 5, and 12 Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 and the Estafette. The company added 54,086 buses/coaches and trucks.<ref name=DTI/>\n\nIn North America, Renault partnered with [[American Motors Corporation]] (AMC), lending AMC operating capital and buying a minority 22.5% stake in the company in late 1979. The first Renault model sold through AMC's dealerships was the R5, renamed Renault Le Car. [[Jeep]] was keeping AMC afloat until new products, particularly the [[Jeep XJ|XJ Cherokee]], could be launched. When the bottom fell out of the [[four-wheel drive]] (4\u00d74) truck market in early 1980, AMC was in danger of bankruptcy. To protect its investment, Renault bailed AMC out with cash \u2013 at the price of a controlling 47.5% interest.<ref name=TCAMAIH>{{cite book|last=Cranswick|first=Marc|title=The Cars of American Motors: An Illustrated History|year=2011|publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|isbn=978-0-7864-4672-8|pages=[https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/279 279\u2013295]|chapter=Kenosha Serves Cafe au Lait!|url=https://archive.org/details/carsofamericanmo0000cran/page/279}}</ref> Renault replaced some AMC executives, and Jose J.

Part of AMC's overall strategy was to save manufacturing costs by using Renault parts and engineering expertise when practical. This led to the improvement of the venerable [[AMC Straight-6 engine|AMC inline six]] \u2013 a Renault/Bendix-based port electronic [[fuel injection]] system (usually called [[Renix]]) transformed it into a modern, competitive powerplant with a jump from {{convert|110|to|177|hp|abbr=on}} with less displacement (from 4.2 to 4.0 litres). The XJC Cherokee concept, which was conceived in 1983 as a successor to the XJ series, was also a joint collaboration with AMC and Renault engineers until the design was inherited by the [[Chrysler Corporation]] in late 1987 after Renault divested AMC \u2013 which debuted in 1989 as the Jeep Concept 1 (evolving into the [[Jeep Grand Cherokee]] in April 1992).\n\nThe Renault-AMC marketing effort in passenger cars was not successful compared to the popularity of Jeep vehicles. This was because by the time the Renault range was ready, the [[1979 energy crisis|second energy crisis]] was over, taking with it much of the desire for economical, compact cars. One exception was the [[Renault Alliance]] (an Americanised version of the [[Renault 9]]), which debuted for the 1983 model year. Assembled at AMC's [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]] plant,<ref name=TCAMAIH/> the Alliance received ''[[Motor Trend]]'''s domestic [[Motor Trend Car of the Year|Car of The Year]] award in 1983.<ref name=\"Renault car of the year USA\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/car/car_of_the_year_winners/|title=Car of the Year Winners, 1983 AMC Renault Alliance|magazine=Motor Trend|accessdate=2015-03-08}}</ref> The Alliance's 72% US content allowed it to qualify as a domestic vehicle, making it the first car with a foreign nameplate to win the award. (In 2000, ''Motor Trend'' did away with separate awards for domestic and imported vehicles.) A surprising side effect of the AMC linkup was that Renault felt the effects of the [[Arab League boycott of Israel|Arab League boycott]] of companies doing business with Israel, as AMC built Jeeps there under license.

However, Renault quickly became the target of customer complaints about poor quality and sales plummeted.\n\nEventually, Renault sold AMC to [[Chrysler Corporation|Chrysler]] in 1987 after the assassination of Renault's chairman, [[Georges Besse]].<ref name=\"IDCH\"/> The [[Renault Medallion]] (Renault 21 in Europe) sedan and wagon was sold from 1987 to 1989 through [[Jeep-Eagle]] dealerships. Jeep-Eagle was the division Chrysler created out of the former AMC. Renault imports ended after 1989. A completely new [[Full-size car|full-sized]] 4-door sedan, the [[Eagle Premier]], was developed during the partnership between AMC and Renault. The Premier design, as well as its state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in [[Bramalea, Ontario|Bramalea]], Ontario, Canada, were the starting point for the sleek [[Chrysler LH platform|LH sedans]] such as the [[Eagle Vision]] and [[Chrysler 300M]].\n\nIn early 1979, as part of its attempts to expand into the US market, Renault bought a 20% minority stake in the truck manufacturer [[Mack Trucks]].<ref name=RCICIUSJWE>{{cite book|last=Hart|first=Jeffrey A.|title=Rival Capitalists: International Competitiveness in the United States, Japan, and Western Europe|year=1992|series=Cornell studies in political economy|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]|chapter=France|isbn=0-8014-9949-6|page=[https://archive.org/details/rivalcapitalists00hart_0/page/119 119]|url=https://archive.org/details/rivalcapitalists00hart_0/page/119}}</ref> The aim of this operation was to make use of the company's extensive dealership network to distribute light trucks.<ref name=TMC>{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1990-10-02/business/2778115_1_mack-s-shares-renault-vehicules-industriels-mack-s-stock|title=Renault's Buyout Of Mack Puts Bite Back In The Bulldog|author=Shope, Dan|work=articles.mcall.com|publisher=[[The Morning Call]]|date=2 October 1990|accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref> In 1983, Renault increased its stake in Mack Trucks to 44.6%.<ref name=RCICIUSJWE/><ref name=TMC/> In 1987, it transferred the ownership of a 42% stake to Renault V\u00e9hicules Industriels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1987-05-28/business/2574683_1_renault-vehicules-industriels-rvi-mack-trucks|title=Mack Shares Shifted At Renault|author=Shope, Dan|work=articles.mcall.com|publisher=[[The Morning Call]]|date=28 May 1987|accessdate=1 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the late seventies and early eighties, Renault increased its involvement in motorsport, with novel inventions such as [[turbochargers]] in their [[Formula One]] cars. Renault's Head of Engines, Georges Douin, orchestrated the installation of turbocharged engines across much of the Renault range beginning in 1980. 10% of all turbocharged European cars in 1984 were Renaults.<ref name=\"Car9.84\">{{cite journal|journal=Car|date=September 1984|page=94|title=Power professor|first=Howard|last=Williams|editor-last=Cropley|editor-first=Steve|publisher=FF Publishing|location=London, UK}}</ref> The company's road car designs were revolutionary in other ways also \u2013 the [[Renault Espace]] was one of the first [[minivan]]s and was to remain the most well-known minivan in Europe for the next two decades. The second-generation Renault 5, the European Car of the Year-winning [[Renault 9]], and the most luxurious Renault yet, the aerodynamic [[Renault 25|25]], were all released in the early 1980s. At the same time, poor product quality damaged the brand. The ill-fated [[Renault 14]] may have been the culmination of these problems in the early 1980s.\n\n[[File:Renault Espace 2165cc manufactured 1990 first registered UK November 1995 (lhd).JPG|thumb|right|1985 [[Renault Espace]], the first European multi-purpose vehicle]]\n[[File:Renault Twingo 2005.JPG|[[Renault Twingo]] popularized the city car in Europe from 1992.

However, Renault was losing a billion francs a month totaling \u20a312.5&nbsp;billion in 1984. The government intervened and [[Georges Besse]] was installed as chairman; he set about cutting costs dramatically, selling many of Renault's non-core assets (Volvo stake, [[Gitane]], Eurocar and Renix), withdrawing almost entirely from [[motorsports]], and laying off many employees.<ref name=R1985>{{cite journal |date=2004 |url=http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/digitalfordism/fordism_materials/Donnelly.pdf |last1=Donnelly |first1=Tom |last2=Donnelly |first2=Tim |last3=Morris |first3=David |title=Renault 1985\u20132000: From bankruptcy to profit |issue=30 |series=Working papers (Caen Innovation March\u00e9 Entreprise) |oclc=799704146 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903080634/http://www2.cddc.vt.edu/digitalfordism/fordism_materials/Donnelly.pdf |archivedate=3 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> This halved the deficit by 1986, but Besse was murdered by the communist [[terrorist]] group ''[[Action Directe (terrorist group)|Action Directe]]'' in November 1986. He was replaced by Raymond L\u00e9vy, who continued Besse's initiatives, slimming the company enough that by the end of 1987, Renault was more or less financially stable. However, while Besse was convinced that Renault needed a presence in the North American market and wanted to push forward with restructuring AMC, L\u00e9vy, facing domestic losses from Renault at home, and losses from AMC in the US, along with the political climate that led to Besse's assassination, decided to sell AMC to [[Chrysler]] that same year.\n\nThe [[Renault 9]], a small four-door family saloon, was voted [[European Car of the Year]] on its 1981 launch. It sold well in [[France]], but was eventually eclipsed by its sister vehicle, the [[Renault 11]] hatchback, as the hatchback body style became more popular on this size of the car. The [[Renault 5]] entered its second generation in 1984 and continued to sell well. The long-running [[Renault 18]] was replaced by the [[Renault 21]] early in 1986, adding a seven-seater estate badged as the Nevada or Savanna depending on where it was sold. Renault's top of the range model in the 1980s was the [[Renault 25]], launched at the end of 1983.\n\nIn 1990, Renault strengthened its collaboration with Volvo by signing an agreement that allowed both companies to reduce vehicle conception costs and purchasing expenses. Renault had access to Volvo expertise in upper market segments and in return, Volvo exploited Renault designs for low and medium segments. In 1993, the two companies announced their intention to merge operations by 1 January 1994 and increased their cross-shareholding. The French accepted the merger, while Volvo shareholders rejected it.<ref name=R1985/>\n\nA revitalised Renault launched successful new cars in the early 1990s, accompanied by an improved marketing effort on European markets,<ref name=R1985/> including the 5 replacement, the [[Renault Clio|Clio]] in May 1990.<ref name=\"IDCH\"/> The Clio was the first new model of a generation that replaced numeric identifiers with traditional nameplates. The Clio was voted [[European Car of the Year]] soon after its launch, and was one of Europe's best-selling cars in the 1990s, proving even more popular than its predecessor. Other important launches included the third-generation [[Renault Espace|Espace]] in 1996 and the innovative [[Renault Twingo|Twingo]] in 1992, the first car to be marketed as a city car MPV.

Nucleotides in blue are unmethylated cytosines converted to uracils by bisulfite, while red nucleotides are 5-methylcytosines resistant to conversion.]]\n\n[[File:Bisulfite conversion.svg|thumb|right|300px|Figure 2: Outline of the chemical reaction that underlies the bisulfite-catalyzed conversion of cytosine to uracil.]]\n\n'''Bisulfite'''<ref>Chatterjee A, Stockwell PA, Rodger EJ and Morison IM 2012. Comparison of alignment software for genome-wide bisulphite sequence data. ''Nucleic Acids Research'' 40(10): e79.</ref> '''sequencing '''(also known as '''bisulphite sequencing''') is the use of [[bisulfite]] treatment of [[DNA]] before routine [[DNA sequencing|sequencing]] to determine the pattern of [[methylation]]. [[DNA methylation]] was the first discovered [[epigenetic]] mark, and remains the most studied. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a [[methyl group]] to the carbon-5 position of [[cytosine]] residues of the dinucleotide [[CpG island|CpG]], and is implicated in repression of [[Transactivation|transcriptional activity]].\n\nTreatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to [[uracil]], but leaves [[5-methylcytosine]] residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA that has been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines. Thus, bisulfite treatment introduces specific changes in the [[DNA sequence]] that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information.  The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (cytosines and [[thymidine]]) resulting from bisulfite conversion (Figure 1).\n\n== Methods ==\nBisulfite sequencing applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides.  Other non-sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a [[genome]]-wide level.  All strategies assume that bisulfite-induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete, and this serves as the basis of all subsequent techniques.  Ideally, the method used would determine the methylation status separately for each [[allele]].  Alternative methods to bisulfite sequencing include [[Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis|Combined Bisulphite Restriction Analysis]] and [[methylated DNA immunoprecipitation]] (MeDIP).\n\nMethodologies to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA are continuously being developed.  To summarize these rapidly evolving methodologies, numerous review articles have been written.<ref name=Fraga02>{{cite journal | vauthors = Fraga MF, Esteller M | title = DNA methylation: a profile of methods and applications | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 33 | issue = 3 | pages = 632, 634, 636\u201349 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12238773 | doi = 10.2144/02333rv01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book | vauthors = El-Maarri O | chapter = Methods: DNA methylation | volume = 544 | pages = 197\u2013204 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14713229 | doi = 10.1007/978-1-4419-9072-3_23 | isbn = 978-0-306-48174-1 | series = Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology | title = Peroxisomal Disorders and Regulation of Genes }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Laird PW | title = The power and the promise of DNA methylation markers | journal = Nature Reviews.

Microarray-based methods use PCR based on non-methylation-specific conditions also.\n\n=== Non-methylation-specific PCR based methods ===\n[[Image:Wiki Bisulfite sequencing Figure 2 small.png|thumb|450px|Figure 3: DNA methylation analysis methods not based on methylation-specific PCR.

Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR.  All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as [[thymine]]s in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as [[adenine]]s in the amplified [[antisense]] strand.  By incorporating high throughput sequencing adaptors into the PCR primers, PCR products can be sequenced with massively parallel sequencing. Alternatively, and labour-intensively, PCR product can be cloned and sequenced. [[Nested PCR]] methods can be used to enhance the product for [[sequencing]].\n\nAll subsequent DNA methylation analysis techniques using bisulfite-treated DNA is based on this report by Frommer et al.

The main limitation of this method is the cost of the technology.  However, Pyrosequencing does well allow for extension to [[high-throughput screening]] methods.\n\nA further improvement to this technique was recently described by Wong et al., which uses allele-specific primers that incorporate [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s into the sequence of the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal [[allele]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong HL, Byun HM, Kwan JM, Campan M, Ingles SA, Laird PW, Yang AS | title = Rapid and quantitative method of allele-specific DNA methylation analysis | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 734\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17191619 | doi = 10.2144/000112305 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/article/000112305 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This technique is of particular usefulness for [[genomic imprinting]] analysis.\n\n==== Methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA) ====\n\nThis method is based on the [[single-strand conformation polymorphism]] analysis (SSCA) method developed for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bianco T, Hussey D, Dobrovic A | title = Methylation-sensitive, single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA): A rapid method to screen for and analyze methylation | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 289\u201393 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10502775 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1004(199910)14:4<289::AID-HUMU3>3.0.CO;2-A }}</ref> SSCA differentiates between single-stranded DNA fragments of identical size but distinct sequence based on differential migration in non-denaturating [[electrophoresis]].

As [[RNase A]] cleaves [[RNA]] specifically at cytosine and uracil [[ribonucleotides]], base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant [[dTTP]] when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired.  The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by [[MALDI-TOF]].  Bisulfite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand.  C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated [[CpG site]]s.  By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of [[CpG site]]s within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole.

This method is particularly useful to interrogate [[CpG islands]] with possibly high methylation density, as increased numbers of CpG pairs in the primer increase the specificity of the assay.  Placing the CpG pair at the 3'-end of the primer also improves the sensitivity.  The initial report using MSP described sufficient sensitivity to detect methylation of 0.1% of [[allele]]s.

The development of Tet-assisted bisulfite sequencing by [[Chuan He]] at the University of Chicago is now able to distinguish between the two modifications at single base resolution.<ref>Yu, M., Hon, G.

If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in [[false positive]] results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical.<ref name=Fraga02/> It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion. Embedding the DNA in [[agarose]] gel has been reported to improve the rate of conversion by keeping strands of DNA physically separate.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Olek A, Oswald J, Walter J | title = A modified and improved method for bisulphite based cytosine methylation analysis | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 24 | issue = 24 | pages = 5064\u20136 | date = December 1996 | pmid = 9016686 | pmc = 146326 | doi = 10.1093/nar/24.24.5064 }}</ref>\n\n=== Degradation of DNA during bisulfite treatment ===\n\nA major challenge in bisulfite sequencing is the degradation of DNA that takes place concurrently with the conversion.

Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired [[amplicon]]. Techniques can also be used to minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature.<ref name=\"Ehrich2007\"/>\n\n=== Other concerns ===\n\nA potentially significant problem following bisulfite treatment is incomplete [[sulfonic acid|desulfonation]] of [[pyrimidine]] residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution. This may inhibit some [[DNA polymerases]], rendering subsequent PCR difficult. However, this situation can be avoided by monitoring the [[pH]] of the solution to ensure that desulfonation will be complete.<ref name=Fraga02/>\n\nA final concern is that bisulfite treatment greatly reduces the level of complexity in the sample, which can be problematic if multiple PCR reactions are to be performed (2006).<ref name=\"Callinan2006\"/> [[Primer (molecular biology)|Primer]] design is more difficult, and inappropriate cross-hybridization is more frequent.\n\n== Applications: genome-wide methylation analysis ==\n\nThe advances in bisulfite sequencing have led to the possibility of applying them at a [[genome]]-wide scale, where, previously, global measure of DNA methylation was feasible only using other techniques, such as [[Restriction landmark genomic scanning]].

It is believed that failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many [[cancers]].

[[DNA methylation]] was the first discovered [[epigenetic]] mark, and remains the most studied. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a [[methyl group]] to the carbon-5 position of [[cytosine]] residues of the dinucleotide [[CpG island|CpG]], and is implicated in repression of [[Transactivation|transcriptional activity]].\n\nTreatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to [[uracil]], but leaves [[5-methylcytosine]] residues unaffected. Therefore, DNA that has been treated with bisulfite retains only methylated cytosines. Thus, bisulfite treatment introduces specific changes in the [[DNA sequence]] that depend on the methylation status of individual cytosine residues, yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA. Various analyses can be performed on the altered sequence to retrieve this information.  The objective of this analysis is therefore reduced to differentiating between [[single nucleotide polymorphisms]] (cytosines and [[thymidine]]) resulting from bisulfite conversion (Figure 1).\n\n== Methods ==\nBisulfite sequencing applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides.  Other non-sequencing strategies are also employed to interrogate the methylation at specific loci or at a [[genome]]-wide level.  All strategies assume that bisulfite-induced conversion of unmethylated cytosines to uracil is complete, and this serves as the basis of all subsequent techniques.  Ideally, the method used would determine the methylation status separately for each [[allele]].  Alternative methods to bisulfite sequencing include [[Combined Bisulfite Restriction Analysis|Combined Bisulphite Restriction Analysis]] and [[methylated DNA immunoprecipitation]] (MeDIP).\n\nMethodologies to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA are continuously being developed.

Therefore, it will amplify both methylated and unmethylated sequences, in contrast to methylation-specific PCR.  All sites of unmethylated cytosines are displayed as [[thymine]]s in the resulting amplified sequence of the sense strand, and as [[adenine]]s in the amplified [[antisense]] strand.  By incorporating high throughput sequencing adaptors into the PCR primers, PCR products can be sequenced with massively parallel sequencing. Alternatively, and labour-intensively, PCR product can be cloned and sequenced. [[Nested PCR]] methods can be used to enhance the product for [[sequencing]].\n\nAll subsequent DNA methylation analysis techniques using bisulfite-treated DNA is based on this report by Frommer et al. (Figure 2).<ref name=\"Frommer\" /> Although most other modalities are not true sequencing-based techniques, the term \"bisulfite sequencing\" is often used to describe bisulfite-conversion DNA methylation analysis techniques in general.\n\n====Pyrosequencing====\n[[Pyrosequencing]] has also been used to analyze bisulfite-treated DNA without using methylation-specific PCR.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Colella S, Shen L, Baggerly KA, Issa JP, Krahe R | title = Sensitive and quantitative universal Pyrosequencing methylation analysis of CpG sites | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 146\u201350 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12866414 | doi = 10.2144/03351md01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Tost J, Dunker J, Gut IG | title = Analysis and quantification of multiple methylation variable positions in CpG islands by Pyrosequencing | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 35 | issue = 1 | pages = 152\u20136 | date = July 2003 | pmid = 12866415 | doi = 10.2144/03351md02 }}</ref>  Following PCR amplification of the region of interest, pyrosequencing is used to determine the bisulfite-converted sequence of specific [[CpG site]]s in the region.  The ratio of C-to-T at individual sites can be determined quantitatively based on the amount of C and T incorporation during the sequence extension.  The main limitation of this method is the cost of the technology.  However, Pyrosequencing does well allow for extension to [[high-throughput screening]] methods.\n\nA further improvement to this technique was recently described by Wong et al., which uses allele-specific primers that incorporate [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]]s into the sequence of the sequencing primer, thus allowing for separate analysis of maternal and paternal [[allele]]s.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wong HL, Byun HM, Kwan JM, Campan M, Ingles SA, Laird PW, Yang AS | title = Rapid and quantitative method of allele-specific DNA methylation analysis | journal = BioTechniques | volume = 41 | issue = 6 | pages = 734\u20139 | date = December 2006 | pmid = 17191619 | doi = 10.2144/000112305 | url = http://www.biotechniques.com/article/000112305 }}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> This technique is of particular usefulness for [[genomic imprinting]] analysis.\n\n==== Methylation-sensitive single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA) ====\n\nThis method is based on the [[single-strand conformation polymorphism]] analysis (SSCA) method developed for [[single-nucleotide polymorphism]] (SNP) analysis.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Bianco T, Hussey D, Dobrovic A | title = Methylation-sensitive, single-strand conformation analysis (MS-SSCA): A rapid method to screen for and analyze methylation | journal = Human Mutation | volume = 14 | issue = 4 | pages = 289\u201393 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10502775 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1098-1004(199910)14:4<289::AID-HUMU3>3.0.CO;2-A }}</ref> SSCA differentiates between single-stranded DNA fragments of identical size but distinct sequence based on differential migration in non-denaturating [[electrophoresis]].  In MS-SSCA, this is used to distinguish between bisulfite-treated, PCR-amplified regions containing the CpG sites of interest.  Although SSCA lacks sensitivity when only a single [[nucleotide]] difference is present, bisulfite treatment frequently makes a number of C-to-T conversions in most regions of interest, and the resulting sensitivity approaches 100%.  MS-SSCA also provides semi-quantitative analysis of the degree of DNA methylation based on the ratio of band intensities.  However, this method is designed to assess all [[CpG site]]s as a whole in the region of interest rather than individual methylation sites.\n\n==== High resolution melting analysis (HRM) ====\n\nA further method to differentiate converted from unconverted bisulfite-treated DNA is using high-resolution melting analysis (HRM), a [[quantitative PCR]]-based technique initially designed to distinguish SNPs.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Wojdacz TK, Dobrovic A | title = Methylation-sensitive high resolution melting (MS-HRM): a new approach for sensitive and high-throughput assessment of methylation | journal = Nucleic Acids Research | volume = 35 | issue = 6 | pages = e41 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17289753 | pmc = 1874596 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkm013 }}</ref>  The PCR [[amplicons]] are analyzed directly by temperature ramping and resulting liberation of an intercalating [[fluorescent dye]] during melting.

As [[RNase A]] cleaves [[RNA]] specifically at cytosine and uracil [[ribonucleotides]], base-specificity is achieved by adding incorporating cleavage-resistant [[dTTP]] when cytosine-specific (C-specific) cleavage is desired, and incorporating dCTP when uracil-specific (U-specific) cleavage is desired.  The cleaved fragments can then be analyzed by [[MALDI-TOF]].  Bisulfite treatment results in either introduction/removal of cleavage sites by C-to-U conversions or shift in fragment mass by G-to-A conversions in the amplified reverse strand.  C-specific cleavage will cut specifically at all methylated [[CpG site]]s.  By analyzing the sizes of the resulting fragments, it is possible to determine the specific pattern of DNA methylation of [[CpG site]]s within the region, rather than determining the extent of methylation of the region as a whole.  This method demonstrated efficacy for [[high-throughput screening]], allowing for interrogation of numerous [[CpG site]]s in multiple tissues in a cost-efficient manner.\n\n=== Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) ===\n[[Image:Wiki Bisulfite sequencing Figure 3 small.png|thumb|400px|Figure 4: Methylation-specific PCR is a sensitive method to discriminately amplify and detect a methylated region of interest using methylated-specific primers on bisulfite-converted genomic DNA.

This method is particularly useful to interrogate [[CpG islands]] with possibly high methylation density, as increased numbers of CpG pairs in the primer increase the specificity of the assay.  Placing the CpG pair at the 3'-end of the primer also improves the sensitivity.  The initial report using MSP described sufficient sensitivity to detect methylation of 0.1% of [[allele]]s.

If conversion is incomplete, the subsequent analysis will incorrectly interpret the unconverted unmethylated cytosines as methylated cytosines, resulting in [[false positive]] results for methylation. Only cytosines in single-stranded DNA are susceptible to attack by bisulfite, therefore [[Denaturation (biochemistry)|denaturation]] of the DNA undergoing analysis is critical.<ref name=Fraga02/> It is important to ensure that reaction parameters such as temperature and salt concentration are suitable to maintain the DNA in a single-stranded conformation and allow for complete conversion.

This could lead to the failure of the PCR amplification, or the loss of quantitatively accurate information on methylation levels resulting from the limited [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]] of template molecules. Thus, it is important to assess the amount of DNA degradation resulting from the reaction conditions employed, and consider how this will affect the desired [[amplicon]]. Techniques can also be used to minimize DNA degradation, such as cycling the incubation temperature.<ref name=\"Ehrich2007\"/>\n\n=== Other concerns ===\n\nA potentially significant problem following bisulfite treatment is incomplete [[sulfonic acid|desulfonation]] of [[pyrimidine]] residues due to inadequate alkalization of the solution.

It is believed that failures to produce cloned animals with normal viability and lifespan result from inappropriate patterns of epigenetic marks. Also, aberrant methylation patterns are well characterized in many [[cancers]]. Global hypomethylation results in decreased genomic stability, while local hypermethylation of [[tumour suppressor gene]] [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]] often accounts for their [[loss of function]]. Specific patterns of methylation are indicative of specific cancer types, have [[prognosis|prognostic]] value, and can help to guide the best course of treatment.<ref name=\"Bradbury2003\"/>\n\nLarge-scale epigenome mapping efforts are under way around the world and have been organized under the [[Human Epigenome Project]].<ref name=\"Jones2005\"/> This is based on a multi-tiered strategy, whereby bisulfite sequencing is used to obtain high-resolution methylation profiles for a limited number of reference epigenomes, while less thorough analysis is performed on a wider spectrum of samples. This approach is intended to maximize the insight gained from a given amount of resources, as high-resolution genome-wide mapping remains a costly undertaking.\n\nGene-set analysis (for example using tools like DAVID and GoSeq) has been shown to be severely biased when applied to high-throughput methylation data (e.g. genome-wide bisulfite sequencing); it has been suggested that this can be corrected using sample label permutations or using a statistical model to control for differences in the numberes of CpG probes / CpG sites that target each gene.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Geeleher P, Hartnett L, Egan LJ, Golden A, Raja Ali RA, Seoighe C | title = Gene-set analysis is severely biased when applied to genome-wide methylation data | journal = Bioinformatics | volume = 29 | issue = 15 | pages = 1851\u20137 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23732277 | doi = 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt311 }}</ref>\n\n==Oxidative bisulfite sequencing==\n5-Methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine both read as a C in bisulfite sequencing.<ref name=\":0\" /> Oxidative bisulfite sequencing is a method to discriminate between 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single base resolution. The method employs a specific chemical oxidation of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine to 5-formylcytosine, which subsequently converts to uracil during bisulfite treatment.<ref>Booth MJ, Branco MR, Ficz G, Oxley D, Krueger F, Reik W, et al. quantitative sequencing of 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine at single-base resolution. Science. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22539555 2012;336(6083):934-7].</ref> The only base that then reads as a C is 5\u2011methylcytosine, giving a map of the true methylation status in the DNA sample. Levels of 5\u2011hydroxymethylcytosine can also be quantified by measuring the difference between bisulfite and oxidative bisulfite sequencing.\n\n== See also ==\n* [https://www.scribd.com/document/91917230/Bisulfite-conversion-and-MSP-Protocol Bisulfite conversion Protocol]\n* [[Reduced representation bisulfite sequencing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [https://www.scribd.com/doc/91917230/Bisulfite-conversion-and-MSP-Protocol Bisulfite conversion protocol]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070124172616/http://www.sanger.ac.uk/PostGenomics/epigenome/ Human Epigenome Project (HEP) - Data] &mdash; by the Sanger Institute\n* [http://www.epigenome-noe.net/index.php/ The Epigenome Network of Excellence]\n\n{{Portal bar|Biology}}\n\n[[Category:Molecular biology]]\n[[Category:Epigenetics]]\n[[Category:Genomics]]\n", "name_user": "Newystats", "label": "safe", "comment": "Replace deleted link in ref to Susan J.
