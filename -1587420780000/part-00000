Surveys of the area approximate around 71 islands and additional mangrove stands in shallow off-shore areas, although locals count 99 islands.<ref>Venegas, Rub\u00e9n, and Lucia Morales 2009 Final Report: Assessment and Mapping of Underwater and Land Habitats of Pulau Banyak, Aceh, Singkil.

Two other major islands located either side of Tuangku are [[Bangkaru]] and [[Ujung Batu]]. Tuangku is separated from Bangkaru by a fault line.\n\n==Geography==\n\nWith an area of 118 square miles (305.7 square km), the group lies north of Nias and 18 miles (29&nbsp;km) west of Sumatra in the [[Indian Ocean]]. The islands have long been noted for the existence of substantial offshore coral reefs, though problems with overharvesting, damage from explosives, and recent geological disturbances have threatened these underwater resources.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://dte.gn.apc.org/45CRC.htm |journal=Down to Earth |date=2000-05-01 |accessdate=2009-12-16 |title=Coastal resources in crisis |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602192039/http://dte.gn.apc.org/45CRC.htm |archivedate=2010-06-02 |df= }}</ref>\n\nThe islands vary in their land cover; most are sandy with limited vegetation, while the larger islands have deep rainforests and are fringed by intertidal mangroves. The Pulau Banyak area contains many varieties of stony Heliopora and branching Acropora types of coral.<ref>Venegas and Morales (2009) Final Report: Assessment and Mapping of Underwater and Land Habitats of Pulau Banyak, Aceh, Singkil. Medan: Yayasan Pulau Banyak, Fundacion Keto</ref> However, [[crown-of-thorns starfish]] are a significant problem. The fringing coral reefs are habitat to diverse species, including green and leatherback sea turtles, pelagic and coral fish, and varieties of octopus, lobster, and other sea life. The weather is tropical; August to January are the rainy season, followed by a dry season from approximately February to July.\n\nThe island group had a population of 6,570 persons at the 2010 Census. The majority of the population resides in villages on the islands of Tuangku, Pulau Baguk and Pulau Balai.<ref name=\"acehsingkilkab.bps.go.id\">Statistik Daerah Kecamatan Pulau Banyak 2015 https://acehsingkilkab.bps.go.id/Publikasi/view/id/76 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828174317/https://acehsingkilkab.bps.go.id/Publikasi/view/id/76 |date=2016-08-28 }}</ref><ref name=\"Biro Pusat Statistik 2011\">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> Most of the dozens of small islands in the area have no permanent homes but are used instead for gardening and leisure, with small pondoks and bungalows constructed for temporary visits The population is spread throughout the islands, but divided administratively into villages (listed below with their populations at the 2010 Census):<ref name=\"acehsingkilkab.bps.go.id\"/><ref name=\"Biro Pusat Statistik 2011\"/>\n\n'''Pulau Banyak District Villages'''\n* Pulau Baguk (Baguk Island) (1,358)\n* Pulau Balai (Balai Island) (1,608)\n* Teluk Nibung (Nibung Bay) (950)\n\n'''Pulau Banyak Barat District Villages'''\n* Asantola (562)\n* Ujung Sialit (Point Sialit) (1,093)\n* Haloban (830)\n* Suka Makmur (169)\n\n==Administrative Districts==\nThe Banyak Islands lie within the [[Aceh Singkil Regency]] in [[Aceh]] Province, and are divided into two districts (''kecamatan''): Banjak Islands District (''Kecamatan Pulau Banyak'') and Western Banjak Islands District (''Kecamatan Pulau Banyak Barat'').<ref>aceh.bps.go.id</ref> The latter district was separated from the former district subsequent to the 2010 Census. Pulau Balai is the seat of the Pulau Banyak District, whose present area had 3,916 inhabitants at the 2010 Census, and Haloban is the seat of the Pulau Banyak Barat District, whose present area had 2,654 inhabitants in 2010.\n\n==Earthquakes and tsunamis==\n\nThe island group was significantly affected by the deadly [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and subsequent tsunami. The quake's [[epicenter]] was located only a few hundred kilometres north of the island group. Along with Simeulue and Nias, the Banyak Islands absorbed the shock waves and shielded a lot of damage from the [[Mentawai Islands]]. The eastern islands were affected the most due to the poor construction of buildings, as many structures contained timber instead of concrete. As many as 300 residents of the island group died as a result of the tsunami.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.asianews.it/index.php?l=en&art=2897|journal=Asia News|title=Hundreds of quake victims on Banyak Islands|date=2005-03-30|accessdate=2009-12-16}}</ref>\n\nOccurring just three months later, the [[2005 Nias\u2013Simeulue earthquake]] was located slightly east of Bangkaru, which was the closest island to the epicenter. The island was hit by a second tsunami that caused additional flooding and damage to structures. The level of the islands also dropped by as much as a meter in places, plunging coastal areas underwater and making them permanently uninhabitable. There were no reported deaths, but over 3,000 people were reportedly displaced from their homes.<ref>WHO Situation Report 7 http://www.who.int/hac/crises/idn/sitreps/2005/earthquake_07/en/</ref> Due to the split between Tuangku and Bangkaru, the earthquake caused Bangkaru to rise and Tuangku to drop.

The series ran from September 3, 2010 to September 14, 2013 on [[YTV (TV channel)|YTV]]. The series is based on the original shorts originally titled '''''The Not-So-Superheroic Adventures of Sidekick''''' aired as part of the 2005 TV series, ''Funpak''.\n\n==Plot==\nThe series is about an orphan boy named Eric, with his best friend Trevor and his two female friends, Vana and Kitty, who are training to become sidekicks at the Academy for Aspiring Sidekicks in the Canadian city of Splittsboro (based on [[Scarborough, Toronto]]). While dealing with intense sidekick training, Eric must also contend with his strict guardian Maxum Brain, his grumpy teacher Professor Pamplemoose, the evil Master XOX and keeping secret the disappearance of his superhero mentor Maxum Man from the city.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n* '''Eric Needles''' (voiced by [[Miklos Perlus]]) - Eric is an [[English Canadian]] boy who was adopted as the sidekick to Maxum Man, the greatest superhero of all time (before he disappeared). He also has a huge crush on Vana, but he later seems to be more infatuated with Mandy Struction. He grew up in an [[orphanage]] because he has no known parents, although in the Funpak short: The Evil Trevor, Eric says that he once had a dad who spit on his face all the time, until he died. He was adopted by Maxum Brain. Eric always wears a T-shirt with a skull on it (hinting at [[Grojband|What Todd Kaufman was going to create after sidekick ended production]]). He and Trevor always get into trouble and they don't have common sense. He and his friends are often forced to clean up the messes they caused. In the Funpak shorts, he was voiced by [[Peter Oldring]]. With Maxum Man missing, Eric must do all his heroic duties to ensure the public is safe and thinks he still on the job but unfortunately, he has no powers nor hero experience to fight the villainous threats Maxum Man faces. Luckily, he has friends to help him out and gives him good and solid advice on how to handle these kind of situations.\n* '''Trevor Troublemeyer''' (voiced by [[Christian Potenza]]) - Eric's best [[French Canadian]] friend and partner-in-shenanigans, Trevor always ropes Eric into all sorts of hijinks. His father is Master XOX but he, and the others are all completely unaware of this. Like Eric, he knows (to quote the intro) ''Maxum Man is missing'' and helps him keep it secret from the public or risk mass panic if they ever find out.\n* '''Kitty Ko''' (voiced by [[Denise Oliver]]) - Kitty is a [[Chinese Canadian]]<ref>https://neptoonstudios.tumblr.com/post/76180276490/is-kitty-ko-from-sidekick-a-korean-girl-or-a</ref> girl who, despite being a bit strange, gives the rest of the group advice, and is somewhat a good hacker and fixer. She has a huge crush on Eric and has a bit of a stalker-like obsession towards him. She literally has two left feet as revealed in \"Trip Van Twinkle Toes\". In the Funpak shorts, she was voiced by [[Sugar Lyn Beard|Stephanie Beard]]. Unlike Eric and Trevor, she is unaware that Maxum Man is missing and is shocked and terrified at the thought of it.\n* '''Vana Glama''' (voiced by [[Stephanie Anne Mills]]) - Vana is a hyper-ambitious [[Portuguese Canadian]] prima donna who is not easily impressed and is extremely shallow. She often tortures Eric and hates him for no apparent reason. Despite this, Eric has a huge crush on her, often oblivious to her selfish, snobby, and more-often-than-not sour-hearted character. In the Funpak shorts, she was also voiced by [[Sugar Lyn Beard|Stephanie Beard]]. Like Kitty, she is also unaware Maxum Man is missing and also shocked and terrified at the thought of it.\n* '''Maxum Brain''' (voiced by [[Tony Daniels]]) - Eric's guardian due to the fact that Maxum Man is missing. He is a computer with lots of gadgets and acted as Maxum Man's assistant before his disappearance. He is strict about following rules, keeping the mansion clean and speaks with an East Indian accent.\n* '''Maxum Man''' (voiced by [[Ron Pardo]]) - Eric's favorite superhero, before Eric became his current sidekick, with [[Superman]]-like powers. After he went missing, Eric and Maxum Brain do everything for him to make it seem like he never left. It seems that Maxum Man always makes his own enemies purely by accident.\n\n===Recurring characters===\n* '''Martin Troublemeyer''' (a.k.a. '''Master XOX''') - Trevor's dad. All he wants is what is best for Trevor and for him to be a good boy, which is why Trevor can't stand him. He tries to stay calm because of his short temper. The only time Trevor likes him is when he gets angry. However, when Trevor is not looking, his dad becomes the super villain known as Master XOX. When he is Mr. Troublemeyer, he is voiced by [[Scott McCord]] and when he is Master XOX, he is voiced by [[Ron Rubin (voice actor)|Ron Rubin]]. He is the main antagonist of the series and he is also Maxum Man's arch nemesis.\n* '''Professor Pamplemoose''' - The cruel Headmaster at the Sidekick Academy and Eric's grumpy teacher, Pampelmoose is a strict disciplinarian who runs the school like it was prison camp. He has devoted his life to turning worthless students into worthless Sidekicks. He is voiced by [[Patrick McKenna]]. In the Funpak shorts, he was voiced by [[Alex Nussbaum]].\n* '''Golly Gee Kid''' - Golly Gee Kid was Maxum Man's sidekick in the old days, often seen in Maxum Man's Sidekick Academy training films. While a sidekick, it seemed that his primary job was to perform chores around the mansion. He is now the school's janitor. He is voiced by [[Ron Pederson]].\n* '''Mandy Struction''' - A [[Italian Canadian|Italian]]-[[Iranian Canadian]] student at the henchman school and Eric's new crush. She has seismic boots that can cause tremors in the floor whenever she stomps down. She is much taller than the other kids, suggesting she might be older than them. She also has a crush on Eric, which is why Kitty (used to) hate her. She appeared in the episodes \"Match Dot Com\", \"Henchman for a Day\", \"Mandy-O and Eric-Et\", \"Oh Trevor, Where Art Thou?\" and \"Walter Ego Presents: Vapo House\". She is voiced by [[Stacey DePass]].\n* '''Allan Amazing''' - Allan is a handsome [[Hispanic Canadian]] student who is popular with the female students. Although he acts nice and sensible, he has an immense hatred for Eric and is a narcissist who will do anything to best anyone, especially Eric.  He is voiced by [[Scott McCord]].\n* '''Kid Ruthless''' - A big tough student who seems to be a bully, as he tortures Eric for stealing his Sidekick Identity Name. He was popular with the students for his music. He was nice to Eric after the latter defeated him in a DJ Battle. He appeared in the episodes \"Identity Crisis\" and \"Drop The Needles\".\n* '''Mayor Swifty''' (a.k.a. '''Mayor Swift''') - The Senior Mayor of Splittsboro, all he wants to do is to see Maxum Man, which happened once in \"Ain't No Party Like a Maxum Brain Party\". He also has a hatred for a fired Super Hero, Static Clint, as shown in \"The Spark is Gone\". Swifty also appeared in the episode \"The Maxum Switcheroo\".\n* '''Madam Needles''' (a.k.a. '''Maxum Mom''') - Maxum Man's Mother, who has an intense dislike for Master XOX. She is tough like her son, and has visited and cared for Eric a couple of times in the Maxum Mansion. She has appeared in the episodes \"Maxum Mom\", \"Shopping Spree\", \"Family Fun Day\" and Eric posed as her in the episode \"The Maxum Switcheroo\" to expose the fake Maxum Man.\n* '''Melvin Needles''' (a.k.a. '''Maxum Mel''') - Maxum Man's older brother. He is tough like his brother and visited the Maxum Mansion one time. He has a sidekick named Mouse Boy.\n* '''Joshua Sideburns''' - A movie star with whom Kitty is obsessed. He visits Splittsboro to act in upcoming movies. He appeared in the episodes \"Comic Book Zombies\", \"Teenage Mummies in Love\" and \"Maxum Method\".\n* '''Opossum Man''' - Another Superhero in Splittsboro who is a parody of [[Batman]] and always wants to make crime and criminals play dead like real opossums do. He also has a sidekick named Boy Vermin. He appears in \"Opposum Man\".\n* '''Boy Vermin''' - Eric's old friend from the orphanage and Opossum Man's sidekick dressed as a rodent who is a parody of [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] and he always assists Opossum Man.

A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Whilst profitable, the film is the 4th lowest-grossing in the series and its relatively modest returns by comparison with those of ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy.<ref name=Aldis-2020>{{cite web |last=Aldis |first=Ben |date=21 March 2020 |title=The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies |url=https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]] with [[solar power]]. At a hint from M, Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.\n\nAfter retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in [[Beirut]] and tracking its manufacturer to [[Macau]], Bond forces the gun maker to show him how he delivers the bullets. Seeing Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a [[casino]]. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next [[contract killing|hit]], Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's [[dwarfism|dwarf]] henchman Nick Nack steals the \"Solex agitator\", a key component of a [[Power station#Solar|solar power station]]. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond then travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, meets with Fat and is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured when he returns for dinner and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat with his golden gun and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.\n\nAnders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a [[Muay Thai]] venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders sitting up straight on the bleachers, but dead from a bullet to the heart. Scaramanga himself then arrives at the match and introduces himself to Bond. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, Scaramanga traps her in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper]], the lawman Bond encountered in [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and let Die]] seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador]] transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.\n\nPicking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters and lands at [[Ko Tapu|Scaramanga's island]]. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.\n\nScaramanga then proposes a pistol [[duel]] with Bond on the beach; Bond with his Walther and him with his single-shot golden gun. As he says, he only needs one shot. The two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of the mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent who receives a golden bullet, supposedly from Scaramanga, indicating that he is a target of Scaramanga. \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Francisco Scaramanga#Film biography|Francisco Scaramanga]]: The main villain and assassin who is identified by his use of a golden gun; he also has a 'superfluous papilla', or [[supernumerary nipple]].

A loose adaptation of [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[The Man with the Golden Gun (novel)|novel of the same name]], the film has Bond sent after the Solex Agitator, a device that can harness the power of the sun, while facing the assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], the \"Man with the Golden Gun\". The action culminates in a duel between them that settles the fate of the Solex.\n\n''The Man with the Golden Gun'' was the fourth and final film in the series directed by [[Guy Hamilton]]. The script was written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Tom Mankiewicz]]. The film was set in the face of the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], a dominant theme in the script. Britain had still not yet fully overcome the crisis when the film was released in December 1974. The film also reflects the then-popular [[martial arts film]] craze, with several [[kung fu]] scenes and a predominantly Asian location, being set and shot in [[Thailand]], [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Part of the film is also set in [[Beirut]], [[Lebanon]], but it was not shot there.\n\nThe film was met with mixed reviews, and some critics described it as the lowest point in the canon up to that time. [[Christopher Lee]]'s portrayal of Scaramanga as a villain of similar skill and ability to Bond was generally praised, but reviewers criticised the film as a whole, particularly its comedic approach and the performances of Moore and [[Britt Ekland]]. Whilst profitable, the film is the 4th lowest-grossing in the series and it's relatively modest returns by comparison with those of ''[[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and Let Die]]'' (1973) reportedly placed the continuation of the franchise in jeopardy.<ref name=Aldis-2020>{{cite web |last=Aldis |first=Ben |date=21 March 2020 |title=The Man With The Golden Gun Almost Ended James Bond Movies |url=https://screenrant.com/james-bond-movies-man-golden-gun-bad/ |website=Screen Rant |access-date=23 March 2020}}</ref> It was the last Bond film to be co-produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], with Saltzman selling his 50% stake in [[Danjaq, LLC]], the parent company of Eon Productions, after the release of the film.\n\n==Plot==\nIn London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code \"007\" etched into its surface is received by [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]]. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin [[Francisco Scaramanga]], who uses a golden gun, to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, [[M (James Bond)|M]] relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the [[1973 energy crisis|energy crisis]] with [[solar power]]. At a hint from M, Bond sets out unofficially to locate Scaramanga.\n\nAfter retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in [[Beirut]] and tracking its manufacturer to [[Macau]], Bond forces the gun maker to show him how he delivers the bullets. Seeing Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a [[casino]]. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her [[The Peninsula Hong Kong|Peninsula Hotel]] room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the [[Bottoms Up Club]]. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next [[contract killing|hit]], Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's [[dwarfism|dwarf]] henchman Nick Nack steals the \"Solex agitator\", a key component of a [[Power station#Solar|solar power station]]. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}} in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.\n\nBond then travels to [[Bangkok]] to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Thai entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, meets with Fat and is invited to dinner, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured when he returns for dinner and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat with his golden gun and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.\n\nAnders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a [[Muay Thai]] venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders sitting up straight on the bleachers, but dead from a bullet to the heart. Scaramanga himself then arrives at the match and introduces himself to Bond. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a [[homing device]] on Scaramanga's car, Scaramanga traps her in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an [[AMC Hornet]] from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing [[Sheriff J.W. Pepper]], the lawman Bond encountered in [[Live and Let Die (film)|Live and let Die]] seated within it. Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's [[AMC Matador]] transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.\n\nPicking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into [[People's Republic of China|Red Chinese]] waters and lands at [[Ko Tapu|Scaramanga's island]]. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.\n\nScaramanga then proposes a pistol [[duel]] with Bond on the beach; Bond with his Walther and him with his single-shot golden gun. As he says, he only needs one shot. The two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of the mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's [[Junk (ship)|Chinese junk]]. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Roger Moore]] as [[James Bond filmography|James Bond]]: An MI6 agent who receives a golden bullet, supposedly from Scaramanga, indicating that he is a target of Scaramanga. \n* [[Christopher Lee]] as [[Francisco Scaramanga#Film biography|Francisco Scaramanga]]: The main villain and assassin who is identified by his use of a golden gun; he also has a 'superfluous papilla', or [[supernumerary nipple]].

In addressing the topic, A. J. Dessler commented that any increased energy received in Earth's [[troposphere]] due to increased solar activity is negligible, and that correlations alone do not establish causation. The challenges facing scientists with complex systems like the planet's weather require finding a coupling mechanism.

The main town and administrative centre is [[Bandanaira]], located on the island of the same name. They rise out of {{convert|4|to|6|km|adj=on}} deep ocean and have a total land area of approximately {{convert|172|km2}}. They had a population of 18,934 at the 2015 Census.<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> Until the mid-19th century the Banda Islands were the world's only source of the spices [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], produced from the nutmeg tree. The islands are also popular destinations for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-European history===\nThe first documented human presence in the Banda Islands comes from a rockshelter site on Pulau Ay that was in use at least 8,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lape|first1=Peter|title=Die erste Besiedlung auf den Banda-Inseln: 8000 Jahre Arch\u00e4ologie auf den Molukken (The first settlement in the Banda Islands: 8000 years of archeology in the Moluccas)|journal=Antike Welt|date=2013|volume=5|issue=13|pages=9\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest mention of the Banda Islands are found in Chinese records dating as far back as 200 BCE though there's speculation that it's mentioned in earlier Indian sources. The Srivijaya kingdom had extensive trade contacts with the Banda Islands. Also during this period (from the late 13th century and onwards) Islam arrived in the region. It soon became established in the area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=87|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, Banda had an [[oligarchic]] form of government led by ''orang kaya'' ('rich men') and the Bandanese had an active and independent role in trade throughout the archipelago.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp24\">{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.| title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =24 | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}</ref> Banda was the world's only source of [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], spices used as flavourings, medicines, and preserving agents that were at the time highly valued in European markets. They were sold by [[Arab]] traders to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location.\n\nThe first written accounts of Banda are in ''Suma Oriental'', a book written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] who was based in [[Malacca]] from 1512 to 1515 but visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500\u20133000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to Malacca, although shipments from Banda were also being made by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders.\n\nIn addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant [[entrep\u00f4t]] trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the north, [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers from the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]] and [[Western New Guinea]], ''massoi'' bark for traditional medicines and salves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton ''[[batik]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Calico (textile)|calicoes]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[ikat]]'' from the [[Lesser Sundas]].  In 1603, an average quality ''[[sarong]]''-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg.  Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in [[Halmahera]] and [[New Guinea]].  Coarser ''ikat'' from the Lesser Sundas was traded for [[sago]] from the [[Kei Islands]], [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru]] and [[Seram]].\n\n===Portuguese===\nIn August 1511 on behalf of the king of [[Portugal]], [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]], which at the time was the hub of Asian trade. In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] to find them. [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots, either recruited or forcibly conscripted, guided them via [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sundas]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] to Banda, arriving in early 1512.<ref>Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton    | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}</ref> The first Europeans to reach the Bandas, the expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with Banda's nutmeg and mace, and with [[clove]]s in which Banda had a thriving entrep\u00f4t trade.<ref name=\"HANNARDp7\">Hannard (1991), page 7</ref> D'Abreu sailed through [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram Island|Seram]] while his second in command [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]] went ahead towards the Maluku islands, was shipwrecked and ended up in [[Ternate]].<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp25\"/> Distracted by hostilities elsewhere in the archipelago, such as Ambon and Ternate, the Portuguese did not return until 1529; a Portuguese trader Captain Garcia Henriques landed troops in the Bandas. Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were, however, hostile to such a plan, and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort.

Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.\n\n===Dutch Control===\n{{main|Governorate of the Banda Islands}}\n[[File:Fort Nassau 1646.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]] in 1646]]\n\nThe Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland's first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch\u2014heavy woolens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example\u2014were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along with steel knives, copper, medicines and prized [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAs much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that in trade with the East Indies, competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)'' (the \u2018[[Dutch East Indies Company]]) in 1602.<ref name = \"uclwxl\">Hannard (1991)</ref>\n\nUntil the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the ''orang kaya'' (literally 'rich men'); each of these was head of a district. At the time nutmeg was one of the \"fine spices\" kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian [[Fernand Braudel]] notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe.<ref>Braudel 1984, p. 219</ref> A number of Banda's ''orang kaya'' were persuaded by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly.\n\nIn April 1609, Admiral [[Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff]] arrived at Banda Neira with a request by [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] to build a fort on the island (the eventual [[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]]). The Bandanese were not excited about this idea. On 22 May, before building of the fort had started, the ''orang kaya'' called a meeting with the Dutch admiral, purportedly to negotiate prices. Instead, they led Verhoeff and two high-ranked men into an ambush and decapitated them and subsequently killed 46 of the Dutch visitors. [[Jan Pietersz Coen]], who was a lower-ranked merchant on the expedition, managed to escape, but the traumatic event likely influenced his future attitude towards the Bandanese.<ref>Opstall, M.E. van, ''De reis van de vloot van Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff naar Azi\u00eb 1607\u20131612'', Utrecht University, 1972, pp. 95\u201398.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Belgica 1824.jpg|thumb|Fort Belgica in 1824]]\n\n===English-Dutch rivalry===\nWhile Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and [[Run (island)|Run]] islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the English paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Anglo-Dutch tensions increased in 1611 the Dutch built the larger and more strategic [[Fort Belgica]] above Fort Nassau.\n\nIn 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men whereupon the English retreated to Run where they regrouped.

A year later, a much stronger Dutch force attacked Ai. This time the defenders were able to hold off the attack with cannon fire, but after a month of siege they ran out of ammunition. The Dutch slaughtered the defenders, and afterwards strengthened the fort, renaming it 'Fort Revenge'.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militairen bij het standbeeld van Koning Willem III op Banda TMnr 10018594.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial soldiers standing guard next to the statue of [[King Willem III of the Netherlands]], representing [[Dutch empire|Dutch dominance]] on Banda.]]\n\n===Massacre of the Bandanese===\n{{main|Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands}}\nNewly appointed VOC governor-general [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] set about enforcing Dutch monopoly over the Banda's spice trade.

They rise out of {{convert|4|to|6|km|adj=on}} deep ocean and have a total land area of approximately {{convert|172|km2}}. They had a population of 18,934 at the 2015 Census.<ref>Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> Until the mid-19th century the Banda Islands were the world's only source of the spices [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], produced from the nutmeg tree. The islands are also popular destinations for [[scuba diving]] and [[snorkeling]].\n\n== History ==\n\n===Pre-European history===\nThe first documented human presence in the Banda Islands comes from a rockshelter site on Pulau Ay that was in use at least 8,000 years ago.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lape|first1=Peter|title=Die erste Besiedlung auf den Banda-Inseln: 8000 Jahre Arch\u00e4ologie auf den Molukken (The first settlement in the Banda Islands: 8000 years of archeology in the Moluccas)|journal=Antike Welt|date=2013|volume=5|issue=13|pages=9\u201313}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest mention of the Banda Islands are found in Chinese records dating as far back as 200 BCE though there's speculation that it's mentioned in earlier Indian sources. The Srivijaya kingdom had extensive trade contacts with the Banda Islands. Also during this period (from the late 13th century and onwards) Islam arrived in the region. It soon became established in the area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|last=|first=|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=87|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref>\n\nBefore the arrival of Europeans, Banda had an [[oligarchic]] form of government led by ''orang kaya'' ('rich men') and the Bandanese had an active and independent role in trade throughout the archipelago.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp24\">{{cite book| last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C.| title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1991  | location =London  | page =24 | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}</ref> Banda was the world's only source of [[nutmeg]] and [[mace (spice)|mace]], spices used as flavourings, medicines, and preserving agents that were at the time highly valued in European markets. They were sold by [[Arab]] traders to the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]]s for exorbitant prices. The traders did not divulge the exact location of their source and no European was able to deduce their location.\n\nThe first written accounts of Banda are in ''Suma Oriental'', a book written by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[apothecary]] [[Tom\u00e9 Pires]] who was based in [[Malacca]] from 1512 to 1515 but visited Banda several times. On his first visit, he interviewed the Portuguese and the far more knowledgeable Malay sailors in Malacca. He estimated the early sixteenth century population to be 2500\u20133000. He reported the Bandanese as being part of an Indonesia-wide trading network and the only native Malukan long-range traders taking cargo to Malacca, although shipments from Banda were also being made by [[Javanese people|Javanese]] traders.\n\nIn addition to the production of nutmeg and mace, Banda maintained significant [[entrep\u00f4t]] trade; goods that moved through Banda included cloves from [[Ternate]] and [[Tidore]] in the north, [[bird-of-paradise]] feathers from the [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru Islands]] and [[Western New Guinea]], ''massoi'' bark for traditional medicines and salves. In exchange, Banda predominantly received rice and cloth; namely light cotton ''[[batik]]'' from [[Java]], ''[[Calico (textile)|calicoes]]'' from [[India]] and ''[[ikat]]'' from the [[Lesser Sundas]].  In 1603, an average quality ''[[sarong]]''-sized cloth traded for eighteen kilograms of nutmeg.  Some of these textiles were then on-sold, ending up in [[Halmahera]] and [[New Guinea]].  Coarser ''ikat'' from the Lesser Sundas was traded for [[sago]] from the [[Kei Islands]], [[Aru Islands Regency|Aru]] and [[Seram]].\n\n===Portuguese===\nIn August 1511 on behalf of the king of [[Portugal]], [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] conquered [[Malacca]], which at the time was the hub of Asian trade. In November of that year, after having secured Malacca and learning of the Bandas' location, Albuquerque sent an expedition of three ships led by his good friend [[Ant\u00f3nio de Abreu]] to find them. [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] pilots, either recruited or forcibly conscripted, guided them via [[Java]], the [[Lesser Sundas]] and [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] to Banda, arriving in early 1512.<ref>Hannard (1991), page 7; {{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton    | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}</ref> The first Europeans to reach the Bandas, the expedition remained in Banda for about one month, purchasing and filling their ships with Banda's nutmeg and mace, and with [[clove]]s in which Banda had a thriving entrep\u00f4t trade.<ref name=\"HANNARDp7\">Hannard (1991), page 7</ref> D'Abreu sailed through [[Ambon Island|Ambon]] and [[Seram Island|Seram]] while his second in command [[Francisco Serr\u00e3o]] went ahead towards the Maluku islands, was shipwrecked and ended up in [[Ternate]].<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp25\"/> Distracted by hostilities elsewhere in the archipelago, such as Ambon and Ternate, the Portuguese did not return until 1529; a Portuguese trader Captain Garcia Henriques landed troops in the Bandas. Five of the Banda islands were within gunshot of each other and he realised that a fort on the main island Neira would give him full control of the group. The Bandanese were, however, hostile to such a plan, and their warlike antics were both costly and tiresome to Garcia whose men were attacked when they attempted to build a fort. From then on, the Portuguese were infrequent visitors to the islands preferring to buy their nutmeg from traders in Malacca.<ref>{{cite book  | last =Milton  | first =Giles  | authorlink =Giles Milton    | title =Nathaniel's Nutmeg  | publisher =Sceptre  | year =1999  | location =London  | pages =5 and 7  | isbn = 978-0-340-69676-7 }}</ref>\n\nUnlike other eastern Indonesian islands, such as [[Ambon Island|Ambon]], [[Solor]], [[Ternate]] and [[Morotai]], the Bandanese displayed no enthusiasm for Christianity or the Europeans who brought it in the sixteenth century, and no serious attempt was made to Christianise the Bandanese.<ref name=\"RICKLEFSp25\">{{cite book  | last =Ricklefs  | first =M.C. | title =A History of Modern Indonesia Since c.1300, 2nd Edition  | publisher =MacMillan  | year =1993  | location =London  | page =25 | isbn = 978-0-333-57689-2 }}</ref> Maintaining their independence, the Bandanese never allowed the Portuguese to build a fort or a permanent post in the islands. Ironically though, it was this lack of ports which brought the Dutch to trade at Banda instead of the clove islands of Ternate and Tidore.\n\n===Dutch Control===\n{{main|Governorate of the Banda Islands}}\n[[File:Fort Nassau 1646.jpg|right|thumb|[[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]] in 1646]]\n\nThe Dutch followed the Portuguese to Banda but were to have a much more dominating and lasting presence. Dutch-Bandanese relations were mutually resentful from the outset, with Holland's first merchants complaining of Bandanese reneging on agreed deliveries and price, and cheating on quantity and quality. For the Bandanese, on the other hand, although they welcomed another competitor purchaser for their spices, the items of trade offered by the Dutch\u2014heavy woolens, and damasks, unwanted manufactured goods, for example\u2014were usually unsuitable in comparison to traditional trade products. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Arab]] and [[India]]n, and Portuguese traders for example brought indispensable items along with steel knives, copper, medicines and prized [[China|Chinese]] [[porcelain]].{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\nAs much as the Dutch disliked dealing with the Bandanese, the trade was a highly profitable one with spices selling for 300 times the purchase price in Banda. This amply justified the expense and risk in shipping them to Europe. The allure of such profits saw an increasing number of Dutch expeditions; it was soon seen that in trade with the East Indies, competition from each would eat into all their profits. Thus the competitors united to form the ''Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie (VOC)'' (the \u2018[[Dutch East Indies Company]]) in 1602.<ref name = \"uclwxl\">Hannard (1991)</ref>\n\nUntil the early seventeenth century the Bandas were ruled by a group of leading citizens, the ''orang kaya'' (literally 'rich men'); each of these was head of a district. At the time nutmeg was one of the \"fine spices\" kept expensive in Europe by disciplined manipulation of the market, but a desirable commodity for Dutch traders in the ports of India as well; economic historian [[Fernand Braudel]] notes that India consumed twice as much as Europe.<ref>Braudel 1984, p. 219</ref> A number of Banda's ''orang kaya'' were persuaded by the Dutch to sign a treaty granting the Dutch a monopoly on spice purchases. Even though the Bandanese had little understanding of the significance of the treaty known as 'The Eternal Compact', or that not all Bandanese leaders had signed, it would later be used to justify Dutch troops being brought in to defend their monopoly.\n\nIn April 1609, Admiral [[Pieter Willemsz. Verhoeff]] arrived at Banda Neira with a request by [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]] to build a fort on the island (the eventual [[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]]). The Bandanese were not excited about this idea. On 22 May, before building of the fort had started, the ''orang kaya'' called a meeting with the Dutch admiral, purportedly to negotiate prices. Instead, they led Verhoeff and two high-ranked men into an ambush and decapitated them and subsequently killed 46 of the Dutch visitors. [[Jan Pietersz Coen]], who was a lower-ranked merchant on the expedition, managed to escape, but the traumatic event likely influenced his future attitude towards the Bandanese.<ref>Opstall, M.E. van, ''De reis van de vloot van Pieter Willemsz Verhoeff naar Azi\u00eb 1607\u20131612'', Utrecht University, 1972, pp. 95\u201398.</ref>\n\n[[File:Fort Belgica 1824.jpg|thumb|Fort Belgica in 1824]]\n\n===English-Dutch rivalry===\nWhile Portuguese and Spanish activity in the region had weakened, the English had built fortified trading posts on tiny Ai and [[Run (island)|Run]] islands, ten to twenty kilometres from the main Banda Islands. With the English paying higher prices, they were significantly undermining Dutch aims for a monopoly. As Anglo-Dutch tensions increased in 1611 the Dutch built the larger and more strategic [[Fort Belgica]] above Fort Nassau.\n\nIn 1615, the Dutch invaded Ai with 900 men whereupon the English retreated to Run where they regrouped. Japanese mercenaries served in the Dutch forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wardsan.travellerspoint.com/s21/|title=Asia 2008\u201309|work=travellerspoint.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://search.library.utoronto.ca/details?7626150|title=Merchant kings : when companies ruled the world, 1600\u20131900 / \u2013 University of Toronto Libraries|work=utoronto.ca}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.danbyrnes.com.au/lostworlds/timeline/lwstory7.htm|title=Lost Worlds Page 7 \u2013 From 1600\u20131700|first=Dan|last=Byrnes|work=danbyrnes.com.au}}</ref> That same night, the English launched a surprise counter-attack on Ai, retaking the island and killing 200 Dutchmen. A year later, a much stronger Dutch force attacked Ai. This time the defenders were able to hold off the attack with cannon fire, but after a month of siege they ran out of ammunition. The Dutch slaughtered the defenders, and afterwards strengthened the fort, renaming it 'Fort Revenge'.\n\n[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Militairen bij het standbeeld van Koning Willem III op Banda TMnr 10018594.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial soldiers standing guard next to the statue of [[King Willem III of the Netherlands]], representing [[Dutch empire|Dutch dominance]] on Banda.]]\n\n===Massacre of the Bandanese===\n{{main|Dutch conquest of the Banda Islands}}\nNewly appointed VOC governor-general [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]] set about enforcing Dutch monopoly over the Banda's spice trade.

The French and British were each seeking to control lucrative Indian Ocean trade routes.  On 10 May 1810, a squadron consisting of the 36-gun frigate {{HMS|Caroline}}, [[French frigate Pi\u00e9montaise (1804)|HMS ''Piedmontaise'']], formerly a French frigate, 18-gun [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|sloop]] {{HMS|Barracouta}}, and the 12-gun transport {{HMS|Mandarin|1810|6}} left [[Chennai|Madras]] with money, supplies and troops to support the garrison at [[Ambon Island|Amboyna]], recently captured from the Dutch.

On 9 August 1810, the British appeared at [[Banda Neira]].  They quickly stormed the island and attacked [[Fort Belgica|Belgica Castle]] at sunrise.  The battle was over within hours, with the Dutch surrendering [[Fort Nassau, Banda Islands|Fort Nassau]] \u2013 after some subterfuge \u2013 and within days the remainder of the Banda Islands. After the Dutch surrender, Captain Charles Foote (of the ''Piedmontaise'') was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of the Banda Islands.

Melbourne: Lonely Planet. {{ISBN|1-74059-154-2}}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\nThere are seven inhabited islands and several that are uninhabited.  The inhabited islands are:\n[[File:BandaVolcano.JPG|thumb|The active volcano [[Banda Api]] in the Banda Islands]]\n[[File:Banda-0039.jpg|thumb|The main island, Banda Neira (centre) viewed from the peak of Gunung Api volcano. In the background is [[Lontar Island]] (Banda Besar).]]\nMain group:\n*[[Banda Neira]], or Naira, the island with the administrative capital and a small airfield (as well as accommodation for visitors). Present on Banda Neira is Fort Belgica, one of the largest remaining Dutch forts that are still intact in Indonesia. \n*[[Banda Api]], an active volcano (Gunung Api) with a peak of about 650 m\n*Banda Besar is the largest island (Indonesian ''besar'', big), {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|3|km|0|abbr=on}} wide. It has three main settlements, Lonthoir, Selamon and Waer.\n\nSome distance to the west:\n*Pulau [[Ai (island)|Ai]] or Pulau Ay\n*Pulau [[Run (island)|Run]], further west again. In the 17th century, this island was involved in an exchange between the British and the Dutch: it was exchanged for the island of Manhattan in New York.\n\nTo the east:\n*[[Pisang Island (Maluku)|Pulau Pisang]] (Banana Island), also known as Syahrir.\n\nTo the southeast:\n*Pulau Hatta, formerly Rosengain or Rozengain\n\nOthers, possibly small and/or uninhabited, are:\n*Nailaka, a short distance northeast of Pulau [[Run (island)|Run]]\n*Batu Kapal\n*Manuk, an active volcano\n*Pulau Keraka or Pulau Karaka (Crab Island)\n*Manukang\n*Hatta Reef\n\nThe islands are part of the [[Banda Sea Islands moist deciduous forests]] [[ecoregion]].\n\n==Bandanese culture==\nMost of the present-day inhabitants of the Banda Islands are descended from migrants and plantation labourers from various parts of Indonesia, as well as from indigenous Bandanese. They have inherited aspects of pre-colonial ritual practices in the Bandas that are highly valued and still performed, giving them a distinct and very local cultural identity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lape|first1=Peter V.|title=Political dynamics and religious change in the late pre-colonial Banda Islands, Eastern Indonesia|journal=World Archaeology|date=2000|volume=32|issue=1|pages=138\u2013155|doi=10.1080/004382400409934|citeseerx=10.1.1.500.4009}}</ref>\n\nIn addition, Bandanese speak a distinct dialect of [[Malay language]] which has several features distinguishing it from [[Ambonese Malay]], the better-known and more widespread dialect that forms a lingua franca in central and southeast Maluku. Bandanese Malay is famous in the region for its unique, lilting accent, but it also has a number of locally identifying words in its lexicon, many of them borrowings or [[loanwords]] from [[Dutch language|Dutch]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Winn|first1=Phillip|title=Slavery and cultural creativity in the Banda Islands|journal=Journal of Southeast Asian Studies|date=2010|volume=41|issue=3|pages=365\u2013389|doi=10.1017/s0022463410000238}}</ref>\n\nExamples :\n* fork\t: forok (Dutch vork)\n* ant\t: mir (Dutch mier)\n* spoon\t: lepe (Dutch lepel)\n* difficult : lastek (Dutch lastig)\n* floor : plur (Dutch vloer)\n* porch: stup (Dutch stoep)\n\nBanda Malay shares many [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] loanwords with Ambonese Malay not appearing in the national language, [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. But it has comparatively fewer, and they differ in pronunciation.\n\nExamples :\n* turtle : tetaruga (Banda Malay); totoruga (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese tartaruga)\n* throat : gargontong (Banda Malay); gargangtang (Ambonese Malay) (from Portuguese garganta)\n\nFinally, and most noticeably, Banda Malay uses some distinct pronouns. The most immediately distinguishing is that of the second person singular familiar form of address: pan\u00e9.\n\nThe descendants of some of the Bandanese who fled Dutch conquest in the seventeenth century live in the [[Kai Islands]] (Kepulauan Kei) to the east of the Banda group, where a version of the original [[Banda language (Indonesia)|Banda language]] is still spoken in the villages of Banda Eli and Banda Elat on Kai Besar Island. While long integrated into Kei Island society, residents of these settlements continue to value the historical origins of their ancestors.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[1938 Banda Sea earthquake]]\n*[[Dutch East India Company in Indonesia]]\n*[[History of Indonesia]]\n*[[List of earthquakes in Indonesia]]\n*[[List of volcanoes in Indonesia#Banda Sea]]\n*[[Maluku Islands]]\n\n==Further reading==\n*[[Giles Milton]].

These measures included tax exemptions and subsidies which ultimately failed to stimulate industry.
