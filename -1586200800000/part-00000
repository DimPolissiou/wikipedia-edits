It opened in January 1954 on the site of a former [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]] station, as part of an extension to [[Wonderland station|Wonderland]]. Revere Beach station was closed and rebuilt from 1994 to 1995.\n\nLike all Blue Line stations from Airport east, Revere Beach has two tracks and two side platforms. Uniquely among Blue Line stations, it is located below grade in a trench, with a surface-level fare lobby. Entrances to the station are from Beach Street and Shirley Avenue.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Crescent Beach Station, Revere Beach, MA.jpg|thumb|left|Crescent Beach station on a 1910 postcard]]\nThe [[narrow gauge]] [[Boston, Revere Beach and Lynn Railroad]] (BRB&L) opened from [[East Boston]] to [[Lynn, Massachusetts|Lynn]] on July 29, 1875.
