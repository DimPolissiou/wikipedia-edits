The [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period of Mauritania]] lasted for a mere two generations, from 1904 to 1960.\nThe French authorities had difficulty in maintaining order in view of the numerous and complicated conflicts among the area's numerous factions and sub-factions. They attempted to abolish [[Slavery in Mauritania|slavery]] in 1905, but with very limited success.<ref>\nthere were renewed efforts to ban slavery in 1981 and 2007, in spite of which Mauritania remains the country with the largest proportion of enslaved population worldwide.</ref> [[History of Mauritania (1960\u20131978)|Mauritanian independence]] was granted in 1960, following a 1958 referendum under the [[French Fifth Republic]].\n\n==Characteristics==\n{{Quote|''In the year 41 AD Suetonius Paullinus, afterwards Consul, was the first of the Romans who led an army across Mount Atlas.

In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the [[Sanhadja Confederation]], at its height from the 8th century to the 10th century, and the [[Almoravid Empire]], from the 11th century to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and succumbed to further invasions from the [[Ghana Empire]] and the [[Almohad Empire]], respectively.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe first external influence that tended to unify the country was [[Islam]]. The [[Islam in Mauritania|Islamization of Mauritania]] was a gradual process that spanned more than 500 years. Beginning slowly through contacts with Berber and Arab merchants engaged in the important [[Convoy|caravan]] trades and rapidly advancing through the Almoravid conquests, Islamization did not take firm hold until the arrival of [[Yemen]]i Arabs in the 12th and 13th centuries and was not complete until several centuries later. Gradual Islamization was accompanied by a process of [[Arabization]] as well, during which the Berber masters of Mauritania lost power and became vassals of their Arab conquerors.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrom the 15th century to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for [[gum arabic]]. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population, the [[Maures]] (Moors), to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]] and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under [[Louis Faidherbe]], governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or \"pacification\" of the entire country did not begin until 1900.\n\n[[France]] created the boundaries of contemporary [[Mauritania]] and administered it until the independence in the 1960s. Because extensive European contact began so late in the country's history, the traditional social structure carried over into modern times with little change.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrench rule brought legal prohibitions against [[slavery]], and an end to interclan warfare. During the [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period]], the population remained nomadic, but many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania. As the country gained independence in 1960, the capital city [[Nouakchott]] was founded at the site of a small colonial village, the Ksar, while 90% of the population was still nomadic.\n\n==Early history==\n{{see also|Serer ancient history}}\n{{History of Mauritania sidebar}}\n\nThe [[prehistory]] of the west Saharan region is not fully characterised. There are some written accounts by medieval [[Arab]] traders and explorers who reached the important [[Trans-Saharan trade|caravan trading centers]] and [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of eastern Mauritania, but the major sources of pre-European history are oral history, legends, and archaeological evidence. These sources indicate that during the millennia preceding the Christian Era, the [[Sahara]] was a more habitable region than it is today and supported a flourishing culture. In the area that is now Mauritania, the [[Bafour]], a proto-[[Berber people|Berber]] people, whose descendants may be the coastal [[Imraguen people|Imraguen]] fishermen, were hunters, pastoralists, and fishermen. Valley cultivators, who may have been black ancestors of the riverine [[Toucouleur people|Toucouleur]] and [[Wolof people|Wolof]] peoples, lived alongside the Bafour. [[Dhar Tichitt]] is the oldest surviving archaeological settlements in West Africa and the oldest of all stone base settlements south of the Sahara. It was built by the [[Soninke people]] (or by the [[Serer people|Serers]]<ref>[[Henry Gravrand|Gravrand, Henry]], ''La Civilisation Sereer - Pangool'', Les Nouvelles Editions Africaines du Senegal (1990),  pp 9, 20,  77, {{ISBN|2-7236-1055-1}}</ref>) and is thought to be the precursor of the [[Ghana empire]], thought to have been built by Wolof people or Wolof-related ancestors.

The wide-ranging activities of these turbulent Berber warriors were made possible by the introduction of the [[camel]] to the Sahara in this period. This first wave of Berber invaders subjugated and made [[vassal]]s of those Bafour who did not flee south. Other Berber groups followed in the 7th and 8th centuries, themselves fleeing in large numbers before the Arab conquerors of the [[Maghreb]].<ref name=eh/>\n\n==Arab invasions==\nBeginning with the [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb|Arab conquest of the western Maghreb]] in the 8th century, Mauritania experienced a slow but constant infiltration of Arabs and Arab influence from the north. The growing Arab presence pressed the Berbers, who chose not to mix with other groups, to move farther south into Mauritania, forcing out the black inhabitants. By the 16th century, most blacks had been pushed to the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]]. Those remaining in the north became [[Slavery in Africa|slaves]] cultivating the [[oases]].<ref name=ai>Warner, Rachel. \"Arab invasions\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of the Almoravid Empire, a long process of Arabization began in Mauritania, one that until then had been resisted successfully by the Berbers. Several groups of [[Yemen]]i Arabs who had been in the north of Africa turned south to Mauritania. Settling in northern Mauritania, they disrupted the [[caravan trade]], causing routes to shift east, which in turn led to the gradual decline of Mauritania's trading towns. One particular Yemeni group, the [[Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n|Bani Hassan]], continued to migrate southward until, by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. The last effort of the Berbers to shake off the Arab yoke was the [[Mauritanian Thirty Years' War]] (1644\u201374), or Sharr Bubba, led by [[Nasr ad-Din (Lamtuna)|Nasr ad-Din]], a [[Lemtuna]] [[imam]]. This Sanhadja war of liberation was, however, unsuccessful; the Berbers were forced to abandon the sword and became vassals to the warrior Arab groups.<ref name=ai/>\n\nThus, the contemporary social structure of Mauritania can be dated from 1674. The warrior groups or Arabs dominated the Berber groups, who turned to [[cleric]]alism to regain a degree of ascendancy. At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves, subservient to both warriors and Islamic holy men. All of these groups, whose language was [[Hassaniya Arabic]], became known as [[Maures]]. The bitter rivalries and resentments characteristic of their social structure were later fully exploited by the French.<ref name=ai/>\n\n==Sanhadja Confederation==\nOne of the Berber groups arriving in Mauritania in the 8th century was the [[Lemtuna]]. By the 9th century, the Lemtuna had attained political dominance in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] and [[Hodh El Gharbi Region|Hodh]] regions. Together with two other important Berber groups, the [[Messufa]] and the [[Godala]], they set up the [[Sanhadja Confederation]]. From their capital, [[Aoudaghast]], the Lemtuna controlled this loose confederation and the western routes of the Saharan caravan trade that had begun to flourish after the introduction of the camel. At its height, from the eighth to the end of the 10th century, the Sanhadja Confederation was a decentralized [[polity]] based on two distinct groups: the nomadic and very independent Berber groups, who maintained their traditional religions, and the Muslim, urban Berber merchants, who conducted the caravan trade.<ref name=sc>Warner, Rachel. \"Sanhadja Confederation\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAlthough dominated by the [[Sanhadja]] merchants, the caravan trade had its northern terminus in the [[Maghreb|Maghribi]] commercial city of [[Sijilmasa]] and its southern terminus in [[Koumbi Saleh]], capital of the [[Ghana Empire]]. Later, the southern trade route ended in [[Timbuktu]], capital of the [[Mali Empire]]. [[Gold]], [[ivory]], and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]] were carried north in return for salt (ancient [[salt mine]]s near [[Kediet Ijill]] in northern Mauritania are still being worked), [[copper]], cloth, and other luxury goods.<ref name=sc/>\n\nImportant towns developed along the trade routes. The easiest, though not the shortest, routes between Ghana and Sijilmasa were from [[Koumbi Saleh]] through [[Aoudaghast]], [[Oual\u00e2ta]], [[T\u00eech\u00eet]], and [[Ouadane]]. These towns along the route grew to be important commercial as well as political centers. The 11th-century Arab chronicler [[Al-Bakri]] describes Aoudaghast, with its population of 5,000 to 6,000, as a big town with a large mosque and several smaller ones, surrounded by large cultivated areas under irrigation. Oual\u00e2ta was a major relay point on the gold and salt trade route, as well as a chief assembly point for [[Hajj|pilgrims traveling to Mecca]]. Koumbi Saleh was a large cosmopolitan city comprising two distinct sections: the Muslim quarter, with its Arab-influenced architecture, and the black quarter of traditional thatch and mud architecture, where the non-Muslim [[king of Ghana]] resided. Another important Mauritanian trade city of the Sanhadja Confederation was [[Chinguetti]], later an important religious center. Although Koumbi Saleh did not outlive the fall of the Ghana Empire, Aoudaghast and particularly Oual\u00e2ta maintained their importance well into the 16th century, when trade began shifting to the European-controlled coasts.<ref name=sc/>\n\n==Almoravids==\n{{see also|Almoravid dynasty|Serer history (medieval era to present)}}\nBy the 11th century, Islam had spread throughout the west Sahara under the influence of Berber and Arab traders and occasional Arab migrants. Nevertheless, [[African traditional religion|traditional religious practices]] thrived. The conquest of the entire west Saharan region by the [[Almoravids]] in the 11th century made possible a more orthodox Islamization of all the peoples of Mauritania.<ref name=a>Warner, Rachel. \"Almoravids\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the Sanhadja Confederation in the early 11th century led to a period of unrest and warfare among the Sanhadja Berber groups of Mauritania. In about 1039, a chief of the [[Godala]], [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca bringing with him a Sanhadja theologian, [[Abdallah ibn Yassin]], to teach a more orthodox Islam. Rejected by the Godala two years later, after the death of Ibn Ibrahim, Ibn Yassin and some of his Sanhadja followers retired to a secluded place where they built a fortified religious center, a [[ribat]], which attracted many Sanhadja. In 1042 the [[al murabitun]] (men of the ribat), as Ibn Yassin's followers came to be called, launched a [[jihad]], or holy war, against the nonbelievers and the heretics among the Sanhadja, beginning what later become known as the Almoravid movement. The initial aim of the Almoravids was to establish a political community in which the ethical and juridical principles of Islam would be strictly applied.<ref name=a/>\n\nFirst, the Almoravids attacked and subdued the Godala, forcing them to acknowledge Islam. Then, rallying the other Berber groups of the west Sahara, the Almoravids succeeded in recreating the political unity of the Sanhadja Confederation and adding to it a religious unity and purpose. By 1054 the Almoravids had captured Sijilmasa in the Maghrib and had retaken Aoudaghast from Ghana.<ref name=a/>\n\nWith the death of Ibn Yassin in 1059, leadership of the movement in the south passed to [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]], [[amir]] of Adrar, and to [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] in the north. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Berbers captured [[Morocco]] and founded [[Marrakech]] as their capital in 1062. By 1082 all of the western Maghrib (to at least present-day [[Algiers]]) was under Almoravid domination. In 1086 the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian emirates]], under attack from the Spanish Christian [[Alfonso VI of Castile|king Alfonso]] and the [[Christian reconquest of Spain]], called on Ibn Tashfin and his Berber warriors to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and come to their rescue. The Almoravids [[Sagrajas|defeated]] the Spanish Christians and, by 1090, imposed Almoravid rule and the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic law in Muslim Spain.<ref name=a/>\n\nIn Mauritania, Abu Bakr led the Almoravids in a war against Ghana (1062\u201376), culminating in the capture in 1076 of Koumbi Saleh. This event marked the end of the dominance of the Ghana Empire. But after the death of Abu Bakr in 1087 and Ibn Tashfin in 1106, traditional rivalries among the Sanhadja and a new Muslim reformist conquest led by the [[Zenata]] [[Almohad]]s (1133\u201363) destroyed the Almoravid Empire.<ref name=a/>\n\nFor a short time, the Mauritanian Sanhadja dynasty of the Almoravid Empire controlled a vast territory stretching from Spain to [[Senegal]]. The unity established between Morocco and Mauritania during the Almoravid period continued to have some political importance in the 1980s, as it formed part of the basis for Morocco's claims to Mauritania. But the greatest contribution of the Sanhadja and the Almoravids was the Islamization of the western Maghrib. This process would remain a dominant factor in the history of the area for the next several centuries.<ref name=a/>\n\n==Sudanic empires and kingdoms==\nAlthough the Almoravids had substantial contacts with the Maghrib, influences from the [[black people|black]] [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] played an important role in Mauritania's history for about 700 years\u2014from the 8th to the 15th century. Ghana, the first of the great West African Sudanic kingdoms, included in its territory all of southeastern Mauritania extending to [[Tagant Plateau|Tagant]]. Ghana reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries with the extension of its rule over the Sanhadja Berbers. This large and centralized kingdom controlled the southern terminus of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, and salt.<ref name=sek>Warner, Rachel. \"Sudanic empires and kingdoms\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe capture of Koumbi Saleh in 1076 by the Almoravids marked the end of Ghana's [[hegemony]], although the kingdom continued to exist for another 125 years. The [[Mand\u00e9]], under the leadership of the legendary [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]], founded the second great Sudanic kingdom, Mali. By the end of the 13th century, the Mali Empire extended over that part of Mauritania previously controlled by Ghana, as well as over the remaining [[Sahel]]ian regions and the [[Senegal River Valley]]. Sundiata and his successors took over Ghana's role in the Saharan trade and in the administration and collection of [[tribute]] from vast stretches of the Sudan and the Sahel.<ref name=sek/>\n\nThe slow decline of the Mali Empire that started at the end of the 14th century came about through internal discord and revolts by the inhabitants of vassal states, including the Songhai of [[Gao]]. By the end of the 15th century, the Songhai Empire had replaced the Mali Empire and extended to Mauritania and the upper Senegal River Valley. At the end of the 16th century, a large Moroccan force defeated the Songhai, bringing to an end the seven centuries of domination of the western Sudan (and a large part of Mauritania) by strong, centralized black kingdoms.<ref name=sek/>\n\n==Early European involvement==\nDespite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe. The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their [[European exploration of Africa|African explorations]] in the 15th century.  The area of Mauritania was of little interest to either Arab or European conquerors; the existence of gold reserves in the interior was not yet known, and the important trade routes passed the territory well to the east, through [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Saadi dynasty]] conquered much of the Saharan interior but did not show interest in expanding their territory westward.\n\nThe Portuguese had established a trading fort at [[Arguin]], southeast of Cap Blanc (present-day [[Ras Nouadhibou]]), in 1455. \nThe king of Portugal also maintained a [[commercial agent]] at [[Ouadane]] in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan. Having only slight success in their quest for gold, the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves. In the mid-15th century, as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese [[sugar plantation]]s on the island of [[Sao Tom\u00e9]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref name=eec>Warner, Rachel. \"Early European contacts\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Iberian Union|merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns]] in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the [[gum arabic]] trade. Produced by the [[acacia]] trees of [[Trarza]] and [[Brakna]] and used in [[Textile printing|textile pattern printing]], this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. \nBy 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] at the mouth of the Senegal River, where the French [[Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] had been trading for more than fifty years.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe [[Maures]], with whom the Europeans were trading, considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness, and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other. For example, they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch. The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible, so that when the French negotiated with the [[Emirate of Trarza|emir of Trarza]] to secure a monopoly on the gum arabic trade, the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts. Thus began the [[coutume]], an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company. By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast, and France recovered control only when the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*Handloff, Robert E., editor.

In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe divisive tendencies of the various groups within Mauritanian society have always worked against the development of Mauritanian unity. Both the [[Sanhadja Confederation]], at its height from the 8th century to the 10th century, and the [[Almoravid Empire]], from the 11th century to the 12th century, were weakened by internecine warfare, and succumbed to further invasions from the [[Ghana Empire]] and the [[Almohad Empire]], respectively.<ref name=cs/>\n\nThe first external influence that tended to unify the country was [[Islam]]. The [[Islam in Mauritania|Islamization of Mauritania]] was a gradual process that spanned more than 500 years. Beginning slowly through contacts with Berber and Arab merchants engaged in the important [[Convoy|caravan]] trades and rapidly advancing through the Almoravid conquests, Islamization did not take firm hold until the arrival of [[Yemen]]i Arabs in the 12th and 13th centuries and was not complete until several centuries later. Gradual Islamization was accompanied by a process of [[Arabization]] as well, during which the Berber masters of Mauritania lost power and became vassals of their Arab conquerors.<ref name=cs/>\n\nFrom the 15th century to the 19th century, European contact with Mauritania was dominated by the trade for [[gum arabic]]. Rivalries among European powers enabled the Arab-Berber population, the [[Maures]] (Moors), to maintain their independence and later to exact annual payments from France, whose sovereignty over the [[S\u00e9n\u00e9gal River]] and the Mauritanian coast was recognized by the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815. Although penetration beyond the coast and the Senegal River began in earnest under [[Louis Faidherbe]], governor of Senegal in the mid-19th century, European conquest or \"pacification\" of the entire country did not begin until 1900.\n\n[[France]] created the boundaries of contemporary [[Mauritania]] and administered it until the independence in the 1960s.

During the [[Colonial Mauritania|colonial period]], the population remained nomadic, but many sedentary peoples, whose ancestors had been expelled centuries earlier, began to trickle back into Mauritania.

Several groups of [[Yemen]]i Arabs who had been in the north of Africa turned south to Mauritania. Settling in northern Mauritania, they disrupted the [[caravan trade]], causing routes to shift east, which in turn led to the gradual decline of Mauritania's trading towns. One particular Yemeni group, the [[Beni \u1e24ass\u0101n|Bani Hassan]], continued to migrate southward until, by the end of the 17th century, they dominated the entire country. The last effort of the Berbers to shake off the Arab yoke was the [[Mauritanian Thirty Years' War]] (1644\u201374), or Sharr Bubba, led by [[Nasr ad-Din (Lamtuna)|Nasr ad-Din]], a [[Lemtuna]] [[imam]]. This Sanhadja war of liberation was, however, unsuccessful; the Berbers were forced to abandon the sword and became vassals to the warrior Arab groups.<ref name=ai/>\n\nThus, the contemporary social structure of Mauritania can be dated from 1674. The warrior groups or Arabs dominated the Berber groups, who turned to [[cleric]]alism to regain a degree of ascendancy. At the bottom of the social structure were the slaves, subservient to both warriors and Islamic holy men. All of these groups, whose language was [[Hassaniya Arabic]], became known as [[Maures]]. The bitter rivalries and resentments characteristic of their social structure were later fully exploited by the French.<ref name=ai/>\n\n==Sanhadja Confederation==\nOne of the Berber groups arriving in Mauritania in the 8th century was the [[Lemtuna]]. By the 9th century, the Lemtuna had attained political dominance in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] and [[Hodh El Gharbi Region|Hodh]] regions. Together with two other important Berber groups, the [[Messufa]] and the [[Godala]], they set up the [[Sanhadja Confederation]]. From their capital, [[Aoudaghast]], the Lemtuna controlled this loose confederation and the western routes of the Saharan caravan trade that had begun to flourish after the introduction of the camel. At its height, from the eighth to the end of the 10th century, the Sanhadja Confederation was a decentralized [[polity]] based on two distinct groups: the nomadic and very independent Berber groups, who maintained their traditional religions, and the Muslim, urban Berber merchants, who conducted the caravan trade.<ref name=sc>Warner, Rachel. \"Sanhadja Confederation\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nAlthough dominated by the [[Sanhadja]] merchants, the caravan trade had its northern terminus in the [[Maghreb|Maghribi]] commercial city of [[Sijilmasa]] and its southern terminus in [[Koumbi Saleh]], capital of the [[Ghana Empire]]. Later, the southern trade route ended in [[Timbuktu]], capital of the [[Mali Empire]]. [[Gold]], [[ivory]], and [[Arab slave trade|slaves]] were carried north in return for salt (ancient [[salt mine]]s near [[Kediet Ijill]] in northern Mauritania are still being worked), [[copper]], cloth, and other luxury goods.<ref name=sc/>\n\nImportant towns developed along the trade routes. The easiest, though not the shortest, routes between Ghana and Sijilmasa were from [[Koumbi Saleh]] through [[Aoudaghast]], [[Oual\u00e2ta]], [[T\u00eech\u00eet]], and [[Ouadane]]. These towns along the route grew to be important commercial as well as political centers. The 11th-century Arab chronicler [[Al-Bakri]] describes Aoudaghast, with its population of 5,000 to 6,000, as a big town with a large mosque and several smaller ones, surrounded by large cultivated areas under irrigation. Oual\u00e2ta was a major relay point on the gold and salt trade route, as well as a chief assembly point for [[Hajj|pilgrims traveling to Mecca]]. Koumbi Saleh was a large cosmopolitan city comprising two distinct sections: the Muslim quarter, with its Arab-influenced architecture, and the black quarter of traditional thatch and mud architecture, where the non-Muslim [[king of Ghana]] resided. Another important Mauritanian trade city of the Sanhadja Confederation was [[Chinguetti]], later an important religious center. Although Koumbi Saleh did not outlive the fall of the Ghana Empire, Aoudaghast and particularly Oual\u00e2ta maintained their importance well into the 16th century, when trade began shifting to the European-controlled coasts.<ref name=sc/>\n\n==Almoravids==\n{{see also|Almoravid dynasty|Serer history (medieval era to present)}}\nBy the 11th century, Islam had spread throughout the west Sahara under the influence of Berber and Arab traders and occasional Arab migrants. Nevertheless, [[African traditional religion|traditional religious practices]] thrived. The conquest of the entire west Saharan region by the [[Almoravids]] in the 11th century made possible a more orthodox Islamization of all the peoples of Mauritania.<ref name=a>Warner, Rachel. \"Almoravids\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe breakup of the Sanhadja Confederation in the early 11th century led to a period of unrest and warfare among the Sanhadja Berber groups of Mauritania. In about 1039, a chief of the [[Godala]], [[Yahya ibn Ibrahim]], returned from a pilgrimage to Mecca bringing with him a Sanhadja theologian, [[Abdallah ibn Yassin]], to teach a more orthodox Islam. Rejected by the Godala two years later, after the death of Ibn Ibrahim, Ibn Yassin and some of his Sanhadja followers retired to a secluded place where they built a fortified religious center, a [[ribat]], which attracted many Sanhadja. In 1042 the [[al murabitun]] (men of the ribat), as Ibn Yassin's followers came to be called, launched a [[jihad]], or holy war, against the nonbelievers and the heretics among the Sanhadja, beginning what later become known as the Almoravid movement. The initial aim of the Almoravids was to establish a political community in which the ethical and juridical principles of Islam would be strictly applied.<ref name=a/>\n\nFirst, the Almoravids attacked and subdued the Godala, forcing them to acknowledge Islam. Then, rallying the other Berber groups of the west Sahara, the Almoravids succeeded in recreating the political unity of the Sanhadja Confederation and adding to it a religious unity and purpose. By 1054 the Almoravids had captured Sijilmasa in the Maghrib and had retaken Aoudaghast from Ghana.<ref name=a/>\n\nWith the death of Ibn Yassin in 1059, leadership of the movement in the south passed to [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar]], [[amir]] of Adrar, and to [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]] in the north. Under Ibn Tashfin, the Berbers captured [[Morocco]] and founded [[Marrakech]] as their capital in 1062. By 1082 all of the western Maghrib (to at least present-day [[Algiers]]) was under Almoravid domination. In 1086 the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian emirates]], under attack from the Spanish Christian [[Alfonso VI of Castile|king Alfonso]] and the [[Christian reconquest of Spain]], called on Ibn Tashfin and his Berber warriors to cross the [[Strait of Gibraltar]] and come to their rescue. The Almoravids [[Sagrajas|defeated]] the Spanish Christians and, by 1090, imposed Almoravid rule and the [[Maliki]] school of Islamic law in Muslim Spain.<ref name=a/>\n\nIn Mauritania, Abu Bakr led the Almoravids in a war against Ghana (1062\u201376), culminating in the capture in 1076 of Koumbi Saleh. This event marked the end of the dominance of the Ghana Empire. But after the death of Abu Bakr in 1087 and Ibn Tashfin in 1106, traditional rivalries among the Sanhadja and a new Muslim reformist conquest led by the [[Zenata]] [[Almohad]]s (1133\u201363) destroyed the Almoravid Empire.<ref name=a/>\n\nFor a short time, the Mauritanian Sanhadja dynasty of the Almoravid Empire controlled a vast territory stretching from Spain to [[Senegal]]. The unity established between Morocco and Mauritania during the Almoravid period continued to have some political importance in the 1980s, as it formed part of the basis for Morocco's claims to Mauritania. But the greatest contribution of the Sanhadja and the Almoravids was the Islamization of the western Maghrib. This process would remain a dominant factor in the history of the area for the next several centuries.<ref name=a/>\n\n==Sudanic empires and kingdoms==\nAlthough the Almoravids had substantial contacts with the Maghrib, influences from the [[black people|black]] [[Sudan (region)|Sudanic]] kingdoms of [[Ghana Empire|Ghana]], [[Mali Empire|Mali]], and [[Songhai Empire|Songhai]] played an important role in Mauritania's history for about 700 years\u2014from the 8th to the 15th century. Ghana, the first of the great West African Sudanic kingdoms, included in its territory all of southeastern Mauritania extending to [[Tagant Plateau|Tagant]]. Ghana reached its apogee in the 9th and 10th centuries with the extension of its rule over the Sanhadja Berbers. This large and centralized kingdom controlled the southern terminus of the [[trans-Saharan trade]] in gold, ivory, and salt.<ref name=sek>Warner, Rachel. \"Sudanic empires and kingdoms\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nThe capture of Koumbi Saleh in 1076 by the Almoravids marked the end of Ghana's [[hegemony]], although the kingdom continued to exist for another 125 years. The [[Mand\u00e9]], under the leadership of the legendary [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]], founded the second great Sudanic kingdom, Mali. By the end of the 13th century, the Mali Empire extended over that part of Mauritania previously controlled by Ghana, as well as over the remaining [[Sahel]]ian regions and the [[Senegal River Valley]]. Sundiata and his successors took over Ghana's role in the Saharan trade and in the administration and collection of [[tribute]] from vast stretches of the Sudan and the Sahel.<ref name=sek/>\n\nThe slow decline of the Mali Empire that started at the end of the 14th century came about through internal discord and revolts by the inhabitants of vassal states, including the Songhai of [[Gao]]. By the end of the 15th century, the Songhai Empire had replaced the Mali Empire and extended to Mauritania and the upper Senegal River Valley. At the end of the 16th century, a large Moroccan force defeated the Songhai, bringing to an end the seven centuries of domination of the western Sudan (and a large part of Mauritania) by strong, centralized black kingdoms.<ref name=sek/>\n\n==Early European involvement==\nDespite the Almoravid domination of Spain in the 11th and 12th centuries, there seems to be little evidence of contact during that time between Mauritania and Europe. The inhospitable coastline of Mauritania continued to deter voyagers until the Portuguese began their [[European exploration of Africa|African explorations]] in the 15th century.  The area of Mauritania was of little interest to either Arab or European conquerors; the existence of gold reserves in the interior was not yet known, and the important trade routes passed the territory well to the east, through [[Timbuktu]].  The [[Saadi dynasty]] conquered much of the Saharan interior but did not show interest in expanding their territory westward.\n\nThe Portuguese had established a trading fort at [[Arguin]], southeast of Cap Blanc (present-day [[Ras Nouadhibou]]), in 1455. \nThe king of Portugal also maintained a [[commercial agent]] at [[Ouadane]] in the [[Adrar Plateau|Adrar]] in an attempt to divert gold traveling north by caravan. Having only slight success in their quest for gold, the Portuguese quickly adapted to dealing in slaves. In the mid-15th century, as many as 1,000 slaves per year were exported from Arguin to Europe and to the Portuguese [[sugar plantation]]s on the island of [[Sao Tom\u00e9]] in the [[Gulf of Guinea]].<ref name=eec>Warner, Rachel. \"Early European contacts\". In Handloff.</ref>\n\nWith the [[Iberian Union|merger of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns]] in 1580, the Spaniards became the dominant influence along the coast. In 1638, however, they were replaced by the Dutch, who were the first to begin exploiting the [[gum arabic]] trade. Produced by the [[acacia]] trees of [[Trarza]] and [[Brakna]] and used in [[Textile printing|textile pattern printing]], this gum arabic was considered superior to that previously obtained in Arabia. \nBy 1678 the French had driven out the Dutch and established a permanent settlement at [[Saint-Louis, Senegal|Saint-Louis]] at the mouth of the Senegal River, where the French [[Compagnie du S\u00e9n\u00e9gal]] had been trading for more than fifty years.<ref name=eec/>\n\nThe [[Maures]], with whom the Europeans were trading, considered the constant rivalries between European powers a sign of weakness, and they quickly learned the benefits of playing one power against the other. For example, they agreed simultaneously to give monopolies to the French and the Dutch. The Maures also took advantage of the Europeans whenever possible, so that when the French negotiated with the [[Emirate of Trarza|emir of Trarza]] to secure a monopoly on the gum arabic trade, the amir in exchange demanded a considerable number of gifts. Thus began the [[coutume]], an annual payment expected by the Maures for doing business with a government or a company. By 1763 the British had expelled France from the West African coast, and France recovered control only when the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1815 recognized French sovereignty over the coast of West Africa from Cap Blanc south to Senegal.<ref name=eec/>\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*Handloff, Robert E., editor.

They are noted for their combination of brass and rock band instrumentation.  The group recorded songs by rock/folk songwriters such as [[Laura Nyro]], [[James Taylor]], [[the Band]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] as well as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Erik Satie]]. They also incorporated music from [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]] into their arrangements. \n\nThey were originally formed in 1967 in [[New York City]]. Since their beginnings, the band has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel and has encompassed a multitude of musical styles. The band is most notable for their fusion of rock, blues, pop music, horn arrangements and jazz improvisation into a hybrid that came to be known as \"[[jazz-rock]]\". Unlike \"[[jazz fusion]]\" bands, which tend toward virtuosic displays of instrumental facility and some experimentation with electric instruments, the songs of Blood, Sweat & Tears merged the stylings of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[R&B]]/[[soul music]] with [[big band]], while also adding elements of 20th-century classical and [[Musical ensemble|small combo]] jazz traditions.\n\n== Al Kooper era ==\n{{ref improve|section|date=October 2017}}\n[[Al Kooper]], [[Jim Fielder]], [[Fred Lipsius]], [[Randy Brecker]], [[Jerry Weiss]], [[Dick Halligan]], [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]] and [[Bobby Colomby]] formed the original band.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=149}}</ref> The creation of the group was inspired by the \"brass-rock\" ideas of [[the Buckinghams]] and its producer, [[James William Guercio]], as well as the early 1960s Roulette-era [[Maynard Ferguson]] Orchestra (according to Kooper's autobiography).\n\nAl Kooper was the group's initial bandleader, having insisted on that position based on his experiences with [[the Blues Project]], his previous band with Steve Katz,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which had been organized as an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[Collectivism|collective]]. Jim Fielder was from [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[the Mothers of Invention]] and had played briefly with [[Buffalo Springfield]]. Kooper's fame as a high-profile contributor to various historic sessions of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others was a catalyst for the prominent debut of Blood, Sweat & Tears in the musical [[counterculture]] of the mid-sixties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n[[File:Blood,Sweat&TearsChildIsFathertotheMan.jpg|thumb]]\nKooper, Colomby, Katz and Fielder did a show as a quartet at the Village Theatre (soon to rename as [[Fillmore East]]) in New York City on September 16, 1967, with [[James Cotton Blues Band]] opening. Fred Lipsius then joined the others a month later. A few more shows were played as a quintet. Lipsius then recruited the other three, Dick Halligan, Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss, who were New York jazz horn players Lipsius knew. The final lineup debuted at the Cafe Au Go Go on November 17\u201319, 1967, then moved over to play [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]] the following week. The band was a hit with the audience, who liked the innovative fusion of [[jazz]] with [[acid rock]] and [[psychedelia]].\n\nAfter signing to [[Columbia Records]], the group released  ''[[Child Is Father to the Man]]''. The album cover was considered quite innovative showing the band members sitting and standing with child-sized versions of themselves. The album slowly picked up in sales despite growing artistic differences among the founding members which resulted in several personnel changes for the second album. Colomby and Katz wanted to move Kooper exclusively to keyboard and composing duties, while hiring a stronger vocalist for the group, causing Kooper's departure in April 1968.<ref name= VH1>{{cite web | url = http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/blood_sweat_and_tears/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears |last=Eder |first=Bruce | publisher = [[VH1]]| year = 2007| accessdate = 2012-08-17}}</ref> He became a [[record producer]] for the Columbia label, but not before arranging some songs that would be on the next BS&T album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/blood-sweat-and-tears/biography |title=Blood, Sweat and Tears Biography &#124; Rolling Stone |website=Rollingstone.com |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/290885/blood-sweat-tears/biography |title=Blood, Sweat & Tears - Biography &#124; Billboard |work=billboard.com  |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> The group's trumpeters, Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss, also left and were replaced by [[Lew Soloff]] and Chuck Winfield.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Brecker joined [[Horace Silver]]'s band with his brother [[Michael Brecker|Michael]], and together they eventually formed their own horn-dominated musical outfits, [[Dreams (band)|Dreams]] and [[the Brecker Brothers]]. Jerry Weiss went on to start the similarly styled group Ambergris.\n\n== David Clayton-Thomas era ==\n{{ref improve|section|date=October 2017}}\nAfter Kooper left the group, Colomby and Katz began to look for a new vocalist, considering [[Alex Chilton]] (after the breakup of soul-rock group [[the Box Tops]] but before the formation of [[Big Star]]),<ref>Jovanovic, Rob. ''Big Star: The Story of Rock's Forgotten Band''. London: Fourth Estate, 2004. {{ISBN|0-00-714908-5}}</ref> [[Stephen Stills]], and [[Laura Nyro]]. Ultimately, they decided upon [[David Clayton-Thomas]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] singer, born in Surrey, England.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/300417/david-clayton-thomas/biography |title=David Clayton-Thomas - Biography &#124; Billboard |website=Billboard.com |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> Reportedly, folk singer [[Judy Collins]] had seen Clayton-Thomas perform at a New York City club and was so taken and moved by his performance that she told Colomby and Katz about him (knowing that they were looking for a new lead singer to front the band).<ref name= VH1 /> With her prodding, they went to see Clayton-Thomas perform and were so impressed that he was offered the role of lead singer in a re-constituted Blood Sweat & Tears. Trombonist Halligan took up the organ chores and Jerry Hyman joined to take over trombone. With new trumpeters [[Lew_Soloff|Soloff]] and Winfield the now nine-member band debuted at New York's Cafe Au Go Go on June 18, 1968, beginning a two-week residency.\n\n[[File:BS&T cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eponymous 1968 album ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Blood, Sweat & Tears]]'']]\n\nThe group's second album, ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Blood, Sweat & Tears]]'', was produced by [[James William Guercio]] and released in late 1968. It was more pop-oriented, featuring fewer compositions by the band. The record quickly hit the top of the charts, winning [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[Grammy Award]]s over [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'', among other nominees.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Three hit singles were released from ''Blood, Sweat & Tears:'' a cover of [[Berry Gordy]] and [[Brenda Holloway]]'s \"[[You've Made Me So Very Happy]]\", Clayton-Thomas' \"[[Spinning Wheel (song)|Spinning Wheel]]\", and a version of Nyro's \"[[And When I Die]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Each of these three #2 singles was on ''Billboard Magazine'' 's Hot 100 chart for 13 weeks.\n\nThe commercial and critical acclaim enjoyed by the band in 1969 culminated in an appearance at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]], in which the band enjoyed headliner status.<ref name= VH1 /> The festival's film crew even caught the band's opening number, \"More and More\", as they took to the stage. But the band's manager at the time, Bennett Glotzer, ordered the movie crew to turn off the cameras and leave the stage since the band had not agreed nor been paid to be filmed.\n\nWhile Blood, Sweat & Tears achieved commercial success alongside similarly configured ensembles such as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and the [[Electric Flag]], the band had difficulty maintaining its status as a counterculture icon at a time when record company executives deemed this characteristic important as a tool to lure young consumers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This was compounded by the band going on a [[United States Department of State]]-sponsored tour of Eastern Europe in May/June 1970.<ref name= VH1 /> Any voluntary association with the government was highly unpopular at the time, and the band was ridiculed for it.<ref name= VH1 /> It is now known that the State Department subtly requested the tour in exchange for more amicability on the issuance of a visa to Clayton-Thomas.<ref name= VH1 />\n\nAfter returning to the U.S., the group released ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears 3]]'' (June 1970), produced by [[Roy Halee]] and drummer Colomby. The album was another popular success,<ref name= VH1 /> spawning hit singles with a cover of [[Carole King]]'s \"Hi-De-Ho\" and another Clayton-Thomas composition, \"Lucretia MacEvil\". While this was a successful attempt to re-create the amalgam of styles found on the previous album, the band again depended almost exclusively on cover material. Album reviews sometimes focused solely upon the band's willingness to work with the U.S. State Department, without bothering to discuss the actual music.<ref name= VH1 /> Compounding the image problems of the band was a decision to play at [[Caesars Palace]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], widely seen at the time as a mainstream venue for acts that did not engage in radical politics.\n\nIn late 1970, the band provided music for the soundtrack of the film comedy ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]] '', which starred [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[George Segal]], further damaging the group's underground reputation.\n\nFollowing this period of controversy, the group reconvened in [[San Francisco]] in January 1971 with jazz writer/saxophonist Don Heckman serving as their producer. With [[Dave Bargeron]] replacing Jerry Hyman, they recorded material that would form the basis of their fourth album, ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears 4|BS&T 4]]'' (June 1971). For the first time since the first album, Blood, Sweat & Tears presented a repertoire of songs composed almost entirely from within the group. Also included on the album is a cover of former member Al Kooper's \"Holy John (John the Baptist)\". Loaded with hooks and a wide variety of moods (featuring such songs as \"Go Down Gamblin'\", \"Lisa, Listen to Me\", \"High on a Mountain\", \"Redemption\"), ''BS&T 4'' broke into the album charts, resulting in a gold record for the group.  However, none of the singles from the album managed to land in the Top 30 on any of the singles charts, and the period after the release of the fourth album began the group's commercial decline.<ref name= VH1 />\n\n== Jerry Fisher era ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}\nAfter playing a final show at [[Anaheim Convention Center]] on December 31, 1971, Clayton-Thomas left in early January 1972 to pursue a solo career. He was briefly replaced by [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]] and then [[Jerry Fisher]], who went on to front the next incarnation of Blood, Sweat & Tears. [[Fred Lipsius]] left as well and was briefly replaced by [[Joe Henderson]], before [[Lou Marini]] settled into the new lineup. Another founding member, Dick Halligan, also departed, replaced by jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]] (from the [[Cannonball Adderley]] Quintet), and [[Sweden|Swedish]] guitarist [[Georg Wadenius]], from the popular Swedish outfit [[Made in Sweden (band)|Made in Sweden]], joined as lead guitarist around the same time.\n\nThe new edition of Blood, Sweat & Tears released ''[[New Blood (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|New Blood]]'' in September 1972, which found the group moving into a more overtly jazz-fusion repertoire. The album broke through the Top 40 chart (the last BS&T LP to do so) and spawned a single (\"So Long Dixie\", chart peak: 44) that received some airplay.  Also included on the record was a cover version of Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\", featuring the voice/guitar soloing of [[Georg Wadenius]].\n\nIn January 1973, Katz left to pursue a career as a producer (for [[Lou Reed]] and others). Winfield departed as well, in March, and was replaced by [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]].\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears' next album, ''[[No Sweat (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|No Sweat]]'' (June 1973), continued in a jazz-fusion vein and featured intricate horn work. Tom Malone's stay in the band was brief and he left to make way for jazz trumpeter [[John Madrid]]. But Madrid's tenure was likewise short-lived and he never recorded with the band. Both Madrid and [[Lew_Soloff|Soloff]] left in late 1973, making way for new horn player/arranger Tony Klatka on their next release,  ''[[Mirror Image (BS&T album)|Mirror Image]]'' (July 1974), which also saw the addition of vocalist/saxophonist Jerry LaCroix (formerly of [[Edgar Winter]]'s White Trash), sax player Bill Tillman, bassist [[Ron McClure]] and the exodus of original bass player [[Jim Fielder]]. This recording features the adoption of a sound pitched between [[Philadelphia soul|Philly Soul]] and the mid-1970s albums by [[Herbie Hancock]]'s [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]], along with aspirations to [[Chick Corea]]'s jazz-fusion group [[Return to Forever]].\n\nJerry LaCroix left BS&T to join [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]] after playing his final show with them at [[Wollman Rink]] in New York's [[Central Park]] on July 27, 1974. [[Luther Kent]], a blues singer from [[New Orleans]], was recruited to replace LaCroix.\n\n== Reformations ==\n{{ref improve|section|date=October 2017}}\nBy the close of 1974, Jerry Fisher decided that he was tired by BS&T's heavy touring schedule, so Bobby Colomby, together with the band's manager Fred Heller, engineered the return of David Clayton-Thomas in the hope of restoring the band to its former level of success. Clayton-Thomas agreed and met the current group at a concert in [[Milwaukee]] while Jerry Fisher and Luther Kent were still with the band. All three singers ended up on stage together before a wildly enthusiastic crowd.\n\nThe next album, ''[[New City (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|New City]]'' in April 1975, featured Clayton-Thomas back fronting the band and contained half cover tunes ([[Janis Ian]], [[Randy Newman]], [[the Beatles]], [[Blues Image]]) and half original material. New horn player Joe Giorgianni joined for ''[[New City (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|New City]]'', which charted higher (#47) than any of their previous albums since ''New Blood''. This was chiefly the result of an entry in the singles charts with a cover of the Beatles' \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\", which peaked at #62. But it still did not sell as well as albums from the group's 1969\u201371 commercial peak period.\n\n[[File:Jaco Pastorius 1986.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]], with [[Jorma Kaukonen]] (rear, left) performing in the Lone Star, New York City]]\nIn the summer of 1975, BS&T recorded a live album that was released in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] the following year as ''[[In Concert (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|In Concert]]''. This very same album was later released in the US as ''[[Live and Improvised]]'' in May 1991. The album featured different guitarists on different nights: Georg Wadenius, [[Steve Khan]] and [[Mike Stern]], the latter who took over permanently for a time (Jeff Richman filled in for Stern in mid-1976). Jazz percussionist [[Don Alias]] was also present for the live album. After its recording, Joe Giorgianni left and was replaced by Forrest Buchtel (formerly of [[Woody Herman]]'s band).\n\nAround the same time, Bobby Colomby discovered a talented bass player by the name of [[Jaco Pastorius]] in [[Florida]]. He produced Jaco's first solo album in the autumn of 1975, which was released in the spring of 1976. In late 1975, Jaco toured with BS&T subbing for Ron McClure and when McClure left in early 1976, Colomby arranged for Jaco to join the band, though he stayed for only about three months. On April 1, 1976 Jaco officially joined [[Weather Report]] where he became world-famous. When Jaco left BS&T, he was briefly succeeded by Keith Jones, before Danny Trifan stepped in.\n\nIn 1975, Blood, Sweat & Tears was offered a slot at a Jazz concert to be held in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. The city government viewed the band as a \"rock\" band and was concerned that it would attract a rowdy audience; it threatened to revoke the concert permit if Blood, Sweat & Tears was not removed from the program. Ultimately, concert organizers were only able to force the event forward via judicial injunction. The ensuing litigation reached the United States Supreme Court.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16519529329572741693 City of New Port v. Fact Concerts], Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981)</ref>\n\nIn July 1976 ''[[More Than Ever (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|More Than Ever]]'', produced by [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]] and featuring guest vocals by [[Patti Austin]] and appearances by a host of NYC session players, including pianist [[Richard Tee]], guitarists [[Eric Gale]] and [[Hugh McCracken]], trumpeter [[Jon Faddis]] and [[Eric Weissberg]] (banjo, dobro), was released but sold disappointingly. After it stalled at US #165, Columbia Records dropped the band. At this time Bobby Colomby, BS&T\u2019s sole remaining original member, stopped touring with the group and Don Alias assumed sole percussion duties before leaving as well to make way for Roy McCurdy.\n\nIn 1977, BS&T was signed to [[ABC Records]] and they began working on their next release, ''[[Brand New Day (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Brand New Day]]'' (November 1977). The album was co-produced by Bobby Colomby. But Colomby's direct involvement with the group ceased after its release, although he continued on as sole owner of the Blood Sweat and Tears trademark. ''Brand New Day'' garnered positive reviews but was not a major seller. At this same time BS&T were said to be recording tracks for an instrumental album with a personnel of Tony Klatka, Forrest Buchtel, Dave Bargeron, Bill Tillman, Larry Willis, Danny Trifan, Roy McCurdy and Mike Stern, but this album never materialized.\n\nDuring 1977, the BS&T lineup continued to be ever fluctuating. Stern, Trifan, McCurdy, Buchtel and Tillman all departed to be succeeded respectively by [[Randy Bernsen]], [[Neil Stubenhaus]], Michael Lawrence and [[Gregory Herbert]]. [[Barry Finnerty]] then took over guitar and Chris Albert trumpet when Bernsen and Lawrence left at the close of '77.\n\nIn January 1978, the group undertook a European tour that ended abruptly after 31-year-old saxophonist [[Gregory Herbert]] died of a drug overdose in [[Amsterdam]] on January 31, 1978. Rocked by this shocking turn of events, the group returned home and temporarily ceased activity.\n\nIn 1979, with the encouragement of longtime BS&T manager Fred Heller, who had numerous requests for the band to play more shows, [[David Clayton-Thomas]] decided to continue Blood, Sweat & Tears with an entirely new lineup that consisted of himself and other Canadian musicians (Kenny Marco \u2013 guitar, [[David Piltch]] \u2013 bass, Joe Sealy \u2013 keyboards, Bruce Cassidy \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn, Earl Seymour \u2013 sax, flute, Steve Kennedy \u2013 sax, flute and Sally Chappis \u2013 drums, with Harvey Kogan soon replacing Kennedy and Jack Scarangella succeeding Chappis).\n\nThe group signed to Avenue Records subsidiary label LAX ([[MCA Records]]), with a slightly altered lineup of: David Clayton-Thomas (vocals, guitar), Robert Piltch (guitar), David Piltch (bass), Richard Martinez (keyboards), Bruce Cassidy (trumpet, flugelhorn), Earl Seymour (sax, flute), Vernon Dorge (sax, flute) and a returning Bobby Economou on drums, and with producer and arranger [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], recorded the album  ''[[Nuclear Blues (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Nuclear Blues]]'' (March 1980). The album was yet another attempt to reinvent the group, showcasing the band in a [[funk]] sound environment that recalled such acts as [[Tower of Power]] and LAX labelmates [[War (U.S. band)|War]] (with whom BS&T did several shows in 1980). The album was regarded by many Blood, Sweat & Tears fans as uncharacteristic of the group's best work.\n\nDuring this period, another live album was recorded at The Street Scene in [[Los Angeles, California]] on October 12, 1980 (this was eventually released as ''[[Live (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Live]]'' in February 1995). Robert and David Piltch left shortly before this concert, as did Richard Martinez. They were replaced by Wayne Pedzwiatr on bass, Peter Harris on guitar and Lou Pomanti on keyboards. And [[Mic Gillette]] (from [[Tower of Power]]) replaced Cassidy on trumpet at the tail end of 1980. Following more touring, including Australia, this incarnation of the group disbanded in 1981.\n\nSince he did not own the rights to the Blood Sweat & Tears name, Clayton-Thomas attempted to restart his failed solo career in 1983 after taking some time off. This caused complications during his initial months on the road when promoters would book his group and instead use the Blood, Sweat & Tears name on the marquee. Consequently, his manager at the time, [[Larry Dorr]], negotiated a licensing deal between himself and [[Bobby Colomby]] in 1984 for rights to tour using the band's name.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.replay-records.net/biography/blood-sweat-tears.htm| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears Discography & Biography| publisher = Replay Records| year = 2007| accessdate = 2007-12-26| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229055239/http://www.replay-records.net/biography/blood-sweat-tears.htm| archivedate = 2007-12-29}}</ref>\n\nFor 20 years afterwards, Clayton-Thomas toured the concert circuit with a constantly changing roster of players (see roster below) as \"Blood, Sweat & Tears\" until his final departure in November 2004. Clayton-Thomas, now residing back in his home country of Canada, continues his solo career and does occasional shows using only his name in promotional efforts.\n\nIn 1998, to celebrate thirty years after he first joined the group, David Clayton-Thomas began work on a solo CD titled ''Bloodlines'' that featured a dozen former members of Blood, Sweat & Tears, (Tony Klatka, Fred Lipsius, [[Lew Soloff]], Dave Bargeron, Randy Brecker and others) performing on the album and providing arrangements to some of the songs. Released in 1999, it was first only available at Clayton-Thomas' concerts but made more widely available in 2001.\n\nThe band continued on without Clayton-Thomas. Larry Dorr has been the band's manager (and much more) for over 30 years now, and Blood Sweat & Tears is still one of the most popular touring acts of all time. At last count, the overall number of BS&T members since the beginning is up around 165 total people (see roster below).\n\nOn March 12 and 13, 1993, Al Kooper organized two shows at the Bottom Line in NYC that were advertised as \"''A Silver Anniversary Celebration of the Classic Album The Child Is Father to the Man''\", which featured Al, Randy Brecker, Jim Fielder, Steve Katz and Fred Lipsius playing together for the first time in 25 years, accompanied by [[Anton Fig]], Tom Malone, [[Lew Soloff]], John Simon and [[Jimmy Vivino]], as well as a two-woman chorus and string section.\n\nThe following year, in early February 1994, Al returned to the Bottom Line for his 50th birthday celebration, in which he played with members of his new band plus the Blues Project & BS&T. The BS&T lineup at this show was the same as the 1993 Silver Anniversary show, with the exception of [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]] sitting in for Fielder and [[John Sebastian]] (ex-[[Loving Spoonful]]) contributing harmonica. Colomby would not allow Kooper to use the name Blood, Sweat & Tears, so the two reunions were billed as \"Child Is Father To The Man\". This second show appeared as the CD ''Soul of a Man'' in 1995. According to page 20 of the CD's liner notes, Steve Katz elected not to allow his performances onto the CD, which were digitally replaced by Jimmy Vivino. Bassist Jim Fielder is said{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to have added some parts to the CD as well.\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears continues its heavy touring schedule throughout the world with its current line-up of members, some of whom have been with the band previously during the past two decades. Under the direction of [[Larry Dorr]] and founding member/owner [[Bobby Colomby]], the band has enjoyed something of a resurgence. Blood, Sweat & Tears donates money through its \"Elsie Monica Colomby\" music scholarship fund to deserving schools and students who need help in prolonging their musical education, such as the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=\"Blood, Sweat & Tears\">{{cite web| url = http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/bio.html| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears official homepage| publisher = Blood, Sweat & Tears| year = 2007| accessdate = 2007-12-26| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227144639/http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/bio.html| archivedate = 2007-12-27}}</ref>\n\nSince late 2005, the band has been back touring worldwide with a refreshed line up and, for a few years. The year 2007 witnessed the band's first world tour in a decade. From 2008 through 2010, Steve Katz even returned to appear at BS&T's shows as a special guest. 2011 saw BS&T and Chicago co-headlining a Jazz festival in [[Stuttgart]], Germany on July 9 and they also appeared on the same bill together again at [[Gretna Heritage Festival]] in [[Gretna, Louisiana]] on October 5, 2013.\n\nFrom 2013 till 2018, Blood Sweat and Tears was fronted by [[Bo Bice]], who was the runner-up against [[Carrie Underwood]] in the [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''.\n\nIn 2018 the group decided to replace Bice with former [[Tower of Power]] singer Tom Bowes, who had previously done a brief stint with BS&T back in July through November 2012.\n\nIn 2019 Keith Paluso, from the reality TV show ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'', was chosen as BS&T's new singer.\n\nAll of the band's albums, with the exception of ''Brand New Day'', are currently{{when?|date=April 2019}} available on [[compact disc]]. BS&T's first four albums were reissued by [[Sony Records]] in [[remastered]] editions (typically with bonus material), except for its third album, which has been reissued by [[Mobile Fidelity]]. The later Columbia albums have been reissued by [[Wounded Bird Records]], and [[Rhino Records]] has reissued ''Nuclear Blues''. ''Brand New Day'' was issued on CD in Russia in 2002, although the disc has not received authorization from copyright holders or Record Companies (counterfeit).\n\n== Members ==\n*Keith Paluso:

They are noted for their combination of brass and rock band instrumentation.  The group recorded songs by rock/folk songwriters such as [[Laura Nyro]], [[James Taylor]], [[the Band]] and [[the Rolling Stones]] as well as [[Billie Holiday]] and [[Erik Satie]]. They also incorporated music from [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]] into their arrangements. \n\nThey were originally formed in 1967 in [[New York City]]. Since their beginnings, the band has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel and has encompassed a multitude of musical styles. The band is most notable for their fusion of rock, blues, pop music, horn arrangements and jazz improvisation into a hybrid that came to be known as \"[[jazz-rock]]\". Unlike \"[[jazz fusion]]\" bands, which tend toward virtuosic displays of instrumental facility and some experimentation with electric instruments, the songs of Blood, Sweat & Tears merged the stylings of [[Rock music|rock]], [[Pop music|pop]] and [[R&B]]/[[soul music]] with [[big band]], while also adding elements of 20th-century classical and [[Musical ensemble|small combo]] jazz traditions.\n\n== Al Kooper era ==\n{{ref improve|section|date=October 2017}}\n[[Al Kooper]], [[Jim Fielder]], [[Fred Lipsius]], [[Randy Brecker]], [[Jerry Weiss]], [[Dick Halligan]], [[Steve Katz (musician)|Steve Katz]] and [[Bobby Colomby]] formed the original band.<ref name=\"Larkin\">{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Virgin Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|editor=[[Colin Larkin (writer)|Colin Larkin]]|publisher=[[Virgin Books]]|date=1997|edition=Concise|isbn=1-85227-745-9|page=149}}</ref> The creation of the group was inspired by the \"brass-rock\" ideas of [[the Buckinghams]] and its producer, [[James William Guercio]], as well as the early 1960s Roulette-era [[Maynard Ferguson]] Orchestra (according to Kooper's autobiography).\n\nAl Kooper was the group's initial bandleader, having insisted on that position based on his experiences with [[the Blues Project]], his previous band with Steve Katz,<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> which had been organized as an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] [[Collectivism|collective]]. Jim Fielder was from [[Frank Zappa]]'s [[the Mothers of Invention]] and had played briefly with [[Buffalo Springfield]]. Kooper's fame as a high-profile contributor to various historic sessions of [[Bob Dylan]], [[Jimi Hendrix]] and others was a catalyst for the prominent debut of Blood, Sweat & Tears in the musical [[counterculture]] of the mid-sixties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\n[[File:Blood,Sweat&TearsChildIsFathertotheMan.jpg|thumb]]\nKooper, Colomby, Katz and Fielder did a show as a quartet at the Village Theatre (soon to rename as [[Fillmore East]]) in New York City on September 16, 1967, with [[James Cotton Blues Band]] opening. Fred Lipsius then joined the others a month later. A few more shows were played as a quintet. Lipsius then recruited the other three, Dick Halligan, Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss, who were New York jazz horn players Lipsius knew. The final lineup debuted at the Cafe Au Go Go on November 17\u201319, 1967, then moved over to play [[The Scene (performance venue)|The Scene]] the following week. The band was a hit with the audience, who liked the innovative fusion of [[jazz]] with [[acid rock]] and [[psychedelia]].\n\nAfter signing to [[Columbia Records]], the group released  ''[[Child Is Father to the Man]]''. The album cover was considered quite innovative showing the band members sitting and standing with child-sized versions of themselves. The album slowly picked up in sales despite growing artistic differences among the founding members which resulted in several personnel changes for the second album. Colomby and Katz wanted to move Kooper exclusively to keyboard and composing duties, while hiring a stronger vocalist for the group, causing Kooper's departure in April 1968.<ref name= VH1>{{cite web | url = http://www.vh1.com/artists/az/blood_sweat_and_tears/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears |last=Eder |first=Bruce | publisher = [[VH1]]| year = 2007| accessdate = 2012-08-17}}</ref> He became a [[record producer]] for the Columbia label, but not before arranging some songs that would be on the next BS&T album.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/blood-sweat-and-tears/biography |title=Blood, Sweat and Tears Biography &#124; Rolling Stone |website=Rollingstone.com |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.billboard.com/artist/290885/blood-sweat-tears/biography |title=Blood, Sweat & Tears - Biography &#124; Billboard |work=billboard.com  |accessdate=24 December 2013}}</ref> The group's trumpeters, Randy Brecker and Jerry Weiss, also left and were replaced by [[Lew Soloff]] and Chuck Winfield.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Brecker joined [[Horace Silver]]'s band with his brother [[Michael Brecker|Michael]], and together they eventually formed their own horn-dominated musical outfits, [[Dreams (band)|Dreams]] and [[the Brecker Brothers]].

Trombonist Halligan took up the organ chores and Jerry Hyman joined to take over trombone. With new trumpeters [[Lew_Soloff|Soloff]] and Winfield the now nine-member band debuted at New York's Cafe Au Go Go on June 18, 1968, beginning a two-week residency.\n\n[[File:BS&T cover.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Eponymous 1968 album ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Blood, Sweat & Tears]]'']]\n\nThe group's second album, ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Blood, Sweat & Tears]]'', was produced by [[James William Guercio]] and released in late 1968. It was more pop-oriented, featuring fewer compositions by the band. The record quickly hit the top of the charts, winning [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[Grammy Award]]s over [[the Beatles]]' ''[[Abbey Road]]'', among other nominees.<ref name=\"Larkin\"/> Three hit singles were released from ''Blood, Sweat & Tears:'' a cover of [[Berry Gordy]] and [[Brenda Holloway]]'s \"[[You've Made Me So Very Happy]]\", Clayton-Thomas' \"[[Spinning Wheel (song)|Spinning Wheel]]\", and a version of Nyro's \"[[And When I Die]]\".<ref name=\"Larkin\"/>  Each of these three #2 singles was on ''Billboard Magazine'' 's Hot 100 chart for 13 weeks.\n\nThe commercial and critical acclaim enjoyed by the band in 1969 culminated in an appearance at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]], in which the band enjoyed headliner status.<ref name= VH1 /> The festival's film crew even caught the band's opening number, \"More and More\", as they took to the stage. But the band's manager at the time, Bennett Glotzer, ordered the movie crew to turn off the cameras and leave the stage since the band had not agreed nor been paid to be filmed.\n\nWhile Blood, Sweat & Tears achieved commercial success alongside similarly configured ensembles such as [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] and the [[Electric Flag]], the band had difficulty maintaining its status as a counterculture icon at a time when record company executives deemed this characteristic important as a tool to lure young consumers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} This was compounded by the band going on a [[United States Department of State]]-sponsored tour of Eastern Europe in May/June 1970.<ref name= VH1 /> Any voluntary association with the government was highly unpopular at the time, and the band was ridiculed for it.<ref name= VH1 /> It is now known that the State Department subtly requested the tour in exchange for more amicability on the issuance of a visa to Clayton-Thomas.<ref name= VH1 />\n\nAfter returning to the U.S., the group released ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears 3]]'' (June 1970), produced by [[Roy Halee]] and drummer Colomby. The album was another popular success,<ref name= VH1 /> spawning hit singles with a cover of [[Carole King]]'s \"Hi-De-Ho\" and another Clayton-Thomas composition, \"Lucretia MacEvil\". While this was a successful attempt to re-create the amalgam of styles found on the previous album, the band again depended almost exclusively on cover material. Album reviews sometimes focused solely upon the band's willingness to work with the U.S. State Department, without bothering to discuss the actual music.<ref name= VH1 /> Compounding the image problems of the band was a decision to play at [[Caesars Palace]] on the [[Las Vegas Strip]], widely seen at the time as a mainstream venue for acts that did not engage in radical politics.\n\nIn late 1970, the band provided music for the soundtrack of the film comedy ''[[The Owl and the Pussycat (film)|The Owl and the Pussycat]] '', which starred [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[George Segal]], further damaging the group's underground reputation.\n\nFollowing this period of controversy, the group reconvened in [[San Francisco]] in January 1971 with jazz writer/saxophonist Don Heckman serving as their producer. With [[Dave Bargeron]] replacing Jerry Hyman, they recorded material that would form the basis of their fourth album, ''[[Blood, Sweat & Tears 4|BS&T 4]]'' (June 1971). For the first time since the first album, Blood, Sweat & Tears presented a repertoire of songs composed almost entirely from within the group. Also included on the album is a cover of former member Al Kooper's \"Holy John (John the Baptist)\". Loaded with hooks and a wide variety of moods (featuring such songs as \"Go Down Gamblin'\", \"Lisa, Listen to Me\", \"High on a Mountain\", \"Redemption\"), ''BS&T 4'' broke into the album charts, resulting in a gold record for the group.  However, none of the singles from the album managed to land in the Top 30 on any of the singles charts, and the period after the release of the fourth album began the group's commercial decline.<ref name= VH1 />\n\n== Jerry Fisher era ==\n{{Refimprove section|date=February 2016}}\nAfter playing a final show at [[Anaheim Convention Center]] on December 31, 1971, Clayton-Thomas left in early January 1972 to pursue a solo career. He was briefly replaced by [[Bobby Doyle (jazz vocalist)|Bobby Doyle]] and then [[Jerry Fisher]], who went on to front the next incarnation of Blood, Sweat & Tears. [[Fred Lipsius]] left as well and was briefly replaced by [[Joe Henderson]], before [[Lou Marini]] settled into the new lineup. Another founding member, Dick Halligan, also departed, replaced by jazz pianist [[Larry Willis]] (from the [[Cannonball Adderley]] Quintet), and [[Sweden|Swedish]] guitarist [[Georg Wadenius]], from the popular Swedish outfit [[Made in Sweden (band)|Made in Sweden]], joined as lead guitarist around the same time.\n\nThe new edition of Blood, Sweat & Tears released ''[[New Blood (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|New Blood]]'' in September 1972, which found the group moving into a more overtly jazz-fusion repertoire. The album broke through the Top 40 chart (the last BS&T LP to do so) and spawned a single (\"So Long Dixie\", chart peak: 44) that received some airplay.  Also included on the record was a cover version of Herbie Hancock's \"[[Maiden Voyage (composition)|Maiden Voyage]]\", featuring the voice/guitar soloing of [[Georg Wadenius]].\n\nIn January 1973, Katz left to pursue a career as a producer (for [[Lou Reed]] and others). Winfield departed as well, in March, and was replaced by [[Tom Malone (musician)|Tom Malone]].\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears' next album, ''[[No Sweat (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|No Sweat]]'' (June 1973), continued in a jazz-fusion vein and featured intricate horn work. Tom Malone's stay in the band was brief and he left to make way for jazz trumpeter [[John Madrid]]. But Madrid's tenure was likewise short-lived and he never recorded with the band. Both Madrid and [[Lew_Soloff|Soloff]] left in late 1973, making way for new horn player/arranger Tony Klatka on their next release,  ''[[Mirror Image (BS&T album)|Mirror Image]]'' (July 1974), which also saw the addition of vocalist/saxophonist Jerry LaCroix (formerly of [[Edgar Winter]]'s White Trash), sax player Bill Tillman, bassist [[Ron McClure]] and the exodus of original bass player [[Jim Fielder]]. This recording features the adoption of a sound pitched between [[Philadelphia soul|Philly Soul]] and the mid-1970s albums by [[Herbie Hancock]]'s [[The Headhunters|Headhunters]], along with aspirations to [[Chick Corea]]'s jazz-fusion group [[Return to Forever]].\n\nJerry LaCroix left BS&T to join [[Rare Earth (band)|Rare Earth]] after playing his final show with them at [[Wollman Rink]] in New York's [[Central Park]] on July 27, 1974. [[Luther Kent]], a blues singer from [[New Orleans]], was recruited to replace LaCroix.\n\n== Reformations ==\n{{ref improve|section|date=October 2017}}\nBy the close of 1974, Jerry Fisher decided that he was tired by BS&T's heavy touring schedule, so Bobby Colomby, together with the band's manager Fred Heller, engineered the return of David Clayton-Thomas in the hope of restoring the band to its former level of success. Clayton-Thomas agreed and met the current group at a concert in [[Milwaukee]] while Jerry Fisher and Luther Kent were still with the band. All three singers ended up on stage together before a wildly enthusiastic crowd.\n\nThe next album, ''[[New City (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|New City]]'' in April 1975, featured Clayton-Thomas back fronting the band and contained half cover tunes ([[Janis Ian]], [[Randy Newman]], [[the Beatles]], [[Blues Image]]) and half original material. New horn player Joe Giorgianni joined for ''[[New City (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|New City]]'', which charted higher (#47) than any of their previous albums since ''New Blood''. This was chiefly the result of an entry in the singles charts with a cover of the Beatles' \"[[Got to Get You into My Life]]\", which peaked at #62. But it still did not sell as well as albums from the group's 1969\u201371 commercial peak period.\n\n[[File:Jaco Pastorius 1986.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Bassist [[Jaco Pastorius]], with [[Jorma Kaukonen]] (rear, left) performing in the Lone Star, New York City]]\nIn the summer of 1975, BS&T recorded a live album that was released in [[Europe]] and [[Japan]] the following year as ''[[In Concert (Blood Sweat & Tears album)|In Concert]]''. This very same album was later released in the US as ''[[Live and Improvised]]'' in May 1991. The album featured different guitarists on different nights: Georg Wadenius, [[Steve Khan]] and [[Mike Stern]], the latter who took over permanently for a time (Jeff Richman filled in for Stern in mid-1976). Jazz percussionist [[Don Alias]] was also present for the live album. After its recording, Joe Giorgianni left and was replaced by Forrest Buchtel (formerly of [[Woody Herman]]'s band).\n\nAround the same time, Bobby Colomby discovered a talented bass player by the name of [[Jaco Pastorius]] in [[Florida]]. He produced Jaco's first solo album in the autumn of 1975, which was released in the spring of 1976. In late 1975, Jaco toured with BS&T subbing for Ron McClure and when McClure left in early 1976, Colomby arranged for Jaco to join the band, though he stayed for only about three months. On April 1, 1976 Jaco officially joined [[Weather Report]] where he became world-famous. When Jaco left BS&T, he was briefly succeeded by Keith Jones, before Danny Trifan stepped in.\n\nIn 1975, Blood, Sweat & Tears was offered a slot at a Jazz concert to be held in [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. The city government viewed the band as a \"rock\" band and was concerned that it would attract a rowdy audience; it threatened to revoke the concert permit if Blood, Sweat & Tears was not removed from the program. Ultimately, concert organizers were only able to force the event forward via judicial injunction. The ensuing litigation reached the United States Supreme Court.<ref>[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=16519529329572741693 City of New Port v. Fact Concerts], Inc., 453 U.S. 247 (1981)</ref>\n\nIn July 1976 ''[[More Than Ever (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|More Than Ever]]'', produced by [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]] and featuring guest vocals by [[Patti Austin]] and appearances by a host of NYC session players, including pianist [[Richard Tee]], guitarists [[Eric Gale]] and [[Hugh McCracken]], trumpeter [[Jon Faddis]] and [[Eric Weissberg]] (banjo, dobro), was released but sold disappointingly. After it stalled at US #165, Columbia Records dropped the band. At this time Bobby Colomby, BS&T\u2019s sole remaining original member, stopped touring with the group and Don Alias assumed sole percussion duties before leaving as well to make way for Roy McCurdy.\n\nIn 1977, BS&T was signed to [[ABC Records]] and they began working on their next release, ''[[Brand New Day (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Brand New Day]]'' (November 1977). The album was co-produced by Bobby Colomby. But Colomby's direct involvement with the group ceased after its release, although he continued on as sole owner of the Blood Sweat and Tears trademark. ''Brand New Day'' garnered positive reviews but was not a major seller. At this same time BS&T were said to be recording tracks for an instrumental album with a personnel of Tony Klatka, Forrest Buchtel, Dave Bargeron, Bill Tillman, Larry Willis, Danny Trifan, Roy McCurdy and Mike Stern, but this album never materialized.\n\nDuring 1977, the BS&T lineup continued to be ever fluctuating. Stern, Trifan, McCurdy, Buchtel and Tillman all departed to be succeeded respectively by [[Randy Bernsen]], [[Neil Stubenhaus]], Michael Lawrence and [[Gregory Herbert]]. [[Barry Finnerty]] then took over guitar and Chris Albert trumpet when Bernsen and Lawrence left at the close of '77.\n\nIn January 1978, the group undertook a European tour that ended abruptly after 31-year-old saxophonist [[Gregory Herbert]] died of a drug overdose in [[Amsterdam]] on January 31, 1978. Rocked by this shocking turn of events, the group returned home and temporarily ceased activity.\n\nIn 1979, with the encouragement of longtime BS&T manager Fred Heller, who had numerous requests for the band to play more shows, [[David Clayton-Thomas]] decided to continue Blood, Sweat & Tears with an entirely new lineup that consisted of himself and other Canadian musicians (Kenny Marco \u2013 guitar, [[David Piltch]] \u2013 bass, Joe Sealy \u2013 keyboards, Bruce Cassidy \u2013 trumpet, flugelhorn, Earl Seymour \u2013 sax, flute, Steve Kennedy \u2013 sax, flute and Sally Chappis \u2013 drums, with Harvey Kogan soon replacing Kennedy and Jack Scarangella succeeding Chappis).\n\nThe group signed to Avenue Records subsidiary label LAX ([[MCA Records]]), with a slightly altered lineup of: David Clayton-Thomas (vocals, guitar), Robert Piltch (guitar), David Piltch (bass), Richard Martinez (keyboards), Bruce Cassidy (trumpet, flugelhorn), Earl Seymour (sax, flute), Vernon Dorge (sax, flute) and a returning Bobby Economou on drums, and with producer and arranger [[Jerry Goldstein (record producer, musician)|Jerry Goldstein]], recorded the album  ''[[Nuclear Blues (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Nuclear Blues]]'' (March 1980). The album was yet another attempt to reinvent the group, showcasing the band in a [[funk]] sound environment that recalled such acts as [[Tower of Power]] and LAX labelmates [[War (U.S. band)|War]] (with whom BS&T did several shows in 1980). The album was regarded by many Blood, Sweat & Tears fans as uncharacteristic of the group's best work.\n\nDuring this period, another live album was recorded at The Street Scene in [[Los Angeles, California]] on October 12, 1980 (this was eventually released as ''[[Live (Blood, Sweat & Tears album)|Live]]'' in February 1995). Robert and David Piltch left shortly before this concert, as did Richard Martinez. They were replaced by Wayne Pedzwiatr on bass, Peter Harris on guitar and Lou Pomanti on keyboards. And [[Mic Gillette]] (from [[Tower of Power]]) replaced Cassidy on trumpet at the tail end of 1980. Following more touring, including Australia, this incarnation of the group disbanded in 1981.\n\nSince he did not own the rights to the Blood Sweat & Tears name, Clayton-Thomas attempted to restart his failed solo career in 1983 after taking some time off. This caused complications during his initial months on the road when promoters would book his group and instead use the Blood, Sweat & Tears name on the marquee. Consequently, his manager at the time, [[Larry Dorr]], negotiated a licensing deal between himself and [[Bobby Colomby]] in 1984 for rights to tour using the band's name.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.replay-records.net/biography/blood-sweat-tears.htm| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears Discography & Biography| publisher = Replay Records| year = 2007| accessdate = 2007-12-26| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229055239/http://www.replay-records.net/biography/blood-sweat-tears.htm| archivedate = 2007-12-29}}</ref>\n\nFor 20 years afterwards, Clayton-Thomas toured the concert circuit with a constantly changing roster of players (see roster below) as \"Blood, Sweat & Tears\" until his final departure in November 2004. Clayton-Thomas, now residing back in his home country of Canada, continues his solo career and does occasional shows using only his name in promotional efforts.\n\nIn 1998, to celebrate thirty years after he first joined the group, David Clayton-Thomas began work on a solo CD titled ''Bloodlines'' that featured a dozen former members of Blood, Sweat & Tears, (Tony Klatka, Fred Lipsius, [[Lew Soloff]], Dave Bargeron, Randy Brecker and others) performing on the album and providing arrangements to some of the songs. Released in 1999, it was first only available at Clayton-Thomas' concerts but made more widely available in 2001.\n\nThe band continued on without Clayton-Thomas. Larry Dorr has been the band's manager (and much more) for over 30 years now, and Blood Sweat & Tears is still one of the most popular touring acts of all time. At last count, the overall number of BS&T members since the beginning is up around 165 total people (see roster below).\n\nOn March 12 and 13, 1993, Al Kooper organized two shows at the Bottom Line in NYC that were advertised as \"''A Silver Anniversary Celebration of the Classic Album The Child Is Father to the Man''\", which featured Al, Randy Brecker, Jim Fielder, Steve Katz and Fred Lipsius playing together for the first time in 25 years, accompanied by [[Anton Fig]], Tom Malone, [[Lew Soloff]], John Simon and [[Jimmy Vivino]], as well as a two-woman chorus and string section.\n\nThe following year, in early February 1994, Al returned to the Bottom Line for his 50th birthday celebration, in which he played with members of his new band plus the Blues Project & BS&T. The BS&T lineup at this show was the same as the 1993 Silver Anniversary show, with the exception of [[Will Lee (bassist)|Will Lee]] sitting in for Fielder and [[John Sebastian]] (ex-[[Loving Spoonful]]) contributing harmonica. Colomby would not allow Kooper to use the name Blood, Sweat & Tears, so the two reunions were billed as \"Child Is Father To The Man\". This second show appeared as the CD ''Soul of a Man'' in 1995. According to page 20 of the CD's liner notes, Steve Katz elected not to allow his performances onto the CD, which were digitally replaced by Jimmy Vivino. Bassist Jim Fielder is said{{by whom|date=April 2015}} to have added some parts to the CD as well.\n\nBlood, Sweat & Tears continues its heavy touring schedule throughout the world with its current line-up of members, some of whom have been with the band previously during the past two decades. Under the direction of [[Larry Dorr]] and founding member/owner [[Bobby Colomby]], the band has enjoyed something of a resurgence. Blood, Sweat & Tears donates money through its \"Elsie Monica Colomby\" music scholarship fund to deserving schools and students who need help in prolonging their musical education, such as the victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].<ref name=\"Blood, Sweat & Tears\">{{cite web| url = http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/bio.html| title = Blood, Sweat & Tears official homepage| publisher = Blood, Sweat & Tears| year = 2007| accessdate = 2007-12-26| url-status = dead| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071227144639/http://www.bloodsweatandtears.com/bio.html| archivedate = 2007-12-27}}</ref>\n\nSince late 2005, the band has been back touring worldwide with a refreshed line up and, for a few years. The year 2007 witnessed the band's first world tour in a decade. From 2008 through 2010, Steve Katz even returned to appear at BS&T's shows as a special guest. 2011 saw BS&T and Chicago co-headlining a Jazz festival in [[Stuttgart]], Germany on July 9 and they also appeared on the same bill together again at [[Gretna Heritage Festival]] in [[Gretna, Louisiana]] on October 5, 2013.\n\nFrom 2013 till 2018, Blood Sweat and Tears was fronted by [[Bo Bice]], who was the runner-up against [[Carrie Underwood]] in the [[American Idol (season 4)|fourth season]] of ''[[American Idol]]''.\n\nIn 2018 the group decided to replace Bice with former [[Tower of Power]] singer Tom Bowes, who had previously done a brief stint with BS&T back in July through November 2012.\n\nIn 2019 Keith Paluso, from the reality TV show ''[[The Voice (franchise)|The Voice]]'', was chosen as BS&T's new singer.\n\nAll of the band's albums, with the exception of ''Brand New Day'', are currently{{when?|date=April 2019}} available on [[compact disc]]. BS&T's first four albums were reissued by [[Sony Records]] in [[remastered]] editions (typically with bonus material), except for its third album, which has been reissued by [[Mobile Fidelity]]. The later Columbia albums have been reissued by [[Wounded Bird Records]], and [[Rhino Records]] has reissued ''Nuclear Blues''. ''Brand New Day'' was issued on CD in Russia in 2002, although the disc has not received authorization from copyright holders or Record Companies (counterfeit).\n\n== Members ==\n*Keith Paluso:

The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon have yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they did participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but it was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification\u2014AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011 but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing at the bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. As hosts, they have finished third\u2014once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media. Their home kit is primarily red and their away kit white, a reference to their [[Flag of Lebanon|national flag]]. After a steady decline in their [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA ranking]] from 1998 to 2016, Lebanon jumped 66 places (from 147th in 2016 to 81st in 2018) and reached their highest rank to date\u201477th\u2014in September 2018.

since their inception in 1933. The squad is governed by the [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC) continentally, and [[FIFA]] worldwide. While Lebanon is yet to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they have participated twice in the [[AFC Asian Cup|Asian Cup]]: in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|2000]], when they hosted the event, and in [[2019 Asian Cup|2019]], the first time through regular qualification. Lebanon's main venue is the [[Camille Chamoun Sports City Stadium]] in [[Beirut]], however they also play in other locations such as the [[Saida International Stadium]] in [[Sidon]].\n\nIn 1934, Lebanon played their first match against the Romanian side [[CA Timi\u0219oara]] (T.A.C.), but was not ratified by FIFA. [[1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match|Lebanon's first FIFA-recognized game]], however, was played in 1940 against [[Mandatory Palestine national football team|Mandatory Palestine]]. During their [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2014 qualification campaign]] for the World Cup, Lebanon reached the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 AFC Fourth Round|fourth round]] of qualifying for the first time thanks to a 2\u20131 victory against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] at home in 2011, but failed to qualify for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] by finishing bottom of that group. At the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019 Asian Cup]], Lebanon were close to qualifying to the knock-out stages for the first time. However, they lost a tiebreaker to [[Vietnam national football team|Vietnam]] in the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup#Ranking of third-placed teams|third-place ranking]] on the fair play rule and were knocked out of the competition at the group stage. Lebanon also competes in the [[WAFF Championship]], the [[Arab Nations Cup]] and the [[Football at the Pan Arab Games|Pan Arab Games]]. They have finished third once at the Arab Nations Cup and twice at the Pan Arab Games, in all three occasions as hosts.\n\nInspired by their [[Cedrus libani|national symbol]], the Lebanese team is known as \"the Cedars\" ({{lang-ar|\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0631\u0632}}) by fans and media.

Bookending his work on ''Mission: Impossible'', Graves starred in two [[television pilot|pilot films]] called ''Call to Danger'', which were an attempt to create a ''Mission: Impossible''\u2013style series in which Graves played a government agent (the Bureau of National Resources) who recruited civilians with special talents for secret missions.<ref name=\"inbaseline1\"/><ref>{{IMDb title|0453002|Call to Danger (1968) (TV)}}</ref><ref>{{IMDb title|0069835|Call to Danger (1973) (TV)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:PeterGravesStarOct09.jpg|thumb|left|Graves attending a ceremony to receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in October 2009]]\n[[File:PeterGravesJoanEndressOct09.jpg|thumb|Graves with wife Joan Endress in October 2009]]\n\nThe 1960s version of the pilot, according to Patrick White in ''The Complete Mission: Impossible Dossier'' (which White reports was actually the second such pilot, but Graves was not involved in the first), is credited with winning Graves the role of Phelps; after ''Mission: Impossible'' ended in 1973, Graves filmed a third version of the pilot (this one structured as a [[Television film|made-for-TV movie]]), but it did not sell as a series. The concept was later used in the brief 1980s adventure series ''[[Masquerade (TV series)|Masquerade]]''.\n\nDuring the 1990s, he hosted and narrated the documentary series ''[[Biography (TV series)|Biography]]'' on [[A&E Network|A&E]].<ref name=\"inbaseline1\"/> He also acted in a number of films featured on ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]'', which subsequently featured running jokes about Graves' ''Biography'' work and presumed sibling rivalry with Arness. The films that have been featured on ''Mystery Science Theater 3000'' include ''[[SST: Death Flight]]'', ''[[It Conquered the World]]'', ''[[Beginning of the End (film)|Beginning of the End]]'', and ''[[Parts: The Clonus Horror]]''.  The film ''[[Killers from Space]]'' was featured in ''[[The Film Crew]]'', [[Michael J. Nelson|Michael J. Nelson's]] follow-up to ''[[MST3K]]''.<ref name=\"inbaseline1\"/> Graves himself [[parody|parodied]] his ''Biography'' work in the film ''[[Men in Black II]]'', hosting an expos\u00e9 television show. He also played Colonel John Camden in the television series ''[[7th Heaven (TV series)|7th Heaven]]''.\n\nGraves refused to reprise the role of Jim Phelps (played by [[Jon Voight]]) in the [[Mission: Impossible (film)|first 1996 theatrical film]] of ''Mission: Impossible'', after the character was revealed to be a traitor and the villain of the film. In the film, Phelps murders three fellow IMF agents, and is killed in a helicopter crash at the end, a decision that disappointed Graves and fellow cast members, and upset many fans of the original series.<ref name=\"CNN obit\" />\n\nOn October 30, 2009, Graves was honoured with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] at 6667 Hollywood Blvd.<ref name=\"CNN obit\" />\n\n[[AirTran Airways]] featured Graves in a series of web-only \"Internetiquette\" videos in 2009 in which Graves appeared in a pilot's uniform and references classic ''Airplane!'' lines.<ref name=netiq>[https://web.archive.org/web/20000520042019/http://www.internetiquette.com/ \"Internetiquette\"] ''[[AirTran Airways]]''.

{"title_page": "Ising model", "text_new": "{{short description|Mathematical model of ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics}}\n{{Statistical mechanics|cTopic=Models}}\n\nThe '''Ising model''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|a\u026a|s|\u026a|\u014b}}; {{IPA-de|\u02c8i\u02d0z\u026a\u014b|lang}}), named after the physicist [[Ernst Ising]], is a [[mathematical models in physics|mathematical model]] of [[ferromagnetism]] in [[statistical mechanics]]. The model consists of [[discrete variables]] that represent [[Nuclear magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moments of atomic \"spins\"]] that can be in one of two states (+1 or \u22121). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (where the local structure repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. The model allows the identification of [[phase transition]]s, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional [[square-lattice Ising model]] is one of the simplest statistical models to show a [[phase transition]].<ref>See {{harvtxt|Gallavotti|1999}}, Chapters VI-VII.</ref>\n\nThe Ising model was invented by the physicist {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Wilhelm Lenz|first=Wilhelm|last=Lenz|year=1920}}, who gave it as a problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional Ising model was solved by {{harvtxt|Ising|1925}} himself in his 1924 thesis;<ref>[http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Ising/isi_fm00.html Ernst Ising, ''Contribution to the Theory of Ferromagnetism'']</ref> it has no phase transition. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is much harder and was only given an analytic description much later, by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Lars Onsager|first=Lars |last=Onsager|year=1944}}. It is usually solved by a [[transfer-matrix method]], although there exist different approaches, more related to [[quantum field theory]].\n\nIn dimensions greater than four, the phase transition of the Ising model is described by [[mean field theory]].\n\n==Definition==\nConsider a set \u039b of lattice sites, each with a set of adjacent sites (e.g. a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) forming a ''d''-dimensional lattice.  For each lattice site ''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b there is a discrete variable \u03c3<sub>''k''</sub> such that \u03c3<sub>''k''</sub> &nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{+1,&nbsp;\u22121}, representing the site's spin. A ''spin configuration'', \u03c3&nbsp;=&nbsp;(\u03c3<sub>''k''</sub>)<sub>''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b</sub> is an assignment of spin value to each lattice site.\n\nFor any two adjacent sites ''i'',&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2208 \u039b there is an ''interaction'' ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub>. Also a site ''j''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b has an ''external magnetic field'' ''h''<sub>''j''</sub> interacting with it. The ''energy'' of a configuration \u03c3 is given by the [[Hamiltonian function]]\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -\\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j - \\mu \\sum_j h_j \\sigma_j,</math>\n\nwhere the first sum is over pairs of adjacent spins (every pair is counted once). The notation \u27e8''ij''\u27e9 indicates that sites ''i'' and ''j'' are nearest neighbors. The [[magnetic moment]] is given by \u00b5. Note that the sign in the second term of the Hamiltonian above should actually be positive because the electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin, but the negative term is used conventionally.<ref>See {{harvtxt|Baierlein|1999}}, Chapter 16.</ref> The ''configuration probability'' is given by the  [[Boltzmann distribution]] with [[inverse temperature]] \u03b2 \u2265 0:\n\n: <math>P_\\beta(\\sigma) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta H(\\sigma)}}{Z_\\beta},</math>\n\nwhere \u03b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'')<sup>\u22121</sup>, and the normalization constant\n\n: <math>Z_\\beta = \\sum_\\sigma e^{-\\beta H(\\sigma)}</math>\n\nis the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]].

Using this sign convention, Ising models can be classified according to the sign of the interaction: if, for a pair ''i'',&nbsp;''j''\n: <math>J_{ij} > 0</math>, the interaction is called [[ferromagnetic]],\n: <math>J_{ij} < 0</math>, the interaction is called [[antiferromagnetic]],\n: <math>J_{ij} = 0</math>, the spins are ''noninteracting''.\n\nThe system is called ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic if all interactions are ferromagnetic or all are antiferromagnetic.  The original Ising models were ferromagnetic, and it is still often assumed that \"Ising model\" means a ferromagnetic Ising model.\n\nIn a ferromagnetic Ising model, spins desire to be aligned: the configurations in which adjacent spins are of the same sign have higher probability. In an antiferromagnetic model, adjacent spins tend to have opposite signs.\n\nThe sign convention of ''H''(\u03c3) also explains how a spin site ''j'' interacts with the external field. Namely, the spin site wants to line up with the external field. If:\n: <math>h_j > 0</math>, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the positive direction,\n: <math>h_j < 0</math>, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the negative direction,\n: <math>h_j = 0</math>, there is no external influence on the spin site.\n\n===Simplifications===\nIsing models are often examined without an external field interacting with the lattice, that is, ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for all ''j'' in the lattice \u039b. Using this simplification, the Hamiltonian becomes\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -\\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j.</math>\n\nWhen the external field is everywhere zero, ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the Ising model is symmetric under switching the value of the spin in all the lattice sites; a nonzero field breaks this symmetry.\n\nAnother common simplification is to assume that all of the nearest neighbors \u27e8''ij''\u27e9 have the same interaction strength. Then we can set ''J<sub>ij</sub>'' = ''J'' for all pairs ''i'',&nbsp;''j'' in \u039b. In this case the Hamiltonian is further simplified to\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j.</math>\n\n===Questions===\nA significant number of statistical questions to ask about this model are in the limit of large numbers of spins:\n* In a typical configuration, are most of the spins +1 or \u22121, or are they split equally?\n* If a spin at any given position ''i'' is 1, what is the probability that the spin at position ''j'' is also 1?\n* If ''\u03b2'' is changed, is there a phase transition?\n* On a lattice \u039b, what is the fractal dimension of the shape of a large cluster of +1 spins?\n\n==Basic properties and history==\n[[File:Ising-tartan.png|thumb|right|Visualization of the translation-invariant probability measure of the one-dimensional Ising model]]\n\nThe most studied case of the Ising model is the translation-invariant ferromagnetic zero-field model on a ''d''-dimensional lattice, namely, \u039b&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''Z'''<sup>''d''</sup>, ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;1, ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\nIn his 1924 PhD thesis, Ising solved the model for the ''d''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 case, which can be thought of as a linear horizontal lattice where each site only interacts with its left and right neighbor.  In one dimension, the solution admits no [[phase transition]].<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://users-phys.au.dk/fogedby/statphysII/no-PT-in-1D.pdf |title=Solving the 3d Ising Model with the Conformal Bootstrap II.

Onsager showed that the [[correlation function]]s and [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the Ising model are determined by a noninteracting lattice fermion. Onsager announced the formula for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] for the 2-dimensional model in 1949 but did not give a derivation. {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} gave the first published proof of this formula, using a [[Szeg\u0151 limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Fredholm determinant]]s, proved in 1951 by [[G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151|Szeg\u0151]] in direct response to Onsager's work.<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\">{{harvnb|Montroll|Potts|Ward|1963|pages=308\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n==Historical significance==\nOne of [[Democritus]]' arguments in support of [[atomism]] was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam. His idea was that small changes in atomic-scale properties would lead to big changes in the aggregate behavior. Others believed that matter is inherently continuous, not atomic, and that the large-scale properties of matter are not reducible to basic atomic properties.\n\nWhile the laws of chemical binding made it clear to nineteenth century chemists that atoms were real, among physicists the debate continued well into the early twentieth century. Atomists, notably [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], applied Hamilton's formulation of Newton's laws to large systems, and found that the [[statistical mechanics|statistical behavior]] of the atoms  correctly describes room temperature gases. But classical statistical mechanics did not account for all of the properties of liquids and solids, nor of gases at low temperature.\n\nOnce modern [[quantum mechanics]] was formulated, atomism was no longer in conflict with experiment, but this did not lead to a universal acceptance of statistical mechanics, which went beyond atomism.  [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] had given a complete formalism to reproduce the laws of thermodynamics from the laws of mechanics. But many faulty arguments survived from the 19th century, when statistical mechanics was considered dubious. The lapses in intuition mostly stemmed from the fact that the limit of an infinite statistical system has many [[Zero\u2013one law (disambiguation)|zero-one law]]s which are absent in finite systems: an infinitesimal change in a parameter can lead to big differences in the overall, aggregate behavior, as Democritus expected.\n\n===No phase transitions in finite volume===\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, some believed that the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] could never describe a phase transition, based on the following argument:\n\n# The partition function is a sum of ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b2''E''</sup> over all configurations.\n# The exponential function is everywhere [[analytic function|analytic]] as a function of \u03b2.\n# The sum of analytic functions is an analytic function.\n\nThis argument works for a finite sum of exponentials, and correctly establishes that there are no singularities in the free energy of a system of a finite size. For systems which are in the thermodynamic limit (that is, for infinite systems) the infinite sum can lead to singularities. The convergence to the thermodynamic limit is fast, so that the phase behavior is apparent already on a relatively small lattice, even though the singularities are smoothed out by the system's finite size.\n\nThis was first established by [[Rudolf Peierls]] in the Ising model.\n\n===Peierls droplets===\nShortly after Lenz and Ising constructed the Ising model, Peierls was able to explicitly show that a phase transition occurs in two dimensions.\n\nTo do this, he compared the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. At infinite temperature (\u03b2&nbsp;= 0) all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus are represented by black and white, they look like [[noise (video)|television snow]]. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little bit, but the screen stays randomly looking, and there is no net excess of black or white.\n\nA quantitative measure of the excess is the '''magnetization''', which is the average value of the spin:\n\n: <math>M = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sigma_i.</math>\n\nA bogus argument analogous to the argument in the last section now establishes that the magnetization in the Ising model is always zero.\n# Every configuration of spins has equal energy to the configuration with all spins flipped.\n# So for every configuration with magnetization ''M'' there is a configuration with magnetization \u2212''M'' with equal probability.\n# The system should therefore spend equal amounts of time in the configuration with magnetization ''M'' as with magnetization \u2212''M''.\n# So the average magnetization (over all time) is zero.\n\nAs before, this only proves that the average magnetization is zero at any finite volume. For an infinite system, fluctuations might not be able to push the system from a mostly plus state to a mostly minus with a nonzero probability.\n\nFor very high temperatures, the magnetization is zero, as it is at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation \u03b5 with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like \u03b5<sup>2</sup>. For two spins separated by distance ''L'', the amount of correlation goes as \u03b5<sup>''L''</sup>, but if there is more than one path by which the correlations can travel, this amount is enhanced by the number of paths.\n\nThe number of paths of length ''L'' on a square lattice in ''d'' dimensions is\n: <math>N(L) = (2d)^L,</math>\nsince there are 2''d'' choices for where to go at each step.\n\nA bound on the total correlation is given by the contribution to the correlation by summing over all paths linking two points, which is bounded above by the sum over all paths of length ''L'' divided by\n: <math>\\sum_L (2d)^L \\varepsilon^L,</math>\nwhich goes to zero when \u03b5 is small.\n\nAt low temperatures (\u03b2 \u226b 1) the configurations are near the lowest-energy configuration, the one where all the spins are plus or all the spins are minus. Peierls asked whether it is statistically possible at low temperature, starting with all the spins minus, to fluctuate to a state where most of the spins are plus. For this to happen, droplets of plus spin must be able to congeal to make the plus state.\n\nThe energy of a droplet of plus spins in a minus background is proportional to the perimeter of the droplet L, where plus spins and minus spins neighbor each other. For a droplet with perimeter ''L'', the area is somewhere between (''L''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2)/2 (the straight line) and (''L''/4)<sup>2</sup> (the square box). The probability cost for introducing a droplet has the factor ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b2''L''</sup>, but this contributes to the partition function multiplied by the total number of droplets with perimeter ''L'', which is less than the total number of paths of length ''L'':\n: <math>N(L) < 4^{2L}.</math>\nSo that the total spin contribution from droplets, even overcounting by allowing each site to have a separate droplet, is bounded above by\n: <math>\\sum_L L^2 4^{2L} e^{-4\\beta L},</math>\n\nwhich goes to zero at large \u03b2. For \u03b2 sufficiently large, this exponentially suppresses long loops, so that they cannot occur, and the magnetization never fluctuates too far from&nbsp;\u22121.\n\nSo Peierls established that the magnetization in the Ising model eventually defines [[superselection sector]]s, separated domains not linked by finite fluctuations.\n\n===Kramers\u2013Wannier duality===\n{{main|Kramers\u2013Wannier duality}}\nKramers and Wannier were able to show that the high-temperature expansion and the low-temperature expansion of the model are equal up to an overall rescaling of the free energy. This allowed the phase-transition point in the two-dimensional model to be determined exactly (under the assumption that there is a unique critical point).\n\n===Yang\u2013Lee zeros===\n{{main|Lee\u2013Yang theorem}}\nAfter Onsager's solution, Yang and Lee investigated the way in which the partition function becomes singular as the temperature approaches the critical temperature.\n\n==Monte Carlo methods for numerical simulation==\n[[File:Ising quench b10.gif|framed|right|Quench of an Ising system on a two-dimensional square lattice (500&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;500) with inverse temperature ''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, starting from a random configuration]]\n\n===Definitions===\nThe Ising model can often be difficult to evaluate numerically if there are many states in the system.

This leads us to the following energy equation for state \u03c3:\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j.</math>\nGiven this Hamiltonian, quantities of interest such as the specific heat or the magnetization of the magnet at a given temperature can be calculated.<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\n===Metropolis algorithm===\n\n====Overview====\nThe [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm]] is the most commonly used Monte Carlo algorithm to calculate Ising model estimations.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> The algorithm first chooses ''selection probabilities'' ''g''(\u03bc, \u03bd), which represent the probability that state \u03bd is selected by the algorithm out of all states, given that one is in state \u03bc. It then uses acceptance probabilities ''A''(\u03bc, \u03bd) so that [[detailed balance]] is satisfied. If the new state \u03bd is accepted, then we move to that state and repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If \u03bd is not accepted then we stay in \u03bc. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes [[ferromagnetic]], meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\nWhen implementing the algorithm, one must ensure that ''g''(\u03bc, \u03bd) is selected such that [[ergodicity]] is met. In [[thermal equilibrium]] a system's energy only fluctuates within a small range.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> This is the motivation behind the concept of '''single-spin-flip dynamics''', which states that in each transition, we will only change one of the spin sites on the lattice.<ref name=\"Newman\" />  Furthermore, by using single- spin-flip dynamics, one can get from any state to any other state by flipping each site that differs between the two states one at a time.\n\nThe maximum amount of change between the energy of the present state, ''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub> and any possible new state's energy ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub> (using single-spin-flip dynamics) is 2''J'' between the spin we choose to \"flip\" to move to the new state and that spin's neighbor.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> Thus, in a 1D Ising model, where each site has two neighbors (left and right), the maximum difference in energy would be 4''J''.\n\nLet ''c'' represent the '''lattice coordination number'''; the number of nearest neighbors that any lattice site has. We assume that all sites have the same number of neighbors due to [[periodic boundary conditions]].<ref name=\"Newman\" /> It is important to note that the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm does not perform well around the critical point due to critical slowing down. Other techniques such as multigrid methods, Niedermayer's algorithm, Swendsen\u2013Wang algorithm, or the Wolff algorithm are required in order to resolve the model near the critical point; a requirement for determining the critical exponents of the system.\n\n====Specification====\nSpecifically for the Ising model and using single-spin-flip dynamics, one can establish the following.\n\nSince there are ''L'' total sites on the lattice, using single-spin-flip as the only way we transition to another state, we can see that there are a total of ''L'' new states \u03bd from our present state \u03bc. The algorithm assumes that the selection probabilities are equal to the ''L'' states: ''g''(\u03bc, \u03bd) = 1/''L''. [[Detailed balance]] tells us that the following equation must hold:\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(\\mu, \\nu)}{P(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{g(\\mu, \\nu) A(\\mu, \\nu)}{g(\\nu, \\mu) A(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{A(\\mu, \\nu)}{A(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{P_\\beta(\\nu)}{P_\\beta(\\mu)} =\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu)}}{\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta(H_\\mu)}} =\ne^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n\nThus, we want to select the acceptance probability for our algorithm to satisfy\n\n: <math>\\frac{A(\\mu, \\nu)}{A(\\nu, \\mu)} = e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n\nIf ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub> > ''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub>, then ''A''(\u03bd, \u03bc) > ''A''(\u03bc, \u03bd). Metropolis sets the larger of ''A''(\u03bc,&nbsp;\u03bd) or ''A''(\u03bd,&nbsp;\u03bc) to be 1. By this reasoning the acceptance algorithm is:<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\n: <math>A(\\mu, \\nu) = \\begin{cases}\n e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}, & \\text{if } H_\\nu - H_\\mu > 0, \\\\\n 1 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe basic form of the algorithm is as follows:\n# Pick a spin site using selection probability ''g''(\u03bc,&nbsp;\u03bd) and calculate the contribution to the energy involving this spin.\n# Flip the value of the spin and calculate the new contribution.\n# If the new energy is less, keep the flipped value.\n# If the new energy is more, only keep with probability <math>e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n# Repeat.\n\nThe change in energy ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub> only depends on the value of the spin and its nearest graph neighbors. So if the graph is not too connected, the algorithm is fast. This process will eventually produce a pick from the distribution.\n\n===Viewing the Ising model as a Markov chain===\nIt is possible to view the Ising model as a [[Markov chain]], as the immediate probability ''P''<sub>\u03b2</sub>(\u03bd) of transitioning to a future state \u03bd only depends on the present state \u03bc. The Metropolis algorithm is actually a version of a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] simulation, and since we use single-spin-flip dynamics in the Metropolis algorithm, every state can be viewed as having links to exactly ''L'' other states, where each transition corresponds to flipping a single spin site to the opposite value.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Teif |first=Vladimir B.|title=General transfer matrix formalism to calculate DNA-protein-drug binding in gene regulation |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |year=2007 |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=e80 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm268 |pmid=17526526 |pmc=1920246}}</ref> Furthermore, since the energy equation ''H''<sub>\u03c3</sub> change only depends on the nearest-neighbor interaction strength ''J'', the Ising model and its variants such the [[Sznajd model]] can be seen as a form of a [[Contact process (mathematics)#Voter model|voter model]] for opinion dynamics.\n\n==One dimension==\nThe thermodynamic limit exists as soon as the interaction decay is <math>J_{ij} \\sim |i - j|^{-\\alpha}</math> with \u03b1 > 1.<ref name=\"Ruelle\">{{cite book |last1=Ruelle |title=Statistical Mechanics:Rigorous Results |publisher=W.\u00a0A.

For ''T'' \u2192 0, though, the inverse correlation length ''c''(\u03b2) vanishes.\n\n====Proof====\nThe proof of this result is a simple computation.\n\nIf ''h'' = 0, it is very easy to obtain the free energy in the case of free boundary condition, i.e. when\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J(\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 + \\cdots + \\sigma_{L-1} \\sigma_L).</math>\nThen the model factorizes under the change of variables\n: <math>\\sigma'_j = \\sigma_j \\sigma_{j-1}, \\quad j \\ge 2.</math>\n\nThis gives\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots, \\sigma_L} e^{\\beta J \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2} e^{\\beta J \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3} \\cdots e^{\\beta J \\sigma_{L-1} \\sigma_L} = 2 \\prod_{j=2}^L \\sum_{\\sigma'_j} e^{\\beta J\\sigma'_j} = 2 \\left[e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}\\right]^{L-1}. </math>\n\nTherefore, the free energy is\n\n: <math>f(\\beta, 0) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left[e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}\\right].</math>\n\nWith the same change of variables\n\n: <math>\\langle\\sigma_j\\sigma_{j+N}\\rangle = \\left[\\frac{e^{\\beta J} - e^{-\\beta J}}{e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}}\\right]^N,</math>\n\nhence it decays exponentially as soon as ''T'' \u2260 0; but for ''T'' = 0, i.e. in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e there is no decay.\n\nIf ''h'' \u2260 0 we need the transfer matrix method. For the periodic boundary conditions case is the following. The partition function is\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_L} e^{\\beta h \\sigma_1} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_1\\sigma_2} e^{\\beta h \\sigma_2} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_2\\sigma_3} \\cdots e^{\\beta h \\sigma_L} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_L\\sigma_1} = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_L} V_{\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2} V_{\\sigma_2,\\sigma_3} \\cdots V_{\\sigma_L,\\sigma_1}.</math>\nThe coefficients <math>V_{\\sigma, \\sigma'}</math> can be seen as the entries of a matrix. There are different possible choices: a convenient one (because the matrix is symmetric) is\n: <math>V_{\\sigma, \\sigma'} = e^{\\frac{\\beta h}{2} \\sigma} e^{\\beta J\\sigma\\sigma'} e^{\\frac{\\beta h}{2} \\sigma'}</math>\nor\n: <math>V = \\begin{bmatrix}\n e^{\\beta(h+J)} & e^{-\\beta J} \\\\\n e^{-\\beta J} & e^{-\\beta(h-J)}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nIn matrix formalism\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\operatorname{Tr} \\left(V^L\\right) = \\lambda_1^L + \\lambda_2^L = \\lambda_1^L \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1}\\right)^L\\right],</math>\nwhere \u03bb<sub>1</sub> is the highest eigenvalue of ''V'', while \u03bb<sub>2</sub> is the other eigenvalue:\n: <math>\\lambda_1 = e^{\\beta J} \\cosh \\beta h + \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J} (\\sinh\\beta h)^2 + e^{-2\\beta J}},</math>\nand |\u03bb<sub>2</sub>| < \u03bb<sub>1</sub>. This gives the formula of the free energy.\n\n====Comments====\nThe energy of the lowest state is \u2212''JL'', when all the spins are the same. For any other configuration, the extra energy is equal to 2''J'' times the number of sign changes that are encountered when scanning the configuration from left to right.\n\nIf we designate the number of sign changes in a configuration as ''k'', the difference in energy from the lowest energy state is 2''k''. Since the energy is additive in the number of flips, the probability ''p'' of having a spin-flip at each position is independent. The ratio of the probability of finding a flip to the probability of not finding one is the Boltzmann factor:\n\n: <math>\\frac{p}{1 - p} = e^{-2\\beta J}.</math>\n\nThe problem is reduced to independent biased [[coin toss]]es. This essentially completes the mathematical description.\n\nFrom the description in terms of independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2\u03b2). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since there is a constant probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to ''p'', so the correlations fall off exponentially.\n\n: <math>\\langle S_i S_j \\rangle \\propto e^{-p|i-j|}.</math>\n\nThe [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is the volume of configurations, each configuration weighted by its Boltzmann weight. Since each configuration is described by the sign-changes, the partition function factorizes:\n\n: <math>Z = \\sum_{\\text{configs}} e^{\\sum_k S_k} = \\prod_k (1 + p ) = (1 + p)^L.</math>\n\nThe logarithm divided by ''L'' is the free energy density:\n\n: <math>\\beta f = \\log(1 + p) = \\log\\left(1 + \\frac{e^{-2\\beta J}}{1 + e^{-2\\beta J}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is [[Analytic function|analytic]] away from \u03b2 = \u221e. A sign of a [[phase transition]] is a non-analytic free energy, so the one-dimensional model does not have a phase transition.\n\n===One-dimensional solution with transverse field===\n\nTo express the Ising Hamiltonian using a quantum mechanical description of spins, we replace the spin variables with their respective Pauli matrices. However, depending on the direction of the magnetic field, we can create a transverse-field or longitudinal-field Hamiltonian. The [[transverse-field Ising model|transverse-field]] Hamiltonian is given by\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{i=1,\\ldots,L} \\sigma_i^z \\sigma_{i+1}^z - h \\sum_i \\sigma_i^x.</math>\n\nThe transverse-field model experiences a phase transition between an ordered and disordered regime at ''J''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''h''.  This can be shown by a mapping of Pauli matrices\n\n: <math>\\sigma_n^z = \\prod_{i=1}^n T_i^x,</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_n^x = T_n^z T_{n+1}^z.</math>\n\nUpon rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of this change-of-basis matrices, we obtain\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -h \\sum_{i=1,\\ldots,L} T_i^z T_{i+1}^z - J \\sum_i T_i^x.</math>\n\nSince the roles of ''h'' and ''J'' are switched, the Hamiltonian undergoes a transition at ''J'' = ''h''.<ref name=\"Chakra\">{{cite book |last1=Suzuki |first1= Sei |last2= Inoue |first2= Jun-ichi |last3= Chakrabarti |first3= Bikas K. |title=Quantum Ising Phases and Transitions in Transverse Ising Models |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-33039-1 |isbn=978-3-642-33038-4 |url= http://cds.cern.ch/record/1513030}}</ref>\n\n==Two dimensions==\n* In the ferromagnetic  case there is a phase transition. At low temperature, the [[Peierls argument]] proves positive magnetization for the nearest neighbor case and then, by the [[Griffiths inequality]], also when longer range interactions are added. Meanwhile, at high temperature, the [[cluster expansion]] gives analyticity of the thermodynamic functions.\n* In the nearest-neighbor case, the free energy was exactly computed by Onsager, through the equivalence of the model with free fermions on lattice. The spin-spin correlation functions were computed by McCoy and Wu.\n\n===Onsager's exact solution===\n{{main|square-lattice Ising model}}\n{{harvtxt|Onsager|1944}} obtained the following analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the anisotropic square lattice when the magnetic field <math>h=0</math> in the thermodynamic limit as a function of temperature and the horizontal and vertical interaction energies <math>J_1</math> and <math>J_2</math>, respectively\n\n:<math> -\\beta f = \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\theta_1\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\theta_2 \\ln[\\cosh(2\\beta J_1)\\cosh(2\\beta J_2) -\\sinh(2\\beta J_1)\\cos(\\theta_1)-\\sinh(2\\beta J_2)\\cos(\\theta_2)]. </math>\n\nFrom this expression for the free energy, all thermodynamic functions of the model can be calculated by using an appropriate derivative. The 2D Ising model was the first model to exhibit a continuous phase transition at a positive temperature. It occurs at the temperature <math>T_c</math> which solves the equation\n\n:<math> \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J_1}{kT_c}\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J_2}{kT_c}\\right) = 1. </math>\n\nIn the isotropic case when the horizontal and vertical interaction energies are equal <math>J_1=J_2=J</math>, the critical temperature <math>T_c</math> occurs at the following point\n\n:<math> T_c = \\frac{2J}{k\\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})} </math>\n\nWhen the interaction energies <math>J_1</math>, <math>J_2</math> are both negative, the Ising model becomes an antiferromagnet. Since the square lattice is bi-partite, it is invariant under this change when the magnetic field <math>h=0</math>, so the free energy and critical temperature are the same for the antiferromagnetic case. For the triangular lattice, which is not bi-partite, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Ising model behave notably differently.\n\n====Transfer matrix====\nStart with an analogy with quantum mechanics. The Ising model on a long periodic lattice has a partition function\n\n:<math>\\sum_S \\exp\\biggl(\\sum_{ij} S_{i,j} S_{i,j+1} + S_{i,j} S_{i+1,j}\\biggr).</math>\n\nThink of the ''i'' direction as ''space'', and the ''j'' direction as ''time''. This is an independent sum over all the values that the spins can take at each time slice. This is a type of [[path integral formulation|path integral]], it is the sum over all spin histories.\n\nA path integral can be rewritten as a Hamiltonian evolution. The Hamiltonian steps through time by performing a unitary rotation between time ''t'' and time ''t'' + \u0394''t'':\n:<math> U = e^{i H \\Delta t}</math>\n\nThe product of the U matrices, one after the other, is the total time evolution operator, which is the path integral we started with.\n\n:<math> U^N = (e^{i H \\Delta t})^N = \\int DX e^{iL}</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of time slices. The sum over all paths is given by a product of matrices, each matrix element is the transition probability from one slice to the next.\n\nSimilarly, one can divide the sum over all partition function configurations into slices, where each slice is the one-dimensional configuration at time 1. This defines the [[Transfer-matrix method|transfer matrix]]:\n:<math>T_{C_1 C_2}.</math>\n\nThe configuration in each slice is a one-dimensional collection of spins. At each time slice, ''T'' has matrix elements between two configurations of spins, one in the immediate future and one in the immediate past. These two configurations are ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub>, and they are all one-dimensional spin configurations. We can think of the vector space that ''T'' acts on as all complex linear combinations of these. Using quantum mechanical notation:\n:<math>|A\\rangle = \\sum_S A(S) |S\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere each basis vector <math>|S\\rangle</math> is a spin configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model.\n\nLike the Hamiltonian, the transfer matrix acts on all linear combinations of states.  The partition function is a matrix function of T, which is defined by the sum over all histories which come back to the original configuration after ''N'' steps:\n:<math>Z= \\mathrm{tr}(T^N).</math>\n\nSince this is a matrix equation, it can be evaluated in any basis. So if we can diagonalize the matrix ''T'', we can find ''Z''.\n\n====''T'' in terms of Pauli matrices====\nThe contribution to the partition function for each past/future pair of configurations on a slice is the sum of two terms. There is the number of spin flips in the past slice and there is the number of spin flips between the past and future slice. Define an operator on configurations which flips the spin at site i:\n\n:<math>\\sigma^x_i.</math>\n\nIn the usual Ising basis, acting on any linear combination of past configurations, it produces the same linear combination but with the spin at position i of each basis vector flipped.\n\nDefine a second operator which multiplies the basis vector by +1 and \u22121 according to the spin at position ''i'':\n\n:<math>\\sigma^z_i.</math>\n\n''T'' can be written in terms of these:\n\n:<math>\\sum_i A \\sigma^x_i + B \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_{i+1}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' and ''B'' are constants which are to be determined so as to reproduce the partition function. The interpretation is that the statistical configuration at this slice contributes according to both the number of spin flips in the slice, and whether or not the spin at position ''i' has flipped.\n\n====Spin flip creation and annihilation operators====\nJust as in the one-dimensional case, we will shift attention from the spins to the spin-flips. The \u03c3<sup>''z''</sup> term in ''T'' counts the number of spin flips, which we can write in terms of spin-flip creation and annihilation operators:\n\n:<math> \\sum C \\psi^\\dagger_i \\psi_i. \\,</math>\n\nThe first term flips a spin, so depending on the basis state it either:\n#moves a spin-flip one unit to the right\n#moves a spin-flip one unit to the left\n#produces two spin-flips on neighboring sites\n#destroys two spin-flips on neighboring sites.\n\nWriting this out in terms of creation and annihilation operators:\n:<math> \\sigma^x_i = D {\\psi^\\dagger}_i \\psi_{i+1} + D^* {\\psi^\\dagger}_i \\psi_{i-1} + C\\psi_i \\psi_{i+1} + C^* {\\psi^\\dagger}_i {\\psi^\\dagger}_{i+1}.</math>\n\nIgnore the constant coefficients, and focus attention on the form. They are all quadratic. Since the coefficients are constant, this means that the ''T'' matrix can be diagonalized by Fourier transforms.\n\nCarrying out the diagonalization produces the Onsager free energy.\n\n====Onsager's formula for spontaneous magnetization====\nOnsager famously announced the following expression for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] ''M'' of a two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet on the square lattice at two different conferences in 1948, though without proof<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\"/>\n:<math>M = \\left(1 - \\left[\\sinh 2\\beta J_1 \\sinh 2\\beta J_2\\right]^{-2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{8}}</math>\nwhere <math>J_1</math> and <math>J_2</math> are horizontal and vertical interaction energies.\n\nA complete derivation was only given in 1951 by {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} using a limiting process of transfer matrix eigenvalues. The proof was subsequently greatly simplified in 1963 by Montroll, Potts, and Ward<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\"/> using [[G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151|Szeg\u0151]]'s [[Szeg\u0151 limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Toeplitz determinant]]s by treating the magnetization as the limit of correlation functions.\n\n==Three and four dimensions==\nIn three dimensions, the Ising model was shown to have a representation in terms of non-interacting fermionic lattice strings by [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]]. The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of the three-dimensional Ising model is described by a [[conformal field theory]], as evidenced by [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm|Monte Carlo]] simulations<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/JHEP07(2013)055| volume = 1307| issue = 7| pages = 055| last1 = Bill\u00f3| first1 = M.| last2 = Caselle| first2 = M.| last3 = Gaiotto| first3 = D.| last4 = Gliozzi| first4 = F.| last5 = Meineri| first5 = M.| last6 = others| title = Line defects in the 3d Ising model| journal = JHEP| date = 2013|bibcode = 2013JHEP...07..055B | arxiv = 1304.4110}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Cosme|first1 = Catarina|last2 = Lopes|first2 = J.

Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]]).\n\n==More than four dimensions==\nIn any dimension, the Ising model can be productively described by a locally varying mean field. The field is defined as the average spin value over a large region, but not so large so as to include the entire system. The field still has slow variations from point to point, as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations in the field are described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.\n\n===Local field===\nThe field ''H'' is defined as the long wavelength Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of ''H'' and not the spins. Once the correlations in ''H'' are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in ''H''.\n\nFor any value of the slowly varying field ''H'', the free energy (log-probability) is a local analytic function of ''H'' and its gradients. The free energy ''F''(''H'') is defined to be the sum over all Ising configurations which are consistent with the long wavelength field. Since ''H'' is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of ''H'', so long as not too much exactness is required for the match.\n\nSince the allowed range of values of the spin in any region only depends on the values of ''H'' within one averaging volume from that region, the free energy contribution from each region only depends on the value of ''H'' there and in the neighboring regions. So ''F'' is a sum over all regions of a local contribution, which only depends on ''H'' and its derivatives.\n\nBy symmetry in ''H'', only even powers contribute. By reflection symmetry on a square lattice, only even powers of gradients contribute. Writing out the first few terms in the free energy:\n\n:<math>\\beta F  =  \\int d^dx \\left[ A H^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^d Z_i (\\partial_i H)^2 + \\lambda H^4 +\\cdots \\right].</math>\n\nOn a square lattice, symmetries guarantee that the coefficients ''Z<sub>i</sub>'' of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an anisotropic Ising model, where the ''Z<sub>i</sub>'''s in different directions are different, the fluctuations in ''H'' are isotropic in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.\n\nOn any lattice, the derivative term\n:<math>Z_{ij} \\, \\partial_i H \\, \\partial_j H </math>\nis a positive definite [[quadratic form]], and can be used to ''define'' the metric for space. So any translationally invariant Ising model is rotationally invariant at long distances, in coordinates that make ''Z<sub>ij</sub>'' = \u03b4<sub>''ij''</sub>. Rotational symmetry emerges spontaneously at large distances just because there aren't very many low order terms. At higher order multicritical points, this [[accidental symmetry]] is lost.\n\nSince \u03b2''F'' is a function of a slowly spatially varying field, the probability of any field configuration is:\n\n:<math>P(H) \\propto e^{ - \\int d^dx \\left[ AH^2 + Z |\\nabla H|^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right]}.</math>\n\nThe statistical average of any product of ''H'' terms is equal to:\n\n:<math>\\langle H(x_1) H(x_2)\\cdots H(x_n) \\rangle = { \\int DH \\, P(H) H(x_1) H(x_2) \\cdots H(x_n) \\over \\int DH \\, P(H) }.</math>\n\nThe denominator in this expression is called the ''partition function'', and the integral over all possible values of ''H'' is a statistical path integral. It integrates exp(\u03b2''F'') over all values of ''H'', over all the long wavelength fourier components of the spins. ''F'' is a Euclidean Lagrangian for the field ''H'', the only difference between this and the [[quantum field theory]] of a scalar field being that all the derivative terms enter with a positive sign, and there is no overall factor of ''i''.\n\n:<math>Z = \\int DH \\, e^{ - \\int d^dx \\left[ A H^2 + Z  |\\nabla H|^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right]}</math>\n\n===Dimensional analysis===\nThe form of ''F'' can be used to predict which terms are most important by dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis is not completely straightforward, because the scaling of ''H'' needs to be determined.\n\nIn the generic case, choosing the scaling law for ''H'' is easy, since the only term that contributes is the first one,\n\n:<math>F = \\int d^dx \\, A H^2.</math>\n\nThis term is the most significant,  but it gives trivial behavior. This form of the free energy is ultralocal, meaning that it is a sum of an independent contribution from each point. This is like the spin-flips in the one-dimensional Ising model. Every value of ''H'' at any point fluctuates completely independently of the value at any other point.\n\nThe scale of the field can be redefined to absorb the coefficient ''A'', and then it is clear that ''A'' only determines the overall scale of fluctuations. The ultralocal model describes the long wavelength high temperature behavior of the Ising model, since in this limit the fluctuation averages are independent from point to point.\n\nTo find the critical point, lower the temperature. As the temperature goes down, the fluctuations in ''H'' go up because the fluctuations are more correlated. This means that the average of a large number of spins does not become small as quickly as if they were uncorrelated, because they tend to be the same. This corresponds to decreasing ''A'' in the system of units where ''H'' does not absorb ''A''. The phase transition can only happen when the subleading terms in ''F'' can contribute, but since the first term dominates at long distances, the coefficient ''A'' must be tuned to zero. This is the location of the critical point:\n\n:<math>F= \\int d^dx  \\left[ t H^2 + \\lambda H^4  + Z (\\nabla H)^2 \\right],</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is a parameter which goes through zero at the transition.\n\nSince ''t'' is vanishing, fixing the scale of the field using this term makes the other terms blow up. Once ''t'' is small, the scale of the field can either be set to fix the coefficient of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term or the (\u2207''H'')<sup>2</sup> term to 1.\n\n===Magnetization===\nTo find the magnetization, fix the scaling of ''H'' so that \u03bb is one. Now the field ''H'' has dimension \u2212''d''/4, so that ''H''<sup>4</sup>''d<sup>d</sup>x'' is dimensionless, and ''Z'' has dimension 2&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''/2. In this scaling, the gradient term is only important at long distances for ''d'' \u2264 4. Above four dimensions, at long wavelengths, the overall magnetization is only affected by the ultralocal terms.\n\nThere is one subtle point. The field ''H'' is fluctuating statistically, and the fluctuations can shift the zero point of ''t''. To see how, consider ''H''<sup>4</sup> split in the following way:\n\n:<math>H(x)^4 = -\\langle H(x)^2\\rangle^2  + 2\\langle H(x)^2\\rangle H(x)^2 + \\left(H(x)^2 - \\langle H(x)^2\\rangle\\right)^2</math>\n\nThe first term is a constant contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in ''t''. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of ''t'' by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted ''t'' that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in ''t'' at any finite ''\u03bb'' is finite, but near the transition ''t'' is very small. The fractional change in ''t'' is very large, and in units where ''t'' is fixed the shift looks infinite.\n\nThe magnetization is at the minimum of the free energy, and this is an analytic equation. In terms of the shifted ''t'',\n\n:<math>{\\partial \\over \\partial H } \\left( t H^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right ) = 2t H + 4\\lambda H^3 = 0</math>\n\nFor ''t'' < 0, the minima are at ''H'' proportional to the square root of ''t''. So Landau's [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]] argument is correct in dimensions larger than 5. The magnetization exponent in dimensions higher than 5 is equal to the mean field value.\n\nWhen ''t'' is negative, the fluctuations about the new minimum are described by a new positive quadratic coefficient. Since this term always dominates, at temperatures below the transition the flucuations again become ultralocal at long distances.\n\n===Fluctuations===\nTo find the behavior of fluctuations, rescale the field to fix the gradient term. Then the length scaling dimension of the field is 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''/2. Now the field has constant quadratic spatial fluctuations at all temperatures. The scale dimension of the ''H''<sup>2</sup> term is 2, while the scale dimension of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term is 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''. For ''d'' < 4, the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term has positive scale dimension. In dimensions higher than 4 it has negative scale dimensions.\n\nThis is an essential difference. In dimensions higher than 4, fixing the scale of the gradient term means that the coefficient of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term is less and less important at longer and longer wavelengths. The dimension at which nonquadratic contributions begin to contribute is known as the critical dimension. In the Ising model, the critical dimension is 4.\n\nIn dimensions above 4, the critical fluctuations are described by a purely quadratic free energy at long wavelengths. This means that the correlation functions are all computable from as [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] averages:\n\n:<math>\\langle S(x)S(y)\\rangle \\propto \\langle H(x)H(y)\\rangle = G(x-y)  = \\int {dk \\over (2\\pi)^d} { e^{ik(x-y)}\\over k^2 + t }</math>\n\nvalid when ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'' is large. The function ''G''(''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'') is the analytic continuation to imaginary time of the [[propagator|Feynman propagator]], since the free energy is the analytic continuation of the quantum field action for a free scalar field. For dimensions 5 and higher, all the other correlation functions at long distances are then determined by [[S-matrix#Wick's theorem|Wick's theorem]]. All the odd moments are zero, by \u00b1 symmetry. The even moments are the sum over all partition into pairs of the product of ''G''(''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'') for each pair.\n\n:<math>\\langle S(x_1) S(x_2) \\cdots S(x_{2n})\\rangle = C^n \\sum G(x_{i1},x_{j1}) G(x_{i2},x_{j2}) \\ldots G(x_{in},x_{jn})</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is the proportionality constant. So knowing ''G'' is enough. It determines all the multipoint correlations of the field.\n\n===The critical two-point function===\nTo determine the form of ''G'', consider that the fields in a path integral obey the classical equations of motion derived by varying the free energy:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                 &&\\left(-\\nabla_x^2 + t\\right) \\langle H(x)H(y) \\rangle &= 0 \\\\\n  \\rightarrow {} &&                                \\nabla^2 G(x) + tG(x) &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is valid at noncoincident points only, since the correlations of ''H'' are singular when points collide. ''H'' obeys classical equations of motion for the same reason that quantum mechanical operators obey them\u2014its fluctuations are defined by a path integral.\n\nAt the critical point ''t'' = 0, this is [[Laplace's equation]], which can be solved by [[Gaussian surface|Gauss's method]] from electrostatics. Define an electric field analog by\n\n:<math>E = \\nabla G</math>\n\nAway from the origin:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot E = 0</math>\n\nsince ''G'' is spherically symmetric in ''d'' dimensions, and ''E'' is the radial gradient of ''G''. Integrating over a large ''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 dimensional sphere,\n\n:<math>\\int d^{d-1}S E_r = \\mathrm{constant}</math>\n\nThis gives:\n\n:<math>E = {C \\over r^{d-1} }</math>\n\nand ''G'' can be found by integrating with respect to ''r''.\n\n:<math>G(r) = {C \\over r^{d-2} }</math>\n\nThe constant ''C'' fixes the overall normalization of the field.\n\n===''G''(''r'') away from the critical point===\nWhen ''t'' does not equal zero, so that ''H'' is fluctuating at a temperature slightly away from critical, the two point function decays at long distances. The equation it obeys is altered:\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2 G  + t G = 0 \\to {1 \\over r^{d - 1}} {d \\over dr} \\left( r^{d-1} {dG \\over dr} \\right) + t G(r) = 0</math>\n\nFor ''r'' small compared with <math>\\sqrt{t}</math>, the solution diverges exactly the same way as in the critical case, but the long distance behavior is modified.\n\nTo see how, it is convenient to represent the two point function as an integral, introduced by Schwinger in the quantum field theory context:\n\n:<math>G(x) = \\int d\\tau  {1 \\over \\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi\\tau}\\right)^d} e^{-{x^2 \\over 4\\tau} - t\\tau}</math>\n\nThis is ''G'', since the Fourier transform of this integral is easy. Each fixed \u03c4 contribution is a Gaussian in ''x'', whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in ''k''.\n\n:<math>G(k) = \\int d\\tau  e^{-(k^2 - t)\\tau} = {1 \\over k^2 - t}</math>\n\nThis is the inverse of the operator \u2207<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t'' in ''k''-space, acting on the unit function in ''k''-space, which is the Fourier transform of a delta function source localized at the origin. So it satisfies the same equation as ''G'' with the same boundary conditions that determine the strength of the divergence at 0.\n\nThe interpretation of the integral representation over the ''proper time'' \u03c4 is that the two point function is the sum over all random walk paths that link position 0 to position ''x'' over time \u03c4. The density of these paths at time \u03c4 at position ''x''  is Gaussian, but the random walkers disappear at a steady rate proportional to ''t'' so that the Gaussian at time \u03c4 is diminished in height by a factor that decreases steadily exponentially. In the quantum field theory context, these are the paths of relativistically localized quanta in a formalism that follows the paths of individual particles. In the pure statistical context, these paths still appear by the mathematical correspondence with quantum fields, but their interpretation is less directly physical.\n\nThe integral representation immediately shows that ''G''(''r'') is positive, since it is represented as a weighted sum of positive Gaussians. It also gives the rate of decay at large r, since the proper time for a random walk to reach position \u03c4 is r<sup>2</sup> and in this time, the Gaussian height has decayed by <math>e^{-t\\tau} = e^{-tr^2}</math>. The decay factor appropriate for position ''r'' is therefore <math>e^{-\\sqrt t r}</math>.\n\nA heuristic approximation for ''G''(''r'') is:\n\n:<math>G(r)  \\approx { e^{-\\sqrt t r} \\over r^{d-2}}</math>\n\nThis is not an exact form, except in three dimensions, where interactions between paths become important. The exact forms in high dimensions are variants of [[Bessel functions]].\n\n===Symanzik polymer interpretation===\nThe interpretation of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the critical dimension of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> interaction is 4. The term ''H''<sup>4</sup> can be thought of as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the ''H''<sup>2</sup> coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.\n\nThe [[fractal dimension]] of an ordinary random walk is 2. The number of balls of size \u03b5 required to cover the path increase as \u03b5<sup>\u22122</sup>. Two objects of fractal dimension 2 will intersect with reasonable probability only in a space of dimension 4 or less, the same condition as for a generic pair of planes. [[Kurt Symanzik]] argued that this implies that the critical Ising fluctuations in dimensions higher than 4 should be described by a free field. This argument eventually became a mathematical proof.\n\n===4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b5'' dimensions \u2013 renormalization group===\nThe Ising model in four dimensions is described by a fluctuating field, but now the fluctuations are interacting. In the polymer representation, intersections of random walks are marginally possible. In  the quantum field continuation, the quanta interact.\n\nThe negative logarithm of the probability of any field configuration ''H'' is the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] function\n\n:<math>F= \\int d^4 x  \\left[ {Z \\over 2} |\\nabla H|^2 + {t\\over 2} H^2  + {\\lambda \\over 4!} H^4 \\right] \\,</math>\n\nThe numerical factors are there to simplify the equations of motion. The goal is to understand the statistical fluctuations. Like any other non-quadratic path integral, the correlation functions have a [[Feynman diagram|Feynman expansion]] as particles travelling along random walks, splitting and rejoining at vertices. The interaction strength is parametrized by the classically dimensionless quantity \u03bb.\n\nAlthough dimensional analysis shows that both \u03bb and ''Z'' are dimensionless, this is misleading. The long wavelength statistical fluctuations are not exactly scale invariant, and only become scale invariant when the interaction strength vanishes.\n\nThe reason is that there is a cutoff used to define ''H'', and the cutoff defines the shortest wavelength. Fluctuations of ''H'' at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.\n\n====Wilson renormalization====\nA quick heuristic way of studying the scaling is to cut off the ''H'' wavenumbers at a point \u03bb. Fourier modes of ''H'' with wavenumbers larger than \u03bb are not allowed to fluctuate. A rescaling of length that make the whole system smaller increases all wavenumbers, and moves some fluctuations above the cutoff.\n\nTo restore the old cutoff, perform a partial integration over all the wavenumbers which used to be forbidden, but are now fluctuating. In Feynman diagrams, integrating over a fluctuating mode at wavenumber ''k'' links up lines carrying momentum ''k'' in a correlation function in pairs, with a factor of the inverse propagator.\n\nUnder rescaling, when the system is shrunk by a factor of (1+''b''), the ''t'' coefficient scales up by a factor (1+''b'')<sup>2</sup> by dimensional analysis. The change in ''t'' for infinitesimal ''b'' is 2''bt''. The other two coefficients are dimensionless and do not change at all.\n\nThe lowest order effect of integrating out can be calculated from the equations of motion:\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2 H + t H = - {\\lambda \\over 6} H^3.</math>\n\nThis equation is an identity inside any correlation function away from other insertions.  After integrating out the modes with \u039b < ''k'' < (1+''b'')\u039b, it will be a slightly different identity.\n\nSince the form of the equation will be preserved, to find the change in coefficients it is sufficient to analyze the change in the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term. In a Feynman diagram expansion, the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term in a correlation function inside a correlation has three dangling lines. Joining two of them at large wavenumber ''k'' gives a change ''H''<sup>3</sup> with one dangling line, so proportional to ''H'':\n\n:<math>\\delta H^3 = 3H \\int_{\\Lambda<|k|<(1 + b)\\Lambda} {d^4k \\over (2\\pi)^4}  {1\\over (k^2 + t)}</math>\n\nThe factor of 3 comes from the fact that the loop can be closed in three different ways.\n\nThe integral should be split into two parts:\n\n:<math>\\int dk {1 \\over k^2} - t \\int dk { 1\\over k^2(k^2 + t)} = A\\Lambda^2 b + B  b t</math>\n\nThe first part is not proportional to ''t'', and in the equation of motion it can be absorbed by a constant shift in ''t''. It is caused by the fact that the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term has a linear part. Only the second term, which varies from ''t'' to ''t'', contributes to the critical scaling.\n\nThis new linear term adds to the first term on the left hand side, changing ''t'' by an amount proportional to ''t''. The total change in ''t'' is the sum of the term from dimensional analysis and this second term from [[operator product expansion|operator products]]:\n\n:<math>\\delta t = \\left(2 - {B\\lambda \\over 2} \\right)b t</math>\n\nSo ''t'' is rescaled, but its dimension is [[anomalous dimension|anomalous]], it is changed by an amount proportional to the value of \u03bb.\n\nBut \u03bb also changes. The change in \u03bb requires considering the lines splitting and then quickly rejoining. The lowest order process is one where one of the three lines from ''H''<sup>3</sup> splits into three, which quickly joins with one of the other lines from the same vertex. The correction to the vertex is\n\n:<math>\\delta \\lambda = - {3 \\lambda^2 \\over 2} \\int_k dk {1 \\over (k^2 + t)^2} = -{3\\lambda^2 \\over 2} b</math>\n\nThe numerical factor is three times bigger because there is an extra factor of three in choosing which of the three new lines to contract. So\n\n:<math>\\delta \\lambda = - 3 B \\lambda^2 b</math>\n\nThese two equations together define the renormalization group equations in four dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n              {dt \\over t} &= \\left(2  - {B\\lambda \\over 2}\\right) b \\\\\n  {d\\lambda \\over \\lambda} &= {-3 B \\lambda \\over 2} b\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe coefficient ''B'' is determined by the formula\n:<math>B b  = \\int_{\\Lambda<|k|<(1+b)\\Lambda} {d^4k\\over (2\\pi)^4} {1 \\over k^4}</math>\n\nand is proportional to the area of a three-dimensional sphere of radius \u03bb, times the width of the integration region ''b''\u039b divided by \u039b<sup>4</sup>:\n:<math>B= (2 \\pi^2 \\Lambda^3) {1\\over (2\\pi)^4} { b \\Lambda} {1 \\over b\\Lambda^4} = {1\\over 8\\pi^2} </math>\n\nIn other dimensions, the constant ''B'' changes, but the same constant appears both in the ''t'' flow and in the coupling flow. The reason is that the derivative with respect to ''t'' of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the ''t'' is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.\n\n====Wilson\u2013Fisher point====\nTo investigate three dimensions starting from the four-dimensional theory should be possible, because the intersection probabilities of random walks depend continuously on the dimensionality of the space. In the language of Feynman graphs, the coupling does not change very much when the dimension is changed.\n\nThe process of continuing away from dimension 4 is not completely well defined without a prescription for how to do it. The prescription is only well defined on diagrams. It replaces the Schwinger representation in dimension 4 with the Schwinger representation in dimension 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b5 defined by:\n:<math> G(x-y) = \\int d\\tau {1 \\over t^{d\\over 2}} e^{{x^2 \\over 2\\tau} + t \\tau} </math>\n\nIn dimension 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b5, the coupling \u03bb has positive scale dimension \u03b5, and this must be added to the flow.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  {d\\lambda \\over \\lambda} &= \\varepsilon - 3 B \\lambda \\\\\n              {dt \\over t} &= 2 - \\lambda  B\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe coefficient ''B'' is dimension dependent, but it will cancel.  The fixed point for \u03bb is no longer zero, but at:\n:<math>\\lambda = {\\varepsilon \\over 3B} </math>\nwhere the scale dimensions of ''t'' is altered by an amount \u03bb''B'' = \u03b5/3.\n\nThe magnetization exponent is altered proportionately to:\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - {\\varepsilon \\over 3}\\right)</math>\n\nwhich is .333 in 3 dimensions (\u03b5 = 1) and .166 in 2 dimensions (\u03b5 = 2). This is not so far off from the measured exponent .308 and the Onsager two dimensional exponent .125.\n\n===Infinite dimensions \u2013 mean field===\n{{main|Mean field theory}}\n\nThe behavior of an Ising model on a fully connected graph may be completely understood by [[mean field theory]]. This type of description is appropriate to very-high-dimensional square lattices, because then each site has a very large number of neighbors.\n\nThe idea is that if each spin is connected to a large number of spins, only the average ratio of + spins to \u2212 spins is important, since the fluctuations about this mean will be small. The [[mean field]] ''H'' is the average fraction of spins which are + minus the average fraction of spins which are&nbsp;\u2212. The energy cost of flipping a single spin in the mean field ''H'' is \u00b12''JNH''. It is convenient to redefine ''J'' to absorb the factor ''N'', so that the limit ''N'' \u2192 \u221e is smooth. In terms of the new ''J'', the energy cost for flipping a spin is \u00b12''JH''.\n\nThis energy cost gives the ratio of probability ''p'' that the spin is + to the probability 1\u2212''p'' that the spin is&nbsp;\u2212. This ratio is the Boltzmann factor:\n:<math>{p\\over 1-p} = e^{2\\beta JH}</math>\n\nso that\n:<math>p = {1 \\over 1 + e^{-2\\beta JH} }</math>\n\nThe mean value of the spin is given by averaging 1 and \u22121 with the weights ''p'' and 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'', so the mean value is 2''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1. But this average is the same for all spins, and is therefore equal to ''H''.\n:<math> H = 2p - 1 = { 1 - e^{-2\\beta JH} \\over 1 + e^{-2\\beta JH}} = \\tanh (\\beta JH)</math>\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the possible consistent mean fields. For \u03b2''J'' < 1 there is only the one solution at ''H'' = 0. For bigger values of \u03b2 there are three solutions, and the solution at ''H'' = 0 is unstable.\n\nThe instability means that increasing the mean field above zero a little bit produces a statistical fraction of spins which are + which is bigger than the value of the mean field. So a mean field which fluctuates above zero will produce an even greater mean field, and will eventually settle at the stable solution. This means that for temperatures below the critical value \u03b2''J'' = 1 the mean field Ising model undergoes a phase transition in the limit of large ''N''.\n\nAbove the critical temperature, fluctuations in ''H'' are damped because the mean field restores the fluctuation to zero field. Below the critical temperature, the mean field is driven to a new equilibrium value, which is either the positive ''H'' or negative ''H'' solution to the equation.\n\nFor \u03b2''J'' = 1 + \u03b5, just below the critical temperature, the value of ''H'' can be calculated from the Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic tangent:\n:<math>H = \\tanh(\\beta J H) = (1+\\varepsilon)H - {(1+\\varepsilon)^3H^3\\over 3}</math>\n\nDividing by ''H'' to discard the unstable solution at ''H'' = 0, the stable solutions are:\n:<math>H = \\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}</math>\n\nThe spontaneous magnetization ''H'' grows near the critical point as the square root of the change in temperature. This is true whenever ''H'' can be calculated from the solution of an analytic equation which is symmetric between positive and negative values, which led [[Lev Landau|Landau]] to suspect that all Ising type phase transitions in all dimensions should follow this law.\n\nThe mean field exponent is [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universal]] because changes in the character of solutions of analytic equations are always described by [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]] in the Taylor series, which is a polynomial equation. By symmetry, the equation for ''H'' must only have odd powers of ''H'' on the right hand side. Changing \u03b2 should only smoothly change the coefficients. The transition happens when the coefficient of ''H'' on the right hand side is 1. Near the transition:\n:<math>H = {\\partial (\\beta F) \\over \\partial h} = (1+A\\varepsilon) H + B H^3 + \\cdots</math>\n\nWhatever ''A'' and ''B'' are, so long as neither of them is tuned to zero, the sponetaneous magnetization will grow as the square root of \u03b5. This argument can only fail if the free energy \u03b2''F'' is either non-analytic or non-generic at the exact \u03b2 where the transition occurs.\n\nBut the spontaneous magnetization in magnetic systems and the density in gasses near the critical point are measured very accurately. The density and the magnetization in three dimensions have the same power-law dependence on the temperature near the critical point, but the behavior from experiments is:\n:<math>H \\propto \\varepsilon^{0.308}</math>\n\nThe exponent is also universal, since it is the same in the Ising model as in the experimental magnet and gas, but it is not equal to the mean field value. This was a great surprise.\n\nThis is also true in two dimensions, where\n:<math>H \\propto \\varepsilon^{0.125}</math>\n\nBut there it was not a surprise, because it was predicted by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]].\n\n===Low dimensions&nbsp;\u2013 block spins===\nIn three dimensions, the perturbative series from the field theory is an expansion in a coupling constant \u03bb which is not particularly small. The effective size of the coupling at the fixed point is one over the branching factor of the particle paths, so the expansion parameter is about 1/3. In two dimensions, the perturbative expansion parameter is 2/3.\n\nBut renormalization can also be productively applied to the spins directly, without passing to an average field. Historically, this approach is due to [[Leo Kadanoff]] and predated the perturbative \u03b5 expansion.\n\nThe idea is to integrate out lattice spins iteratively, generating a flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The fact that a continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.\n\n====Migdal\u2013Kadanoff renormalization====\nWrite the two-dimensional Ising model with an infinite number of possible higher order interactions. To keep spin reflection symmetry, only even powers contribute:\n:<math>E = \\sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j + \\sum J_{ijkl} S_i S_j S_k S_l \\ldots.</math>\n\nBy translation invariance,''J<sub>ij</sub>'' is only a function of i-j. By the accidental rotational symmetry, at large i and j its size only depends on the magnitude of the two-dimensional vector ''i''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''j''. The higher order coefficients are also similarly restricted.\n\nThe renormalization iteration divides the lattice into two parts \u2013 even spins and odd spins. The odd spins live on the odd-checkerboard lattice positions, and the even ones on the even-checkerboard. When the spins are indexed by the position (''i'',''j''), the odd sites are those with ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' odd and the even sites those with ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' even, and even sites are only connected to odd sites.\n\nThe two possible values of the odd spins will be integrated out, by summing over both possible values. This will produce a new free energy function for the remaining even spins, with new adjusted couplings. The even spins are again in a lattice, with axes tilted at 45 degrees to the old ones. Unrotating the system restores the old configuration, but with new parameters. These parameters describe the interaction between spins at distances <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}</math> larger.\n\nStarting from the Ising model and repeating this iteration eventually changes all the couplings. When the temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.\n\nThe simplest approximation is to keep only the usual ''J'' term, and discard everything else. This will generate a flow in ''J'', analogous to the flow in ''t'' at the fixed point of \u03bb in the \u03b5 expansion.\n\nTo find the change in ''J'', consider the four neighbors of an odd site. These are the only spins which interact with it. The multiplicative contribution to the partition function from the sum over the two values of the spin at the odd site is:\n:<math> e^{J (N_+ - N_-)} + e^{J (N_- - N_+)} = 2 \\cosh(J[N_+ - N_-])</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sub>\u00b1</sub> is the number of neighbors which are \u00b1. Ignoring the factor of 2, the free energy contribution from this odd site is:\n:<math> F = \\log(\\cosh[J(N_+ - N_-)]).</math>\n\nThis includes nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor interactions, as expected, but also a four-spin interaction which is to be discarded. To truncate to nearest neighbor interactions, consider that the difference in energy between all spins the same and equal numbers + and \u2013 is:\n:<math> \\Delta F = \\ln(\\cosh[4J]).</math>\n\nFrom nearest neighbor couplings, the difference in energy between all spins equal and staggered spins is 8''J''. The difference in energy between all spins equal and nonstaggered but net zero spin is 4''J''. Ignoring four-spin interactions, a reasonable truncation is the average of these two energies or 6''J''. Since each link will contribute to two odd spins, the right value to compare with the previous one is half that:\n:<math>3J' =  \\ln(\\cosh[4J]).</math>\n\nFor small ''J'', this quickly flows to zero coupling. Large ''J'''s flow to large couplings. The magnetization exponent is determined from the slope of the equation at the fixed point.\n\nVariants of this method produce good numerical approximations for the critical exponents when many terms are included, in both two and three dimensions.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Magnetism===\nThe original motivation for the model was the phenomenon of [[ferromagnetism]]. Iron is magnetic; once it is magnetized it stays magnetized for a long time compared to any atomic time.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was thought that magnetic fields are due to currents in matter, and [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re|Amp\u00e8re]] postulated that permanent magnets are caused by permanent atomic currents. The motion of classical charged particles could not explain permanent currents though, as shown by [[Joseph Larmor|Larmor]]. In order to have ferromagnetism, the atoms must have permanent [[magnetic moment]]s which are not due to the motion of classical charges.\n\nOnce the electron's spin was discovered, it was clear that the magnetism should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It was natural to ask how the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.\n\n===Lattice gas===\nThe Ising model can be reinterpreted as a statistical model for the motion of atoms. Since the kinetic energy depends only on momentum and not on position, while the statistics of the positions only depends on the potential energy, the thermodynamics of the gas only depends on the potential energy for each configuration of atoms.\n\nA coarse model is to make space-time a lattice and imagine that each position either contains an atom or it doesn't. The space of configuration is that of independent bits ''B<sub>i</sub>'', where each bit is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the position is occupied or not. An attractive interaction reduces the energy of two nearby atoms. If the attraction is only between nearest neighbors, the energy is reduced by \u22124''JB''<sub>''i''</sub>''B''<sub>''j''</sub> for each occupied neighboring pair.\n\nThe density of the atoms can be controlled by adding a [[chemical potential]], which is a multiplicative probability cost for adding one more atom. A multiplicative factor in probability can be reinterpreted as an additive term in the logarithm \u2013 the energy. The extra energy of a configuration with ''N'' atoms is changed by ''\u03bcN''. The probability cost of one more atom is a factor of exp(\u2212''\u03b2\u03bc'').\n\nSo the energy of the lattice gas is:\n:<math>E = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} 4 J B_i B_j + \\sum_i \\mu B_i</math>\n\nRewriting the bits in terms of spins, <math>B_i = (S_i + 1)/2. </math>\n:<math>E = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} J S_i S_j - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i (4 J - \\mu) S_i</math>\n\nFor lattices where every site has an equal number of neighbors, this is the Ising model with a magnetic field ''h'' = (''zJ''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')/2, where ''z'' is the number of neighbors.\n\nIn biological systems, modified versions of the lattice gas model have been used to understand a range of binding behaviors.

Given a collection of neurons, a statistical model which can reproduce the average firing rate for each neuron introduces a [[Lagrange multiplier]] for each neuron:\n:<math>E = - \\sum_i h_i S_i</math>\nBut the activity of each neuron in this model is statistically independent. To allow for pair correlations, when one neuron tends to fire (or not to fire) along with another, introduce pair-wise lagrange multipliers:\n:<math>E= - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j - \\sum_i h_i S_i</math>\nwhere <math>J_{ij}</math> are not restricted to neighbors. Note that this generalization of Ising model is sometimes called the quadratic exponential binary distribution in statistics.\nThis energy function only introduces probability biases for a spin having a value and for a pair of spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.\n\n===Spin glasses===\nWith the Ising model the so-called [[spin glasses]] can also be described, by the usual Hamiltonian\n<math>\\hat H=-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum J_{i,k}\\,S_i\\,S_k,</math>\nwhere the ''S''-variables describe the Ising spins, while the ''J<sub>i,k</sub>'' are taken from a random distribution.  For spin glasses a typical distribution chooses antiferromagnetic bonds with probability ''p'' and ferromagnetic bonds with probability 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''.  These bonds stay fixed or \"quenched\" even in the presence of thermal fluctuations. When ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 we have the original Ising model. This system deserves interest in its own; particularly one has \"non-ergodic\" properties leading to strange relaxation behaviour. Much attention has been also attracted by the related bond and site dilute Ising model, especially in two dimensions, leading to intriguing critical behavior.<ref>{{Citation|author= J-S Wang, [[Walter Selke|W Selke]], VB Andreichenko, and VS Dotsenko| title= The critical behaviour of the two-dimensional dilute model|journal= Physica A|volume= 164| issue= 2| pages= 221\u2013239 |year= 1990|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(90)90196-Y|bibcode = 1990PhyA..164..221W }}</ref>\n\n===Sea ice===\n2D [[melt pond]] approximations can be created using the Ising model; sea ice topography data bears rather heavily on the results.

The model consists of [[discrete variables]] that represent [[Nuclear magnetic moment|magnetic dipole moments of atomic \"spins\"]] that can be in one of two states (+1 or \u22121). The spins are arranged in a graph, usually a [[lattice (group)|lattice]] (where the local structure repeats periodically in all directions), allowing each spin to interact with its neighbors. Neighboring spins that agree have a lower energy than those that disagree; the system tends to the lowest energy but heat disturbs this tendency, thus creating the possibility of different structural phases. The model allows the identification of [[phase transition]]s, as a simplified model of reality. The two-dimensional [[square-lattice Ising model]] is one of the simplest statistical models to show a [[phase transition]].<ref>See {{harvtxt|Gallavotti|1999}}, Chapters VI-VII.</ref>\n\nThe Ising model was invented by the physicist {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Wilhelm Lenz|first=Wilhelm|last=Lenz|year=1920}}, who gave it as a problem to his student Ernst Ising. The one-dimensional Ising model was solved by {{harvtxt|Ising|1925}} himself in his 1924 thesis;<ref>[http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/anglica/Chronology/20thC/Ising/isi_fm00.html Ernst Ising, ''Contribution to the Theory of Ferromagnetism'']</ref> it has no phase transition. The two-dimensional square-lattice Ising model is much harder and was only given an analytic description much later, by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Lars Onsager|first=Lars |last=Onsager|year=1944}}. It is usually solved by a [[transfer-matrix method]], although there exist different approaches, more related to [[quantum field theory]].\n\nIn dimensions greater than four, the phase transition of the Ising model is described by [[mean field theory]].\n\n==Definition==\nConsider a set \u039b of lattice sites, each with a set of adjacent sites (e.g. a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]) forming a ''d''-dimensional lattice.  For each lattice site ''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b there is a discrete variable \u03c3<sub>''k''</sub> such that \u03c3<sub>''k''</sub> &nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;{+1,&nbsp;\u22121}, representing the site's spin. A ''spin configuration'', \u03c3&nbsp;=&nbsp;(\u03c3<sub>''k''</sub>)<sub>''k''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b</sub> is an assignment of spin value to each lattice site.\n\nFor any two adjacent sites ''i'',&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;\u2208 \u039b there is an ''interaction'' ''J''<sub>''ij''</sub>. Also a site ''j''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;\u039b has an ''external magnetic field'' ''h''<sub>''j''</sub> interacting with it. The ''energy'' of a configuration \u03c3 is given by the [[Hamiltonian function]]\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -\\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j - \\mu \\sum_j h_j \\sigma_j,</math>\n\nwhere the first sum is over pairs of adjacent spins (every pair is counted once). The notation \u27e8''ij''\u27e9 indicates that sites ''i'' and ''j'' are nearest neighbors. The [[magnetic moment]] is given by \u00b5. Note that the sign in the second term of the Hamiltonian above should actually be positive because the electron's magnetic moment is antiparallel to its spin, but the negative term is used conventionally.<ref>See {{harvtxt|Baierlein|1999}}, Chapter 16.</ref> The ''configuration probability'' is given by the  [[Boltzmann distribution]] with [[inverse temperature]] \u03b2 \u2265 0:\n\n: <math>P_\\beta(\\sigma) = \\frac{e^{-\\beta H(\\sigma)}}{Z_\\beta},</math>\n\nwhere \u03b2&nbsp;=&nbsp;(''k''<sub>B</sub>''T'')<sup>\u22121</sup>, and the normalization constant\n\n: <math>Z_\\beta = \\sum_\\sigma e^{-\\beta H(\\sigma)}</math>\n\nis the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]]. For a function ''f'' of the spins (\"observable\"), one denotes by\n\n: <math>\\langle f \\rangle_\\beta = \\sum_\\sigma f(\\sigma) P_\\beta(\\sigma)</math>\n\nthe expectation (mean) value of ''f''.\n\nThe configuration probabilities ''P''<sub>\u03b2</sub>(\u03c3) represent the probability that (in equilibrium) the system is in a state with configuration \u03c3.\n\n===Discussion===\nThe minus sign on each term of the Hamiltonian function ''H''(\u03c3) is conventional. Using this sign convention, Ising models can be classified according to the sign of the interaction: if, for a pair ''i'',&nbsp;''j''\n: <math>J_{ij} > 0</math>, the interaction is called [[ferromagnetic]],\n: <math>J_{ij} < 0</math>, the interaction is called [[antiferromagnetic]],\n: <math>J_{ij} = 0</math>, the spins are ''noninteracting''.\n\nThe system is called ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic if all interactions are ferromagnetic or all are antiferromagnetic.  The original Ising models were ferromagnetic, and it is still often assumed that \"Ising model\" means a ferromagnetic Ising model.\n\nIn a ferromagnetic Ising model, spins desire to be aligned: the configurations in which adjacent spins are of the same sign have higher probability. In an antiferromagnetic model, adjacent spins tend to have opposite signs.\n\nThe sign convention of ''H''(\u03c3) also explains how a spin site ''j'' interacts with the external field. Namely, the spin site wants to line up with the external field. If:\n: <math>h_j > 0</math>, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the positive direction,\n: <math>h_j < 0</math>, the spin site ''j'' desires to line up in the negative direction,\n: <math>h_j = 0</math>, there is no external influence on the spin site.\n\n===Simplifications===\nIsing models are often examined without an external field interacting with the lattice, that is, ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 for all ''j'' in the lattice \u039b. Using this simplification, the Hamiltonian becomes\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -\\sum_{\\langle i~j\\rangle} J_{ij} \\sigma_i \\sigma_j.</math>\n\nWhen the external field is everywhere zero, ''h''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, the Ising model is symmetric under switching the value of the spin in all the lattice sites; a nonzero field breaks this symmetry.\n\nAnother common simplification is to assume that all of the nearest neighbors \u27e8''ij''\u27e9 have the same interaction strength. Then we can set ''J<sub>ij</sub>'' = ''J'' for all pairs ''i'',&nbsp;''j'' in \u039b.

Onsager showed that the [[correlation function]]s and [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] of the Ising model are determined by a noninteracting lattice fermion. Onsager announced the formula for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] for the 2-dimensional model in 1949 but did not give a derivation. {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} gave the first published proof of this formula, using a [[Szeg\u0151 limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Fredholm determinant]]s, proved in 1951 by [[G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151|Szeg\u0151]] in direct response to Onsager's work.<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\">{{harvnb|Montroll|Potts|Ward|1963|pages=308\u2013309}}</ref>\n\n==Historical significance==\nOne of [[Democritus]]' arguments in support of [[atomism]] was that atoms naturally explain the sharp phase boundaries observed in materials{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}, as when ice melts to water or water turns to steam. His idea was that small changes in atomic-scale properties would lead to big changes in the aggregate behavior. Others believed that matter is inherently continuous, not atomic, and that the large-scale properties of matter are not reducible to basic atomic properties.\n\nWhile the laws of chemical binding made it clear to nineteenth century chemists that atoms were real, among physicists the debate continued well into the early twentieth century. Atomists, notably [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Ludwig Boltzmann]], applied Hamilton's formulation of Newton's laws to large systems, and found that the [[statistical mechanics|statistical behavior]] of the atoms  correctly describes room temperature gases. But classical statistical mechanics did not account for all of the properties of liquids and solids, nor of gases at low temperature.\n\nOnce modern [[quantum mechanics]] was formulated, atomism was no longer in conflict with experiment, but this did not lead to a universal acceptance of statistical mechanics, which went beyond atomism.  [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]] had given a complete formalism to reproduce the laws of thermodynamics from the laws of mechanics. But many faulty arguments survived from the 19th century, when statistical mechanics was considered dubious. The lapses in intuition mostly stemmed from the fact that the limit of an infinite statistical system has many [[Zero\u2013one law (disambiguation)|zero-one law]]s which are absent in finite systems: an infinitesimal change in a parameter can lead to big differences in the overall, aggregate behavior, as Democritus expected.\n\n===No phase transitions in finite volume===\nIn the early part of the twentieth century, some believed that the [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] could never describe a phase transition, based on the following argument:\n\n# The partition function is a sum of ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b2''E''</sup> over all configurations.\n# The exponential function is everywhere [[analytic function|analytic]] as a function of \u03b2.\n# The sum of analytic functions is an analytic function.\n\nThis argument works for a finite sum of exponentials, and correctly establishes that there are no singularities in the free energy of a system of a finite size. For systems which are in the thermodynamic limit (that is, for infinite systems) the infinite sum can lead to singularities. The convergence to the thermodynamic limit is fast, so that the phase behavior is apparent already on a relatively small lattice, even though the singularities are smoothed out by the system's finite size.\n\nThis was first established by [[Rudolf Peierls]] in the Ising model.\n\n===Peierls droplets===\nShortly after Lenz and Ising constructed the Ising model, Peierls was able to explicitly show that a phase transition occurs in two dimensions.\n\nTo do this, he compared the high-temperature and low-temperature limits. At infinite temperature (\u03b2&nbsp;= 0) all configurations have equal probability. Each spin is completely independent of any other, and if typical configurations at infinite temperature are plotted so that plus/minus are represented by black and white, they look like [[noise (video)|television snow]]. For high, but not infinite temperature, there are small correlations between neighboring positions, the snow tends to clump a little bit, but the screen stays randomly looking, and there is no net excess of black or white.\n\nA quantitative measure of the excess is the '''magnetization''', which is the average value of the spin:\n\n: <math>M = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^N \\sigma_i.</math>\n\nA bogus argument analogous to the argument in the last section now establishes that the magnetization in the Ising model is always zero.\n# Every configuration of spins has equal energy to the configuration with all spins flipped.\n# So for every configuration with magnetization ''M'' there is a configuration with magnetization \u2212''M'' with equal probability.\n# The system should therefore spend equal amounts of time in the configuration with magnetization ''M'' as with magnetization \u2212''M''.\n# So the average magnetization (over all time) is zero.\n\nAs before, this only proves that the average magnetization is zero at any finite volume. For an infinite system, fluctuations might not be able to push the system from a mostly plus state to a mostly minus with a nonzero probability.\n\nFor very high temperatures, the magnetization is zero, as it is at infinite temperature. To see this, note that if spin A has only a small correlation \u03b5 with spin B, and B is only weakly correlated with C, but C is otherwise independent of A, the amount of correlation of A and C goes like \u03b5<sup>2</sup>. For two spins separated by distance ''L'', the amount of correlation goes as \u03b5<sup>''L''</sup>, but if there is more than one path by which the correlations can travel, this amount is enhanced by the number of paths.\n\nThe number of paths of length ''L'' on a square lattice in ''d'' dimensions is\n: <math>N(L) = (2d)^L,</math>\nsince there are 2''d'' choices for where to go at each step.\n\nA bound on the total correlation is given by the contribution to the correlation by summing over all paths linking two points, which is bounded above by the sum over all paths of length ''L'' divided by\n: <math>\\sum_L (2d)^L \\varepsilon^L,</math>\nwhich goes to zero when \u03b5 is small.\n\nAt low temperatures (\u03b2 \u226b 1) the configurations are near the lowest-energy configuration, the one where all the spins are plus or all the spins are minus. Peierls asked whether it is statistically possible at low temperature, starting with all the spins minus, to fluctuate to a state where most of the spins are plus. For this to happen, droplets of plus spin must be able to congeal to make the plus state.\n\nThe energy of a droplet of plus spins in a minus background is proportional to the perimeter of the droplet L, where plus spins and minus spins neighbor each other. For a droplet with perimeter ''L'', the area is somewhere between (''L''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2)/2 (the straight line) and (''L''/4)<sup>2</sup> (the square box). The probability cost for introducing a droplet has the factor ''e''<sup>\u2212\u03b2''L''</sup>, but this contributes to the partition function multiplied by the total number of droplets with perimeter ''L'', which is less than the total number of paths of length ''L'':\n: <math>N(L) < 4^{2L}.</math>\nSo that the total spin contribution from droplets, even overcounting by allowing each site to have a separate droplet, is bounded above by\n: <math>\\sum_L L^2 4^{2L} e^{-4\\beta L},</math>\n\nwhich goes to zero at large \u03b2. For \u03b2 sufficiently large, this exponentially suppresses long loops, so that they cannot occur, and the magnetization never fluctuates too far from&nbsp;\u22121.\n\nSo Peierls established that the magnetization in the Ising model eventually defines [[superselection sector]]s, separated domains not linked by finite fluctuations.\n\n===Kramers\u2013Wannier duality===\n{{main|Kramers\u2013Wannier duality}}\nKramers and Wannier were able to show that the high-temperature expansion and the low-temperature expansion of the model are equal up to an overall rescaling of the free energy. This allowed the phase-transition point in the two-dimensional model to be determined exactly (under the assumption that there is a unique critical point).\n\n===Yang\u2013Lee zeros===\n{{main|Lee\u2013Yang theorem}}\nAfter Onsager's solution, Yang and Lee investigated the way in which the partition function becomes singular as the temperature approaches the critical temperature.\n\n==Monte Carlo methods for numerical simulation==\n[[File:Ising quench b10.gif|framed|right|Quench of an Ising system on a two-dimensional square lattice (500&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;500) with inverse temperature ''\u03b2''&nbsp;=&nbsp;10, starting from a random configuration]]\n\n===Definitions===\nThe Ising model can often be difficult to evaluate numerically if there are many states in the system.

It then uses acceptance probabilities ''A''(\u03bc, \u03bd) so that [[detailed balance]] is satisfied. If the new state \u03bd is accepted, then we move to that state and repeat with selecting a new state and deciding to accept it. If \u03bd is not accepted then we stay in \u03bc. This process is repeated until some stopping criterion is met, which for the Ising model is often when the lattice becomes [[ferromagnetic]], meaning all of the sites point in the same direction.<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\nWhen implementing the algorithm, one must ensure that ''g''(\u03bc, \u03bd) is selected such that [[ergodicity]] is met. In [[thermal equilibrium]] a system's energy only fluctuates within a small range.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> This is the motivation behind the concept of '''single-spin-flip dynamics''', which states that in each transition, we will only change one of the spin sites on the lattice.<ref name=\"Newman\" />  Furthermore, by using single- spin-flip dynamics, one can get from any state to any other state by flipping each site that differs between the two states one at a time.\n\nThe maximum amount of change between the energy of the present state, ''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub> and any possible new state's energy ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub> (using single-spin-flip dynamics) is 2''J'' between the spin we choose to \"flip\" to move to the new state and that spin's neighbor.<ref name=\"Newman\" /> Thus, in a 1D Ising model, where each site has two neighbors (left and right), the maximum difference in energy would be 4''J''.\n\nLet ''c'' represent the '''lattice coordination number'''; the number of nearest neighbors that any lattice site has. We assume that all sites have the same number of neighbors due to [[periodic boundary conditions]].<ref name=\"Newman\" /> It is important to note that the Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm does not perform well around the critical point due to critical slowing down. Other techniques such as multigrid methods, Niedermayer's algorithm, Swendsen\u2013Wang algorithm, or the Wolff algorithm are required in order to resolve the model near the critical point; a requirement for determining the critical exponents of the system.\n\n====Specification====\nSpecifically for the Ising model and using single-spin-flip dynamics, one can establish the following.\n\nSince there are ''L'' total sites on the lattice, using single-spin-flip as the only way we transition to another state, we can see that there are a total of ''L'' new states \u03bd from our present state \u03bc. The algorithm assumes that the selection probabilities are equal to the ''L'' states: ''g''(\u03bc, \u03bd) = 1/''L''. [[Detailed balance]] tells us that the following equation must hold:\n\n: <math>\\frac{P(\\mu, \\nu)}{P(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{g(\\mu, \\nu) A(\\mu, \\nu)}{g(\\nu, \\mu) A(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{A(\\mu, \\nu)}{A(\\nu, \\mu)} =\n\\frac{P_\\beta(\\nu)}{P_\\beta(\\mu)} =\n\\frac{\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu)}}{\\frac{1}{Z} e^{-\\beta(H_\\mu)}} =\ne^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n\nThus, we want to select the acceptance probability for our algorithm to satisfy\n\n: <math>\\frac{A(\\mu, \\nu)}{A(\\nu, \\mu)} = e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n\nIf ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub> > ''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub>, then ''A''(\u03bd, \u03bc) > ''A''(\u03bc, \u03bd). Metropolis sets the larger of ''A''(\u03bc,&nbsp;\u03bd) or ''A''(\u03bd,&nbsp;\u03bc) to be 1. By this reasoning the acceptance algorithm is:<ref name=\"Newman\" />\n\n: <math>A(\\mu, \\nu) = \\begin{cases}\n e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}, & \\text{if } H_\\nu - H_\\mu > 0, \\\\\n 1 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThe basic form of the algorithm is as follows:\n# Pick a spin site using selection probability ''g''(\u03bc,&nbsp;\u03bd) and calculate the contribution to the energy involving this spin.\n# Flip the value of the spin and calculate the new contribution.\n# If the new energy is less, keep the flipped value.\n# If the new energy is more, only keep with probability <math>e^{-\\beta(H_\\nu - H_\\mu)}.</math>\n# Repeat.\n\nThe change in energy ''H''<sub>\u03bd</sub>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''H''<sub>\u03bc</sub> only depends on the value of the spin and its nearest graph neighbors. So if the graph is not too connected, the algorithm is fast. This process will eventually produce a pick from the distribution.\n\n===Viewing the Ising model as a Markov chain===\nIt is possible to view the Ising model as a [[Markov chain]], as the immediate probability ''P''<sub>\u03b2</sub>(\u03bd) of transitioning to a future state \u03bd only depends on the present state \u03bc. The Metropolis algorithm is actually a version of a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] simulation, and since we use single-spin-flip dynamics in the Metropolis algorithm, every state can be viewed as having links to exactly ''L'' other states, where each transition corresponds to flipping a single spin site to the opposite value.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Teif |first=V.\u00a0B. |title=General transfer matrix formalism to calculate DNA-protein-drug binding in gene regulation |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |year=2007 |volume=35 |issue=11 |pages=e80 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm268 |pmid=17526526 |pmc=1920246}}</ref> Furthermore, since the energy equation ''H''<sub>\u03c3</sub> change only depends on the nearest-neighbor interaction strength ''J'', the Ising model and its variants such the [[Sznajd model]] can be seen as a form of a [[Contact process (mathematics)#Voter model|voter model]] for opinion dynamics.\n\n==One dimension==\nThe thermodynamic limit exists as soon as the interaction decay is <math>J_{ij} \\sim |i - j|^{-\\alpha}</math> with \u03b1 > 1.<ref name=\"Ruelle\">{{cite book |last1=Ruelle |title=Statistical Mechanics:Rigorous Results |publisher=W.\u00a0A.

The energy of the one-dimensional Ising model on a lattice of ''L'' sites with periodic boundary conditions is\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{i=1,\\ldots,L-1} \\sigma_i \\sigma_{i+1} - h \\sum_i \\sigma_i,</math>\nwhere ''J'' and ''h'' can be any number, since in this simplified case ''J'' is a constant representing the interaction strength between the nearest neighbors and ''h'' is the constant external magnetic field applied to lattice sites. Then the\n[[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] is\n: <math>f(\\beta, h) = -\\lim_{L \\to \\infty} \\frac{1}{\\beta L} \\ln Z(\\beta) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left(e^{\\beta J} \\cosh \\beta h + \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J}(\\sinh\\beta h)^2 + e^{-2\\beta J}}\\right),\n</math>\nand the spin-spin correlation (i.e. the covariance) is\n: <math>\\langle\\sigma_i \\sigma_j\\rangle - \\langle\\sigma_i\\rangle \\langle\\sigma_j\\rangle = C(\\beta) e^{-c(\\beta)|i - j|},</math>\nwhere ''C''(\u03b2) and ''c''(\u03b2) are positive functions for ''T'' > 0. For ''T'' \u2192 0, though, the inverse correlation length ''c''(\u03b2) vanishes.\n\n====Proof====\nThe proof of this result is a simple computation.\n\nIf ''h'' = 0, it is very easy to obtain the free energy in the case of free boundary condition, i.e. when\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J(\\sigma_1 \\sigma_2 + \\cdots + \\sigma_{L-1} \\sigma_L).</math>\nThen the model factorizes under the change of variables\n: <math>\\sigma'_j = \\sigma_j \\sigma_{j-1}, \\quad j \\ge 2.</math>\n\nThis gives\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots, \\sigma_L} e^{\\beta J \\sigma_1 \\sigma_2} e^{\\beta J \\sigma_2 \\sigma_3} \\cdots e^{\\beta J \\sigma_{L-1} \\sigma_L} = 2 \\prod_{j=2}^L \\sum_{\\sigma'_j} e^{\\beta J\\sigma'_j} = 2 \\left[e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}\\right]^{L-1}. </math>\n\nTherefore, the free energy is\n\n: <math>f(\\beta, 0) = -\\frac{1}{\\beta} \\ln\\left[e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}\\right].</math>\n\nWith the same change of variables\n\n: <math>\\langle\\sigma_j\\sigma_{j+N}\\rangle = \\left[\\frac{e^{\\beta J} - e^{-\\beta J}}{e^{\\beta J} + e^{-\\beta J}}\\right]^N,</math>\n\nhence it decays exponentially as soon as ''T'' \u2260 0; but for ''T'' = 0, i.e. in the limit \u03b2 \u2192 \u221e there is no decay.\n\nIf ''h'' \u2260 0 we need the transfer matrix method. For the periodic boundary conditions case is the following. The partition function is\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_L} e^{\\beta h \\sigma_1} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_1\\sigma_2} e^{\\beta h \\sigma_2} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_2\\sigma_3} \\cdots e^{\\beta h \\sigma_L} e^{\\beta J\\sigma_L\\sigma_1} = \\sum_{\\sigma_1,\\ldots,\\sigma_L} V_{\\sigma_1,\\sigma_2} V_{\\sigma_2,\\sigma_3} \\cdots V_{\\sigma_L,\\sigma_1}.</math>\nThe coefficients <math>V_{\\sigma, \\sigma'}</math> can be seen as the entries of a matrix. There are different possible choices: a convenient one (because the matrix is symmetric) is\n: <math>V_{\\sigma, \\sigma'} = e^{\\frac{\\beta h}{2} \\sigma} e^{\\beta J\\sigma\\sigma'} e^{\\frac{\\beta h}{2} \\sigma'}</math>\nor\n: <math>V = \\begin{bmatrix}\n e^{\\beta(h+J)} & e^{-\\beta J} \\\\\n e^{-\\beta J} & e^{-\\beta(h-J)}\n\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\nIn matrix formalism\n: <math>Z(\\beta) = \\operatorname{Tr} \\left(V^L\\right) = \\lambda_1^L + \\lambda_2^L = \\lambda_1^L \\left[1 + \\left(\\frac{\\lambda_2}{\\lambda_1}\\right)^L\\right],</math>\nwhere \u03bb<sub>1</sub> is the highest eigenvalue of ''V'', while \u03bb<sub>2</sub> is the other eigenvalue:\n: <math>\\lambda_1 = e^{\\beta J} \\cosh \\beta h + \\sqrt{e^{2\\beta J} (\\sinh\\beta h)^2 + e^{-2\\beta J}},</math>\nand |\u03bb<sub>2</sub>| < \u03bb<sub>1</sub>. This gives the formula of the free energy.\n\n====Comments====\nThe energy of the lowest state is \u2212''JL'', when all the spins are the same. For any other configuration, the extra energy is equal to 2''J'' times the number of sign changes that are encountered when scanning the configuration from left to right.\n\nIf we designate the number of sign changes in a configuration as ''k'', the difference in energy from the lowest energy state is 2''k''. Since the energy is additive in the number of flips, the probability ''p'' of having a spin-flip at each position is independent. The ratio of the probability of finding a flip to the probability of not finding one is the Boltzmann factor:\n\n: <math>\\frac{p}{1 - p} = e^{-2\\beta J}.</math>\n\nThe problem is reduced to independent biased [[coin toss]]es. This essentially completes the mathematical description.\n\nFrom the description in terms of independent tosses, the statistics of the model for long lines can be understood. The line splits into domains. Each domain is of average length exp(2\u03b2). The length of a domain is distributed exponentially, since there is a constant probability at any step of encountering a flip. The domains never become infinite, so a long system is never magnetized. Each step reduces the correlation between a spin and its neighbor by an amount proportional to ''p'', so the correlations fall off exponentially.\n\n: <math>\\langle S_i S_j \\rangle \\propto e^{-p|i-j|}.</math>\n\nThe [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is the volume of configurations, each configuration weighted by its Boltzmann weight. Since each configuration is described by the sign-changes, the partition function factorizes:\n\n: <math>Z = \\sum_{\\text{configs}} e^{\\sum_k S_k} = \\prod_k (1 + p ) = (1 + p)^L.</math>\n\nThe logarithm divided by ''L'' is the free energy density:\n\n: <math>\\beta f = \\log(1 + p) = \\log\\left(1 + \\frac{e^{-2\\beta J}}{1 + e^{-2\\beta J}}\\right),</math>\n\nwhich is [[Analytic function|analytic]] away from \u03b2 = \u221e. A sign of a [[phase transition]] is a non-analytic free energy, so the one-dimensional model does not have a phase transition.\n\n===One-dimensional solution with transverse field===\n\nTo express the Ising Hamiltonian using a quantum mechanical description of spins, we replace the spin variables with their respective Pauli matrices. However, depending on the direction of the magnetic field, we can create a transverse-field or longitudinal-field Hamiltonian. The [[transverse-field Ising model|transverse-field]] Hamiltonian is given by\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -J \\sum_{i=1,\\ldots,L} \\sigma_i^z \\sigma_{i+1}^z - h \\sum_i \\sigma_i^x.</math>\n\nThe transverse-field model experiences a phase transition between an ordered and disordered regime at ''J''&nbsp;~&nbsp;''h''.  This can be shown by a mapping of Pauli matrices\n\n: <math>\\sigma_n^z = \\prod_{i=1}^n T_i^x,</math>\n\n: <math>\\sigma_n^x = T_n^z T_{n+1}^z.</math>\n\nUpon rewriting the Hamiltonian in terms of this change-of-basis matrices, we obtain\n\n: <math>H(\\sigma) = -h \\sum_{i=1,\\ldots,L} T_i^z T_{i+1}^z - J \\sum_i T_i^x.</math>\n\nSince the roles of ''h'' and ''J'' are switched, the Hamiltonian undergoes a transition at ''J'' = ''h''.<ref name=\"Chakra\">{{cite book |last1=Suzuki |first1= Sei |last2= Inoue |first2= Jun-ichi |last3= Chakrabarti |first3= Bikas K. |title=Quantum Ising Phases and Transitions in Transverse Ising Models |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-33039-1 |isbn=978-3-642-33038-4 |url= http://cds.cern.ch/record/1513030}}</ref>\n\n==Two dimensions==\n* In the ferromagnetic  case there is a phase transition. At low temperature, the [[Peierls argument]] proves positive magnetization for the nearest neighbor case and then, by the [[Griffiths inequality]], also when longer range interactions are added. Meanwhile, at high temperature, the [[cluster expansion]] gives analyticity of the thermodynamic functions.\n* In the nearest-neighbor case, the free energy was exactly computed by Onsager, through the equivalence of the model with free fermions on lattice. The spin-spin correlation functions were computed by McCoy and Wu.\n\n===Onsager's exact solution===\n{{main|square-lattice Ising model}}\n{{harvtxt|Onsager|1944}} obtained the following analytical expression for the free energy of the Ising model on the anisotropic square lattice when the magnetic field <math>h=0</math> in the thermodynamic limit as a function of temperature and the horizontal and vertical interaction energies <math>J_1</math> and <math>J_2</math>, respectively\n\n:<math> -\\beta f = \\ln 2 + \\frac{1}{8\\pi^2}\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\theta_1\\int_0^{2\\pi}d\\theta_2 \\ln[\\cosh(2\\beta J_1)\\cosh(2\\beta J_2) -\\sinh(2\\beta J_1)\\cos(\\theta_1)-\\sinh(2\\beta J_2)\\cos(\\theta_2)]. </math>\n\nFrom this expression for the free energy, all thermodynamic functions of the model can be calculated by using an appropriate derivative. The 2D Ising model was the first model to exhibit a continuous phase transition at a positive temperature. It occurs at the temperature <math>T_c</math> which solves the equation\n\n:<math> \\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J_1}{kT_c}\\right)\\sinh\\left(\\frac{2J_2}{kT_c}\\right) = 1. </math>\n\nIn the isotropic case when the horizontal and vertical interaction energies are equal <math>J_1=J_2=J</math>, the critical temperature <math>T_c</math> occurs at the following point\n\n:<math> T_c = \\frac{2J}{k\\ln(1+\\sqrt{2})} </math>\n\nWhen the interaction energies <math>J_1</math>, <math>J_2</math> are both negative, the Ising model becomes an antiferromagnet. Since the square lattice is bi-partite, it is invariant under this change when the magnetic field <math>h=0</math>, so the free energy and critical temperature are the same for the antiferromagnetic case. For the triangular lattice, which is not bi-partite, the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Ising model behave notably differently.\n\n====Transfer matrix====\nStart with an analogy with quantum mechanics. The Ising model on a long periodic lattice has a partition function\n\n:<math>\\sum_S \\exp\\biggl(\\sum_{ij} S_{i,j} S_{i,j+1} + S_{i,j} S_{i+1,j}\\biggr).</math>\n\nThink of the ''i'' direction as ''space'', and the ''j'' direction as ''time''. This is an independent sum over all the values that the spins can take at each time slice. This is a type of [[path integral formulation|path integral]], it is the sum over all spin histories.\n\nA path integral can be rewritten as a Hamiltonian evolution. The Hamiltonian steps through time by performing a unitary rotation between time ''t'' and time ''t'' + \u0394''t'':\n:<math> U = e^{i H \\Delta t}</math>\n\nThe product of the U matrices, one after the other, is the total time evolution operator, which is the path integral we started with.\n\n:<math> U^N = (e^{i H \\Delta t})^N = \\int DX e^{iL}</math>\n\nwhere ''N'' is the number of time slices. The sum over all paths is given by a product of matrices, each matrix element is the transition probability from one slice to the next.\n\nSimilarly, one can divide the sum over all partition function configurations into slices, where each slice is the one-dimensional configuration at time 1. This defines the [[Transfer-matrix method|transfer matrix]]:\n:<math>T_{C_1 C_2}.</math>\n\nThe configuration in each slice is a one-dimensional collection of spins. At each time slice, ''T'' has matrix elements between two configurations of spins, one in the immediate future and one in the immediate past. These two configurations are ''C''<sub>1</sub> and ''C''<sub>2</sub>, and they are all one-dimensional spin configurations. We can think of the vector space that ''T'' acts on as all complex linear combinations of these. Using quantum mechanical notation:\n:<math>|A\\rangle = \\sum_S A(S) |S\\rangle</math>\n\nwhere each basis vector <math>|S\\rangle</math> is a spin configuration of a one-dimensional Ising model.\n\nLike the Hamiltonian, the transfer matrix acts on all linear combinations of states.  The partition function is a matrix function of T, which is defined by the sum over all histories which come back to the original configuration after ''N'' steps:\n:<math>Z= \\mathrm{tr}(T^N).</math>\n\nSince this is a matrix equation, it can be evaluated in any basis. So if we can diagonalize the matrix ''T'', we can find ''Z''.\n\n====''T'' in terms of Pauli matrices====\nThe contribution to the partition function for each past/future pair of configurations on a slice is the sum of two terms. There is the number of spin flips in the past slice and there is the number of spin flips between the past and future slice. Define an operator on configurations which flips the spin at site i:\n\n:<math>\\sigma^x_i.</math>\n\nIn the usual Ising basis, acting on any linear combination of past configurations, it produces the same linear combination but with the spin at position i of each basis vector flipped.\n\nDefine a second operator which multiplies the basis vector by +1 and \u22121 according to the spin at position ''i'':\n\n:<math>\\sigma^z_i.</math>\n\n''T'' can be written in terms of these:\n\n:<math>\\sum_i A \\sigma^x_i + B \\sigma^z_i \\sigma^z_{i+1}</math>\n\nwhere ''A'' and ''B'' are constants which are to be determined so as to reproduce the partition function. The interpretation is that the statistical configuration at this slice contributes according to both the number of spin flips in the slice, and whether or not the spin at position ''i' has flipped.\n\n====Spin flip creation and annihilation operators====\nJust as in the one-dimensional case, we will shift attention from the spins to the spin-flips. The \u03c3<sup>''z''</sup> term in ''T'' counts the number of spin flips, which we can write in terms of spin-flip creation and annihilation operators:\n\n:<math> \\sum C \\psi^\\dagger_i \\psi_i. \\,</math>\n\nThe first term flips a spin, so depending on the basis state it either:\n#moves a spin-flip one unit to the right\n#moves a spin-flip one unit to the left\n#produces two spin-flips on neighboring sites\n#destroys two spin-flips on neighboring sites.\n\nWriting this out in terms of creation and annihilation operators:\n:<math> \\sigma^x_i = D {\\psi^\\dagger}_i \\psi_{i+1} + D^* {\\psi^\\dagger}_i \\psi_{i-1} + C\\psi_i \\psi_{i+1} + C^* {\\psi^\\dagger}_i {\\psi^\\dagger}_{i+1}.</math>\n\nIgnore the constant coefficients, and focus attention on the form. They are all quadratic. Since the coefficients are constant, this means that the ''T'' matrix can be diagonalized by Fourier transforms.\n\nCarrying out the diagonalization produces the Onsager free energy.\n\n====Onsager's formula for spontaneous magnetization====\nOnsager famously announced the following expression for the [[spontaneous magnetization]] ''M'' of a two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet on the square lattice at two different conferences in 1948, though without proof<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\"/>\n:<math>M = \\left(1 - \\left[\\sinh 2\\beta J_1 \\sinh 2\\beta J_2\\right]^{-2}\\right)^{\\frac{1}{8}}</math>\nwhere <math>J_1</math> and <math>J_2</math> are horizontal and vertical interaction energies.\n\nA complete derivation was only given in 1951 by {{harvtxt|Yang|1952}} using a limiting process of transfer matrix eigenvalues. The proof was subsequently greatly simplified in 1963 by Montroll, Potts, and Ward<ref name=\"Montroll 1963 pages=308-309\"/> using [[G\u00e1bor Szeg\u0151|Szeg\u0151]]'s [[Szeg\u0151 limit theorems|limit formula]] for [[Toeplitz determinant]]s by treating the magnetization as the limit of correlation functions.\n\n==Three and four dimensions==\nIn three dimensions, the Ising model was shown to have a representation in terms of non-interacting fermionic lattice strings by [[Alexander Markovich Polyakov|Alexander Polyakov]]. The [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] of the three-dimensional Ising model is described by a [[conformal field theory]], as evidenced by [[Metropolis\u2013Hastings algorithm|Monte Carlo]] simulations<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/JHEP07(2013)055| volume = 1307| issue = 7| pages = 055| last1 = Bill\u00f3| first1 = M.| last2 = Caselle| first2 = M.| last3 = Gaiotto| first3 = D.| last4 = Gliozzi| first4 = F.| last5 = Meineri| first5 = M.| last6 = others| title = Line defects in the 3d Ising model| journal = JHEP| date = 2013|bibcode = 2013JHEP...07..055B | arxiv = 1304.4110}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1 = Cosme|first1 = Catarina|last2 = Lopes|first2 = J.

Wilson|Kenneth Wilson]]).\n\n==More than four dimensions==\nIn any dimension, the Ising model can be productively described by a locally varying mean field. The field is defined as the average spin value over a large region, but not so large so as to include the entire system. The field still has slow variations from point to point, as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations in the field are described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.\n\n===Local field===\nThe field ''H'' is defined as the long wavelength Fourier components of the spin variable, in the limit that the wavelengths are long. There are many ways to take the long wavelength average, depending on the details of how high wavelengths are cut off. The details are not too important, since the goal is to find the statistics of ''H'' and not the spins. Once the correlations in ''H'' are known, the long-distance correlations between the spins will be proportional to the long-distance correlations in ''H''.\n\nFor any value of the slowly varying field ''H'', the free energy (log-probability) is a local analytic function of ''H'' and its gradients. The free energy ''F''(''H'') is defined to be the sum over all Ising configurations which are consistent with the long wavelength field. Since ''H'' is a coarse description, there are many Ising configurations consistent with each value of ''H'', so long as not too much exactness is required for the match.\n\nSince the allowed range of values of the spin in any region only depends on the values of ''H'' within one averaging volume from that region, the free energy contribution from each region only depends on the value of ''H'' there and in the neighboring regions. So ''F'' is a sum over all regions of a local contribution, which only depends on ''H'' and its derivatives.\n\nBy symmetry in ''H'', only even powers contribute. By reflection symmetry on a square lattice, only even powers of gradients contribute. Writing out the first few terms in the free energy:\n\n:<math>\\beta F  =  \\int d^dx \\left[ A H^2 + \\sum_{i=1}^d Z_i (\\partial_i H)^2 + \\lambda H^4 +\\cdots \\right].</math>\n\nOn a square lattice, symmetries guarantee that the coefficients ''Z<sub>i</sub>'' of the derivative terms are all equal. But even for an anisotropic Ising model, where the ''Z<sub>i</sub>'''s in different directions are different, the fluctuations in ''H'' are isotropic in a coordinate system where the different directions of space are rescaled.\n\nOn any lattice, the derivative term\n:<math>Z_{ij} \\, \\partial_i H \\, \\partial_j H </math>\nis a positive definite [[quadratic form]], and can be used to ''define'' the metric for space. So any translationally invariant Ising model is rotationally invariant at long distances, in coordinates that make ''Z<sub>ij</sub>'' = \u03b4<sub>''ij''</sub>. Rotational symmetry emerges spontaneously at large distances just because there aren't very many low order terms. At higher order multicritical points, this [[accidental symmetry]] is lost.\n\nSince \u03b2''F'' is a function of a slowly spatially varying field, the probability of any field configuration is:\n\n:<math>P(H) \\propto e^{ - \\int d^dx \\left[ AH^2 + Z |\\nabla H|^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right]}.</math>\n\nThe statistical average of any product of ''H'' terms is equal to:\n\n:<math>\\langle H(x_1) H(x_2)\\cdots H(x_n) \\rangle = { \\int DH \\, P(H) H(x_1) H(x_2) \\cdots H(x_n) \\over \\int DH \\, P(H) }.</math>\n\nThe denominator in this expression is called the ''partition function'', and the integral over all possible values of ''H'' is a statistical path integral. It integrates exp(\u03b2''F'') over all values of ''H'', over all the long wavelength fourier components of the spins. ''F'' is a Euclidean Lagrangian for the field ''H'', the only difference between this and the [[quantum field theory]] of a scalar field being that all the derivative terms enter with a positive sign, and there is no overall factor of ''i''.\n\n:<math>Z = \\int DH \\, e^{ - \\int d^dx \\left[ A H^2 + Z  |\\nabla H|^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right]}</math>\n\n===Dimensional analysis===\nThe form of ''F'' can be used to predict which terms are most important by dimensional analysis. Dimensional analysis is not completely straightforward, because the scaling of ''H'' needs to be determined.\n\nIn the generic case, choosing the scaling law for ''H'' is easy, since the only term that contributes is the first one,\n\n:<math>F = \\int d^dx \\, A H^2.</math>\n\nThis term is the most significant,  but it gives trivial behavior. This form of the free energy is ultralocal, meaning that it is a sum of an independent contribution from each point. This is like the spin-flips in the one-dimensional Ising model. Every value of ''H'' at any point fluctuates completely independently of the value at any other point.\n\nThe scale of the field can be redefined to absorb the coefficient ''A'', and then it is clear that ''A'' only determines the overall scale of fluctuations. The ultralocal model describes the long wavelength high temperature behavior of the Ising model, since in this limit the fluctuation averages are independent from point to point.\n\nTo find the critical point, lower the temperature. As the temperature goes down, the fluctuations in ''H'' go up because the fluctuations are more correlated. This means that the average of a large number of spins does not become small as quickly as if they were uncorrelated, because they tend to be the same. This corresponds to decreasing ''A'' in the system of units where ''H'' does not absorb ''A''. The phase transition can only happen when the subleading terms in ''F'' can contribute, but since the first term dominates at long distances, the coefficient ''A'' must be tuned to zero. This is the location of the critical point:\n\n:<math>F= \\int d^dx  \\left[ t H^2 + \\lambda H^4  + Z (\\nabla H)^2 \\right],</math>\n\nwhere ''t'' is a parameter which goes through zero at the transition.\n\nSince ''t'' is vanishing, fixing the scale of the field using this term makes the other terms blow up. Once ''t'' is small, the scale of the field can either be set to fix the coefficient of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term or the (\u2207''H'')<sup>2</sup> term to 1.\n\n===Magnetization===\nTo find the magnetization, fix the scaling of ''H'' so that \u03bb is one. Now the field ''H'' has dimension \u2212''d''/4, so that ''H''<sup>4</sup>''d<sup>d</sup>x'' is dimensionless, and ''Z'' has dimension 2&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''/2. In this scaling, the gradient term is only important at long distances for ''d'' \u2264 4. Above four dimensions, at long wavelengths, the overall magnetization is only affected by the ultralocal terms.\n\nThere is one subtle point. The field ''H'' is fluctuating statistically, and the fluctuations can shift the zero point of ''t''. To see how, consider ''H''<sup>4</sup> split in the following way:\n\n:<math>H(x)^4 = -\\langle H(x)^2\\rangle^2  + 2\\langle H(x)^2\\rangle H(x)^2 + \\left(H(x)^2 - \\langle H(x)^2\\rangle\\right)^2</math>\n\nThe first term is a constant contribution to the free energy, and can be ignored. The second term is a finite shift in ''t''. The third term is a quantity that scales to zero at long distances. This means that when analyzing the scaling of ''t'' by dimensional analysis, it is the shifted ''t'' that is important. This was historically very confusing, because the shift in ''t'' at any finite ''\u03bb'' is finite, but near the transition ''t'' is very small. The fractional change in ''t'' is very large, and in units where ''t'' is fixed the shift looks infinite.\n\nThe magnetization is at the minimum of the free energy, and this is an analytic equation. In terms of the shifted ''t'',\n\n:<math>{\\partial \\over \\partial H } \\left( t H^2 + \\lambda H^4 \\right ) = 2t H + 4\\lambda H^3 = 0</math>\n\nFor ''t'' < 0, the minima are at ''H'' proportional to the square root of ''t''. So Landau's [[catastrophe theory|catastrophe]] argument is correct in dimensions larger than 5. The magnetization exponent in dimensions higher than 5 is equal to the mean field value.\n\nWhen ''t'' is negative, the fluctuations about the new minimum are described by a new positive quadratic coefficient. Since this term always dominates, at temperatures below the transition the flucuations again become ultralocal at long distances.\n\n===Fluctuations===\nTo find the behavior of fluctuations, rescale the field to fix the gradient term. Then the length scaling dimension of the field is 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''/2. Now the field has constant quadratic spatial fluctuations at all temperatures. The scale dimension of the ''H''<sup>2</sup> term is 2, while the scale dimension of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term is 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''d''. For ''d'' < 4, the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term has positive scale dimension. In dimensions higher than 4 it has negative scale dimensions.\n\nThis is an essential difference. In dimensions higher than 4, fixing the scale of the gradient term means that the coefficient of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> term is less and less important at longer and longer wavelengths. The dimension at which nonquadratic contributions begin to contribute is known as the critical dimension. In the Ising model, the critical dimension is 4.\n\nIn dimensions above 4, the critical fluctuations are described by a purely quadratic free energy at long wavelengths. This means that the correlation functions are all computable from as [[Gaussian distribution|Gaussian]] averages:\n\n:<math>\\langle S(x)S(y)\\rangle \\propto \\langle H(x)H(y)\\rangle = G(x-y)  = \\int {dk \\over (2\\pi)^d} { e^{ik(x-y)}\\over k^2 + t }</math>\n\nvalid when ''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'' is large. The function ''G''(''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'') is the analytic continuation to imaginary time of the [[propagator|Feynman propagator]], since the free energy is the analytic continuation of the quantum field action for a free scalar field. For dimensions 5 and higher, all the other correlation functions at long distances are then determined by [[S-matrix#Wick's theorem|Wick's theorem]]. All the odd moments are zero, by \u00b1 symmetry. The even moments are the sum over all partition into pairs of the product of ''G''(''x''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''y'') for each pair.\n\n:<math>\\langle S(x_1) S(x_2) \\cdots S(x_{2n})\\rangle = C^n \\sum G(x_{i1},x_{j1}) G(x_{i2},x_{j2}) \\ldots G(x_{in},x_{jn})</math>\n\nwhere ''C'' is the proportionality constant. So knowing ''G'' is enough. It determines all the multipoint correlations of the field.\n\n===The critical two-point function===\nTo determine the form of ''G'', consider that the fields in a path integral obey the classical equations of motion derived by varying the free energy:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n                 &&\\left(-\\nabla_x^2 + t\\right) \\langle H(x)H(y) \\rangle &= 0 \\\\\n  \\rightarrow {} &&                                \\nabla^2 G(x) + tG(x) &= 0\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThis is valid at noncoincident points only, since the correlations of ''H'' are singular when points collide. ''H'' obeys classical equations of motion for the same reason that quantum mechanical operators obey them\u2014its fluctuations are defined by a path integral.\n\nAt the critical point ''t'' = 0, this is [[Laplace's equation]], which can be solved by [[Gaussian surface|Gauss's method]] from electrostatics. Define an electric field analog by\n\n:<math>E = \\nabla G</math>\n\nAway from the origin:\n\n:<math>\\nabla \\cdot E = 0</math>\n\nsince ''G'' is spherically symmetric in ''d'' dimensions, and ''E'' is the radial gradient of ''G''. Integrating over a large ''d''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1 dimensional sphere,\n\n:<math>\\int d^{d-1}S E_r = \\mathrm{constant}</math>\n\nThis gives:\n\n:<math>E = {C \\over r^{d-1} }</math>\n\nand ''G'' can be found by integrating with respect to ''r''.\n\n:<math>G(r) = {C \\over r^{d-2} }</math>\n\nThe constant ''C'' fixes the overall normalization of the field.\n\n===''G''(''r'') away from the critical point===\nWhen ''t'' does not equal zero, so that ''H'' is fluctuating at a temperature slightly away from critical, the two point function decays at long distances. The equation it obeys is altered:\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2 G  + t G = 0 \\to {1 \\over r^{d - 1}} {d \\over dr} \\left( r^{d-1} {dG \\over dr} \\right) + t G(r) = 0</math>\n\nFor ''r'' small compared with <math>\\sqrt{t}</math>, the solution diverges exactly the same way as in the critical case, but the long distance behavior is modified.\n\nTo see how, it is convenient to represent the two point function as an integral, introduced by Schwinger in the quantum field theory context:\n\n:<math>G(x) = \\int d\\tau  {1 \\over \\left(\\sqrt{2\\pi\\tau}\\right)^d} e^{-{x^2 \\over 4\\tau} - t\\tau}</math>\n\nThis is ''G'', since the Fourier transform of this integral is easy. Each fixed \u03c4 contribution is a Gaussian in ''x'', whose Fourier transform is another Gaussian of reciprocal width in ''k''.\n\n:<math>G(k) = \\int d\\tau  e^{-(k^2 - t)\\tau} = {1 \\over k^2 - t}</math>\n\nThis is the inverse of the operator \u2207<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''t'' in ''k''-space, acting on the unit function in ''k''-space, which is the Fourier transform of a delta function source localized at the origin. So it satisfies the same equation as ''G'' with the same boundary conditions that determine the strength of the divergence at 0.\n\nThe interpretation of the integral representation over the ''proper time'' \u03c4 is that the two point function is the sum over all random walk paths that link position 0 to position ''x'' over time \u03c4. The density of these paths at time \u03c4 at position ''x''  is Gaussian, but the random walkers disappear at a steady rate proportional to ''t'' so that the Gaussian at time \u03c4 is diminished in height by a factor that decreases steadily exponentially. In the quantum field theory context, these are the paths of relativistically localized quanta in a formalism that follows the paths of individual particles. In the pure statistical context, these paths still appear by the mathematical correspondence with quantum fields, but their interpretation is less directly physical.\n\nThe integral representation immediately shows that ''G''(''r'') is positive, since it is represented as a weighted sum of positive Gaussians. It also gives the rate of decay at large r, since the proper time for a random walk to reach position \u03c4 is r<sup>2</sup> and in this time, the Gaussian height has decayed by <math>e^{-t\\tau} = e^{-tr^2}</math>. The decay factor appropriate for position ''r'' is therefore <math>e^{-\\sqrt t r}</math>.\n\nA heuristic approximation for ''G''(''r'') is:\n\n:<math>G(r)  \\approx { e^{-\\sqrt t r} \\over r^{d-2}}</math>\n\nThis is not an exact form, except in three dimensions, where interactions between paths become important. The exact forms in high dimensions are variants of [[Bessel functions]].\n\n===Symanzik polymer interpretation===\nThe interpretation of the correlations as fixed size quanta travelling along random walks gives a way of understanding why the critical dimension of the ''H''<sup>4</sup> interaction is 4. The term ''H''<sup>4</sup> can be thought of as the square of the density of the random walkers at any point. In order for such a term to alter the finite order correlation functions, which only introduce a few new random walks into the fluctuating environment, the new paths must intersect. Otherwise, the square of the density is just proportional to the density and only shifts the ''H''<sup>2</sup> coefficient by a constant. But the intersection probability of random walks depends on the dimension, and random walks in dimension higher than 4 do not intersect.\n\nThe [[fractal dimension]] of an ordinary random walk is 2. The number of balls of size \u03b5 required to cover the path increase as \u03b5<sup>\u22122</sup>. Two objects of fractal dimension 2 will intersect with reasonable probability only in a space of dimension 4 or less, the same condition as for a generic pair of planes. [[Kurt Symanzik]] argued that this implies that the critical Ising fluctuations in dimensions higher than 4 should be described by a free field. This argument eventually became a mathematical proof.\n\n===4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03b5'' dimensions \u2013 renormalization group===\nThe Ising model in four dimensions is described by a fluctuating field, but now the fluctuations are interacting. In the polymer representation, intersections of random walks are marginally possible. In  the quantum field continuation, the quanta interact.\n\nThe negative logarithm of the probability of any field configuration ''H'' is the [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]] function\n\n:<math>F= \\int d^4 x  \\left[ {Z \\over 2} |\\nabla H|^2 + {t\\over 2} H^2  + {\\lambda \\over 4!} H^4 \\right] \\,</math>\n\nThe numerical factors are there to simplify the equations of motion. The goal is to understand the statistical fluctuations. Like any other non-quadratic path integral, the correlation functions have a [[Feynman diagram|Feynman expansion]] as particles travelling along random walks, splitting and rejoining at vertices. The interaction strength is parametrized by the classically dimensionless quantity \u03bb.\n\nAlthough dimensional analysis shows that both \u03bb and ''Z'' are dimensionless, this is misleading. The long wavelength statistical fluctuations are not exactly scale invariant, and only become scale invariant when the interaction strength vanishes.\n\nThe reason is that there is a cutoff used to define ''H'', and the cutoff defines the shortest wavelength. Fluctuations of ''H'' at wavelengths near the cutoff can affect the longer-wavelength fluctuations. If the system is scaled along with the cutoff, the parameters will scale by dimensional analysis, but then comparing parameters doesn't compare behavior because the rescaled system has more modes. If the system is rescaled in such a way that the short wavelength cutoff remains fixed, the long-wavelength fluctuations are modified.\n\n====Wilson renormalization====\nA quick heuristic way of studying the scaling is to cut off the ''H'' wavenumbers at a point \u03bb. Fourier modes of ''H'' with wavenumbers larger than \u03bb are not allowed to fluctuate. A rescaling of length that make the whole system smaller increases all wavenumbers, and moves some fluctuations above the cutoff.\n\nTo restore the old cutoff, perform a partial integration over all the wavenumbers which used to be forbidden, but are now fluctuating. In Feynman diagrams, integrating over a fluctuating mode at wavenumber ''k'' links up lines carrying momentum ''k'' in a correlation function in pairs, with a factor of the inverse propagator.\n\nUnder rescaling, when the system is shrunk by a factor of (1+''b''), the ''t'' coefficient scales up by a factor (1+''b'')<sup>2</sup> by dimensional analysis. The change in ''t'' for infinitesimal ''b'' is 2''bt''. The other two coefficients are dimensionless and do not change at all.\n\nThe lowest order effect of integrating out can be calculated from the equations of motion:\n\n:<math>\\nabla^2 H + t H = - {\\lambda \\over 6} H^3.</math>\n\nThis equation is an identity inside any correlation function away from other insertions.  After integrating out the modes with \u039b < ''k'' < (1+''b'')\u039b, it will be a slightly different identity.\n\nSince the form of the equation will be preserved, to find the change in coefficients it is sufficient to analyze the change in the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term. In a Feynman diagram expansion, the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term in a correlation function inside a correlation has three dangling lines. Joining two of them at large wavenumber ''k'' gives a change ''H''<sup>3</sup> with one dangling line, so proportional to ''H'':\n\n:<math>\\delta H^3 = 3H \\int_{\\Lambda<|k|<(1 + b)\\Lambda} {d^4k \\over (2\\pi)^4}  {1\\over (k^2 + t)}</math>\n\nThe factor of 3 comes from the fact that the loop can be closed in three different ways.\n\nThe integral should be split into two parts:\n\n:<math>\\int dk {1 \\over k^2} - t \\int dk { 1\\over k^2(k^2 + t)} = A\\Lambda^2 b + B  b t</math>\n\nThe first part is not proportional to ''t'', and in the equation of motion it can be absorbed by a constant shift in ''t''. It is caused by the fact that the ''H''<sup>3</sup> term has a linear part. Only the second term, which varies from ''t'' to ''t'', contributes to the critical scaling.\n\nThis new linear term adds to the first term on the left hand side, changing ''t'' by an amount proportional to ''t''. The total change in ''t'' is the sum of the term from dimensional analysis and this second term from [[operator product expansion|operator products]]:\n\n:<math>\\delta t = \\left(2 - {B\\lambda \\over 2} \\right)b t</math>\n\nSo ''t'' is rescaled, but its dimension is [[anomalous dimension|anomalous]], it is changed by an amount proportional to the value of \u03bb.\n\nBut \u03bb also changes. The change in \u03bb requires considering the lines splitting and then quickly rejoining. The lowest order process is one where one of the three lines from ''H''<sup>3</sup> splits into three, which quickly joins with one of the other lines from the same vertex. The correction to the vertex is\n\n:<math>\\delta \\lambda = - {3 \\lambda^2 \\over 2} \\int_k dk {1 \\over (k^2 + t)^2} = -{3\\lambda^2 \\over 2} b</math>\n\nThe numerical factor is three times bigger because there is an extra factor of three in choosing which of the three new lines to contract. So\n\n:<math>\\delta \\lambda = - 3 B \\lambda^2 b</math>\n\nThese two equations together define the renormalization group equations in four dimensions:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n              {dt \\over t} &= \\left(2  - {B\\lambda \\over 2}\\right) b \\\\\n  {d\\lambda \\over \\lambda} &= {-3 B \\lambda \\over 2} b\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe coefficient ''B'' is determined by the formula\n:<math>B b  = \\int_{\\Lambda<|k|<(1+b)\\Lambda} {d^4k\\over (2\\pi)^4} {1 \\over k^4}</math>\n\nand is proportional to the area of a three-dimensional sphere of radius \u03bb, times the width of the integration region ''b''\u039b divided by \u039b<sup>4</sup>:\n:<math>B= (2 \\pi^2 \\Lambda^3) {1\\over (2\\pi)^4} { b \\Lambda} {1 \\over b\\Lambda^4} = {1\\over 8\\pi^2} </math>\n\nIn other dimensions, the constant ''B'' changes, but the same constant appears both in the ''t'' flow and in the coupling flow. The reason is that the derivative with respect to ''t'' of the closed loop with a single vertex is a closed loop with two vertices. This means that the only difference between the scaling of the coupling and the ''t'' is the combinatorial factors from joining and splitting.\n\n====Wilson\u2013Fisher point====\nTo investigate three dimensions starting from the four-dimensional theory should be possible, because the intersection probabilities of random walks depend continuously on the dimensionality of the space. In the language of Feynman graphs, the coupling does not change very much when the dimension is changed.\n\nThe process of continuing away from dimension 4 is not completely well defined without a prescription for how to do it. The prescription is only well defined on diagrams. It replaces the Schwinger representation in dimension 4 with the Schwinger representation in dimension 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b5 defined by:\n:<math> G(x-y) = \\int d\\tau {1 \\over t^{d\\over 2}} e^{{x^2 \\over 2\\tau} + t \\tau} </math>\n\nIn dimension 4&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;\u03b5, the coupling \u03bb has positive scale dimension \u03b5, and this must be added to the flow.\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  {d\\lambda \\over \\lambda} &= \\varepsilon - 3 B \\lambda \\\\\n              {dt \\over t} &= 2 - \\lambda  B\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe coefficient ''B'' is dimension dependent, but it will cancel.  The fixed point for \u03bb is no longer zero, but at:\n:<math>\\lambda = {\\varepsilon \\over 3B} </math>\nwhere the scale dimensions of ''t'' is altered by an amount \u03bb''B'' = \u03b5/3.\n\nThe magnetization exponent is altered proportionately to:\n:<math>\\tfrac{1}{2} \\left( 1 - {\\varepsilon \\over 3}\\right)</math>\n\nwhich is .333 in 3 dimensions (\u03b5 = 1) and .166 in 2 dimensions (\u03b5 = 2). This is not so far off from the measured exponent .308 and the Onsager two dimensional exponent .125.\n\n===Infinite dimensions \u2013 mean field===\n{{main|Mean field theory}}\n\nThe behavior of an Ising model on a fully connected graph may be completely understood by [[mean field theory]]. This type of description is appropriate to very-high-dimensional square lattices, because then each site has a very large number of neighbors.\n\nThe idea is that if each spin is connected to a large number of spins, only the average ratio of + spins to \u2212 spins is important, since the fluctuations about this mean will be small. The [[mean field]] ''H'' is the average fraction of spins which are + minus the average fraction of spins which are&nbsp;\u2212. The energy cost of flipping a single spin in the mean field ''H'' is \u00b12''JNH''. It is convenient to redefine ''J'' to absorb the factor ''N'', so that the limit ''N'' \u2192 \u221e is smooth. In terms of the new ''J'', the energy cost for flipping a spin is \u00b12''JH''.\n\nThis energy cost gives the ratio of probability ''p'' that the spin is + to the probability 1\u2212''p'' that the spin is&nbsp;\u2212. This ratio is the Boltzmann factor:\n:<math>{p\\over 1-p} = e^{2\\beta JH}</math>\n\nso that\n:<math>p = {1 \\over 1 + e^{-2\\beta JH} }</math>\n\nThe mean value of the spin is given by averaging 1 and \u22121 with the weights ''p'' and 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p'', so the mean value is 2''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1. But this average is the same for all spins, and is therefore equal to ''H''.\n:<math> H = 2p - 1 = { 1 - e^{-2\\beta JH} \\over 1 + e^{-2\\beta JH}} = \\tanh (\\beta JH)</math>\n\nThe solutions to this equation are the possible consistent mean fields. For \u03b2''J'' < 1 there is only the one solution at ''H'' = 0. For bigger values of \u03b2 there are three solutions, and the solution at ''H'' = 0 is unstable.\n\nThe instability means that increasing the mean field above zero a little bit produces a statistical fraction of spins which are + which is bigger than the value of the mean field. So a mean field which fluctuates above zero will produce an even greater mean field, and will eventually settle at the stable solution. This means that for temperatures below the critical value \u03b2''J'' = 1 the mean field Ising model undergoes a phase transition in the limit of large ''N''.\n\nAbove the critical temperature, fluctuations in ''H'' are damped because the mean field restores the fluctuation to zero field. Below the critical temperature, the mean field is driven to a new equilibrium value, which is either the positive ''H'' or negative ''H'' solution to the equation.\n\nFor \u03b2''J'' = 1 + \u03b5, just below the critical temperature, the value of ''H'' can be calculated from the Taylor expansion of the hyperbolic tangent:\n:<math>H = \\tanh(\\beta J H) = (1+\\varepsilon)H - {(1+\\varepsilon)^3H^3\\over 3}</math>\n\nDividing by ''H'' to discard the unstable solution at ''H'' = 0, the stable solutions are:\n:<math>H = \\sqrt{3\\varepsilon}</math>\n\nThe spontaneous magnetization ''H'' grows near the critical point as the square root of the change in temperature. This is true whenever ''H'' can be calculated from the solution of an analytic equation which is symmetric between positive and negative values, which led [[Lev Landau|Landau]] to suspect that all Ising type phase transitions in all dimensions should follow this law.\n\nThe mean field exponent is [[Universality (dynamical systems)|universal]] because changes in the character of solutions of analytic equations are always described by [[catastrophe theory|catastrophes]] in the Taylor series, which is a polynomial equation. By symmetry, the equation for ''H'' must only have odd powers of ''H'' on the right hand side. Changing \u03b2 should only smoothly change the coefficients. The transition happens when the coefficient of ''H'' on the right hand side is 1. Near the transition:\n:<math>H = {\\partial (\\beta F) \\over \\partial h} = (1+A\\varepsilon) H + B H^3 + \\cdots</math>\n\nWhatever ''A'' and ''B'' are, so long as neither of them is tuned to zero, the sponetaneous magnetization will grow as the square root of \u03b5. This argument can only fail if the free energy \u03b2''F'' is either non-analytic or non-generic at the exact \u03b2 where the transition occurs.\n\nBut the spontaneous magnetization in magnetic systems and the density in gasses near the critical point are measured very accurately. The density and the magnetization in three dimensions have the same power-law dependence on the temperature near the critical point, but the behavior from experiments is:\n:<math>H \\propto \\varepsilon^{0.308}</math>\n\nThe exponent is also universal, since it is the same in the Ising model as in the experimental magnet and gas, but it is not equal to the mean field value. This was a great surprise.\n\nThis is also true in two dimensions, where\n:<math>H \\propto \\varepsilon^{0.125}</math>\n\nBut there it was not a surprise, because it was predicted by [[Lars Onsager|Onsager]].\n\n===Low dimensions&nbsp;\u2013 block spins===\nIn three dimensions, the perturbative series from the field theory is an expansion in a coupling constant \u03bb which is not particularly small. The effective size of the coupling at the fixed point is one over the branching factor of the particle paths, so the expansion parameter is about 1/3. In two dimensions, the perturbative expansion parameter is 2/3.\n\nBut renormalization can also be productively applied to the spins directly, without passing to an average field. Historically, this approach is due to [[Leo Kadanoff]] and predated the perturbative \u03b5 expansion.\n\nThe idea is to integrate out lattice spins iteratively, generating a flow in couplings. But now the couplings are lattice energy coefficients. The fact that a continuum description exists guarantees that this iteration will converge to a fixed point when the temperature is tuned to criticality.\n\n====Migdal\u2013Kadanoff renormalization====\nWrite the two-dimensional Ising model with an infinite number of possible higher order interactions. To keep spin reflection symmetry, only even powers contribute:\n:<math>E = \\sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j + \\sum J_{ijkl} S_i S_j S_k S_l \\ldots.</math>\n\nBy translation invariance,''J<sub>ij</sub>'' is only a function of i-j. By the accidental rotational symmetry, at large i and j its size only depends on the magnitude of the two-dimensional vector ''i''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''j''. The higher order coefficients are also similarly restricted.\n\nThe renormalization iteration divides the lattice into two parts \u2013 even spins and odd spins. The odd spins live on the odd-checkerboard lattice positions, and the even ones on the even-checkerboard. When the spins are indexed by the position (''i'',''j''), the odd sites are those with ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' odd and the even sites those with ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;''j'' even, and even sites are only connected to odd sites.\n\nThe two possible values of the odd spins will be integrated out, by summing over both possible values. This will produce a new free energy function for the remaining even spins, with new adjusted couplings. The even spins are again in a lattice, with axes tilted at 45 degrees to the old ones. Unrotating the system restores the old configuration, but with new parameters. These parameters describe the interaction between spins at distances <math>\\scriptstyle \\sqrt{2}</math> larger.\n\nStarting from the Ising model and repeating this iteration eventually changes all the couplings. When the temperature is higher than the critical temperature, the couplings will converge to zero, since the spins at large distances are uncorrelated. But when the temperature is critical, there will be nonzero coefficients linking spins at all orders. The flow can be approximated by only considering the first few terms. This truncated flow will produce better and better approximations to the critical exponents when more terms are included.\n\nThe simplest approximation is to keep only the usual ''J'' term, and discard everything else. This will generate a flow in ''J'', analogous to the flow in ''t'' at the fixed point of \u03bb in the \u03b5 expansion.\n\nTo find the change in ''J'', consider the four neighbors of an odd site. These are the only spins which interact with it. The multiplicative contribution to the partition function from the sum over the two values of the spin at the odd site is:\n:<math> e^{J (N_+ - N_-)} + e^{J (N_- - N_+)} = 2 \\cosh(J[N_+ - N_-])</math>\n\nwhere ''N''<sub>\u00b1</sub> is the number of neighbors which are \u00b1. Ignoring the factor of 2, the free energy contribution from this odd site is:\n:<math> F = \\log(\\cosh[J(N_+ - N_-)]).</math>\n\nThis includes nearest neighbor and next-nearest neighbor interactions, as expected, but also a four-spin interaction which is to be discarded. To truncate to nearest neighbor interactions, consider that the difference in energy between all spins the same and equal numbers + and \u2013 is:\n:<math> \\Delta F = \\ln(\\cosh[4J]).</math>\n\nFrom nearest neighbor couplings, the difference in energy between all spins equal and staggered spins is 8''J''. The difference in energy between all spins equal and nonstaggered but net zero spin is 4''J''. Ignoring four-spin interactions, a reasonable truncation is the average of these two energies or 6''J''. Since each link will contribute to two odd spins, the right value to compare with the previous one is half that:\n:<math>3J' =  \\ln(\\cosh[4J]).</math>\n\nFor small ''J'', this quickly flows to zero coupling. Large ''J'''s flow to large couplings. The magnetization exponent is determined from the slope of the equation at the fixed point.\n\nVariants of this method produce good numerical approximations for the critical exponents when many terms are included, in both two and three dimensions.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Magnetism===\nThe original motivation for the model was the phenomenon of [[ferromagnetism]]. Iron is magnetic; once it is magnetized it stays magnetized for a long time compared to any atomic time.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was thought that magnetic fields are due to currents in matter, and [[Andr\u00e9-Marie Amp\u00e8re|Amp\u00e8re]] postulated that permanent magnets are caused by permanent atomic currents. The motion of classical charged particles could not explain permanent currents though, as shown by [[Joseph Larmor|Larmor]]. In order to have ferromagnetism, the atoms must have permanent [[magnetic moment]]s which are not due to the motion of classical charges.\n\nOnce the electron's spin was discovered, it was clear that the magnetism should be due to a large number of electrons spinning in the same direction. It was natural to ask how the electrons all know which direction to spin, because the electrons on one side of a magnet don't directly interact with the electrons on the other side. They can only influence their neighbors. The Ising model was designed to investigate whether a large fraction of the electrons could be made to spin in the same direction using only local forces.\n\n===Lattice gas===\nThe Ising model can be reinterpreted as a statistical model for the motion of atoms. Since the kinetic energy depends only on momentum and not on position, while the statistics of the positions only depends on the potential energy, the thermodynamics of the gas only depends on the potential energy for each configuration of atoms.\n\nA coarse model is to make space-time a lattice and imagine that each position either contains an atom or it doesn't. The space of configuration is that of independent bits ''B<sub>i</sub>'', where each bit is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the position is occupied or not. An attractive interaction reduces the energy of two nearby atoms. If the attraction is only between nearest neighbors, the energy is reduced by \u22124''JB''<sub>''i''</sub>''B''<sub>''j''</sub> for each occupied neighboring pair.\n\nThe density of the atoms can be controlled by adding a [[chemical potential]], which is a multiplicative probability cost for adding one more atom. A multiplicative factor in probability can be reinterpreted as an additive term in the logarithm \u2013 the energy. The extra energy of a configuration with ''N'' atoms is changed by ''\u03bcN''. The probability cost of one more atom is a factor of exp(\u2212''\u03b2\u03bc'').\n\nSo the energy of the lattice gas is:\n:<math>E = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} 4 J B_i B_j + \\sum_i \\mu B_i</math>\n\nRewriting the bits in terms of spins, <math>B_i = (S_i + 1)/2. </math>\n:<math>E = - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{\\langle i,j \\rangle} J S_i S_j - \\frac{1}{2} \\sum_i (4 J - \\mu) S_i</math>\n\nFor lattices where every site has an equal number of neighbors, this is the Ising model with a magnetic field ''h'' = (''zJ''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''\u03bc'')/2, where ''z'' is the number of neighbors.\n\nIn biological systems, modified versions of the lattice gas model have been used to understand a range of binding behaviors.

Given a collection of neurons, a statistical model which can reproduce the average firing rate for each neuron introduces a [[Lagrange multiplier]] for each neuron:\n:<math>E = - \\sum_i h_i S_i</math>\nBut the activity of each neuron in this model is statistically independent. To allow for pair correlations, when one neuron tends to fire (or not to fire) along with another, introduce pair-wise lagrange multipliers:\n:<math>E= - \\tfrac{1}{2} \\sum_{ij} J_{ij} S_i S_j - \\sum_i h_i S_i</math>\nwhere <math>J_{ij}</math> are not restricted to neighbors. Note that this generalization of Ising model is sometimes called the quadratic exponential binary distribution in statistics.\nThis energy function only introduces probability biases for a spin having a value and for a pair of spins having the same value. Higher order correlations are unconstrained by the multipliers. An activity pattern sampled from this distribution requires the largest number of bits to store in a computer, in the most efficient coding scheme imaginable, as compared with any other distribution with the same average activity and pairwise correlations. This means that Ising models are relevant to any system which is described by bits which are as random as possible, with constraints on the pairwise correlations and the average number of 1s, which frequently occurs in both the physical and social sciences.\n\n===Spin glasses===\nWith the Ising model the so-called [[spin glasses]] can also be described, by the usual Hamiltonian\n<math>\\hat H=-\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\sum J_{i,k}\\,S_i\\,S_k,</math>\nwhere the ''S''-variables describe the Ising spins, while the ''J<sub>i,k</sub>'' are taken from a random distribution.  For spin glasses a typical distribution chooses antiferromagnetic bonds with probability ''p'' and ferromagnetic bonds with probability 1&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;''p''.  These bonds stay fixed or \"quenched\" even in the presence of thermal fluctuations. When ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 we have the original Ising model. This system deserves interest in its own; particularly one has \"non-ergodic\" properties leading to strange relaxation behaviour. Much attention has been also attracted by the related bond and site dilute Ising model, especially in two dimensions, leading to intriguing critical behavior.<ref>{{Citation|author= J-S Wang, [[Walter Selke|W Selke]], VB Andreichenko, and VS Dotsenko| title= The critical behaviour of the two-dimensional dilute model|journal= Physica A|volume= 164| issue= 2| pages= 221\u2013239 |year= 1990|doi=10.1016/0378-4371(90)90196-Y|bibcode = 1990PhyA..164..221W }}</ref>\n\n===Sea ice===\n2D [[melt pond]] approximations can be created using the Ising model; sea ice topography data bears rather heavily on the results.
