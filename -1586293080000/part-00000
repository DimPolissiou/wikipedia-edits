is the lead single of [[Sugar Ray]]'s album ''[[14:59]]''. It was one of Sugar Ray's most successful singles, climbing to number one on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Alternative Songs|Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and the Canadian ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles chart, becoming the latter country's second-highest-selling single of 1999. It also reached number three on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] in April 1999 and number 10 on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. It was ranked number 98 on the [[Triple J Hottest 100, 1999]], Australia's largest annual music poll.\n\n==Composition==\nThe chorus of the song references \"Suavecito\" by the Chicano music group [[Malo (band)|Malo]], as well as [[Hugh Masekela]]'s 1968 hit \"[[Grazing in the Grass]]\". [[Mark McGrath]] explained, \"We referenced 'Suavecito' because growing up in California, you know, that was just like the low rider anthem. Any car show or swap meet you'd ever go by, you'd always hear that [song] and that just stuck in your mind.\" He added, \"We actually came up with that part, and it was very similar to Malo's part. We were sort of imitating it, and then we said, 'Let's just leave it, we're gonna change it later.' It really makes the song \u2013 we think \u2013 so we just left it.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434704/sugar-ray-coasts-lowriding-groove-every-morning.jhtml | title=Sugar

Guertin in 1946. As of May 2019, David Kong is the president and CEO of Best Western and Dorothy Dowling is the chief marketing officer.\n\nIn 1964, Canadian hotel owners joined the system. Best Western then expanded to Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand in 1976.\n\nIn 2002, Best Western International launched ''Best Western Premier'' in Europe and Asia. (The other hotels in the chain were known as ''Best Western''.) In 2011, the chain's branding system-wide changed to a three-tiered system: ''Best Western'', ''Best Western Plus'', and ''Best Western Premier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestwestern.com/reservations/hotel-types/|title=Best Western}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Best Western logo.svg|thumb|Logo used from 1993 to 2015.]]\n[[File:BestWesternParkwayHotel2.jpg|thumb|Best Western Hotel with new logo.]]\nBest Western began in the years following [[World War II]]. At the time, most hotels were either large urban properties or smaller family-owned roadside hotels. In California, a network of independent hotel operators began making [[referral chain|referrals]] of each other to travelers. This \"referral system\" consisted of phone calls between one desk operator and another. This small and informal network eventually grew into the modern Best Western hotel brand founded by [[M.K. Guertin]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=3432426|title=Company Overview of Best Western International, Inc. |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun Des Voeux Road West \u83ef\u5927\u76db\u54c1\u9152\u5e97 Hotel Best Western Plus Hong Kong exterior Water Street Feb-2016 DSC (2).JPG|thumb|Best Western Plus in Hong Kong]]\nThe name \"Best Western\" originated from the fact that most of the chain's original operators were west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States. By 1962, Best Western had the only hospitality reservations service covering the entire United States, and in 1963, was the largest motel brand in the industry with 699 member properties and 35,201 rooms. From 1946 to 1964, Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as [[Choice Hotels|Quality Inns]], whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi River, and thus not in direct competition with Best Western. This partnership made sense geographically, but was not successful in the long run, and was eventually abandoned. In 1964, Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi under the name \"Best Eastern\" for those properties with the same typeset and Gold Crown logo as \"Best Western.\" By 1967, the \"Best Eastern\" name was dropped and all motels from coast-to-coast got the \"Best Western\" name and Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the \"World's Largest Hotel Chain\" by the 1970s.\n\nBest Western's \"Gold Crown\" logo was introduced in 1964 and would continue with a few minor revisions over the next 32 years, until it was replaced by a blue and yellow logo in 1996. In 2015, Best Western introduced a new family of logos, replacing the core logo and adding signage for Best Western Plus and Best Western Premier.\n\nBest Western purchased WorldHotels in February 2019 adding approximately 300 additional hotels to its brand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Western\u00ae Timeline and Story |url=https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/about/press-media/best-western-timeline-and-story.html |website=Best Western |accessdate=May 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n===Legal dispute===\nBest Western used to call itself a [[cooperative]] membership association, and as such could be seen as a co-op. Around 1985, it abandoned the \"cooperative\" terminology after courts insisted on calling it a [[franchisor]] despite its nonprofit status. The most dramatic example of this was ''Quist v. Best Western Int'l, Inc.'', 354 N.W.2d 656 (N.D. 1984),<ref name=\"NDSCO\">{{cite court|url=http://www.ndcourts.com/court/opinions/10571.htm|litigants=Quist v. Best Western International, Inc.|vol=354|reporter=N.W.2d|opinion=656|court=N.D.|year=1984|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}</ref> in which the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] decided that Best Western was a franchisor and had to comply with the appropriate laws and regulations.\n\n===Best Western GB===\n[[Best Western GB]] began in 1978 when Interchange Hotels of the United Kingdom consisting of independent hoteliers from key locations in the UK elected to trade under the brand name Best Western United Kingdom, effectively an affiliate of Best Western International in the US. Now there are over 260 Best Western hotels within Great Britain.\n\n===Best Western Australia and New Zealand===\nIn 1981, Homestead Motor Inns of Australia affiliated with Best Western. This move put 'International' after the Best Western name. The company has since been known as Best Western International.\n\nIn early 2007, Best Western Australia took over the rights to operate Best Western properties in New Zealand from the previous company, the Motel Federation of New Zealand. This was a bold but beneficial move for the brand as it made way for better quality properties to be brought into the brand. Currently, Best Western Australia has 205 properties in the group (11 in New Zealand and 194 in Australia).\n\n===Best Western Myanmar (Burma)===\nOn May 21, 2013, Best Western International announced that it will take over management of the Green Hill Hotel in [[Yangon, Myanmar]].

Guertin in 1946. As of May 2019, David Kong is the president and CEO of Best Western and Dorothy Dowling is the chief marketing officer.\n\nIn 1964, Canadian hotel owners joined the system. Best Western then expanded to Mexico, Australia, and New Zealand in 1976.\n\nIn 2002, Best Western International launched ''Best Western Premier'' in Europe and Asia. (The other hotels in the chain were known as ''Best Western''.) In 2011, the chain's branding system-wide changed to a three-tiered system: ''Best Western'', ''Best Western Plus'', and ''Best Western Premier''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bestwestern.com/reservations/hotel-types/|title=Best Western}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{expand section|date=May 2014}}\n[[File:Best Western logo.svg|thumb|Logo used from 1993 to 2015.]]\n[[File:BestWesternParkwayHotel2.jpg|thumb|Best Western Hotel with new logo.]]\nBest Western began in the years following [[World War II]]. At the time, most hotels were either large urban properties or smaller family-owned roadside hotels. In California, a network of independent hotel operators began making [[referral chain|referrals]] of each other to travelers. This \"referral system\" consisted of phone calls between one desk operator and another. This small and informal network eventually grew into the modern Best Western hotel brand founded by [[M.K. Guertin]] in 1946.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=3432426|title=Company Overview of Best Western International, Inc. |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]|accessdate=August 21, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:HK Sai Ying Pun Des Voeux Road West \u83ef\u5927\u76db\u54c1\u9152\u5e97 Hotel Best Western Plus Hong Kong exterior Water Street Feb-2016 DSC (2).JPG|thumb|Best Western Plus in Hong Kong]]\nThe name \"Best Western\" originated from the fact that most of the chain's original operators were west of the [[Mississippi River]] in the United States. By 1962, Best Western had the only hospitality reservations service covering the entire United States, and in 1963, was the largest motel brand in the industry with 699 member properties and 35,201 rooms. From 1946 to 1964, Best Western had a marketing partnership with Quality Courts, the forerunner of the chain known today as [[Choice Hotels|Quality Inns]], whose properties were located mostly east of the Mississippi River, and thus not in direct competition with Best Western. This partnership made sense geographically, but was not successful in the long run, and was eventually abandoned. In 1964, Best Western launched an expansion effort of its own operations east of the Mississippi under the name \"Best Eastern\" for those properties with the same typeset and Gold Crown logo as \"Best Western.\" By 1967, the \"Best Eastern\" name was dropped and all motels from coast-to-coast got the \"Best Western\" name and Gold Crown, a move that would further enhance an already successful marketing brand into the \"World's Largest Hotel Chain\" by the 1970s.\n\nBest Western's \"Gold Crown\" logo was introduced in 1964 and would continue with a few minor revisions over the next 32 years, until it was replaced by a blue and yellow logo in 1996. In 2015, Best Western introduced a new family of logos, replacing the core logo and adding signage for Best Western Plus and Best Western Premier.\n\nBest Western purchased WorldHotels in February 2019 adding approximately 300 additional hotels to its brand.<ref>{{cite web |title=Best Western\u00ae Timeline and Story |url=https://www.bestwestern.com/en_US/about/press-media/best-western-timeline-and-story.html |website=Best Western |accessdate=20 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n{{clear left}}\n===Legal dispute===\nBest Western used to call itself a [[cooperative]] membership association, and as such could be seen as a co-op. Around 1985, it abandoned the \"cooperative\" terminology after courts insisted on calling it a [[franchisor]] despite its nonprofit status. The most dramatic example of this was ''Quist v. Best Western Int'l, Inc.'', 354 N.W.2d 656 (N.D. 1984),<ref name=\"NDSCO\">{{cite court|url=http://www.ndcourts.com/court/opinions/10571.htm|litigants=Quist v. Best Western International, Inc.|vol=354|reporter=N.W.2d|opinion=656|court=N.D.|date=1984|accessdate=September 28, 2009}}</ref> in which the [[North Dakota Supreme Court]] decided that Best Western was a franchisor and had to comply with the appropriate laws and regulations.\n\n===Best Western GB===\n[[Best Western GB]] began in 1978 when Interchange Hotels of the United Kingdom consisting of independent hoteliers from key locations in the UK elected to trade under the brand name Best Western United Kingdom, effectively an affiliate of Best Western International in the US. Now there are over 260 Best Western hotels within Great Britain.\n\n===Best Western Australia and New Zealand===\nIn 1981, Homestead Motor Inns of Australia affiliated with Best Western. This move put 'International' after the Best Western name. The company has since been known as Best Western International.\n\nIn early 2007, Best Western Australia took over the rights to operate Best Western properties in New Zealand from the previous company, the Motel Federation of New Zealand. This was a bold but beneficial move for the brand as it made way for better quality properties to be brought into the brand. Currently, Best Western Australia has 205 properties in the group (11 in New Zealand and 194 in Australia).\n\n===Best Western Myanmar (Burma)===\nOn 21 May 2013, Best Western International announced that it will take over management of the Green Hill Hotel in [[Yangon, Myanmar]]. The acquisition gave the Best Western brand a place presence in Myanmar (Burma) as its first hotel establishment in the country.<ref name=\"investvine\">{{cite web|url=http://investvine.com/best-western-opens-first-myanmar-hotel/|title=Best Western opens first Myanmar hotel|first=Justin|last=Calderon|work=Inside Investor|date=24 May 2013|accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/hotelcheckin/2013/05/22/best-western-burma-myanmar-hotel/2351843/|title=Best Western to open its first hotel in Burma|work=USA Today|date=22 May 2013 |accessdate=27 October 2013}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arizona|Companies}}\n* [[List of hotels]]\n* [[List of motels]]\n{{Clear right}}\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Best Western Hotels}}\n* {{official website|http://www.bestwestern.com/}}\n\n{{Hotel chains}}\n\n[[Category:Best Western Hotels| ]]\n[[Category:Motels]]\n[[Category:Cooperatives in the United States]]\n[[Category:Hospitality companies of the United States]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Phoenix, Arizona]]\n[[Category:American companies established in 1946]]\n[[Category:Business services companies established in 1946]]\n[[Category:Hotels established in 1946]]\n[[Category:1946 establishments in California]]\n[[Category:OpenTravel Alliance]]\n[[Category:Hospitality companies of Hong Kong]]\n", "name_user": "Walter G\u00f6rlitz", "label": "safe", "comment": "date formats perMOS:DATEFORMATbyscript,Script-assisted fixes: perCS1andMOS:ITALICS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_Western"}

Their main inspiration was the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague Linguistic Circle]], which had been founded in 1926. It was, in the first place, a forum for discussion of theoretical and [[methodology|methodological]] problems in linguistics. Initially, their interest lay mainly in developing an alternative concept of the [[phoneme]], but it later developed into a complete theory which was coined ''glossematics'', and was notably influenced by [[structuralism]]. Membership of the group grew rapidly and a significant list of publications resulted, including an irregular series of larger works under the name ''Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Copenhague''. A ''Bulletin'' was produced, followed by an international journal for structuralistic research in language, ''Acta Linguistica'' (later called ''Acta Linguistica Hafniensia''), which was founded with the members of the Prague Linguistic Circle. It was, at that time, the sole journal explicitly dedicated to structuralism. With one short break from 1934 to 1937, while he lectured at the university of Aarhus, Hjelmslev acted as chairman of the Circle until shortly before his death in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultink|first=Henk|title=Hjelmslev og tredivernes strukturelle lingvistik: En presentation.|journal=Tijdschrift voor Skandinavistiek|volume=2|year=1981|url=http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/get-pdf?c=tvs;idno=0202a08|language=da}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical work ==\nHjelmslev published his first paper at the age of 25. His first major book, ''Principes de grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'', which he finished in 1928, is an invaluable source for anyone interested in Hjelmslev's work. During the 1930s Hjelmslev wrote another book, ''La cat\u00e9gorie des cas'', which was a major contribution to linguistics. In this book, Hjelmslev analysed the general category of case in detail, providing ample empirical material supporting his hypotheses. It is important to read Hjelmslev's work as a continuous evolving theory on the [[epistemology]] of linguistics. He made his first academic journey at 1921 to Lithuania to study [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], an experience which can be traced throughout his works.<ref>{{cite book|title=Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kQ6CTNgAbPMC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=danis+hjelmslev+studied+lithuanian#v=onepage&q=danis%20hjelmslev%20studied%20lithuanian&f=false|format=PDF|page=124|accessdate=4 March 2018|isbn=9780195187687|last1=Chapman|first1=Siobhan|last2=Routledge|first2=Christopher|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nHis most well-known book, ''Omkring sprogteoriens grundl\u00e6ggelse'', or in English translation, ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', first published in 1943, critiques the then-prevailing methodologies in linguistics as being descriptive, even anecdotal, and not systematising. He proposed a linguistic theory intended to form the basis of a more rational linguistics and a contribution to general [[epistemology]]. Like [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857\u20131913), he accepted [[language]] as a system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], from the point of view of language use. He argued that a theory of semiotics should be consistent within itself, comprehensive, and as simple as possible.<ref name=\"Oller99\">Oller ''et al.'' (1999)</ref>\n\n===Hjelmslev's sign model===\nHjelmslev's [[sign model]] is a development of [[Saussure]]'s bilateral sign model.<ref name=\"Noth90\"/> Saussure considered a sign as having two sides, ''signifier'' and ''signified''. Hjelmslev's famously renamed signifier and signified as respectively ''expression plane'' and ''content plane'', and also distinguished between form and substance.<ref name=\"Noth90\"/><ref name=\"DeleuzeG\">Deleuze and Guattari (1980)</ref><ref name=\"GroupeMu\">Groupe \u00b5 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Metcalf\">Metcalf</ref> The combinations of the four would distinguish between ''form of content'', ''form of expression'', ''substance of content'', and ''substance of expression''.<ref name=\"Noth90\">N\u00f6th (1990)</ref> In Hjelmslev's analysis, a sign is a function between two forms, the content form and the expression form, and this is the starting point of linguistic analysis. However, every sign function is also manifested by two substances: the content substance and the expression substance. The content substance is the physical and conceptual manifestation of the sign. The expression substance is the physical substance wherein a sign is manifested. This substance can be sound, as is the case for most known languages, but it can be any material support whatsoever, for instance, hand movements, as is the case for [[sign language]]s, or distinctive marks on a suitable medium as in the many different writing systems of the world.\n\nIn short, Hjelmslev was proposing an open-ended, scientific method of analysis as a new [[semiotics]]. In proposing this, he was reacting against the conventional view in [[phonetics]] that sounds should be the focus of enquiry. Some{{Who|date=June 2011}} have interpreted his work as if Hjelmslev argued that no sign can be interpreted unless it is contextualised{{snd}}treating his functives, ''expression'' and ''content'' as the general connotative mechanisms (for instance by [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]]){{snd}}for Hjelmslev the point of view of the linguist on meaning is that of the form of content. Even if the content substance is important, one has to analyse it from the point of view of the form. Not only do pictures and literature manifest the same organising principles, but, more broadly, [[visual perception|seeing]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], though certainly not identical, interact in surprisingly complex ways at deeper levels of the sign hierarchy which Hjelmslev sought to understand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taverniers|first=Miriam|year=2008|title=Hjelmslev's semiotic model of language: An exegesis.|journal=Semiotica|volume=171|issue=171|pages=367\u2013394|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2008.082|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/MiriamTaverniers/Papers/1268201/Hjelmslevs_semiotic_model_of_language_An_exegesis_Taverniers_2008_}}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nHjelmslev made a bold proposal to transform technical analysis into a broad enquiry, emphasising that the true focus of linguistics should be the language and the human [[culture]] that continually reinvents it, and all [[Collective memory|society's memory]] of its accumulated [[knowledge]] preserved through language. This was a challenging but constructive argument at the time, and remains one that still has relevance today.  Most conspicuously, Hjelmslev's lines of inquiry have been taken up by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]] (see the \"Postulates of Linguistics\" and \"Geology of Morals\" chapters of ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''), and subsequently their followers.\n\n== Terminology ==\nHjelmslev introduced the terms ''glosseme'', ''ceneme'', ''prosodeme'' and ''plereme'' as linguistic units, analogous to ''phoneme'', ''morpheme'', etc.<ref>Desblanche, Lucile (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=YOcFiTOiAbMC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153source=web&ots=7ZLq05gVyw&sig=kOuf6yg4yUeoFCg-G_2BJ3Q5MBE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result ''Aspects of specialised translation'', p.&nbsp;153.] Google Books.</ref>\n\nAlso, his most famous work, ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', is mostly concerned with the formal definition of a terminology for the analysis of any level of a system of signs, and as such there exists an exclusively Hjelmslevian terminology for that.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Hjelmslev, Louis (1928).

Their main inspiration was the [[Prague linguistic circle|Prague Linguistic Circle]], which had been founded in 1926. It was, in the first place, a forum for discussion of theoretical and [[methodology|methodological]] problems in linguistics. Initially, their interest lay mainly in developing an alternative concept of the [[phoneme]], but it later developed into a complete theory which was coined ''glossematics'', and was notably influenced by [[structuralism]]. Membership of the group grew rapidly and a significant list of publications resulted, including an irregular series of larger works under the name ''Travaux du Cercle Linguistique de Copenhague''. A ''Bulletin'' was produced, followed by an international journal for structuralistic research in language, ''Acta Linguistica'' (later called ''Acta Linguistica Hafniensia''), which was founded with the members of the Prague Linguistic Circle. It was, at that time, the sole journal explicitly dedicated to structuralism. With one short break from 1934 to 1937, while he lectured at the university of Aarhus, Hjelmslev acted as chairman of the Circle until shortly before his death in 1965.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Schultink|first=Henk|title=Hjelmslev og tredivernes strukturelle lingvistik: En presentation.|journal=Tijdschrift voor Skandinavistiek|volume=2|year=1981|url=http://dpc.uba.uva.nl/cgi/t/text/get-pdf?c=tvs;idno=0202a08|language=da}}</ref>\n\n== Theoretical work ==\nHjelmslev published his first paper at the age of 25. His first major book, ''Principes de grammaire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale'', which he finished in 1928, is an invaluable source for anyone interested in Hjelmslev's work. During the 1930s Hjelmslev wrote another book, ''La cat\u00e9gorie des cas'', which was a major contribution to linguistics. In this book, Hjelmslev analysed the general category of case in detail, providing ample empirical material supporting his hypotheses. It is important to read Hjelmslev's work as a continuous evolving theory on the [[epistemology]] of linguistics. He made his first academic journey at 1921 to Lithuania to study [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], an experience which can be traced throughout his works.<ref>{{cite book|title=Key Thinkers in Linguistics and the Philosophy of Language|url=https://books.google.com/?id=kQ6CTNgAbPMC&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=danis+hjelmslev+studied+lithuanian#v=onepage&q=danis%20hjelmslev%20studied%20lithuanian&f=false|format=PDF|page=124|accessdate=4 March 2018|isbn=9780195187687|last1=Chapman|first1=Siobhan|last2=Routledge|first2=Christopher|year=2005}}</ref>\n\nHis most well-known book, ''Omkring sprogteoriens grundl\u00e6ggelse'', or in English translation, ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', first published in 1943, critiques the then-prevailing methodologies in linguistics as being descriptive, even anecdotal, and not systematising. He proposed a linguistic theory intended to form the basis of a more rational linguistics and a contribution to general [[epistemology]]. Like [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857\u20131913), he accepted [[language]] as a system of [[sign (semiotics)|signs]], from the point of view of language use. He argued that a theory of semiotics should be consistent within itself, comprehensive, and as simple as possible.<ref name=\"Oller99\">Oller ''et al.'' (1999)</ref>\n\n===Hjelmslev's sign model===\nHjelmslev's [[sign model]] is a development of [[Saussure]]'s bilateral sign model.<ref name=\"Noth90\"/> Saussure considered a sign as having two sides, ''signifier'' and ''signified''. Hjelmslev's famously renamed signifier and signified as respectively ''expression plane'' and ''content plane'', and also distinguished between form and substance.<ref name=\"Noth90\"/><ref name=\"DeleuzeG\">Deleuze and Guattari (1980)</ref><ref name=\"GroupeMu\">Groupe \u00b5 (1976)</ref><ref name=\"Metcalf\">Metcalf</ref> The combinations of the four would distinguish between ''form of content'', ''form of expression'', ''substance of content'', and ''substance of expression''.<ref name=\"Noth90\">N\u00f6th (1990)</ref> In Hjelmslev's analysis, a sign is a function between two forms, the content form and the expression form, and this is the starting point of linguistic analysis. However, every sign function is also manifested by two substances: the content substance and the expression substance. The content substance is the physical and conceptual manifestation of the sign. The expression substance is the physical substance wherein a sign is manifested. This substance can be sound, as is the case for most known languages, but it can be any material support whatsoever, for instance, hand movements, as is the case for [[sign language]]s, or distinctive marks on a suitable medium as in the many different writing systems of the world.\n\nIn short, Hjelmslev was proposing an open-ended, scientific method of analysis as a new [[semiotics]]. In proposing this, he was reacting against the conventional view in [[phonetics]] that sounds should be the focus of enquiry. Some{{Who|date=June 2011}} have interpreted his work as if Hjelmslev argued that no sign can be interpreted unless it is contextualised{{snd}}treating his functives, ''expression'' and ''content'' as the general connotative mechanisms (for instance by [[Algirdas Julius Greimas]]){{snd}}for Hjelmslev the point of view of the linguist on meaning is that of the form of content. Even if the content substance is important, one has to analyse it from the point of view of the form. Not only do pictures and literature manifest the same organising principles, but, more broadly, [[visual perception|seeing]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]], though certainly not identical, interact in surprisingly complex ways at deeper levels of the sign hierarchy which Hjelmslev sought to understand.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taverniers|first=Miriam|year=2008|title=Hjelmslev's semiotic model of language: An exegesis.|journal=Semiotica|volume=171|issue=171|pages=367\u2013394|doi=10.1515/SEMI.2008.082|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/MiriamTaverniers/Papers/1268201/Hjelmslevs_semiotic_model_of_language_An_exegesis_Taverniers_2008_}}</ref>\n\n== Assessment ==\nHjelmslev made a bold proposal to transform technical analysis into a broad enquiry, emphasising that the true focus of linguistics should be the language and the human [[culture]] that continually reinvents it, and all [[Collective memory|society's memory]] of its accumulated [[knowledge]] preserved through language. This was a challenging but constructive argument at the time, and remains one that still has relevance today.  Most conspicuously, Hjelmslev's lines of inquiry have been taken up by [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[F\u00e9lix Guattari]] (see the \"Postulates of Linguistics\" and \"Geology of Morals\" chapters of ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]''), and subsequently their followers.\n\n== Terminology ==\nHjelmslev introduced the terms ''glosseme'', ''ceneme'', ''prosodeme'' and ''plereme'' as linguistic units, analogous to ''phoneme'', ''morpheme'', etc.<ref>Desblanche, Lucile (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=YOcFiTOiAbMC&pg=PA153&lpg=PA153source=web&ots=7ZLq05gVyw&sig=kOuf6yg4yUeoFCg-G_2BJ3Q5MBE&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=6&ct=result ''Aspects of specialised translation'', p.&nbsp;153.] Google Books.</ref>\n\nAlso, his most famous work, ''Prolegomena to a Theory of Language'', is mostly concerned with the formal definition of a terminology for the analysis of any level of a system of signs, and as such there exists an exclusively Hjelmslevian terminology for that.\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Hjelmslev, Louis (1928).
