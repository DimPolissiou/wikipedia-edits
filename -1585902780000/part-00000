The pair are arrested when they have a fight outside [[The Dog in the Pond]] with [[Adam Morgan (Hollyoaks)|Adam Morgan]] and [[Jamie Nash]]. Toby moves to ''Hollyoaks'' village to help the Hunter family search for [[Ellie Hunter]], when she went missing in [[Ibiza]]. He begins working at The Dog with [[Izzy Cornwell]] and begins living there. Toby is shocked when Ellie returns to ''Hollyoaks''. Ellie warns Toby that when they had sex she may have given him [[gonorrhoea]]. Ellie tells her brother [[Dan Hunter (Hollyoaks)|Dan]] and her father [[Les Hunter (Hollyoaks)|Les]], who attack Toby. Toby keeps his distance from Ellie. He begins dating [[Mandy Richardson]], but the relationship ends when Toby claims that Mandy is too possessive. Toby leaves college and begins to work part-time at The Loft. However, Ellie is the manager at The Loft, which resulted in some tension between her and Toby. Dan advised Toby to not let her get to him, but with Ellie flirting with The Loft's boss [[Scott Anderson (Hollyoaks)|Scott Anderson]], Toby couldn't help feeling jealous.\n\nToby soon discovered that Ellie's parents had thrown her out and he offered her a place to stay at The Dog. The pair began dating again, but Toby still disliked Ellie working for Scott. Soon Scott sacked her and Toby also quit his job at the Loft. Toby\u2019s mum Linda arrived, and she caused a stir in his relationship with Ellie. Ellie put Toby under pressure to choose between her or his mother. Toby made a difficult decision, and decided it was Ellie he wanted to be with and he told his mother that he'd had enough of her interfering. Toby was then worried when Ellie decided to go on a [[reality TV]] program called the Fish Tank. Toby made her promise not to flirt with any men there. During Ellie's experience of The Fish Tank, rumours started to spread around the village that Ellie had slept with someone. Toby became angry by Ellie's actions and was frustrated that Ellie had not kept her promise. Toby demanded [[Chloe Bruce]] allow Ellie to get out of the Fish Tank, otherwise his relationship was over with her. Ellie was allowed out for an hour, and Toby told her that he was getting impatient and angry by Ellie's lies. Ellie got upset about how little Toby thought of her, and told him that she slept with everyone.\n\nToby then murdered a blonde named Roxy at the River Dee. Toby was unwilling to take any responsibility for his actions. After the murder he went home and looked into a mirror and, seemingly, argued with himself, blaming someone else for his actions and telling himself that he is good. Over the next few days Toby felt guilty and especially when Ellie returned and convinced him to give their relationship one last try. A week later, Dan told Toby that he had slept with Roxy, and the police had found her body. The blame of Roxy's death went to Toby's best friend Dan after he slept with her, hours before she was murdered. Toby's best friend and Ellie's brother Dan had been arrested, but with the help of Toby\u2019s guilt, Toby provided Dan with a good solicitor as Dan had been soon released. There was not much evidence against Dan and he was released. When Toby's mother returns she tries to convince him that Ellie is cheating on him. In anger, he struck again this time on teenager [[Steph Dean]] leaving her there for dead but the crime was witnessed and he was followed by his mother Linda. After a confrontation with his mother, Toby lashed out pushing her down the stairs. This had left Toby astonished of what he'd done, and when Ellie arrived the pair managed to make the incident look more like an accident. When the police arrived they told Toby that Linda was dead and further bad news for Toby was that Steph was alive but suffering with memory loss. Toby was left scared of the truth being discovered and feeling guilty after Steph had developed epilepsy post-attack, a condition which she would battle for the rest of her life. He then killed around 11 more blonde girls between July 2002 and October 2003. In order for Toby to stop killing these girls, he needed Ellie to be more committed to him and decided to marry her. Ellie was delighted as the pair got married in a low profile wedding without inviting Ellie\u2019s parents. Steph continues to make progress and begins regaining her memory. Toby confesses to Ellie leaving her frightened and afraid of his next move. Toby was also scared that Ellie would tell the police or her family and stopped her from leaving his flat.\n\nIn the late-night special [[Hollyoaks: Leap of Faith]], Ellie could no longer cope with Toby and ran off to [[Liverpool]], with Toby close in her wake. Ellie confronted him and Toby promised that he would hand himself in, but he just wanted to enjoy his last few hours with her.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McGown|first1=Alistair|title=BFI Television Handbook 2005: The Essential Guide to UK TV: 2005|date=December 28, 2004|publisher=British Film Institute|isbn=1844570274}}</ref> After the hours went by, Toby caught Ellie trying to get in contact with her brother which made Toby furious.

Therefore she decided to separate from her husband; and for this purpose she adroitly convinced him to make a trip to her province of Aquitaine, assuming that his hereditary rights there guaranteed him the possession of the land. Louis, without suspecting the artifice, yielded to the advice of his wife, and went with her. When they were in Aquitaine, she left her husband to join his family.<ref>[[Rodulfus Glaber]]: ''Collection des m\u00e9moires de France par M.

At that time, however, there existed in the Frankish court two factions: one led by Archbishop Adalberon of Reims and Queen Emma, who, being strongly influenced by her mother [[Adelaide of Italy|Empress Adelaide]], wanted the renewal of friendly relationships with the [[Ottonian dynasty]]; the other faction wanted to continue Lothair's policy, and taking advantage of the minority of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], wanted a policy of expansion to the east and the recovery of [[Lotharingia]]. In addition, the young monarch inherited a battle between his father's line of elected kings (which had been interrupted twice by [[Capetian dynasty|the Robertian kings]] and once by the [[Bosonids|Bosonid family]]), and the [[Ottonian]] house of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I the Great|Otto I]]. As defender of Rome, Otto I had the power to name the clergy in Carolingian territory, and the clergy he had named were not supporting the Carolingians.\n\nInitially, Queen Emma dominated the situation, but in the summer of 986 there was a reversal: The Anti-Ottonian party prevailed, after which she was forced to leave court and seek refuge with [[Hugh Capet]]. This event also put Adalberon in a predicament: having been elevated by Otto I to the powerful archbishopric of Reims, he was forced to leave his episcopal seat and took refuge in one of his fortresses on the [[Meuse]] river, who belonged to the Ottonian sphere. The escape of the Archbishop was perceived by Louis V as treason; he turned violently against Adalberon and threatened him with a siege of Reims. The matter was finally settled in a trial court at [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. Before this meeting, however, Louis V changed his mind and sought a reconciliation with Adalberon, and so in the spring of 987, he planned a peace meeting with [[Theophanu|Empress Theophanu]], who could act on behalf of her son Otto III. Before all these tangled events were resolved, Louis V died on 21 May 987<ref>Detlev Schwennicke, ''Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ\u00e4ischen Staaten'', Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J.

But the clergy, including both Adalberon and Gerbert (who later became [[Pope Sylvester II]]), argued eloquently for the election of [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh Capet]], who was not only of royal blood but had proven himself through his actions and his military might. Capet was elected to the Frankish throne and Adalberon crowned him, all within two months of Louis V's death. Thus the rule of the Carolingian dynasty ended and the [[Capetians|Capetian]] era had begun.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[[H. M. Gwatkin|Gwatkin, H.M.]], [[J. P.

When they were in Aquitaine, she left her husband to join his family.<ref>[[Rodulfus Glaber]]: ''Collection des m\u00e9moires de France par M.

At that time, however, there existed in the Frankish court two factions: one led by Archbishop Adalberon of Reims and Queen Emma, who, being strongly influenced by her mother [[Adelaide of Italy|Empress Adelaide]], wanted the renewal of friendly relationships with the [[Ottonian dynasty]]; the other faction wanted to continue Lothair's policy, and taking advantage of the minority of [[Otto III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto III]], wanted a policy of expansion to the east and the recovery of [[Lotharingia]]. In addition, the young monarch inherited a battle between his father's line of elected kings (which had been interrupted twice by [[Capetian dynasty|the Robertian kings]] and once by the [[Bosonids|Bosonid family]]), and the [[Ottonian]] house of the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Otto I the Great|Otto I]]. As defender of Rome, Otto I had the power to name the clergy in Carolingian territory, and the clergy he had named were not supporting the Carolingians.\n\nInitially, Queen Emma dominated the situation, but in the summer of 986 there was a reversal: The Anti-Ottonian party prevailed, after which she was forced to leave court and seek refuge with [[Hugh Capet]]. This event also put Adalberon in a predicament: having been elevated by Otto I to the powerful archbishopric of Reims, he was forced to leave his episcopal seat and took refuge in one of his fortresses on the [[Meuse]] river, who belonged to the Ottonian sphere. The escape of the Archbishop was perceived by Louis V as treason; he turned violently against Adalberon and threatened him with a siege of Reims. The matter was finally settled in a trial court at [[Compi\u00e8gne]]. Before this meeting, however, Louis V changed his mind and sought a reconciliation with Adalberon, and so in the spring of 987, he planned a peace meeting with [[Theophanu|Empress Theophanu]], who could act on behalf of her son Otto III. Before all these tangled events were resolved, Louis V died on 21 May 987<ref>Detlev Schwennicke, ''Europ\u00e4ische Stammtafeln: Stammtafeln zur Geschichte der Europ\u00e4ischen Staaten'', Neue Folge, Band III Teilband 1 (Marburg, Germany: Verlag von J.

But the clergy, including both Adalberon and Gerbert (who later became [[Pope Sylvester II]]), argued eloquently for the election of [[Hugh Capet of France|Hugh Capet]], who was not only of royal blood but had proven himself through his actions and his military might. Capet was elected to the Frankish throne and Adalberon crowned him, all within two months of Louis V's death. Thus the rule of the Carolingian dynasty ended and the [[Capetians|Capetian]] era had begun.\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n*[[H. M. Gwatkin|Gwatkin, H.M.]], [[J. P.

The term is mostly applied to machines that use water as opposed to [[dry cleaning]] (which uses alternative cleaning fluids and is performed by specialist businesses) or [[ultrasonic cleaner]]s. The user adds [[laundry detergent]], which is sold in liquid or powder form, to the wash water.\n\n==History==\n===Washing by hand===\n{{Main|Laundry#History}}\n[[File:Rhof-histWaschmaschine.ogv|thumb|Irreler Bauerntradition shows an early Miele washing machine at the [[Roscheider Hof Open Air Museum]]]]\n\nLaundering by hand involves soaking, beating, scrubbing, and rinsing dirty textiles. Before [[indoor plumbing]], the [[maids]], [[washerwoman]] (laundress), or [[housewife]] also had to carry all the water used for washing, boiling, and rinsing the laundry; according to an 1886 calculation, some women in the United States fetched water eight to ten times every day from a [[pump]], [[Water well|well]], or spring for these purposes.<ref name=digital>{{cite web | publisher = Digital History | title = Housework in Late 19th Century America | first = Steven | last = Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/topic_display.cfm?tcid=93 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref> Water for the laundry would be hand carried, heated on a fire for washing, then poured into the tub. That made the warm soapy water precious; it would be reused, first to wash the least soiled clothing, then to wash progressively dirtier laundry.\n\nRemoval of soap and water from the clothing after washing was a separate process. First, soap would be rinsed out with clear water. After rinsing, the soaking wet clothing would be formed into a roll and twisted by hand to extract water. The entire process often occupied an entire day of hard work, plus drying and ironing.\n\nIt is also often used in [[Washstand|washbasins]].\n\n[[File:Miele 100.jpg|thumb|upright|1930 electric wringer/ mangle washing machine.]]\n[[File:OldMiele2.jpg|thumb|Early [[Miele]] washing machine with a [[Mangle (machine)|mangle]] (probably 1930).]]\n\n===Early machines===\n[[File:Washing machine.jpg|thumb|19th-century Metropolitan washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschmaschine Historisch.jpg|thumb|upright|A vintage German model]]\n\nThe first English [[patent]] \nunder the category of Washing machines was issued in 1691.<ref>''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for a Revised History of Technology'', Autumn Stanley, [[Rutgers University]] Press, 1995, p. 301</ref>  A drawing of an early washing machine appeared in the January 1752 issue of ''The Gentleman's Magazine'', a British publication.

As metal drums started to replace the traditional wooden drums, it allowed for the drum to turn above an open fire or an enclosed fire chamber, raising the water temperature for more effective washes.\n\nIt would not be until the 19th century when steam power would be used in washing machine designs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2896500105.html |title=Washing Machine Facts, information, pictures &#124; Encyclopedia.com articles about Washing Machine |publisher=Encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-01}}</ref>\n\nIn 1862, a patented \"compound rotary washing machine, with rollers for wringing or mangling\"  by Richard Lansdale of Pendleton, Manchester, was shown at the [[1862 International Exhibition|1862 London Exhibition]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/1862_London_Exhibition:_Catalogue:_Class_VIII.:_Richard_Lansdale |title=1862 London Exhibition: Catalogue: Class VIII.: Richard Lansdale |publisher=GracesGuide.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-06-19}}</ref>\n\nThe first United States Patent titled \"Clothes Washing\" was granted to Nathaniel Briggs of [[New Hampshire]] in 1797.

The mechanism was now enclosed within a cabinet, and more attention was paid to electrical and mechanical safety. [[Spin dryer]]s were introduced to replace the dangerous power mangle/wringers of the day.\n\nBy 1940, 60% of the 25,000,000 wired homes in the United States had an electric washing machine.

In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. \n\nAlthough it included many of today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent \"walking\". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.\n\nEarly automatic washing machines were usually connected to a water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps. Later, permanent connections to both the hot and cold water supplies became the norm, as dedicated laundry water hookups became common. Most modern front-loading European machines now only have a cold water connection (called \"cold fill\") and rely completely on internal electric heaters to raise the water temperature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner |title=Test & Vergleich |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225117/http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMany of the early automatic machines had coin-in-the-slot facilities and were installed in the basement laundry rooms of apartment houses.\n\n===World War II and after=== \n{{Globalize |date=September 2016|reason=This is not the \"Washing machine in the US\" article!}}\n[[File:Bendix washing machine. Melbourne Museum.jpg|thumb|A classic Bendix washing machine]]\n[[File:Waschvollautomat Constructa 1950er.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1950s model Constructa]]\n\nAfter the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], US domestic washer production was suspended for the duration of [[World War II]] in favor of manufacturing war [[materiel|material]]. However, numerous US appliance manufacturers were given permission to undertake the research and development of washers during the war years. Many took the opportunity to develop automatic machines, realizing that these represented the future for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1129064419 | author=A. S. Campbell Co. | title = Your Next Washing Machine (or is it?) |date=1942-12-28 |magazine=Time |page=88 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nA large number of US manufacturers introduced competing automatic machines (mainly of the top-loading type) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[General Electric]] also introduced its first top loading automatic model in 1947. This machine had many of the features that are incorporated into modern machines. Another early form of automatic washing machine manufactured by [[The Hoover Company]] used cartridges to program different wash cycles. This system, called the \"Keymatic\", used plastic cartridges with key-like slots and ridges around the edges. The cartridge was inserted into a slot on the machine and a mechanical reader operated the machine accordingly.\n\nSeveral manufacturers produced semi-automatic machines, requiring the user to intervene at one or two points in the wash cycle. A common semi-automatic type (available from Hoover in the UK until at least the 1970s) included two tubs: one with an agitator or impeller for washing, plus another smaller tub for water extraction or centrifugal rinsing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSince their introduction, automatic washing machines have relied on [[timer|electromechanical timer]]s to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist of a series of [[cam]]s on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a [[reduction gearbox]]. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each cam actuates a switch to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor). One of the first was invented in 1957 by [[Winston L. Shelton]] and Gresham N. Jennings, then both [[General Electric]] engineers. The device was granted US Patent 2870278.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.google.la/patents/US2870278 | title = Timing mechanism for conducting a selected one of a plurality of sequences of operation | accessdate = 2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the early electromechanical timers, the motor ran at a constant speed throughout the wash cycle, although it was possible for the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a micro-switch being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process.  Fully electronic timers did not become widespread until decades later.\n\nDespite the high cost of automatic washers, manufacturers had difficulty in meeting the demand.[https://www.clashofclansapk.com/clash-of-magic/] Although there were material shortages during the [[Korean War]], by 1953 automatic washing machine sales in the US exceeded those of wringer-type electric machines.\n\nIn the UK and in most of Europe, electric washing machines did not become popular until the 1950s. This was largely because of the economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully automatic washing machines were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the [[Rolls Razor]] washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. Automatic washing machines did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.\n\nIn early automatic washing machines, any changes in impeller/drum speed were achieved by mechanical means or by a [[rheostat]] on the motor power supply. However, since the 1970s electronic control of motor speed has become a common feature on the more expensive models.\n\n===Modern washers===\n<!-- If you have doubts about something, do not delete text, instead, add the citation needed template or go search for citations! -->\nOver time manufacturers of automatic washers have gone to great lengths to reduce cost. For instance, expensive gearboxes are no longer required, since motor speed can be controlled electronically. Some models can be controlled via WiFi.\n\nEven on some expensive washers, the outer drum of front loading machines is often (but not always) made of plastic (it can also be made out of metal but this is expensive). This makes [[Planned obsolescence|changing the main bearings difficult]], as the plastic drum usually cannot be separated into two halves to enable the inner drum to be removed to gain access to the bearing.\n\nSome manufacturers have taken steps to reduce vibration emanating from their washers, by means of reducing or controlling motor speeds, using hydraulic suspensions instead of spring suspensions, and having freely moving steel balls contained inside a ring mounted on both the front and back sides of the drum in order to counter the weight of the clothes and reduce vibration.\n\nSome machines, since 1998<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lg.com/levant_en/press-release/direct-drive-motor-featured-in-lgs-washing-machines-earns-prestigious-vde-certification|title=Drive Motor In LG'S Washing Machines |website=LG Levant |language=en|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> now use a direct drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly is attached to the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum.<ref>{{cite patent|title=Direct drive motor in washing machine|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en|country=US|number=7750531B2|issue-date=2005-11-08|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> Direct drive eliminates the need for a pulley, belt and belt tensioner.

These proved reliable and cost-effective, so many cheaper machines now also incorporate microcontrollers rather than electromechanical timers. Since the 2010s, some machines have touch panel displays, full color or color displays, or touch sensitive control panels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/uk/laundry/washing-machine/|title=Washing Machines {{!}} Freestanding|website=Samsung uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1994, [[Staber Industries]] released the System 2000 washing machine, which is the only top-loading, horizontal-axis washer to be manufactured in the United States. The hexagonal tub spins like a front-loading machine, using only about one third as much water as conventional top-loaders.  This factor has led to an [[Energy Star]] rating for its high efficiency. This type of horizontal axis washer and dryer (with a circular drum) is often used in Europe, where space is limited, as they can be as thin as 40&nbsp;cm in width.\n\nIn 1998, [[New Zealand]]-based company [[Fisher & Paykel]] introduced its SmartDrive washing machine line in the US. This washing machine uses a computer-controlled system to determine certain factors such as load size and automatically adjusts the wash cycle to match. It also used a mixed system of washing, first with the \"Eco-Active\" wash, using a low level of recirculated water being sprayed on the load followed by a more traditional style wash. The SmartDrive also included direct drive [[brushless DC electric motor]], which simplified the bowl and agitator drive by doing away with the need for a gearbox system.\n\nIn 2000, the British [[inventor]] [[James Dyson]] launched the CR01 [[ContraRotator]], a type of washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a single cylinder machine. In 2004 there was the launch of the CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture. They were discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=James|title=Inside Dyson: CR01|url=http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|publisher=dyson.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024545/http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-18/james-dyson-on-killing-the-contrarotator-his-educative-failure|title=James Dyson on Killing the Contrarotator, His 'Educative Failure'|date=2012-12-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}</ref> It is patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en U.S. Patent US7750531B2], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527 U.S. Patent US6311527], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20010023513 U.S. Patent US20010023513], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527B1/en?q=D06F21%2f04 U.S. Patent US6311527B1], [https://patents.google.com/patent/USD450164 U.S. Patent USD450164].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.dyson.com:80/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112141138/http://www.international.dyson.com/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-11-12|title=Dyson - Patent and design applications|date=2004-11-12|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Whirlpool Corporation]] introduced the Calypso, the first vertical-axis high efficiency washing machine to be top-loading.

The pans on the inside of the lid are placed atop the agitator, and wash water is pumped through the perforated pans to collect lint. (California)]]\n[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|In a top-loading washer, water circulates primarily along the poloidal axis during the wash cycle, as indicated by the red arrow in this illustration of a [[torus]].]]\n\nThe top loading, vertical axis cloth washer, is the dominant design in the United States and Canada. This design places the clothes in a vertically mounted perforated basket that is contained within a water-retaining tub, with a finned water-pumping [[agitator (device)|agitator]] in the center of the bottom of the basket. Clothes are loaded through the top of the machine, which is usually but not always covered with a hinged door.\n\nDuring the wash cycle, the outer tub is filled with water sufficient to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the agitator pushes water outward between the paddles towards the edge of the tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the agitator to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a [[torus]]. The agitator direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket with the agitator rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the agitator with a large rotating screw on the shaft above the agitator, to help move water downwards in the center of the basket.\n\nSince the agitator and the drum are separate and distinct in a top-loading washing machine, the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.\n\nWhile a top-loading washing machine could use a [[universal motor]] or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and more electrically efficient and reliable [[induction motor]]s. The action of a front-loading washing machine is better suited to a motor capable of reversing direction with every reversal of the wash basket; a universal motor is noisier, less efficient, doesn't last as long, but is better suited to the task of reversing direction every few seconds.\n\nAn alternative to the oscillating agitator design is the impeller type washtub pioneered by [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] on its long running ''Hoovermatic'' series of top loading machines.  Here, an [[impeller]] (trademarked by Hoover as a \"Pulsator\") mounted on the side of the tub spins in a constant direction, and creates a fast moving current of water in the tub which drags the clothes through the water along a toroidal path. The impeller design has the advantage of its mechanical simplicity - a single speed motor with belt drive is all that is required to drive the Pulsator with no need for gearboxes or complex electrical controls, but has the disadvantage of lower load capacity in relation to tub size. Hoovermatic machines were made mostly in twin tub format for the European market - (where they competed with [[Hotpoint]]'s ''Supermatic'' line which used the oscillating agitator design) until the early 1990s.  Some industrial garment testing machines still use the Hoover wash action.\n\nThe many different ways different manufacturers have solved the same problem over the years is a good example of many different ways to solve the same [[engineering]] problem with different goals, different manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and different [[patent]] encumbrances.\n\n====Reversible motor====\nIn most current top-loading washers, if the motor spins in one direction, the [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] drives the agitator; if the motor spins the other way, the gearbox locks the agitator and spins the basket and agitator together. Similarly, if the pump motor rotates one way it recirculates the sudsy water; in the other direction it pumps water from the machine during the spin cycle. Mechanically, this system is very simple.\n\n====Mode-changing transmission====\nIn some top loaders, the motor runs only in one direction. During agitation, the transmission converts the rotation into the alternating motion driving the agitator. During the spin cycle, the timer turns on a [[solenoid]] which engages a [[clutch]] locking the motor's rotation to the wash basket, providing a spin cycle. General Electric's very popular line of Filter-Flo (seen to the right) used a variant of this design where the motor reversed only to pump water out of the machine. The same clutch which allows the heavy tub full of wet clothes to \"slip\" as it comes up to the motor's speed, is also allowed to \"slip\" during agitation to engage a Gentle Cycle for delicate clothes.\n\nWhirlpool (Kenmore) created a popular design demonstrating the complex mechanisms which could be used to produce different motions from a single motor with the so-called \"[[wig wag (washing machines)|wig wag]]\" mechanism, which was used for decades until modern controls rendered it obsolete. In the Whirlpool mechanism, a protruding moving piece oscillates in time with the agitation motion. Two solenoids are mounted to this protruding moving piece, with wires attaching them to the timer. During the cycle, the motor operates continuously, and the solenoids on the \"wig wag\" engage agitation or spin. Despite the wires controlling the solenoids being subject to abrasion and broken connections due to their constant motion and the solenoids operating in a damp environment where corrosion could damage them, these machines were surprisingly reliable.\n\n====Reversible motor with mode-changing transmission====\n\nSome top-loaders, especially compact apartment-sized washers, use a hybrid mechanism. The motor reverses direction every few seconds, often with a pause between direction changes, to perform the agitation. Spin cycle is accomplished by engaging a clutch in the transmission. A separate motorized pump is generally used to drain this style of machine. These machines could easily be implemented with [[universal motor]]s or more modern DC [[brushless motors]], but older ones tend to use a capacitor-start [[induction motor]] with a pause between reversals of agitation.\n\n====Top-load advantages====\n\nThe top-loader's spin cycle between washing and rinsing allows an extremely simple passive [[fabric softener]] dispenser, which operates through [[centrifugal force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Fabric softener, vinegar, or any other liquid rinse agent, is placed in a cup at the top of the agitator. It \"rides along\" during the wash cycle. When the spin cycle is engaged, the fabric softener is pulled up by a tapered cup and centrifugal force, where it collects in the top of the spinning agitator. Once the spin cycle is completed, centrifugal force no longer suspends the fabric softener and it falls through the center of the agitator to join the rinse water coming into the tub. The same objective must be accomplished by a [[solenoid valve]] or a pump, and associated timer controls and wiring, on a front loader.\n\nA lint trap can also be built into the center of the agitator,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.consul.com.br/produto/lavadora-consul-facilite-9-kg/|title=M\u00e1quina de Lavar Consul 9kg Turbo Lavagem|work=Consul|access-date=2018-02-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> or on the drum's walls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://panasonic.jp/wash/product/fa_fw_jfa/auto_cleaning.html|title=FW/FD/FA/JFA\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u7279\u9577\uff1a\u81ea\u52d5\u69fd\u6d17\u6d44/\u30ab\u30d3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af/\u300c\u30ca\u30ce\u30a4\u30fc\u300d\u69fd\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 {{!}} \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f {{!}} Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lg.com/in/support/video-tutorials/CT20150045-1394432728524-maintenance|title=LG Video Tutorials: Video: Magic/Lint Filter Cleaning ( Top loading) {{!}} LG India|website=www.lg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/137356|title=What is the function of Magic Filter in a Samsung Washing Machine?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/za/support/skp/faq/1139253|title=What is Magic Filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/1138351|title=How to clean the Magic filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>  passively collecting lint from water forced through the agitator. Front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine.\n\nAnother advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water, rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals. Top loaders may require less periodic maintenance, since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows, although a plastic tub may still require a periodic \"maintenance wash\" cycle (described below).\n\nAs with front-loading washers, clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam the motion of the agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical \"fuse\" designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft, possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.\n\nSome top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines, and are [[#Variant and hybrid designs|described below]].\n\n===Front-loading===\n[[File:WashingMachine, manufactured by ArcticRomania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arctic S.A.|Arctic]] BE1200A+ is a front loading budget model sold in 2008 with {{convert|6|kg|adj=on}} load, LCD indicator, 1200 RPM]]\n[[File:Drum of a washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440).jpg|thumb|Modern drum of front-loading washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440)]]\nThe front-loading or horizontal-axis clothes washer is the dominant design in Europe. In the U.S. and elsewhere, most \"high-end\" washing machines are of this type. In addition, most commercial and industrial clothes washers around the world are of the horizontal-axis design.\n\nThis layout mounts the inner basket and outer tub horizontally, and loading is through a door at the front of the machine. The door often but not always contains a transparent window. Agitation is supplied by the back-and-forth rotation of the cylinder and by gravity. The clothes are lifted up by paddles on the inside wall of the drum and then dropped. This motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load. Because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water, only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric. Because less water is required, front-loaders typically use less soap, and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds.\n\nFront-loaders control water usage through the [[surface tension]] of water, and the [[capillary action|capillary wicking action]] this creates in the fabric weave. A front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level, but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture, causing the water level to drop. The washer then refills to maintain the original water level. Because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric, nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum, to rapidly saturate the clothes with water.\n\nFront-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders, with the main motor (a [[universal motor]] or [[variable-frequency drive]] motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large [[pulley]] wheel, without the need for a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of [[gravity]] pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a [[gasket]] to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.\n\nNearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible [[bellows]] assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, plugging the drain and possibly jamming rotation of the inner basket. Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of the front of the washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.\n\nThe bellows assembly around the door is a potential source of problems for the consumer front-loader. The bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle. On many machines, these folds can collect lint, dirt, and moisture, resulting in [[mold]] and [[mildew]] growth, and a foul odor. Some front-loading washer operating instructions say the bellows should be wiped down monthly with a strong bleach solution, while others offer a special \"freshening\" cycle where the machine is run empty with a strong dosing of bleach.\n\nThe inherent mechanical weak spot of the front loader design is the [[cantilever]]ed mounting of the inner drum within the outer tub.  The drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum, the laundry, and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle.  The drum bearing eventually wears out, and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace, which often results in the machine being [[Write-off|written off]] due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew.  Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by \"overmolding\" the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of [[Planned obsolescence|built-in obsolescence]].\n\nCompared to top-loading washers, clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader, up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle. This is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth, and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing. Extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket, potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub, and in severe cases, tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket.\n\n===Variant and hybrid designs===\n[[File:European top washingmachine.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2008)]]\n<!-- [[File:tvatt.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2001)]] -->\n\nThere are many variations of the two general designs. Top-loading machines in [[Asia]] use [[impeller]]s instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except that they do not have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.\n\nSome machines which actually load from the top are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, but there is no front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life. This type of washing machine is popular in Europe, where space is limited, as a washer can be as little as 40&nbsp;cm wide, and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.candy.fi/en_GB/appliances/wash-dry/top-loading-washing-machines/-/catalog/16314605/clt-272l-s|title=Candy Top loading washing machines. Comfort and efficiency - Candy|website=www.candy.fi|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThere are also [[combo washer dryer]] machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum, eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine.  In principle, these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning (the combined cycle is considerably longer), but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced. The drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices, because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing, but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself. These machines are used more in Europe, because they can be fitted into small spaces, and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections. In these machines, the washer and dryer functions often have different capacities, with the dryer usually having the lowest capacity. These machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation, or with a laundry center, which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation. Laundry centers usually have the dryer on top of the washer, with the controls for both machines being on a single control panel. Often, the controls are simpler than the controls on a washer-dryer combo or a dedicated washer and dryer. Some implementations are patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6343492B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US6343492B1] and [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6363756B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US 6363756B1].\n\n===Comparison===\nTrue front-loaders, and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above, can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects:\n\n* Efficient cleaning: Front-loaders usually use less energy, water, and detergent compared to the best top-loaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/washing_machines.htm | title=Laundry Products Research | date=March 2008}}</ref> High efficiency washers use 20% to 60% of the detergent, water and energy of standard\"{{explain|date=February 2020}} washers.  They usually take somewhat longer (20\u2013110 minutes) to wash a load, but are often computer controlled with additional sensors, to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load.  As this technology improves, the [[human interface]] will also improve, to make it easier to understand and control the many different cleaning options.\n* Water usage: Front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers. Estimates are that front-loaders use from one third<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housewares.about.com/lw/Home-Garden/Home-improvement-renovation/Top-Loading-vs-Front-Loading-Washers-Which-is-Better-.htm | title=About.com}}</ref> to one half<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/appliances/washers.html | title=Consumer Energy Center}}</ref> as much water as top-loaders.\n* Spin-dry effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European horizontal axis top loaders and some front loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds of up to 2000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]], although home machines tend to be in the 1000 to 1400&nbsp;RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140&nbsp;RPM.  High-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower.  Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the [[g-force]], and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster. This also reduces energy consumption if clothes are dried in a [[clothes dryer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* Cycle length: Top-loaders have tended to have shorter cycle times, in part because their design has traditionally emphasized simplicity and speed of operation more than resource conservation.\n* Wear and abrasion: Top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively, which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics.  Front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning; this gentler action causes less wear.  The amount of clothes wear can be roughly gauged by the amount of accumulation in a clothes dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] filter, since the lint largely consists of stray fibers detached from textiles during washing and drying.\n* Difficult items: Top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items, such as [[sleeping bag]]s or [[pillow]]s, which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it. In addition, vigorous top-loader agitator motions may damage delicate fabrics.\n* Noise: Front-loaders tend to operate more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, and because there is less of a tendency to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a [[mechanical transmission]] (due to agitators, see above), which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders.\n* Compactness: True front-loading machines may be installed underneath counter-height work surfaces. A front-loading washing machine, in a fully fitted kitchen, may even be disguised as a [[kitchen cabinet]].  These models can also be convenient in homes with limited floor area, since the clothes dryer may be installed directly above the washer (\"stacked\" configuration).\n* Water leakage: Top-loading machines are less prone to leakage, because simple [[gravity]] can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top.  True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out.  This seal may leak and require replacement.  However, many current front-loaders use so little water that they can be stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level.  Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a [[floor drain]] or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a [[solenoid valve]] getting stuck in the open position.\n* Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular \"freshening\" cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.\n* Accessibility and ergonomics: Front-loaders are more convenient for [[Dwarfism|very short people]] and those with [[paraplegia]], as the controls are front-mounted and the horizontal drum eliminates the need for standing or climbing. Risers, also referred to as pedestals, often with storage drawers underneath, can be used to raise the door of a true front-loader closer to the user's level.\n* Initial cost: In countries where top-loaders are popular, front-loaders tend to be more expensive to buy than top-loaders, though their lower operating costs can ultimately lead to lower [[total cost of ownership]], especially if energy, detergent, or water are expensive. On the other hand, in countries with a large front-loader user base, top-loaders are usually seen as alternatives and more expensive than basic off-brand front loaders, although without many differences in [[total cost of ownership]] apart from design-originated ones. In addition, manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating, automatic dirt sensors, and high-speed emptying on front-loaders, although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders.\n\n==Wash cycles==\n[[File:Waescheschleuder.jpg|thumb|upright|German laundry [[centrifuge]] to extract water from laundry.  The advent of automatic washing machines with spin cycles made such specialized appliances largely obsolete by the 1970s.]]\n\nThe earliest washing machines simply carried out a washing action when loaded with clothes and soap, filled with hot water, and started. Over time machines became more and more automated, first with very complex electromechanical controllers, then fully electronic controllers; users put clothes into the machine, select a suitable program via a switch, start the machine, and come back to remove clean and slightly damp clothes at the end of the cycle. The controller starts and stops many different processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.\n\n===Washing===\nMany front loading machines have internal electrical heating elements to heat the wash water, to near boiling if desired. The rate of chemical cleaning action of the detergent and other laundry chemicals increases greatly with temperature, in accordance with the [[Arrhenius equation]]. Washing machines with internal heaters can use special detergents formulated to release different chemical ingredients at different temperatures, allowing different type of stains and soils to be cleaned from the clothes as the wash water is heated up by the electrical heater.\n\nHowever, higher-temperature washing uses more energy, and many fabrics and elastics are damaged at higher temperatures. Temperatures exceeding {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} have the undesirable effect of inactivating the [[enzyme]]s when using [[biological detergent]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany machines are cold-fill, connected to cold water only, which they heat to [[operating temperature]]. Where water can be heated more cheaply or with less carbon dioxide emission than by electricity, cold-fill operation is inefficient.\n\nFront loaders need to use low-sudsing detergents because the tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows.  However, due to efficient use of water and detergent, the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent, without lessening cleaning action.\n\n===Rinsing===\nWashing machines perform several rinses after the main wash to remove most of the [[detergent]]. Modern washing machines use less [[water]] due to [[environmental concern]]s; however, this has led to the problem of poor rinsing on many washing machines on the [[Market (economics)|market]],<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitegoodshelp.co.uk/wordpress/why-cant-modern-washing-machines-rinse-properly/ |title=Why can't modern washing machines rinse properly? |publisher=Whitegoodshelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> which can be a problem to people who are [[Allergy|sensitive]] to [[detergent]]s. The [[Allergy UK]] website suggests re-running the rinse cycle, or rerunning the entire wash cycle without [[detergent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |title=Allergy Tips and Advice for Household Cleaning |publisher=Allergyuk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613062143/http://allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |archive-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn response to complaints, many washing machines allow the user to select additional rinse cycles, at the [[expense]] of higher [[water usage]] and longer cycle time.\n\n===Spinning===\nHigher spin speeds, along with larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to faster drying. On the other hand, avoid [[ironing]] can be obtained not using spin cycle in the washing machine.\n\nIf a heated [[clothes dryer|clothes-dryer]] is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes. However, faster spinning can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.\n\nIn 1976, most front loading washing machines spun at around 700 rpm, or less.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSeparate spin-driers, without washing functionality, are available for specialized applications.  For example, a small high-speed [[centrifuge]] machine may be provided in [[locker room]]s of communal [[swimming pool]]s to allow wet [[swimsuit]]s to be substantially dried to a slightly damp condition after daily use.\n\n===Maintenance wash===\nMany home washing machines use a plastic, rather than metal, outer shell to contain the wash water; residue can build up on the plastic tub over time. Some manufacturers advise users to perform a regular maintenance or \"freshening\" wash to clean the inside of the washing machine of any [[mold]], [[bacteria]], encrusted detergent, and unspecified dirt more effectively than with a normal wash.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA maintenance wash is performed without any laundry, on the hottest wash program if there is a heater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washerhelp.co.uk/usage_2.html |title=Washing machine usage (part 2) |publisher=Washerhelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> adding substances such as [[white vinegar]], 100 grams of [[citric acid]], a detergent with bleaching properties, or a proprietary washing machine cleaner.

All else being equal, a machine of higher capacity will cost more to buy, but will be more convenient if large amounts of laundry must be cleaned. Fewer runs of a machine of larger capacity may have lower running costs and better energy and [[water efficiency]] than frequent use of a smaller machine, particularly for large families. Running a large machine with small loads is wasteful.\n\nFor many years energy and water efficiency were not regulated, and little attention was paid to them. From the last part of the twentieth century increasing attention was paid to efficiency, with regulations enforcing some standards, and efficiency being a selling point, both to save on running costs and to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions associated with energy generation, and waste of water.\n\nAs energy and water efficiency became regulated, they became a selling point, however, the effectiveness of rinsing was not regulated, and it didn't directly become a selling point. Therefore, manufacturers tended to reduce the degree of rinsing after washing, saving water and motor energy. This had the side-effect of leaving more detergent residue in clothes. Insufficient rinsing can leave enough detergent in clothes to affect people with allergies or sensitivity.<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|upright|The EU requires washing machines carry an efficiency label]]\nWashing machines display an [[EU Energy Label]] with grades for energy efficiency, washing performance and spin efficiency. Grades for energy efficiency run from A+++ to G (best to worst), providing a simple method for judging running costs. Washing performance and spin efficiency are graded in the range A to G. However, all machines for sale must have washing performance A, such that manufacturers cannot compromise washing performance in order to improve the energy efficiency. This labeling has had the desired effect of driving customers toward more efficient washing machines and away from less efficient ones.\n\nThe TopTenEU and other national TopTen European organizations provide independent recommendations for high efficient washing machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html&fromid= |title=Selection criteria washing machines |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425102236/http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html%26fromid%3D |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |publisher=TopTenEU}}</ref>\n\nAccording to newer [[regulation]]s, each washing machine is equipped with a waste water filter. There are two reasons for that. On one hand it has to be ensured that no hazardous [[chemical substance]]s are disposed of improperly through the waste water channel; on the other hand it must also be ensured that in case of a backwards shear in the waste water channel that is possible in case of technical problems, the [[feces]] and other [[waste]] could not enter the washing machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |author= Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 147|year = 2014}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nTop-loading and front-loading clothes washers are covered by a single Federal Standard regulating energy consumption.

Certified Energy Star units can be compared by their Modified Energy Factor (MEF) and Water Factor (WF) coefficients.\n \nThe MEF tells us how many [[cubic feet]] (about 28.3 liters) of clothes are washed per kWh (kilowatt hour) and is closely related to the configuration of the washer (top-loading, front-loading), its spin speed and the temperatures and the amount of water used in the rinse and wash cycles.\n\nEnergy Star residential clothes washers have a MEF of at least 2.0 (the higher the better), but the best machines may reach 3.5.

They are built with large easy-to-open service covers, and washers are designed not to require access to the underside for service. Often commercial washers are installed in long rows with a wide access passageway behind all the machines to allow maintenance without moving the heavy machines.\n\n===Laundromat machines===\nMany commercial washers are built for use by the general public, and are installed in publicly accessible [[laundromat]]s or laundrettes, operated by [[currency acceptor|money accepting devices]] or [[Magnetic stripe card|card readers]]. The features of a commercial laundromat washer are more limited than a consumer washer, usually offering just two or three basic wash programs and an option to choose wash cycle temperatures.\n\nThe common front-loading commercial washing machine also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models [[pump]] used washer water out, allowing the waste line to be located above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only [[gravity]] to expel used water. A drain in the rear, at the bottom of the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and drain. The trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height,  and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.\n\nMost laundromat machines are horizontal-axis front-loading models, because of their lower operating costs (notably lower consumption of expensive hot water).\n\n===Industrial washers===\n<!-- [[File:Lapauw Combi 2000.jpg|thumb|A 1980s Belgian {{convert|180|kg|0|abbr=on}} load industrial washer in a Hotel in Brussels (horizontal axis, front load)]] -->\n[[File:Lapauw Combi 1000.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1980s Belgian {{nowrap|90 kg}} load industrial washer (horizontal axis, front load)]]\nBy contrast, commercial washers for ''internal'' business operations (still often referred to as \"washer/extractor\" machines) may include features absent from domestic machines. Many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types, so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and fabric softeners for each load by hand. Instead, a precise metering system draws the detergents and wash additives directly from large liquid-chemical storage barrels and injects them as needed into the various wash and rinse cycles. Some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator  control over the various wash and rinse cycles, allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles.\n\nMost large-scale industrial washers are horizontal-axis machines, but may have front-, side-, or top-load doors. Some industrial clothes washers can batch-process up to {{convert|800|lb}} of textiles at once, and can be used for extremely machine-abusive washing tasks such as [[stone washing]] or fabric [[bleaching]] and [[dyeing]].\n\nAn industrial washer can be mounted on heavy-duty [[shock absorbers]] and attached to a concrete floor, so that it can extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on [[hydraulic cylinders]], permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a [[conveyor belt]] once the cycle is complete. \n \nOne special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the [[tunnel washer]].  This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an [[assembly line]], with different processes at different positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isopasse.com.br/dicas/lavadora-de-roupas-melhor-marca/|title=Lavadora de Roupas - Qual a melhor marca?|last=Guilherme|date=2017-08-17|website=Isopasse|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Social impact==\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|\"Woman's Friend\" machine (c. 1890)]]\nThe historically laborious process of washing clothes ([[wikt:laundry day|a task which often had a whole day set aside to perform]]) has at times been labelled 'woman's work'.

In appearance and mechanical detail, this first machine was not unlike the front loading automatic washers produced today. \n\nAlthough it included many of today's basic features, the machine lacked any drum suspension and therefore had to be anchored to the floor to prevent \"walking\". Because of the components required, the machine was also very expensive. For instance, the Bendix Home Laundry Service Manual (published November 1, 1946) shows that the drum speed change was facilitated by a 2-speed gearbox built to a heavy duty standard (not unlike a car automatic gearbox, albeit at a smaller size). The timer was also probably fairly costly, because miniature electric motors were expensive to produce.\n\nEarly automatic washing machines were usually connected to a water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps. Later, permanent connections to both the hot and cold water supplies became the norm, as dedicated laundry water hookups became common. Most modern front-loading European machines now only have a cold water connection (called \"cold fill\") and rely completely on internal electric heaters to raise the water temperature.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner |title=Test & Vergleich |accessdate=March 17, 2016 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305225117/http://www.trocknerland.com/waermepumpentrockner/ |archivedate=March 5, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nMany of the early automatic machines had coin-in-the-slot facilities and were installed in the basement laundry rooms of apartment houses.\n\n===World War II and after=== \n{{Globalize |date=September 2016|reason=This is not the \"Washing machine in the US\" article!}}\n[[File:Bendix washing machine.

However, numerous US appliance manufacturers were given permission to undertake the research and development of washers during the war years. Many took the opportunity to develop automatic machines, realizing that these represented the future for the industry.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://gogd.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1129064419 | author=A. S. Campbell Co. | title = Your Next Washing Machine (or is it?) |date=1942-12-28 |magazine=Time |page=88 | accessdate = 13 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nA large number of US manufacturers introduced competing automatic machines (mainly of the top-loading type) in the late 1940s and early 1950s. [[General Electric]] also introduced its first top loading automatic model in 1947. This machine had many of the features that are incorporated into modern machines. Another early form of automatic washing machine manufactured by [[The Hoover Company]] used cartridges to program different wash cycles. This system, called the \"Keymatic\", used plastic cartridges with key-like slots and ridges around the edges. The cartridge was inserted into a slot on the machine and a mechanical reader operated the machine accordingly.\n\nSeveral manufacturers produced semi-automatic machines, requiring the user to intervene at one or two points in the wash cycle. A common semi-automatic type (available from Hoover in the UK until at least the 1970s) included two tubs: one with an agitator or impeller for washing, plus another smaller tub for water extraction or centrifugal rinsing.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nSince their introduction, automatic washing machines have relied on [[timer|electromechanical timer]]s to sequence the washing and extraction process. Electromechanical timers consist of a series of [[cam]]s on a common shaft driven by a small electric motor via a [[reduction gearbox]]. At the appropriate time in the wash cycle, each cam actuates a switch to engage or disengage a particular part of the machinery (for example, the drain pump motor). One of the first was invented in 1957 by [[Winston L. Shelton]] and Gresham N. Jennings, then both [[General Electric]] engineers. The device was granted US Patent 2870278.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://www.google.la/patents/US2870278 | title = Timing mechanism for conducting a selected one of a plurality of sequences of operation | accessdate = 2 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nOn the early electromechanical timers, the motor ran at a constant speed throughout the wash cycle, although it was possible for the user to truncate parts of the program by manually advancing the control dial. However, by the 1950s demand for greater flexibility in the wash cycle led to the introduction of more sophisticated electrical timers to supplement the electromechanical timer. These newer timers enabled greater variation in functions such as the wash time. With this arrangement, the electric timer motor is periodically switched off to permit the clothing to soak, and is only re-energized just prior to a micro-switch being engaged or disengaged for the next stage of the process.  Fully electronic timers did not become widespread until decades later.\n\nDespite the high cost of automatic washers, manufacturers had difficulty in meeting the demand.[https://www.clashofclansapk.com/clash-of-magic/] Although there were material shortages during the [[Korean War]], by 1953 automatic washing machine sales in the US exceeded those of wringer-type electric machines.\n\nIn the UK and in most of Europe, electric washing machines did not become popular until the 1950s. This was largely because of the economic impact of World War II on the consumer market, which did not properly recover until the late 1950s. The early electric washers were single-tub, wringer-type machines, as fully automatic washing machines were extremely expensive. During the 1960s, twin tub machines briefly became very popular, helped by the low price of the [[Rolls Razor]] washers. Some machines had the ability to pump used wash water into a separate tub for temporary storage, and to later pump it back for re-use. This was done not to save water or soap, but because heated water was expensive and time-consuming to produce. Automatic washing machines did not become dominant in the UK until well into the 1970s and by then were almost exclusively of the front-loader design.\n\nIn early automatic washing machines, any changes in impeller/drum speed were achieved by mechanical means or by a [[rheostat]] on the motor power supply. However, since the 1970s electronic control of motor speed has become a common feature on the more expensive models.\n\n===Modern washers===\n<!-- If you have doubts about something, do not delete text, instead, add the citation needed template or go search for citations! -->\nOver time manufacturers of automatic washers have gone to great lengths to reduce cost. For instance, expensive gearboxes are no longer required, since motor speed can be controlled electronically. Some models can be controlled via WiFi.\n\nEven on some expensive washers, the outer drum of front loading machines is often (but not always) made of plastic (it can also be made out of metal but this is expensive). This makes [[Planned obsolescence|changing the main bearings difficult]], as the plastic drum usually cannot be separated into two halves to enable the inner drum to be removed to gain access to the bearing.\n\nSome manufacturers have taken steps to reduce vibration emanating from their washers, by means of reducing or controlling motor speeds, using hydraulic suspensions instead of spring suspensions, and having freely moving steel balls contained inside a ring mounted on both the front and back sides of the drum in order to counter the weight of the clothes and reduce vibration.\n\nSome machines, since 1998<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lg.com/levant_en/press-release/direct-drive-motor-featured-in-lgs-washing-machines-earns-prestigious-vde-certification|title=Drive Motor In LG'S Washing Machines |website=LG Levant |language=en|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> now use a direct drive motor, a low aspect ratio device, where the stator assembly is attached to the rear of the outer drum, whilst the co-axial rotor is mounted on the shaft of the inner drum.<ref>{{cite patent|title=Direct drive motor in washing machine|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en|country=US|number=7750531B2|issue-date=2005-11-08|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref> Direct drive eliminates the need for a pulley, belt and belt tensioner.

It also used a mixed system of washing, first with the \"Eco-Active\" wash, using a low level of recirculated water being sprayed on the load followed by a more traditional style wash. The SmartDrive also included direct drive [[brushless DC electric motor]], which simplified the bowl and agitator drive by doing away with the need for a gearbox system.\n\nIn 2000, the British [[inventor]] [[James Dyson]] launched the CR01 [[ContraRotator]], a type of washing machine with two cylinders rotating in opposite directions. It was claimed that this design reduced the wash time and produced cleaner washing than a single cylinder machine. In 2004 there was the launch of the CR02, which was the first washing machine to gain the British Allergy Foundation Seal of Approval. However, neither of the ContraRotator machines are now in production as they were too expensive to manufacture. They were discontinued in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dyson|first=James|title=Inside Dyson: CR01|url=http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|publisher=dyson.co.uk|accessdate=13 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523024545/http://content.dyson.co.uk/insideDyson/article.asp?aID=cr01&disType=nonFlash&dir=&cp=&hf=1&js=1|archive-date=23 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2012-12-18/james-dyson-on-killing-the-contrarotator-his-educative-failure|title=James Dyson on Killing the Contrarotator, His 'Educative Failure'|date=2012-12-18|work=Bloomberg.com|access-date=2018-02-19|language=en}}</ref> It is patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US7750531B2/en U.S. Patent US7750531B2], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527 U.S. Patent US6311527], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US20010023513 U.S. Patent US20010023513], [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6311527B1/en?q=D06F21%2f04 U.S. Patent US6311527B1], [https://patents.google.com/patent/USD450164 U.S. Patent USD450164].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.international.dyson.com:80/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041112141138/http://www.international.dyson.com/tech/contrarotator/patents.asp|url-status=dead|archive-date=2004-11-12|title=Dyson - Patent and design applications|date=2004-11-12|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, [[Whirlpool Corporation]] introduced the Calypso, the first vertical-axis high efficiency washing machine to be top-loading.

The pans on the inside of the lid are placed atop the agitator, and wash water is pumped through the perforated pans to collect lint. (California)]]\n[[File:Toroidal coord.png|thumb|In a top-loading washer, water circulates primarily along the poloidal axis during the wash cycle, as indicated by the red arrow in this illustration of a [[torus]].]]\n\nThe top loading, vertical axis cloth washer, is the dominant design in the United States and Canada. This design places the clothes in a vertically mounted perforated basket that is contained within a water-retaining tub, with a finned water-pumping [[agitator (device)|agitator]] in the center of the bottom of the basket. Clothes are loaded through the top of the machine, which is usually but not always covered with a hinged door.\n\nDuring the wash cycle, the outer tub is filled with water sufficient to fully immerse and suspend the clothing freely in the basket. The movement of the agitator pushes water outward between the paddles towards the edge of the tub. The water then moves outward, up the sides of the basket, towards the center, and then down towards the agitator to repeat the process, in a circulation pattern similar to the shape of a [[torus]]. The agitator direction is periodically reversed, because continuous motion in one direction would just lead to the water spinning around the basket with the agitator rather than the water being pumped in the torus-shaped motion. Some washers supplement the water-pumping action of the agitator with a large rotating screw on the shaft above the agitator, to help move water downwards in the center of the basket.\n\nSince the agitator and the drum are separate and distinct in a top-loading washing machine, the mechanism of a top-loader is inherently more complicated than a front-loading machine. Manufacturers have devised several ways to control the motion of the agitator during wash and rinse separately from the high speed rotation of the drum required for the spin cycle.\n\nWhile a top-loading washing machine could use a [[universal motor]] or DC brushless motor, it is conventional for top-loading washing machines to use more expensive, heavy, and more electrically efficient and reliable [[induction motor]]s. The action of a front-loading washing machine is better suited to a motor capable of reversing direction with every reversal of the wash basket; a universal motor is noisier, less efficient, doesn't last as long, but is better suited to the task of reversing direction every few seconds.\n\nAn alternative to the oscillating agitator design is the impeller type washtub pioneered by [[The Hoover Company|Hoover]] on its long running ''Hoovermatic'' series of top loading machines.  Here, an [[impeller]] (trademarked by Hoover as a \"Pulsator\") mounted on the side of the tub spins in a constant direction, and creates a fast moving current of water in the tub which drags the clothes through the water along a toroidal path. The impeller design has the advantage of its mechanical simplicity - a single speed motor with belt drive is all that is required to drive the Pulsator with no need for gearboxes or complex electrical controls, but has the disadvantage of lower load capacity in relation to tub size. Hoovermatic machines were made mostly in twin tub format for the European market - (where they competed with [[Hotpoint]]'s ''Supermatic'' line which used the oscillating agitator design) until the early 1990s.  Some industrial garment testing machines still use the Hoover wash action.\n\nThe many different ways different manufacturers have solved the same problem over the years is a good example of many different ways to solve the same [[engineering]] problem with different goals, different manufacturing capabilities and expertise, and different [[patent]] encumbrances.\n\n====Reversible motor====\nIn most current top-loading washers, if the motor spins in one direction, the [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] drives the agitator; if the motor spins the other way, the gearbox locks the agitator and spins the basket and agitator together. Similarly, if the pump motor rotates one way it recirculates the sudsy water; in the other direction it pumps water from the machine during the spin cycle. Mechanically, this system is very simple.\n\n====Mode-changing transmission====\nIn some top loaders, the motor runs only in one direction. During agitation, the transmission converts the rotation into the alternating motion driving the agitator. During the spin cycle, the timer turns on a [[solenoid]] which engages a [[clutch]] locking the motor's rotation to the wash basket, providing a spin cycle. General Electric's very popular line of Filter-Flo (seen to the right) used a variant of this design where the motor reversed only to pump water out of the machine. The same clutch which allows the heavy tub full of wet clothes to \"slip\" as it comes up to the motor's speed, is also allowed to \"slip\" during agitation to engage a Gentle Cycle for delicate clothes.\n\nWhirlpool (Kenmore) created a popular design demonstrating the complex mechanisms which could be used to produce different motions from a single motor with the so-called \"[[wig wag (washing machines)|wig wag]]\" mechanism, which was used for decades until modern controls rendered it obsolete. In the Whirlpool mechanism, a protruding moving piece oscillates in time with the agitation motion. Two solenoids are mounted to this protruding moving piece, with wires attaching them to the timer. During the cycle, the motor operates continuously, and the solenoids on the \"wig wag\" engage agitation or spin. Despite the wires controlling the solenoids being subject to abrasion and broken connections due to their constant motion and the solenoids operating in a damp environment where corrosion could damage them, these machines were surprisingly reliable.\n\n====Reversible motor with mode-changing transmission====\n\nSome top-loaders, especially compact apartment-sized washers, use a hybrid mechanism. The motor reverses direction every few seconds, often with a pause between direction changes, to perform the agitation. Spin cycle is accomplished by engaging a clutch in the transmission. A separate motorized pump is generally used to drain this style of machine. These machines could easily be implemented with [[universal motor]]s or more modern DC [[brushless motors]], but older ones tend to use a capacitor-start [[induction motor]] with a pause between reversals of agitation.\n\n====Top-load advantages====\n\nThe top-loader's spin cycle between washing and rinsing allows an extremely simple passive [[fabric softener]] dispenser, which operates through [[centrifugal force]] and [[Gravitation|gravity]]. Fabric softener, vinegar, or any other liquid rinse agent, is placed in a cup at the top of the agitator. It \"rides along\" during the wash cycle. When the spin cycle is engaged, the fabric softener is pulled up by a tapered cup and centrifugal force, where it collects in the top of the spinning agitator. Once the spin cycle is completed, centrifugal force no longer suspends the fabric softener and it falls through the center of the agitator to join the rinse water coming into the tub. The same objective must be accomplished by a [[solenoid valve]] or a pump, and associated timer controls and wiring, on a front loader.\n\nA lint trap can also be built into the center of the agitator,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.consul.com.br/produto/lavadora-consul-facilite-9-kg/|title=M\u00e1quina de Lavar Consul 9kg Turbo Lavagem|work=Consul|access-date=2018-02-19|language=pt-BR}}</ref> or on the drum's walls,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://panasonic.jp/wash/product/fa_fw_jfa/auto_cleaning.html|title=FW/FD/FA/JFA\u30b7\u30ea\u30fc\u30ba\u7279\u9577\uff1a\u81ea\u52d5\u69fd\u6d17\u6d44/\u30ab\u30d3\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u30bf\u30f3\u30af/\u300c\u30ca\u30ce\u30a4\u30fc\u300d\u69fd\u30af\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3 {{!}} \u6d17\u6fef\u6a5f\uff0f\u8863\u985e\u4e7e\u71e5\u6a5f {{!}} Panasonic|website=panasonic.jp|language=ja|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.lg.com/in/support/video-tutorials/CT20150045-1394432728524-maintenance|title=LG Video Tutorials: Video: Magic/Lint Filter Cleaning ( Top loading) {{!}} LG India|website=www.lg.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/137356|title=What is the function of Magic Filter in a Samsung Washing Machine?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/za/support/skp/faq/1139253|title=What is Magic Filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.samsung.com/in/support/skp/faq/1138351|title=How to clean the Magic filter in Samsung Washing Machine ?|website=www.samsung.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>  passively collecting lint from water forced through the agitator. Front-loaders tend to require separate pumps and plumbing to provide lint filters which are often mounted behind covers on the bottom of the machine.\n\nAnother advantage to the top loading design is the reliance on gravity to contain the water, rather than potentially trouble-prone or short-lived front door seals. Top loaders may require less periodic maintenance, since there is no need to clean a door seal or bellows, although a plastic tub may still require a periodic \"maintenance wash\" cycle (described below).\n\nAs with front-loading washers, clothing should not be packed tightly into a top-loading washer. Although wet fabric usually fits into a smaller space than dry fabric, a dense wad of fabric can restrict water circulation, resulting in poor soap distribution and incomplete rinsing. Extremely overloaded top-loading washers can either jam the motion of the agitator, overloading or damaging the motor or gearbox, burning drive belts, or tearing fabrics - many Whirlpool/Kenmore machines even have a mechanical \"fuse\" designed to break before the expensive motor is damaged. Extreme overloading can also push fabrics into the small gap between the underside of the agitator and the bottom of the wash basket, resulting in fabrics wrapped around the agitator shaft, possibly requiring agitator removal to unjam.\n\nSome top-loading machines use mechanisms very similar to front-loading drum machines, and are [[#Variant and hybrid designs|described below]].\n\n===Front-loading===\n[[File:WashingMachine, manufactured by ArcticRomania.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arctic S.A.|Arctic]] BE1200A+ is a front loading budget model sold in 2008 with {{convert|6|kg|adj=on}} load, LCD indicator, 1200 RPM]]\n[[File:Drum of a washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440).jpg|thumb|Modern drum of front-loading washing machine (Bosch Maxx WFO 2440)]]\nThe front-loading or horizontal-axis clothes washer is the dominant design in Europe. In the U.S. and elsewhere, most \"high-end\" washing machines are of this type. In addition, most commercial and industrial clothes washers around the world are of the horizontal-axis design.\n\nThis layout mounts the inner basket and outer tub horizontally, and loading is through a door at the front of the machine. The door often but not always contains a transparent window. Agitation is supplied by the back-and-forth rotation of the cylinder and by gravity. The clothes are lifted up by paddles on the inside wall of the drum and then dropped. This motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load. Because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water, only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric. Because less water is required, front-loaders typically use less soap, and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds.\n\nFront-loaders control water usage through the [[surface tension]] of water, and the [[capillary action|capillary wicking action]] this creates in the fabric weave. A front-loader washer always fills to the same low water level, but a large pile of dry clothing standing in water will soak up the moisture, causing the water level to drop. The washer then refills to maintain the original water level. Because it takes time for this water absorption to occur with a motionless pile of fabric, nearly all front-loaders begin the washing process by slowly tumbling the clothing under the stream of water entering and filling the drum, to rapidly saturate the clothes with water.\n\nFront-loading washers are mechanically simple compared to top-loaders, with the main motor (a [[universal motor]] or [[variable-frequency drive]] motor) normally being connected to the drum via a grooved pulley belt and large [[pulley]] wheel, without the need for a gearbox, clutch or crank. But front-load washers suffer from their own technical problems, due to the drum lying sideways. For example, a top loading washer keeps water inside the tub merely through the force of [[gravity]] pulling down on the water, while a front-loader must tightly seal the door shut with a [[gasket]] to prevent water dripping onto the floor during the wash cycle. This access door is locked shut during the entire wash cycle, since opening the door with the machine in use could result in water gushing out onto the floor. For front-loaders without viewing windows on the door, it is possible to accidentally pinch fabric between the door and the drum, resulting in tearing and damage to the pinched clothing during tumbling and spinning.\n\nNearly all front-loader washers for the consumer market also use a folded flexible [[bellows]] assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, plugging the drain and possibly jamming rotation of the inner basket. Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and inner basket can require complete disassembly of the front of the washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.\n\nThe bellows assembly around the door is a potential source of problems for the consumer front-loader. The bellows has a large number of flexible folds to permit the tub to move separately from the door during the high speed extraction cycle. On many machines, these folds can collect lint, dirt, and moisture, resulting in [[mold]] and [[mildew]] growth, and a foul odor. Some front-loading washer operating instructions say the bellows should be wiped down monthly with a strong bleach solution, while others offer a special \"freshening\" cycle where the machine is run empty with a strong dosing of bleach.\n\nThe inherent mechanical weak spot of the front loader design is the [[cantilever]]ed mounting of the inner drum within the outer tub.  The drum bearing has to support the entire weight of the drum, the laundry, and the dynamic loads created by the sloshing of the water and of the imbalance of the load during the spin cycle.  The drum bearing eventually wears out, and usually requires extensive dismantling of the machine to replace, which often results in the machine being [[Write-off|written off]] due to the failure of a relatively inexpensive component that is labor-intensive to renew.  Some manufacturers have compounded this problem by \"overmolding\" the drum bearing into the outer tub to reduce manufacturing costs, but this makes the bearing impossible to renew without replacing the entire outer tub - which usually forces owners to scrap the entire machine - this may be viewed as an implementation of [[Planned obsolescence|built-in obsolescence]].\n\nCompared to top-loading washers, clothing can be packed more tightly in a front loader, up to the full drum volume if using a cottons wash cycle. This is because wet cloth usually fits into a smaller space than dry cloth, and front loaders are able to self-regulate the water needed to achieve correct washing and rinsing. Extreme overloading of front-loading washers pushes fabrics towards the small gap between the loading door and the front of the wash basket, potentially resulting in fabrics lost between the basket and outer tub, and in severe cases, tearing of clothing and jamming the motion of the basket.\n\n===Variant and hybrid designs===\n[[File:European top washingmachine.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2008)]]\n<!-- [[File:tvatt.jpg|thumb|European top loader with horizontal axis rotating drum (2001)]] -->\n\nThere are many variations of the two general designs. Top-loading machines in [[Asia]] use [[impeller]]s instead of agitators. Impellers are similar to agitators except that they do not have the center post extending up in the middle of the wash tub basket.\n\nSome machines which actually load from the top are otherwise much more similar to front-loading horizontal-axis drum machines. They have a drum rotating around a horizontal axis, as a front-loader, but there is no front door; instead there is a liftable lid which provides access to the drum, which has a hatch which can be latched shut. Clothes are loaded, the hatch and lid are closed, and the machine operates and spins just like a front-loader. These machines are narrower but usually taller than front-loaders, usually have a lower capacity, and are intended for use where only a narrow space is available, as is sometimes the case in Europe. They have incidental advantages: they can be loaded without bending down; they do not require a perishable rubber bellows seal; and instead of the drum having a single bearing on one side, it has a pair of symmetrical bearings, one on each side, avoiding asymmetrical bearing loading and potentially increasing life. This type of washing machine is popular in Europe, where space is limited, as a washer can be as little as 40&nbsp;cm wide, and a full washer and dryer installation can be as little as 80&nbsp;cm wide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.candy.fi/en_GB/appliances/wash-dry/top-loading-washing-machines/-/catalog/16314605/clt-272l-s|title=Candy Top loading washing machines. Comfort and efficiency - Candy|website=www.candy.fi|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-02-19}}</ref>\n\nThere are also [[combo washer dryer]] machines that combine washing cycles and a full drying cycle in the same drum, eliminating the need to transfer wet clothes from a washer to a dryer machine.  In principle, these machines are convenient for overnight cleaning (the combined cycle is considerably longer), but the effective capacity for cleaning larger batches of laundry is drastically reduced. The drying process tends to use much more energy than using two separate devices, because a combo washer dryer not only must dry the clothing, but also needs to dry out the wash chamber itself. These machines are used more in Europe, because they can be fitted into small spaces, and many can be operated without dedicated utility connections. In these machines, the washer and dryer functions often have different capacities, with the dryer usually having the lowest capacity. These machines should not be confused with a dryer on top of a washer installation, or with a laundry center, which is a one piece appliance offering a compromise between a washer-dryer combo and a full washer to the side of the dryer installation or a dryer on top of a washer installation. Laundry centers usually have the dryer on top of the washer, with the controls for both machines being on a single control panel. Often, the controls are simpler than the controls on a washer-dryer combo or a dedicated washer and dryer. Some implementations are patented under [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6343492B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US6343492B1] and [https://patents.google.com/patent/US6363756B1/en?q=D06F37%2f04 US Patent US 6363756B1].\n\n===Comparison===\nTrue front-loaders, and top-loading machines with horizontal-axis drum as described above, can be compared with top-loaders on a number of aspects:\n\n* Efficient cleaning: Front-loaders usually use less energy, water, and detergent compared to the best top-loaders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lanfaxlabs.com.au/washing_machines.htm | title=Laundry Products Research | date=March 2008}}</ref> High efficiency washers use 20% to 60% of the detergent, water and energy of standard\"{{explain|date=February 2020}} washers.  They usually take somewhat longer (20\u2013110 minutes) to wash a load, but are often computer controlled with additional sensors, to adapt the wash cycle to the needs of each load.  As this technology improves, the [[human interface]] will also improve, to make it easier to understand and control the many different cleaning options.\n* Water usage: Front-loaders usually use less water than top-loading residential clothes washers. Estimates are that front-loaders use from one third<ref>{{cite web|url=http://housewares.about.com/lw/Home-Garden/Home-improvement-renovation/Top-Loading-vs-Front-Loading-Washers-Which-is-Better-.htm | title=About.com}}</ref> to one half<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.consumerenergycenter.org/home/appliances/washers.html | title=Consumer Energy Center}}</ref> as much water as top-loaders.\n* Spin-dry effectiveness: Front-loaders (and European horizontal axis top loaders and some front loaders) offer much higher maximum spin speeds of up to 2000&nbsp;[[revolutions per minute|RPM]], although home machines tend to be in the 1000 to 1400&nbsp;RPM range, while top-loaders (with agitators) do not exceed 1140&nbsp;RPM.  High-efficiency top-loaders with a wash plate (instead of an agitator) can spin up to 1100 RPM, as their center of gravity is lower.  Higher spin speeds, along with the diameter of the drum, determine the [[g-force]], and a higher g-force removes more residual water, making clothes dry faster. This also reduces energy consumption if clothes are dried in a [[clothes dryer]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n* Cycle length: Top-loaders have tended to have shorter cycle times, in part because their design has traditionally emphasized simplicity and speed of operation more than resource conservation.\n* Wear and abrasion: Top-loaders require an agitator or impeller mechanism to force enough water through clothes to clean them effectively, which greatly increases mechanical wear and tear on fabrics.  Front-loaders use paddles in the drum to repeatedly pick up and drop clothes into water for cleaning; this gentler action causes less wear.  The amount of clothes wear can be roughly gauged by the amount of accumulation in a clothes dryer [[lint (material)|lint]] filter, since the lint largely consists of stray fibers detached from textiles during washing and drying.\n* Difficult items: Top-loaders may have trouble cleaning large items, such as [[sleeping bag]]s or [[pillow]]s, which tend to float on top of the wash water rather than circulate within it. In addition, vigorous top-loader agitator motions may damage delicate fabrics.\n* Noise: Front-loaders tend to operate more quietly than top-loaders because the door seal helps contain noise, and because there is less of a tendency to imbalance. Top-loaders usually need a [[mechanical transmission]] (due to agitators, see above), which can generate more noise than the rubber belt or direct drive found in most front loaders.\n* Compactness: True front-loading machines may be installed underneath counter-height work surfaces. A front-loading washing machine, in a fully fitted kitchen, may even be disguised as a [[kitchen cabinet]].  These models can also be convenient in homes with limited floor area, since the clothes dryer may be installed directly above the washer (\"stacked\" configuration).\n* Water leakage: Top-loading machines are less prone to leakage, because simple [[gravity]] can reliably keep water from spilling out the loading door on top.  True front-loading machines require a flexible seal or gasket on the front door, and the front door must be locked during operation to prevent opening, lest large amounts of water spill out.  This seal may leak and require replacement.  However, many current front-loaders use so little water that they can be stopped mid-cycle for addition or removal of laundry, while keeping the water level in the horizontal tub below the door level.  Best practice installations of either type of machine will include a [[floor drain]] or an overflow catch tray with a drain connection, since neither design is immune to leakage or a [[solenoid valve]] getting stuck in the open position.\n* Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers are more tolerant of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular \"freshening\" cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip around the top of the inner basket and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.\n* Accessibility and ergonomics: Front-loaders are more convenient for [[Dwarfism|very short people]] and those with [[paraplegia]], as the controls are front-mounted and the horizontal drum eliminates the need for standing or climbing. Risers, also referred to as pedestals, often with storage drawers underneath, can be used to raise the door of a true front-loader closer to the user's level.\n* Initial cost: In countries where top-loaders are popular, front-loaders tend to be more expensive to buy than top-loaders, though their lower operating costs can ultimately lead to lower [[total cost of ownership]], especially if energy, detergent, or water are expensive. On the other hand, in countries with a large front-loader user base, top-loaders are usually seen as alternatives and more expensive than basic off-brand front loaders, although without many differences in [[total cost of ownership]] apart from design-originated ones. In addition, manufacturers have tended to include more advanced features such as internal water heating, automatic dirt sensors, and high-speed emptying on front-loaders, although some of these features could be implemented on top-loaders.\n\n==Wash cycles==\n[[File:Waescheschleuder.jpg|thumb|upright|German laundry [[centrifuge]] to extract water from laundry.  The advent of automatic washing machines with spin cycles made such specialized appliances largely obsolete by the 1970s.]]\n\nThe earliest washing machines simply carried out a washing action when loaded with clothes and soap, filled with hot water, and started. Over time machines became more and more automated, first with very complex electromechanical controllers, then fully electronic controllers; users put clothes into the machine, select a suitable program via a switch, start the machine, and come back to remove clean and slightly damp clothes at the end of the cycle. The controller starts and stops many different processes including pumps and valves to fill and empty the drum with water, heating, and rotating at different speeds, with different combinations of settings for different fabrics.\n\n===Washing===\nMany front loading machines have internal electrical heating elements to heat the wash water, to near boiling if desired. The rate of chemical cleaning action of the detergent and other laundry chemicals increases greatly with temperature, in accordance with the [[Arrhenius equation]]. Washing machines with internal heaters can use special detergents formulated to release different chemical ingredients at different temperatures, allowing different type of stains and soils to be cleaned from the clothes as the wash water is heated up by the electrical heater.\n\nHowever, higher-temperature washing uses more energy, and many fabrics and elastics are damaged at higher temperatures. Temperatures exceeding {{convert|40|\u00b0C}} have the undesirable effect of inactivating the [[enzyme]]s when using [[biological detergent]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nMany machines are cold-fill, connected to cold water only, which they heat to [[operating temperature]]. Where water can be heated more cheaply or with less carbon dioxide emission than by electricity, cold-fill operation is inefficient.\n\nFront loaders need to use low-sudsing detergents because the tumbling action of the drum folds air into the clothes load that can cause over-sudsing and overflows.  However, due to efficient use of water and detergent, the sudsing issue with front-loaders can be controlled by simply using less detergent, without lessening cleaning action.\n\n===Rinsing===\nWashing machines perform several rinses after the main wash to remove most of the [[detergent]]. Modern washing machines use less [[water]] due to [[environmental concern]]s; however, this has led to the problem of poor rinsing on many washing machines on the [[Market (economics)|market]],<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.whitegoodshelp.co.uk/wordpress/why-cant-modern-washing-machines-rinse-properly/ |title=Why can't modern washing machines rinse properly? |publisher=Whitegoodshelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> which can be a problem to people who are [[Allergy|sensitive]] to [[detergent]]s. The [[Allergy UK]] website suggests re-running the rinse cycle, or rerunning the entire wash cycle without [[detergent]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |title=Allergy Tips and Advice for Household Cleaning |publisher=Allergyuk.org |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613062143/http://allergyuk.org/fs_handyhints.aspx |archive-date=2010-06-13 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn response to complaints, many washing machines allow the user to select additional rinse cycles, at the [[expense]] of higher [[water usage]] and longer cycle time.\n\n===Spinning===\nHigher spin speeds, along with larger tub diameters, remove more water, leading to faster drying. On the other hand, avoid [[ironing]] can be obtained not using spin cycle in the washing machine.\n\nIf a heated [[clothes dryer|clothes-dryer]] is used after the wash and spin, energy use is reduced if more water has been removed from clothes. However, faster spinning can crease clothes more. Also, mechanical wear on bearings increases rapidly with rotational speed, reducing life. Early machines would spin at only 300 rpm and, because of lack of any mechanical suspension, would often shake and vibrate.\n\nIn 1976, most front loading washing machines spun at around 700 rpm, or less.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}\n\nSeparate spin-driers, without washing functionality, are available for specialized applications.  For example, a small high-speed [[centrifuge]] machine may be provided in [[locker room]]s of communal [[swimming pool]]s to allow wet [[swimsuit]]s to be substantially dried to a slightly damp condition after daily use.\n\n===Maintenance wash===\nMany home washing machines use a plastic, rather than metal, outer shell to contain the wash water; residue can build up on the plastic tub over time. Some manufacturers advise users to perform a regular maintenance or \"freshening\" wash to clean the inside of the washing machine of any [[mold]], [[bacteria]], encrusted detergent, and unspecified dirt more effectively than with a normal wash.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nA maintenance wash is performed without any laundry, on the hottest wash program if there is a heater,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washerhelp.co.uk/usage_2.html |title=Washing machine usage (part 2) |publisher=Washerhelp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-02-16}}</ref> adding substances such as [[white vinegar]], 100 grams of [[citric acid]], a detergent with bleaching properties, or a proprietary washing machine cleaner.

All else being equal, a machine of higher capacity will cost more to buy, but will be more convenient if large amounts of laundry must be cleaned. Fewer runs of a machine of larger capacity may have lower running costs and better energy and [[water efficiency]] than frequent use of a smaller machine, particularly for large families. Running a large machine with small loads is wasteful.\n\nFor many years energy and water efficiency were not regulated, and little attention was paid to them. From the last part of the twentieth century increasing attention was paid to efficiency, with regulations enforcing some standards, and efficiency being a selling point, both to save on running costs and to reduce [[carbon dioxide]] emissions associated with energy generation, and waste of water.\n\nAs energy and water efficiency became regulated, they became a selling point, however, the effectiveness of rinsing was not regulated, and it didn't directly become a selling point. Therefore, manufacturers tended to reduce the degree of rinsing after washing, saving water and motor energy. This had the side-effect of leaving more detergent residue in clothes. Insufficient rinsing can leave enough detergent in clothes to affect people with allergies or sensitivity.<ref name=\"whitegoodshelp1\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Energy label en.svg|thumb|upright|The EU requires washing machines carry an efficiency label]]\nWashing machines display an [[EU Energy Label]] with grades for energy efficiency, washing performance and spin efficiency. Grades for energy efficiency run from A+++ to G (best to worst), providing a simple method for judging running costs. Washing performance and spin efficiency are graded in the range A to G. However, all machines for sale must have washing performance A, such that manufacturers cannot compromise washing performance in order to improve the energy efficiency. This labeling has had the desired effect of driving customers toward more efficient washing machines and away from less efficient ones.\n\nThe TopTenEU and other national TopTen European organizations provide independent recommendations for high efficient washing machines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html&fromid= |title=Selection criteria washing machines |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425102236/http://www.topten.eu/english/criteria/washing-machines-2.html%26fromid%3D |archive-date=April 25, 2016 |publisher=TopTenEU}}</ref>\n\nAccording to newer [[regulation]]s, each washing machine is equipped with a waste water filter. There are two reasons for that. On one hand it has to be ensured that no hazardous [[chemical substance]]s are disposed of improperly through the waste water channel; on the other hand it must also be ensured that in case of a backwards shear in the waste water channel that is possible in case of technical problems, the [[feces]] and other [[waste]] could not enter the washing machine.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite book|isbn = 978-3-906484-57-0|url = http://www.eawag.ch/forschung/sandec/publikationen/compendium_e/index_EN|title = Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies |edition=2nd |author= Tilley, E. |author2=Ulrich, L. |author3=L\u00fcthi, C. |author4=Reymond, Ph. |author5=Zurbr\u00fcgg, C.|publisher = Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) |location=Duebendorf, Switzerland|page = 147|year = 2014}}</ref>\n\n===United States===\nTop-loading and front-loading clothes washers are covered by a single Federal Standard regulating energy consumption.

Energy Star washers have also a WF of less than 6.0 (the lower the better).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=clotheswash.pr_crit_clothes_washers |title=Clothes Washers Key Product Criteria |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109211645/http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=clotheswash.pr_crit_clothes_washers |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |publisher=Energy Star}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial use==\n{{unreferenced section|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Laundry in Paris.jpg|thumb|Commercial washing machines and dryers (at left) in a self-service laundry (Paris, France)]]\n[[File:Laundromat ontario.jpg|thumb|Commercial washing machines in a self-service laundromat (Toronto, Canada)]]\nA commercial washing machine is intended for more frequent use than a consumer washing machine.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katayama|first=Michiko|last2=Sugihara|first2=Reiko|date=2011-02-14|title=Which type of washing machine should you choose?|journal=International Journal of Consumer Studies|volume=35|issue=2|pages=237\u2013242|doi=10.1111/j.1470-6431.2010.00977.x|issn=1470-6423}}</ref> Durability and functionality is more important than style; most commercial washers are bulky and heavy, often with more expensive stainless steel construction to minimize corrosion in a constantly moist environment. They are built with large easy-to-open service covers, and washers are designed not to require access to the underside for service. Often commercial washers are installed in long rows with a wide access passageway behind all the machines to allow maintenance without moving the heavy machines.\n\n===Laundromat machines===\nMany commercial washers are built for use by the general public, and are installed in publicly accessible [[laundromat]]s or laundrettes, operated by [[currency acceptor|money accepting devices]] or [[Magnetic stripe card|card readers]]. The features of a commercial laundromat washer are more limited than a consumer washer, usually offering just two or three basic wash programs and an option to choose wash cycle temperatures.\n\nThe common front-loading commercial washing machine also differs from consumer models in its expulsion of wash and rinse water. While the consumer models [[pump]] used washer water out, allowing the waste line to be located above the washer, front loading commercial machines generally use only [[gravity]] to expel used water. A drain in the rear, at the bottom of the machine opens at the appointed time during the cycle and water flows out. This creates the need for a drainage trough behind machines, which leads to a filter and drain. The trough is usually part of a cement platform built for the purpose of raising the machines to a convenient height,  and can be seen behind washers at most laundromats.\n\nMost laundromat machines are horizontal-axis front-loading models, because of their lower operating costs (notably lower consumption of expensive hot water).\n\n===Industrial washers===\n<!-- [[File:Lapauw Combi 2000.jpg|thumb|A 1980s Belgian {{convert|180|kg|0|abbr=on}} load industrial washer in a Hotel in Brussels (horizontal axis, front load)]] -->\n[[File:Lapauw Combi 1000.jpg|thumb|upright|A 1980s Belgian {{nowrap|90 kg}} load industrial washer (horizontal axis, front load)]]\nBy contrast, commercial washers for ''internal'' business operations (still often referred to as \"washer/extractor\" machines) may include features absent from domestic machines. Many commercial washers offer an option for automatic injection of five or more different chemical types, so that the operator does not have to deal with constantly measuring out soap products and fabric softeners for each load by hand. Instead, a precise metering system draws the detergents and wash additives directly from large liquid-chemical storage barrels and injects them as needed into the various wash and rinse cycles. Some computer-controlled commercial washers offer the operator  control over the various wash and rinse cycles, allowing the operator to program custom washing cycles.\n\nMost large-scale industrial washers are horizontal-axis machines, but may have front-, side-, or top-load doors. Some industrial clothes washers can batch-process up to {{convert|800|lb}} of textiles at once, and can be used for extremely machine-abusive washing tasks such as [[stone washing]] or fabric [[bleaching]] and [[dyeing]].\n\nAn industrial washer can be mounted on heavy-duty [[shock absorbers]] and attached to a concrete floor, so that it can extract water from even the most severely out-of-balance and heavy wash loads. Noise and vibration is not as unacceptable as in a domestic machine. It may be mounted on [[hydraulic cylinders]], permitting the entire washer to be lifted and tilted so that fabrics can be automatically dumped from the wash drum onto a [[conveyor belt]] once the cycle is complete. \n \nOne special type of continuous-processing washer is known as the [[tunnel washer]].  This specialized high-capacity machine does not have a drum where everything being washed undergoes distinct wash and rinse cycles, but moves the laundry slowly and continuously through a long, large-diameter horizontal-axis rotating tube in the manner of an [[assembly line]], with different processes at different positions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.isopasse.com.br/dicas/lavadora-de-roupas-melhor-marca/|title=Lavadora de Roupas - Qual a melhor marca?|last=Guilherme|date=2017-08-17|website=Isopasse|language=pt-BR|access-date=2018-12-16}}</ref>\n\n==Social impact==\n[[File:Woman's Friend - Indiana State Museum - DSC00433.JPG|thumb|\"Woman's Friend\" machine (c. 1890)]]\nThe historically laborious process of washing clothes ([[wikt:laundry day|a task which often had a whole day set aside to perform]]) has at times been labelled 'woman's work'.

(Such <math>P,D</math> are not unique.) For a finite-[[Dimension (linear algebra)|dimensional]] [[vector space]] <math>V</math>, a [[linear map]] <math>T:V\\to V</math>\u00a0is called '''diagonalizable''' if there exists an [[Basis (linear algebra)#Ordered%20bases%20and%20coordinates|ordered basis]] of <math>V</math>\u00a0consisting of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of <math>T</math>. These definitions are equivalent: if <math>T</math>\u00a0has a matrix representation <math>A = PDP^{-1}</math> as above, then the column vectors of <math>P</math>\u00a0form a basis of eigenvectors of <math>T</math>, and the diagonal entries of <math>D</math>\u00a0are the corresponding eigenvalues of <math>T</math>; with respect to this eigenvector basis, <math>P</math>\u00a0is represented by <math>D</math>. '''Diagonalization''' is the process of finding the above <math>P</math>\u00a0and <math>D</math>.\n\nDiagonalizable matrices and maps are especially easy for computations, once their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known. One can raise a diagonal matrix <math>D</math>\u00a0to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that power, and the [[determinant]] of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries; such computations generalize easily to <math>A=PDP^{-1}</math>. Geometrically, a diagonalizable matrix is an '''[[inhomogeneous dilation]]''' (or ''anisotropic scaling'') \u2014 it [[Scaling (geometry)|scales]] the space, as does a ''[[homogeneous dilation]]'', but by a different factor along each eigenvector axis, the factor given by the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\nA square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called ''[[Defective matrix|defective]]''. It can happen that a matrix <math>A</math> with real entries is defective over the real numbers, meaning that <math>A = PDP^{-1}</math> is impossible for any invertible <math>P</math> and diagonal <math>D</math> with real entries, but it is possible with complex entries, so that <math>A</math> is diagonalizable over the complex numbers. For example, this is the case for a generic [[rotation matrix]].  \n\nMany results for diagonalizable matrices hold only over an algebraically closed field (such as the complex numbers). In this case, diagonalizable matrices are [[Dense set|dense]] in the space of all matrices, which means any defective matrix can be deformed into a diagonalizable matrix by a small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]; and the [[Jordan normal form]] theorem states that any matrix is uniquely the sum of a diagonalizable matrix and a [[nilpotent matrix]]. Over an algebraically closed field, diagonalizable matrices are equivalent to [[Semi-simplicity#Semi-simple%20matrices|semi-simple matrices]]. \n\n== Definition ==\nA square <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>A</math> over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> is called '''diagonalizable''' or '''nondefective''' if there exists an invertible matrix <math>P</math> such that <math>P^{-1}AP</math> is a diagonal matrix. Formally,\n\n{{Equation box 1\n|indent =:\n|equation = <math>A \\in F^{n \\times n} \\text{ diagonalizable} \\iff \\exists \\, P,P^{-1} \\in F^{n \\times n} : \\; P^{-1}\\!AP \\text{ diagonal}</math>\n|cellpadding= 6\n|border\n|border colour = #0073CF\n|background colour = #F5FFFA\n|title=}}\n\n== Characterization ==\nThe fundamental fact about diagonalizable maps and matrices is expressed by the following:\n\n* An <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>A</math> over a field <math>F</math> is diagonalizable [[if and only if]] the sum of the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]s of its eigenspaces is equal to <math>n</math>, which is the case if and only if there exists a [[basis (linear algebra)|basis]] of <math>F^n</math> consisting of eigenvectors of <math>A</math>. If such a basis has been found, one can form the matrix <math>P</math> having these [[basis vectors]] as columns, and <math>P^{-1}\\!AP</math> will be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <math>A</math>. The matrix <math>P</math> is known as a [[modal matrix]] for <math>A</math>.\n* A linear map <math>T : V \\mapsto V</math> is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]s of its eigenspaces is equal to <math>\\operatorname{dim}(V)</math>, which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of <math>V</math> consisting of eigenvectors of <math>T</math>. With respect to such a basis, <math>T</math> will be represented by a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of this matrix are the eigenvalues of <math>T</math>.\n\nAnother characterization: A matrix or linear map is diagonalizable over the field <math>F</math> if and only if its [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] is a product of distinct linear factors over <math>F</math>. (Put another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if all of its [[elementary divisor]]s are linear.)\n\nThe following sufficient (but not necessary) condition is often useful.\n{{bulleted list\n| An <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>A</math> is diagonalizable over the field <math>F</math> if it has <math>n</math> distinct eigenvalues in <math>F</math>, i.e. if its [[characteristic polynomial]] has <math>n</math> distinct roots in <math>F</math>; however, the converse may be false. Consider\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 5 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhich has eigenvalues 1, 2, 2 (not all distinct) and is diagonalizable with diagonal form ([[similar (linear algebra)|similar]] to <math>A</math>)\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nand [[change of basis|change of basis matrix]] <math>P</math>\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe converse fails when <math>A</math> has an eigenspace of dimension higher than 1. In this example, the eigenspace of <math>A</math> associated with the eigenvalue 2 has dimension 2.\n| A linear map <math>T : V \\mapsto V</math> with <math>n = \\operatorname{dim}(V)</math> is diagonalizable if it has <math>n</math> distinct eigenvalues, i.e. if its characteristic polynomial has <math>n</math> distinct roots in <math>F</math>.\n}}\n\nLet <math>A</math> be a matrix over <math>F</math>. If <math>A</math> is diagonalizable, then so is any power of it. Conversely, if <math>A</math> is invertible, <math>F</math> is algebraically closed, and <math>A^n</math> is diagonalizable for some <math>n</math> that is not an integer multiple of the characteristic of <math>F</math>, then <math>A</math> is diagonalizable. Proof: If <math>A^n</math> is diagonalizable, then <math>A</math> is annihilated by some polynomial <math>\\left(x^n - \\lambda_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(x^n - \\lambda_k\\right)</math>, which has no multiple root (since <math>\\lambda_j \\ne 0</math>) and is divided by the minimal polynomial of <math>A</math>.\n\nOver the complex numbers <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, almost every matrix is diagonalizable. More precisely: the set of complex <math>n \\times n</math> matrices that are ''not'' diagonalizable over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, considered as a [[subset]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}</math>, has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. One can also say that the diagonalizable matrices form a dense subset with respect to the [[Zariski topology]]: the non-diagonalizable matrices lie inside the [[Algebraic variety|vanishing set]] of the [[discriminant]] of the characteristic polynomial, which is a [[hypersurface]]. From that follows also density in the usual (''strong'') topology given by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. The same is not true over <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe [[Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition]] expresses an operator as the sum of its semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable) part and its [[nilpotent]] part. Hence, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its nilpotent part is zero. Put in another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if each block in its [[Jordan form]] has no nilpotent part; i.e., each \"block\" is a one-by-one matrix.\n\n== Diagonalization ==\n[[File:Diagonalization as rotation.gif|400px|thumb|right|The diagonalization of a matrix can be interpreted as a rotation of the axes to align them with the eigenvectors.]]\nIf a matrix <math>A</math> can be diagonalized, that is,\n\n: <math>P^{-1}AP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\lambda_1 &         0 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n          0 & \\lambda_2 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n     \\vdots &    \\vdots & \\ddots &    \\vdots \\\\\n          0 &         0 &  \\dots & \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nthen:\n\n: <math>AP = P\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\lambda_1 &         0 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n          0 & \\lambda_2 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n     \\vdots &    \\vdots & \\ddots &    \\vdots \\\\\n          0 &         0 &  \\dots & \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nWriting <math>P</math> as a [[block matrix]] of its column vectors <math>\\vec{\\alpha}_{i}</math>\n\n:<math>P = \\begin{pmatrix}\\vec{\\alpha}_1 & \\vec{\\alpha}_2 & \\cdots & \\vec{\\alpha}_n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nthe above equation can be rewritten as\n\n:<math>A\\vec{\\alpha}_i = \\lambda_i\\vec{\\alpha}_i\\qquad(i=1,2,\\cdots,n).</math>\n\nSo the column vectors of <math>P</math> are [[right eigenvector]]s of <math>A</math>, and the corresponding diagonal entry is the corresponding [[eigenvalue]]. The invertibility of <math>P</math> also suggests that the eigenvectors are [[linearly independent]] and form a basis of <math>F^{n}</math>. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for diagonalizability and the canonical approach of diagonalization. The [[row vector]]s of <math>P^{-1}</math> are the [[left eigenvector]]s of <math>A</math>.\n\nWhen a complex matrix <math>A\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}</math> is a [[Hermitian matrix]] (or more generally a [[normal matrix]]), eigenvectors of <math>A</math> can be chosen to form an [[orthonormal basis]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, and <math>P</math> can be chosen to be a [[unitary matrix]]. If in addition, <math>A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}</math> is a real [[symmetric matrix]], then its eigenvectors can be chosen to be an orthonormal basis of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> and <math>P</math> can be chosen to be an [[orthogonal matrix]].\n\nFor most practical work matrices are diagonalized numerically using computer software. [[eigenvalue algorithm|Many algorithms]] exist to accomplish this.\n\n== Simultaneous diagonalization ==\n{{See also|Triangular matrix#Simultaneous triangularisability|l1=Simultaneous triangularisability|Weight (representation theory)|Positive definite matrix#Simultaneous_diagonalization|l3=Positive definite matrix}}\n\nA set of matrices is said to be ''simultaneously diagonalizable'' if there exists a single invertible matrix <math>P</math> such that <math>P^{-1}AP</math> is a diagonal matrix for every <math>A</math> in the set. The following theorem characterises simultaneously diagonalizable matrices: A set of diagonalizable [[Commuting matrices|matrices commutes]] if and only if the set is simultaneously diagonalizable.<ref name=\"HornJohnson\">{{cite book|title=Matrix Analysis, second edition|last1=Horn|first1=Roger A.|last2=Johnson|first2=Charles R.|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2013|isbn=9780521839402}}</ref>{{rp|pp. 51-53}}\n\nThe set of all <math>n \\times n</math> diagonalizable matrices (over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>) with <math>n > 1</math> is not simultaneously diagonalizable. For instance, the matrices\n\n:<math> \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad\\text{and}\\quad \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} </math>\n\nare diagonalizable but not simultaneously diagonalizable because they do not commute.\n\nA set consists of commuting [[normal matrix|normal matrices]] if and only if it is simultaneously diagonalizable by a [[unitary matrix]]; that is, there exists a unitary matrix <math>U</math> such that <math>U^{*}\\!AU</math> is diagonal for every <math>A</math> in the set.\n\nIn the language of [[Lie theory]], a set of simultaneously diagonalizable matrices generate a [[toral Lie algebra]].\n\n== Examples ==\n\n=== Diagonalizable matrices ===\n* [[Involution (mathematics)|Involution]]s are diagonalizable over the reals (and indeed any field of characteristic not 2), with \u00b11 on the diagonal.\n* Finite order [[endomorphism]]s are diagonalisable over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math> (or any algebraically closed field where the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of the endomorphism) with [[roots of unity]] on the diagonal. This follows since the minimal polynomial is [[separable polynomial|separable]], because the roots of unity are distinct.\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|Projections]] are diagonalizable, with 0s and 1s on the diagonal.\n* Real [[symmetric matrices]] are diagonalizable by [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]]; i.e., given a real symmetric matrix <math>A</math>, <math>Q^{\\mathrm T}AQ</math> is diagonal for some orthogonal matrix <math>Q</math>. More generally, matrices are diagonalizable by [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] if and only if they are [[normal matrix|normal]]. In the case of the real symmetric matrix, we see that <math>A=A^{\\mathrm T}</math>, so clearly <math>AA^{\\mathrm T} = A^{\\mathrm T}A</math> holds. Examples of normal matrices are real symmetric (or [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]) matrices (e.g. covariance matrices) and [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] (or skew-Hermitian matrices). See [[spectral theorem]]s for generalizations to infinite-dimensional vector spaces.\n\n=== Matrices that are not diagonalizable ===\nIn general, a [[rotation matrix]] is not diagonalizable over the reals, but all [[rotation matrix#Independent planes|rotation matrices]] are diagonalizable over the complex field. Even if a matrix is not diagonalizable, it is always possible to \"do the best one can\", and find a matrix with the same properties consisting of eigenvalues on the leading diagonal, and either ones or zeroes on the superdiagonal \u2013 known as [[Jordan Normal Form|Jordan normal form]].\n\nSome matrices are not diagonalizable over any field, most notably nonzero [[nilpotent matrix|nilpotent matrices]]. This happens more generally if the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors#Algebraic multiplicity|algebraic and geometric multiplicities]] of an eigenvalue do not coincide. For instance, consider\n\n:<math> C = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nThis matrix is not diagonalizable: there is no matrix <math>U</math> such that <math>U^{-1}CU</math> is a diagonal matrix. Indeed, <math>C</math> has one eigenvalue (namely zero) and this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.\n\nSome real matrices are not diagonalizable over the reals. Consider for instance the matrix\n\n:<math> B = \\left[\\begin{array}{rr} 0 & 1 \\\\ \\!-1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]. </math>\n\nThe matrix <math>B</math> does not have any real eigenvalues, so there is no '''real''' matrix <math>Q</math> such that <math>Q^{-1}BQ</math> is a diagonal matrix. However, we can diagonalize <math>B</math> if we allow complex numbers. Indeed, if we take\n\n:<math> Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\textrm{i} \\\\ \\textrm{i} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nthen <math>Q^{-1}BQ</math> is diagonal. It is easy to find that B is the rotation matrix which rotates counterclockwise by angle <math>\\theta=\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2}</math>\n\nNote that the above examples show that the sum of diagonalizable matrices need not be diagonalizable.\n\n=== How to diagonalize a matrix ===\nDiagonalizing a matrix is the same process as finding its [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]], in the case that the eigenvectors form a basis. For example, consider the matrix\n\n:<math>A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!-2\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & \\!\\!\\!-1 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right].</math>\n\nThe roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]] <math>p(\\lambda)=\\det(\\lambda I-A)</math> are the eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_1 = 1,\\lambda_2 = 1,\\lambda_3 = 2</math>. Solving the linear system <math>(I-A)(\\mathbf{v})=0</math> gives the eigenvectors <math>\\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,1,0)</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,2,1)</math>, while <math>(2I-A)(\\mathbf{v})=0</math> gives <math>\\mathbf{v}_3=(1,0,-1)</math>; that is, <math>A(\\mathbf{v}_i)=\\lambda_i\\mathbf{v}_i</math> for <math>i = 1,2,3</math>. These vectors form a basis of <math>V=\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, so we can assemble them as the column vectors of a [[Change of basis|change-of-basis]] matrix <math>P</math> to get:<blockquote><math>P^{-1}\\!AP \\ = \\ \n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!-2\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & \\!\\!\\!-1 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\ =\\ \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&2\\end{bmatrix} \\ =\\ D .</math></blockquote>We may see this equation in terms of transformations: <math>P</math> takes the standard basis to the eigenbasis, <math>P(\\mathbf{e}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_i</math>, so we have:<blockquote><math>P^{-1}\\!AP(\\mathbf{e}_i) \\ =\\ \nP^{-1}\\!A(\\mathbf{v}_i) \\ =\\ \nP^{-1}\\!(\\lambda_i\\mathbf{v}_i) \\ = \\ \n\\lambda_i\\mathbf{e}_i,</math></blockquote>so that <math>P^{-1}\\!AP</math> has the standard basis as its eigenvectors, which is the defining property of <math>D</math>. \n\nNote that there is no preferred order of the eigenvectors in <math>P</math>; changing the order of the [[eigenvectors]] in <math>P</math> just changes the order of the [[eigenvalues]] in the diagonalized form of <math>A</math>.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Anton |first1=H. |last2= Rorres|first2= C. |title=Elementary Linear Algebra (Applications Version) | url=https://archive.org/details/studentsolutions00grob | url-access=registration |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|edition=8th|date=22 Feb 2000| ISBN= 978-0-471-17052-5}}</ref>\n\n== Application to matrix functions ==\nDiagonalization can be used to efficiently compute the powers of a matrix <math>A=PDP^{-1}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \n  A^k &= \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right)^k = \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\cdots \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\\\\n      &= PD\\left(P^{-1}P\\right) D \\left(P^{-1}P\\right) \\cdots \\left(P^{-1}P\\right) D P^{-1} = PD^kP^{-1},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand the latter is easy to calculate since it only involves the powers of a diagonal matrix. For example, for the matrix <math>A</math> with eigenvalues <math>\\lambda = 1,1,2</math> in the example above we compute:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA^k = PD^kP^{-1} &=&\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1^k&0&0\\\\ 0&1^k&0\\\\ 0&0&2^k\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1} \n\\\\[1em]\n&=&\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 - 2^k & -1 + 2^k & 2 - 2^{k + 1} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 + 2^k & 1 - 2^k & -1 + 2^{k + 1}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{array}\n\n </math> </blockquote>This approach can be generalized to [[matrix exponential]] and other [[matrix function]]s that can be defined as power series. For example, defining  <math>\\exp(A) = I + A + \\tfrac{1}{2!}A^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3!}A^3 + \\cdots</math> , we have:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\exp(A) = P\\,\\exp(D)\\,P^{-1} &=&\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} e^1&0&0\\\\ 0&e^1&0\\\\ 0&0&e^2\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1} \n\\\\[1em]\n&=&\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 e - e^2 & -e + e^2 & 2 e - 2 e^2\\\\\n0 & e & 0\\\\\n-e + e^2 & e - e^2 & -e + 2 e^2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{array}\n\n </math></blockquote>This is particularly useful in finding closed form expressions for terms of [[linear recursive sequences]], such as the [[Fibonacci_number#Matrix_form|Fibonacci numbers]].\n\n=== Particular application ===\nFor example, consider the following matrix:\n\n:<math>M = \\begin{bmatrix}a & b - a\\\\ 0 & b\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nCalculating the various powers of <math>M</math> reveals a  surprising pattern:\n\n:<math>\n  M^2 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^2 & b^2-a^2 \\\\ 0 &b^2 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  M^3 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^3 & b^3-a^3 \\\\ 0 &b^3 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  M^4 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^4 & b^4-a^4 \\\\ 0 &b^4 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe above phenomenon can be explained by diagonalizing <math>M</math>.  To accomplish this, we need a basis of <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> consisting of eigenvectors of <math>M</math>.  One such eigenvector basis is given by\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{e}_1,\\quad\n  \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\mathbf{e}_2,\n</math>\n\nwhere '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes the standard basis of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. The reverse change of basis is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\mathbf{u},\\qquad \\mathbf{e}_2 = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}.</math>\n\nStraightforward calculations show that\n\n:<math>M\\mathbf{u} = a\\mathbf{u},\\qquad M\\mathbf{v} = b\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nThus, ''a'' and ''b'' are the eigenvalues corresponding to '''u''' and '''v''', respectively. By linearity of matrix multiplication, we have that\n\n:<math> M^n \\mathbf{u} = a^n\\, \\mathbf{u},\\qquad M^n \\mathbf{v} = b^n\\,\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nSwitching back to the standard basis, we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  M^n \\mathbf{e}_1 &= M^n \\mathbf{u} = a^n \\mathbf{e}_1, \\\\\n  M^n \\mathbf{e}_2 &= M^n \\left(\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}\\right) = b^n \\mathbf{v} - a^n\\mathbf{u} = \\left(b^n - a^n\\right) \\mathbf{e}_1 + b^n\\mathbf{e}_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe preceding relations, expressed in matrix form, are\n\n:<math>M^n = \\begin{bmatrix}a^n & b^n - a^n \\\\ 0 & b^n \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nthereby explaining the above phenomenon.\n\n== Quantum mechanical application ==\nIn [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] and [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] computations matrix diagonalization is one of the most frequently applied numerical processes. The basic reason is that the time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is an eigenvalue equation, albeit in most of the physical situations on an infinite dimensional space (a [[Hilbert space]]).\n\nA very common approximation is to truncate Hilbert space to finite dimension, after which the  Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem of a real symmetric, or complex Hermitian matrix. Formally this approximation is founded on the [[variational principle]], valid for Hamiltonians that are bounded from below.\n\n[[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#First order corrections|First-order perturbation theory]] also leads to matrix eigenvalue problem for degenerate states.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Defective matrix]]\n* [[Scaling (geometry)]]\n* [[Triangular matrix]]\n* [[Semisimple operator]]\n* [[Diagonalizable group]]\n* [[Jordan normal form]]\n* [[Weight module]] \u2013 associative algebra generalization\n* [[Orthogonal diagonalization]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{planetmath reference|id=1960|title=Diagonalization}} (or try https://planetmath.org/Diagonalization)\n\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use American English|date = April 2019}}\n{{Short description|matrices similar to diagonal matrices}}\n{{About|matrix diagonalization in linear algebra||Diagonalization (disambiguation){{!}}Diagonalization}}\n\nIn [[linear algebra]], a [[square matrix]] <math>A</math>\u00a0is called '''diagonalizable''' or '''nondefective''' if it is [[Similar (linear algebra)|similar]] to a [[diagonal matrix]], i.e., if there exists an [[invertible matrix]] <math>P</math>\u00a0and a diagonal matrix <math>D</math> such that <math>P^{-1}AP=D</math>, or equivalently <math>A = PDP^{-1}</math>. (Such <math>P,D</math> are not unique.) For a finite-[[Dimension (linear algebra)|dimensional]] [[vector space]] <math>V</math>, a [[linear map]] <math>T:V\\to V</math>\u00a0is called '''diagonalizable''' if there exists an [[Basis (linear algebra)#Ordered%20bases%20and%20coordinates|ordered basis]] of <math>V</math>\u00a0consisting of [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of <math>T</math>. These definitions are equivalent: if <math>T</math>\u00a0has a matrix representation <math>A = PDP^{-1}</math> as above, then the column vectors of <math>P</math>\u00a0form a basis of eigenvectors of <math>T</math>, and the diagonal entries of <math>D</math>\u00a0are the corresponding eigenvalues of <math>T</math>; with respect to this eigenvector basis, <math>P</math>\u00a0is represented by <math>D</math>. '''Diagonalization''' is the process of finding the above <math>P</math>\u00a0and <math>D</math>.\n\nDiagonalizable matrices and maps are especially easy for computations, once their eigenvalues and eigenvectors are known. One can raise a diagonal matrix <math>D</math>\u00a0to a power by simply raising the diagonal entries to that power, and the [[determinant]] of a diagonal matrix is simply the product of all diagonal entries; such computations generalize easily to <math>A=PDP^{-1}</math>. Geometrically, a diagonalizable matrix is an '''[[inhomogeneous dilation]]''' (or ''anisotropic scaling'') \u2014 it [[Scaling (geometry)|scales]] the space, as does a ''[[homogeneous dilation]]'', but by a different factor along each eigenvector axis, the factor given by the corresponding eigenvalue.\n\nA square matrix that is not diagonalizable is called ''[[Defective matrix|defective]]''. It can happen that a matrix <math>A</math> with real entries is defective over the real numbers, meaning that <math>A = PDP^{-1}</math> is impossible for any invertible <math>P</math> and diagonal <math>D</math> with real entries, but it is possible with complex entries, so that <math>A</math> is diagonalizable over the complex numbers. For example, this is the case for a generic [[rotation matrix]].  \n\nMany results for diagonalizable matrices hold only over an algebraically closed field (such as the complex numbers). In this case, diagonalizable matrices are [[Dense set|dense]] in the space of all matrices, which means any defective matrix can be deformed into a diagonalizable matrix by a small [[Perturbation theory|perturbation]]; and the [[Jordan normal form]] theorem states that any matrix is uniquely the sum of a diagonalizable matrix and a [[nilpotent matrix]]. Over an algebraically closed field, diagonalizable matrices are equivalent to [[Semi-simplicity#Semi-simple%20matrices|semi-simple matrices]]. \n\n== Definition ==\nA square <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>A</math> over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] <math>F</math> is called '''diagonalizable''' or '''nondefective''' if there exists an invertible matrix <math>P</math> such that <math>P^{-1}AP</math> is a diagonal matrix.

If such a basis has been found, one can form the matrix <math>P</math> having these [[basis vectors]] as columns, and <math>P^{-1}\\!AP</math> will be a diagonal matrix whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of <math>A</math>. The matrix <math>P</math> is known as a [[modal matrix]] for <math>A</math>.\n* A linear map <math>T : V \\mapsto V</math> is diagonalizable if and only if the sum of the [[dimension (linear algebra)|dimension]]s of its eigenspaces is equal to <math>\\operatorname{dim}(V)</math>, which is the case if and only if there exists a basis of <math>V</math> consisting of eigenvectors of <math>T</math>. With respect to such a basis, <math>T</math> will be represented by a diagonal matrix. The diagonal entries of this matrix are the eigenvalues of <math>T</math>.\n\nAnother characterization: A matrix or linear map is diagonalizable over the field <math>F</math> if and only if its [[minimal polynomial (linear algebra)|minimal polynomial]] is a product of distinct linear factors over <math>F</math>. (Put another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if all of its [[elementary divisor]]s are linear.)\n\nThe following sufficient (but not necessary) condition is often useful.\n{{bulleted list\n| An <math>n \\times n</math> matrix <math>A</math> is diagonalizable over the field <math>F</math> if it has <math>n</math> distinct eigenvalues in <math>F</math>, i.e. if its [[characteristic polynomial]] has <math>n</math> distinct roots in <math>F</math>; however, the converse may be false. Consider\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} -1 & 3 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 5 & -1 \\\\ -3 & 3 & 1 \\end{bmatrix},</math>\n\nwhich has eigenvalues 1, 2, 2 (not all distinct) and is diagonalizable with diagonal form ([[similar (linear algebra)|similar]] to <math>A</math>)\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 2 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 2 \\end{bmatrix}</math>\n\nand [[change of basis|change of basis matrix]] <math>P</math>\n: <math>\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 & -1 \\\\ 1 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 & 3 \\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe converse fails when <math>A</math> has an eigenspace of dimension higher than 1. In this example, the eigenspace of <math>A</math> associated with the eigenvalue 2 has dimension 2.\n| A linear map <math>T : V \\mapsto V</math> with <math>n = \\operatorname{dim}(V)</math> is diagonalizable if it has <math>n</math> distinct eigenvalues, i.e. if its characteristic polynomial has <math>n</math> distinct roots in <math>F</math>.\n}}\n\nLet <math>A</math> be a matrix over <math>F</math>. If <math>A</math> is diagonalizable, then so is any power of it. Conversely, if <math>A</math> is invertible, <math>F</math> is algebraically closed, and <math>A^n</math> is diagonalizable for some <math>n</math> that is not an integer multiple of the characteristic of <math>F</math>, then <math>A</math> is diagonalizable. Proof: If <math>A^n</math> is diagonalizable, then <math>A</math> is annihilated by some polynomial <math>\\left(x^n - \\lambda_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(x^n - \\lambda_k\\right)</math>, which has no multiple root (since <math>\\lambda_j \\ne 0</math>) and is divided by the minimal polynomial of <math>A</math>.\n\nOver the complex numbers <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, almost every matrix is diagonalizable. More precisely: the set of complex <math>n \\times n</math> matrices that are ''not'' diagonalizable over <math>\\mathbb{C}</math>, considered as a [[subset]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}</math>, has [[Lebesgue measure]] zero. One can also say that the diagonalizable matrices form a dense subset with respect to the [[Zariski topology]]: the non-diagonalizable matrices lie inside the [[Algebraic variety|vanishing set]] of the [[discriminant]] of the characteristic polynomial, which is a [[hypersurface]]. From that follows also density in the usual (''strong'') topology given by a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. The same is not true over <math>\\mathbb{R}</math>.\n\nThe [[Jordan\u2013Chevalley decomposition]] expresses an operator as the sum of its semisimple (i.e., diagonalizable) part and its [[nilpotent]] part. Hence, a matrix is diagonalizable if and only if its nilpotent part is zero. Put in another way, a matrix is diagonalizable if each block in its [[Jordan form]] has no nilpotent part; i.e., each \"block\" is a one-by-one matrix.\n\n== Diagonalization ==\n[[File:Diagonalization as rotation.gif|400px|thumb|right|The diagonalization of a matrix can be interpreted as a rotation of the axes to align them with the eigenvectors.]]\nIf a matrix <math>A</math> can be diagonalized, that is,\n\n: <math>P^{-1}AP = \\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\lambda_1 &         0 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n          0 & \\lambda_2 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n     \\vdots &    \\vdots & \\ddots &    \\vdots \\\\\n          0 &         0 &  \\dots & \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nthen:\n\n: <math>AP = P\\begin{pmatrix}\n  \\lambda_1 &         0 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n          0 & \\lambda_2 &  \\dots &         0 \\\\\n     \\vdots &    \\vdots & \\ddots &    \\vdots \\\\\n          0 &         0 &  \\dots & \\lambda_n\n\\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nWriting <math>P</math> as a [[block matrix]] of its column vectors <math>\\vec{\\alpha}_{i}</math>\n\n:<math>P = \\begin{pmatrix}\\vec{\\alpha}_1 & \\vec{\\alpha}_2 & \\cdots & \\vec{\\alpha}_n\\end{pmatrix},</math>\n\nthe above equation can be rewritten as\n\n:<math>A\\vec{\\alpha}_i = \\lambda_i\\vec{\\alpha}_i\\qquad(i=1,2,\\cdots,n).</math>\n\nSo the column vectors of <math>P</math> are [[right eigenvector]]s of <math>A</math>, and the corresponding diagonal entry is the corresponding [[eigenvalue]]. The invertibility of <math>P</math> also suggests that the eigenvectors are [[linearly independent]] and form a basis of <math>F^{n}</math>. This is the necessary and sufficient condition for diagonalizability and the canonical approach of diagonalization. The [[row vector]]s of <math>P^{-1}</math> are the [[left eigenvector]]s of <math>A</math>.\n\nWhen a complex matrix <math>A\\in\\mathbb{C}^{n\\times n}</math> is a [[Hermitian matrix]] (or more generally a [[normal matrix]]), eigenvectors of <math>A</math> can be chosen to form an [[orthonormal basis]] of <math>\\mathbb{C}^n</math>, and <math>P</math> can be chosen to be a [[unitary matrix]]. If in addition, <math>A\\in\\mathbb{R}^{n\\times n}</math> is a real [[symmetric matrix]], then its eigenvectors can be chosen to be an orthonormal basis of <math>\\mathbb{R}^n</math> and <math>P</math> can be chosen to be an [[orthogonal matrix]].\n\nFor most practical work matrices are diagonalized numerically using computer software.

This follows since the minimal polynomial is [[separable polynomial|separable]], because the roots of unity are distinct.\n* [[Projection (linear algebra)|Projections]] are diagonalizable, with 0s and 1s on the diagonal.\n* Real [[symmetric matrices]] are diagonalizable by [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]]; i.e., given a real symmetric matrix <math>A</math>, <math>Q^{\\mathrm T}AQ</math> is diagonal for some orthogonal matrix <math>Q</math>. More generally, matrices are diagonalizable by [[unitary matrix|unitary matrices]] if and only if they are [[normal matrix|normal]]. In the case of the real symmetric matrix, we see that <math>A=A^{\\mathrm T}</math>, so clearly <math>AA^{\\mathrm T} = A^{\\mathrm T}A</math> holds. Examples of normal matrices are real symmetric (or [[Skew-symmetric matrix|skew-symmetric]]) matrices (e.g. covariance matrices) and [[Hermitian matrix|Hermitian matrices]] (or skew-Hermitian matrices). See [[spectral theorem]]s for generalizations to infinite-dimensional vector spaces.\n\n=== Matrices that are not diagonalizable ===\nIn general, a [[rotation matrix]] is not diagonalizable over the reals, but all [[rotation matrix#Independent planes|rotation matrices]] are diagonalizable over the complex field. Even if a matrix is not diagonalizable, it is always possible to \"do the best one can\", and find a matrix with the same properties consisting of eigenvalues on the leading diagonal, and either ones or zeroes on the superdiagonal \u2013 known as [[Jordan Normal Form|Jordan normal form]].\n\nSome matrices are not diagonalizable over any field, most notably nonzero [[nilpotent matrix|nilpotent matrices]]. This happens more generally if the [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace#Algebraic and geometric multiplicities|algebraic and geometric multiplicities]] of an eigenvalue do not coincide. For instance, consider\n\n:<math> C = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix}. </math>\n\nThis matrix is not diagonalizable: there is no matrix <math>U</math> such that <math>U^{-1}CU</math> is a diagonal matrix. Indeed, <math>C</math> has one eigenvalue (namely zero) and this eigenvalue has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.\n\nSome real matrices are not diagonalizable over the reals. Consider for instance the matrix\n\n:<math> B = \\left[\\begin{array}{rr} 0 & 1 \\\\ \\!-1 & 0 \\end{array}\\right]. </math>\n\nThe matrix <math>B</math> does not have any real eigenvalues, so there is no '''real''' matrix <math>Q</math> such that <math>Q^{-1}BQ</math> is a diagonal matrix. However, we can diagonalize <math>B</math> if we allow complex numbers. Indeed, if we take\n\n:<math> Q = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & \\textrm{i} \\\\ \\textrm{i} & 1 \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nthen <math>Q^{-1}BQ</math> is diagonal. It is easy to find that B is the rotation matrix which rotates counterclockwise by angle <math>\\theta=\\tfrac{3\\pi}{2}</math>\n\nNote that the above examples show that the sum of diagonalizable matrices need not be diagonalizable.\n\n=== How to diagonalize a matrix ===\nDiagonalizing a matrix is the same process as finding its [[eigenvalues and eigenvectors]], in the case that the eigenvectors form a basis. For example, consider the matrix\n\n:<math>A=\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!-2\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & \\!\\!\\!-1 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right].</math>\n\nThe roots of the [[characteristic polynomial]] <math>p(\\lambda)=\\det(\\lambda I-A)</math> are the eigenvalues <math>\\lambda_1 = 1,\\lambda_2 = 1,\\lambda_3 = 2</math>. Solving the linear system <math>(I-A)(\\mathbf{v})=0</math> gives the eigenvectors <math>\\mathbf{v}_1 = (1,1,0)</math> and <math>\\mathbf{v}_2 = (0,2,1)</math>, while <math>(2I-A)(\\mathbf{v})=0</math> gives <math>\\mathbf{v}_3=(1,0,-1)</math>; that is, <math>A(\\mathbf{v}_i)=\\lambda_i\\mathbf{v}_i</math> for <math>i = 1,2,3</math>. These vectors form a basis of <math>V=\\mathbb{R}^3</math>, so we can assemble them as the column vectors of a [[Change of basis|change-of-basis]] matrix <math>P</math> to get:<blockquote><math>P^{-1}\\!AP \\ = \\ \n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!-2\\\\\n0 & 1 & 0\\\\\n1 & \\!\\!\\!-1 & 3\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\ =\\ \n\\begin{bmatrix} 1&0&0\\\\ 0&1&0\\\\ 0&0&2\\end{bmatrix} \\ =\\ D .</math></blockquote>We may see this equation in terms of transformations: <math>P</math> takes the standard basis to the eigenbasis, <math>P(\\mathbf{e}_i) = \\mathbf{v}_i</math>, so we have:<blockquote><math>P^{-1}\\!AP(\\mathbf{e}_i) \\ =\\ \nP^{-1}\\!A(\\mathbf{v}_i) \\ =\\ \nP^{-1}\\!(\\lambda_i\\mathbf{v}_i) \\ = \\ \n\\lambda_i\\mathbf{e}_i,</math></blockquote>so that <math>P^{-1}\\!AP</math> has the standard basis as its eigenvectors, which is the defining property of <math>D</math>. \n\nNote that there is no preferred order of the eigenvectors in <math>P</math>; changing the order of the [[eigenvectors]] in <math>P</math> just changes the order of the [[eigenvalues]] in the diagonalized form of <math>A</math>.<ref>{{cite book| last1=Anton |first1=H. |last2= Rorres|first2= C. |title=Elementary Linear Algebra (Applications Version) | url=https://archive.org/details/studentsolutions00grob | url-access=registration |publisher=John Wiley & Sons|edition=8th|date=22 Feb 2000| ISBN= 978-0-471-17052-5}}</ref>\n\n== Application to matrix functions ==\nDiagonalization can be used to efficiently compute the powers of a matrix <math>A=PDP^{-1}</math>:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \n  A^k &= \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right)^k = \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\cdots \\left(PDP^{-1}\\right) \\\\\n      &= PD\\left(P^{-1}P\\right) D \\left(P^{-1}P\\right) \\cdots \\left(P^{-1}P\\right) D P^{-1} = PD^kP^{-1},\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nand the latter is easy to calculate since it only involves the powers of a diagonal matrix. For example, for the matrix <math>A</math> with eigenvalues <math>\\lambda = 1,1,2</math> in the example above we compute:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\nA^k = PD^kP^{-1} &=&\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} 1^k&0&0\\\\ 0&1^k&0\\\\ 0&0&2^k\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1} \n\\\\[1em]\n&=&\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 - 2^k & -1 + 2^k & 2 - 2^{k + 1} \\\\\n0 & 1 & 0 \\\\\n-1 + 2^k & 1 - 2^k & -1 + 2^{k + 1}\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{array}\n\n </math> </blockquote>This approach can be generalized to [[matrix exponential]] and other [[matrix function]]s that can be defined as power series. For example, defining  <math>\\exp(A) = I + A + \\tfrac{1}{2!}A^2 + \\tfrac{1}{3!}A^3 + \\cdots</math> , we have:<blockquote><math>\\begin{array}{rcl}\n\\exp(A) = P\\,\\exp(D)\\,P^{-1} &=&\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\n\\begin{bmatrix} e^1&0&0\\\\ 0&e^1&0\\\\ 0&0&e^2\\end{bmatrix}\n\n\\left[\\begin{array}{rrr}\n1 & \\,0 & 1\\\\\n1 & 2 & 0\\\\\n0 & 1 & \\!\\!\\!\\!-1\n\\end{array}\\right]^{-1} \n\\\\[1em]\n&=&\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n2 e - e^2 & -e + e^2 & 2 e - 2 e^2\\\\\n0 & e & 0\\\\\n-e + e^2 & e - e^2 & -e + 2 e^2\n\\end{bmatrix}.\n\\end{array}\n\n </math></blockquote>This is particularly useful in finding closed form expressions for terms of [[linear recursive sequences]], such as the [[Fibonacci_number#Matrix_form|Fibonacci numbers]].\n\n=== Particular application ===\nFor example, consider the following matrix:\n\n:<math>M = \\begin{bmatrix}a & b - a\\\\ 0 & b\\end{bmatrix}.</math>\n\nCalculating the various powers of <math>M</math> reveals a  surprising pattern:\n\n:<math>\n  M^2 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^2 & b^2-a^2 \\\\ 0 &b^2 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  M^3 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^3 & b^3-a^3 \\\\ 0 &b^3 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  M^4 = \\begin{bmatrix}a^4 & b^4-a^4 \\\\ 0 &b^4 \\end{bmatrix},\\quad\n  \\ldots\n</math>\n\nThe above phenomenon can be explained by diagonalizing <math>M</math>.  To accomplish this, we need a basis of <math>\\mathbb{R}^2</math> consisting of eigenvectors of <math>M</math>.  One such eigenvector basis is given by\n\n:<math>\n  \\mathbf{u} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 0 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{e}_1,\\quad\n  \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 \\\\ 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\mathbf{e}_1 + \\mathbf{e}_2,\n</math>\n\nwhere '''e'''<sub>''i''</sub> denotes the standard basis of '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>. The reverse change of basis is given by\n\n:<math>\\mathbf{e}_1 = \\mathbf{u},\\qquad \\mathbf{e}_2 = \\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}.</math>\n\nStraightforward calculations show that\n\n:<math>M\\mathbf{u} = a\\mathbf{u},\\qquad M\\mathbf{v} = b\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nThus, ''a'' and ''b'' are the eigenvalues corresponding to '''u''' and '''v''', respectively. By linearity of matrix multiplication, we have that\n\n:<math> M^n \\mathbf{u} = a^n\\, \\mathbf{u},\\qquad M^n \\mathbf{v} = b^n\\,\\mathbf{v}.</math>\n\nSwitching back to the standard basis, we have\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n  M^n \\mathbf{e}_1 &= M^n \\mathbf{u} = a^n \\mathbf{e}_1, \\\\\n  M^n \\mathbf{e}_2 &= M^n \\left(\\mathbf{v} - \\mathbf{u}\\right) = b^n \\mathbf{v} - a^n\\mathbf{u} = \\left(b^n - a^n\\right) \\mathbf{e}_1 + b^n\\mathbf{e}_2.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe preceding relations, expressed in matrix form, are\n\n:<math>M^n = \\begin{bmatrix}a^n & b^n - a^n \\\\ 0 & b^n \\end{bmatrix}, </math>\n\nthereby explaining the above phenomenon.\n\n== Quantum mechanical application ==\nIn [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] and [[quantum chemistry|quantum chemical]] computations matrix diagonalization is one of the most frequently applied numerical processes. The basic reason is that the time-independent [[Schr\u00f6dinger equation]] is an eigenvalue equation, albeit in most of the physical situations on an infinite dimensional space (a [[Hilbert space]]).\n\nA very common approximation is to truncate Hilbert space to finite dimension, after which the  Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be formulated as an eigenvalue problem of a real symmetric, or complex Hermitian matrix. Formally this approximation is founded on the [[variational principle]], valid for Hamiltonians that are bounded from below.\n\n[[Perturbation theory (quantum mechanics)#First order corrections|First-order perturbation theory]] also leads to matrix eigenvalue problem for degenerate states.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Defective matrix]]\n* [[Scaling (geometry)]]\n* [[Triangular matrix]]\n* [[Semisimple operator]]\n* [[Diagonalizable group]]\n* [[Jordan normal form]]\n* [[Weight module]] \u2013 associative algebra generalization\n* [[Orthogonal diagonalization]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{planetmath reference|id=1960|title=Diagonalization}} (or try https://planetmath.org/Diagonalization)\n\n[[Category:Matrices]]\n", "name_user": "Adam Dent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eMatrices that are not diagonalizable:updated a link", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonalizable_matrix"}
