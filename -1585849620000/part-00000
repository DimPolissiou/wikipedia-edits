It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of [[intellectual property]] (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.<ref>See TRIPS Art. 1(3).</ref> TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) between 1989 and 1990<ref>{{Cite book|title=The TRIPS Agreement: Negotiating History|last=Gervais|first=Daniel|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=Part I.}}</ref> and is administered by the WTO.\n\nThe TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the multilateral trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the [[Doha Declaration]]. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal \"to promote access to medicines for all.\"\n\nSpecifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide [[copyright]] rights, covering authors and other copyright holders, as well as holders of related rights, namely performers, sound recording producers and broadcasting organisations; [[geographical indication]]s; [[Industrial design law|industrial designs]]; [[mask work|integrated circuit layout-designs]]; [[patent]]s;  [[plant breeders' rights|new plant varieties]]; [[trademark]]s; [[Trade name|trade names]] and undisclosed or [[confidential information]]. TRIPS also specifies [[enforcement]] procedures, remedies, and [[dispute resolution]] procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\n\n==Background and history==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2012}}\nTRIPS was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1986-1994.   Its inclusion was the culmination of a program of intense [[lobbying]] by the [[United States]], supported by the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and other [[developed nations]].  Campaigns of unilateral economic encouragement under the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] and [[Economic coercion|coercion]] under [[Section 301]] of the Trade Act played an important role in defeating competing policy positions that were favored by developing countries like Brazil, but also including Thailand, India and Caribbean Basin states.  In turn, the United States strategy of linking trade policy to intellectual property standards can be traced back to the entrepreneurship of senior management at [[Pfizer]] in the early 1980s, who mobilized corporations in the United States and made maximizing intellectual property privileges the number one priority of trade policy in the United States (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000, Chapter 7).\n\nAfter the Uruguay round, the GATT became the basis for the establishment of the World Trade Organization.  Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS.  For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws.  States like Russia and [[China]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Farah, Paolo Davide|author2=Cima, Elena|date=2010|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1527992|title=China\u2019s Participation in the World Trade Organization: Trade in Goods, Services, Intellectual Property Rights and Transparency Issues\" in Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella Martinez (ed.), El comercio con China.

States can be disciplined through the WTO's [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|dispute settlement]] mechanism.\n\n==Requirements==\nTRIPS requires member states to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights. For example, under TRIPS:\n\n* Copyright terms must extend at least 50 years, unless based on the life of the [[author]]. (Art. 12 and 14)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards |publisher=WTO |date=1994-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>\n* Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based upon any \"[[copyright formalities|formality]]\", such as [[copyright registration|registrations]], as specified in the [[Berne Convention]]. (Art. 9)\n* Computer programs must be regarded as \"literary works\" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.\n* National [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|exceptions to copyright]] (such as \"[[fair use]]\" in the United States) are constrained by the [[Berne three-step test]]\n* Patents must be granted for \"inventions\" in all \"fields of technology\" provided they meet all other patentability requirements (although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3)<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part II \u2014 Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of Intellectual Property Rights; Sections 5 and 6\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm}}</ref> and must be enforceable for at least 20 years (Art 33).\n* Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided that a normal exploitation of the work (Art.&nbsp;13) and normal exploitation of the patent (Art&nbsp;30) is not in conflict.\n* No unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the right holders of computer programs and patents is allowed.\n* Legitimate interests of third parties have to be taken into account by patent rights (Art&nbsp;30).\n* In each state, intellectual property laws may not offer any benefits to local citizens which are not available to citizens of other TRIPS signatories under the principle of [[national treatment]] (with certain limited exceptions, Art. 3 and 5).<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part I \u2014 General Provisions and Basic Principles\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm}}</ref>  TRIPS also has a [[most favored nation clause]].\n\nThe TRIPS Agreement incorporates by reference the provisions on copyright from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] (Art 9), with the exception of moral rights. It also incorporated by reference the substantive provisions of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (Art 2.1). The TRIPS Agreement specifically mentions that software and databases are protected by copyright, subject to originality requirement (Art 10).\n\nArticle 10 of the Agreement stipulates:\n\"1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).\n2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.\"\n\n===Access to essential medicines===<!-- This section is linked from [[Patent]] -->\nThe most visible conflict has been over [[AIDS]] drugs in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]].  Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs  for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the [[Doha Declaration]], was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises.  After Doha, [[PhRMA]], the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Timmermann, Cristian|author2=Henk van den Belt|date=2013|title=Intellectual property and global health: from corporate social responsibility to the access to knowledge movement|journal=Liverpool Law Review|volume=34 (1)|pages=47-73}}</ref>\n\nA 2003 agreement loosened the domestic market requirement, and allows developing countries to export to other countries where there is a national health problem as long as drugs exported are not part of a commercial or industrial policy.<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health\n|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/implem_para6_e.htm\n|date=1 September 2003\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization}}</ref> Drugs exported under such a regime may be packaged or colored differently in order to prevent them from prejudicing markets in the developed world.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration also changed its position, concluding that generic treatments might in fact be a component of an effective strategy to combat HIV.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, \u201c[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2011_life_cycle-libre.pdf The Life-Cycle of Transnational Issues: Lessons from the Access to Medicines Controversy]\u201d, Global Society 25(2) 2011: 227-247.</ref>  Bush created the [[PEPFAR]] program, which received $15 billion from 2003 to 2007, and was reauthorized in 2008 for $48 billion over the next five years.  Despite wavering on the issue of [compulsory licensing], PEPFAR began to distribute generic drugs in 2004\u20135.\n\n===Software and business method patents===\n{{main article|Software patents under TRIPs Agreement}}\nAnother controversy has been over the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for patentability \"in all fields of technology\", and whether or not this necessitates the granting of [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent]]s.\n\nAccording to article 10 of the TRIPS Agreement the appropriate instrument to protect software protection is copyright. The importance of this instrument has recently been confirmed by the US Supreme Court (''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'').\n\n== Implementation in developing countries ==\n\nThe obligations under TRIPS apply equally to all member states, however [[developing countries]] were allowed extra time to implement the applicable changes to their national laws, in two tiers of transition according to their level of development.  The transition period for developing countries expired in 2005. The transition period for [[least developed countries]] to implement TRIPS was extended to 2013, and until 1 January 2016 for pharmaceutical patents, with the possibility of further extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/tripfq_e.htm|title=WTO - intellectual property (TRIPS) - frequently-asked questions|website=Wto.org|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt has therefore been argued that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = IP Justice policy paper for the WIPO development agenda\n |publisher   = IP Justice\n |url         = http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130108183327/http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |archivedate = 8 January 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.-F.

Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of [[artificial scarcity]] on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.<ref>Ping Xiong \u2018Patents in TRIPS-Plus Provisions and the Approaches to Interpretation of Free Trade Agreements and TRIPS: Do They Affect Public Health?\u2019 (2012) 46(1) Journal of World Trade 155</ref> Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market.

Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as compulsory licensing, are near-on impossible to exercise.

an [[international agreement|international legal agreement]] between all the member nations of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO). It sets down minimum standards for the regulation by national governments of many forms of [[intellectual property]] (IP) as applied to nationals of other WTO member nations.<ref>See TRIPS Art. 1(3).</ref> TRIPS was negotiated at the end of the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) between 1989 and 1990<ref>{{Cite book|title=The TRIPS Agreement: Negotiating History|last=Gervais|first=Daniel|publisher=Sweet & Maxwell|year=2012|isbn=|location=London|pages=Part I.}}</ref> and is administered by the WTO.\n\nThe TRIPS agreement introduced intellectual property law into the multilateral trading system for the first time and remains the most comprehensive multilateral agreement on intellectual property to date. In 2001, developing countries, concerned that developed countries were insisting on an overly narrow reading of TRIPS, initiated a round of talks that resulted in the [[Doha Declaration]]. The Doha declaration is a WTO statement that clarifies the scope of TRIPS, stating for example that TRIPS can and should be interpreted in light of the goal \"to promote access to medicines for all.\"\n\nSpecifically, TRIPS requires WTO members to provide [[copyright]] rights, covering authors and other copyright holders, as well as holders of related rights, namely performers, sound recording producers and broadcasting organisations; [[geographical indication]]s; [[Industrial design law|industrial designs]]; [[mask work|integrated circuit layout-designs]]; [[patent]]s;  [[plant breeders' rights|new plant varieties]]; [[trademark]]s; [[Trade name|trade names]] and undisclosed or [[confidential information]]. TRIPS also specifies [[enforcement]] procedures, remedies, and [[dispute resolution]] procedures. Protection and enforcement of all intellectual property rights shall meet the objectives to contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.\n\n==Background and history==\n{{refimprove|section|date=May 2012}}\nTRIPS was negotiated during the [[Uruguay Round]] of the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT) in 1986-1994.   Its inclusion was the culmination of a program of intense [[lobbying]] by the [[United States]], supported by the [[European Union]], [[Japan]] and other [[developed nations]].  Campaigns of unilateral economic encouragement under the [[Generalized System of Preferences]] and [[Economic coercion|coercion]] under [[Section 301]] of the Trade Act played an important role in defeating competing policy positions that were favored by developing countries like Brazil, but also including Thailand, India and Caribbean Basin states.  In turn, the United States strategy of linking trade policy to intellectual property standards can be traced back to the entrepreneurship of senior management at [[Pfizer]] in the early 1980s, who mobilized corporations in the United States and made maximizing intellectual property privileges the number one priority of trade policy in the United States (Braithwaite and Drahos, 2000, Chapter 7).\n\nAfter the Uruguay round, the GATT became the basis for the establishment of the World Trade Organization.  Because ratification of TRIPS is a compulsory requirement of World Trade Organization membership, any country seeking to obtain hard access to the numerous international markets opened by the World Trade Organization must enact the strict intellectual property laws mandated by TRIPS.  For this reason, TRIPS is the most important multilateral instrument for the globalization of intellectual property laws.  States like Russia and [[China]],<ref>{{cite book|author1=Farah, Paolo Davide|author2=Cima, Elena|date=2010|url=http://ssrn.com/abstract=1527992|title=China\u2019s Participation in the World Trade Organization: Trade in Goods, Services, Intellectual Property Rights and Transparency Issues\" in Aurelio Lopez-Tarruella Martinez (ed.), El comercio con China. Oportunidades empresariales, incertidumbres jur\u00eddicas, Tirant lo Blanch, |location=Valencia, Spain|pages=85\u2013121|isbn=978-84-8456-981-7}}</ref> that were very unlikely to join the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]] have found the prospect of WTO membership a powerful enticement.\n\nFurthermore, unlike other agreements on intellectual property, TRIPS has a powerful enforcement mechanism.  States can be disciplined through the WTO's [[WTO Dispute Settlement Body|dispute settlement]] mechanism.\n\n==Requirements==\nTRIPS requires member states to provide strong protection for intellectual property rights. For example, under TRIPS:\n\n* Copyright terms must extend at least 50 years, unless based on the life of the [[author]]. (Art. 12 and 14)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/t_agm3_e.htm |title=intellectual property (TRIPS) - agreement text - standards |publisher=WTO |date=1994-04-15 |accessdate=2012-04-16}}</ref>\n* Copyright must be granted automatically, and not based upon any \"[[copyright formalities|formality]]\", such as [[copyright registration|registrations]], as specified in the [[Berne Convention]]. (Art. 9)\n* Computer programs must be regarded as \"literary works\" under copyright law and receive the same terms of protection.\n* National [[limitations and exceptions to copyright|exceptions to copyright]] (such as \"[[fair use]]\" in the United States) are constrained by the [[Berne three-step test]]\n* Patents must be granted for \"inventions\" in all \"fields of technology\" provided they meet all other patentability requirements (although exceptions for certain public interests are allowed (Art. 27.2 and 27.3)<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part II \u2014 Standards concerning the availability, scope and use of Intellectual Property Rights; Sections 5 and 6\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_04c_e.htm}}</ref> and must be enforceable for at least 20 years (Art 33).\n* Exceptions to exclusive rights must be limited, provided that a normal exploitation of the work (Art.&nbsp;13) and normal exploitation of the patent (Art&nbsp;30) is not in conflict.\n* No unreasonable prejudice to the legitimate interests of the right holders of computer programs and patents is allowed.\n* Legitimate interests of third parties have to be taken into account by patent rights (Art&nbsp;30).\n* In each state, intellectual property laws may not offer any benefits to local citizens which are not available to citizens of other TRIPS signatories under the principle of [[national treatment]] (with certain limited exceptions, Art. 3 and 5).<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization\n|chapter=Part I \u2014 General Provisions and Basic Principles\n|chapterurl=http://www.wto.org/english/docs_e/legal_e/27-trips_03_e.htm}}</ref>  TRIPS also has a [[most favored nation clause]].\n\nThe TRIPS Agreement incorporates by reference the provisions on copyright from the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]] (Art 9), with the exception of moral rights. It also incorporated by reference the substantive provisions of the [[Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property]] (Art 2.1). The TRIPS Agreement specifically mentions that software and databases are protected by copyright, subject to originality requirement (Art 10).\n\nArticle 10 of the Agreement stipulates:\n\"1. Computer programs, whether in source or object code, shall be protected as literary works under the Berne Convention (1971).\n2. Compilations of data or other material, whether in machine readable or other form, which by reason of the selection or arrangement of their contents constitute intellectual creations shall be protected as such. Such protection, which shall not extend to the data or material itself, shall be without prejudice to any copyright subsisting in the data or material itself.\"\n\n===Access to essential medicines===<!-- This section is linked from [[Patent]] -->\nThe most visible conflict has been over [[AIDS]] drugs in [[AIDS in Africa|Africa]].  Despite the role that patents have played in maintaining higher drug costs  for public health programs across Africa, this controversy has not led to a revision of TRIPS. Instead, an interpretive statement, the [[Doha Declaration]], was issued in November 2001, which indicated that TRIPS should not prevent states from dealing with public health crises.  After Doha, [[PhRMA]], the United States and to a lesser extent other developed nations began working to minimize the effect of the declaration.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=Timmermann, Cristian|author2=Henk van den Belt|date=2013|title=Intellectual property and global health: from corporate social responsibility to the access to knowledge movement|journal=Liverpool Law Review|volume=34 (1)|pages=47-73}}</ref>\n\nA 2003 agreement loosened the domestic market requirement, and allows developing countries to export to other countries where there is a national health problem as long as drugs exported are not part of a commercial or industrial policy.<ref>{{Citation\n|title=Implementation of paragraph 6 of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and public health\n|url=http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/implem_para6_e.htm\n|date=1 September 2003\n|author=World Trade Organization\n|authorlink=World Trade Organization}}</ref> Drugs exported under such a regime may be packaged or colored differently in order to prevent them from prejudicing markets in the developed world.\n\nIn 2003, the Bush administration also changed its position, concluding that generic treatments might in fact be a component of an effective strategy to combat HIV.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, \u201c[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_2011_life_cycle-libre.pdf The Life-Cycle of Transnational Issues: Lessons from the Access to Medicines Controversy]\u201d, Global Society 25(2) 2011: 227-247.</ref>  Bush created the [[PEPFAR]] program, which received $15 billion from 2003 to 2007, and was reauthorized in 2008 for $48 billion over the next five years.  Despite wavering on the issue of [compulsory licensing], PEPFAR began to distribute generic drugs in 2004\u20135.\n\n===Software and business method patents===\n{{main article|Software patents under TRIPs Agreement}}\nAnother controversy has been over the TRIPS Article 27 requirements for patentability \"in all fields of technology\", and whether or not this necessitates the granting of [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent]]s.\n\nAccording to article 10 of the TRIPS Agreement the appropriate instrument to protect software protection is copyright. The importance of this instrument has recently been confirmed by the US Supreme Court (''[[Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.]]'').\n\n== Implementation in developing countries ==\n\nThe obligations under TRIPS apply equally to all member states, however [[developing countries]] were allowed extra time to implement the applicable changes to their national laws, in two tiers of transition according to their level of development.  The transition period for developing countries expired in 2005. The transition period for [[least developed countries]] to implement TRIPS was extended to 2013, and until 1 January 2016 for pharmaceutical patents, with the possibility of further extension.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/tripfq_e.htm|title=WTO - intellectual property (TRIPS) - frequently-asked questions|website=Wto.org|accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIt has therefore been argued that the TRIPS standard of requiring all countries to create strict intellectual property systems will be detrimental to poorer countries' development.<ref>{{Citation\n |title       = IP Justice policy paper for the WIPO development agenda\n |publisher   = IP Justice\n |url         = http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://archive.is/20130108183327/http://www.ipjustice.org/WIPO/WIPO_DA_IP_Justice_Policy_Paper.shtml\n |archivedate = 8 January 2013\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author1=J.-F.

These collection of standards, known as TRIPS+ or TRIPS-Plus, can take many forms.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin and Dimitri Theriault, [https://www.cigionline.org/publications/how-trade-deals-extend-frontiers-international-patent-law How Trade Deals Extend the Frontiers of International Patent Law], CIGI Paper 199, 2018; {{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195390124.001.0001/acprof-9780195390124-chapter-8|title=Overview of \"TRIPS-Plus\" Standards - Oxford Scholarship|publisher=}}</ref>  General objectives of these agreements include:\n\n* The creation of [[anti-circumvention laws]] to protect [[Digital Rights Management]] systems.

Though some of this criticism is against the WTO generally, many advocates of trade liberalisation also regard TRIPS as poor policy. TRIPS's wealth concentration effects (moving money from people in developing countries to copyright and patent owners in developed countries) and its imposition of [[artificial scarcity]] on the citizens of countries that would otherwise have had weaker intellectual property laws, are common bases for such criticisms. Other criticism has focused on the failure of TRIPS to accelerate investment and technology flows to low-income countries, a benefit advanced by WTO members in the lead-up to the agreement's formation. Statements by the World Bank indicate that TRIPS has not led to a demonstrable acceleration of investment to low-income countries, though it may have done so for middle-income countries.<ref>Ping Xiong \u2018Patents in TRIPS-Plus Provisions and the Approaches to Interpretation of Free Trade Agreements and TRIPS: Do They Affect Public Health?\u2019 (2012) 46(1) Journal of World Trade 155</ref> Lengthy patent periods under TRIPs have been scrutinised for unduly slowing the entry of generic substitutes and competition to the market.

They argue, however, that the benefits from weakening intellectual property rights strongly depend on whether the governments can credibly commit to using it only in exceptional cases of emergencies since firms may invest less in R&D if they expect repeated episodes of compulsory licensing.   \n\nThe 2002 Doha Declaration affirmed that the TRIPS agreement should not prevent members from taking measures necessary to protect public health. Despite this recognition, less-developed countries have argued that TRIPS's flexible provisions, such as compulsory licensing, are near-on impossible to exercise. In particular, less developed countries have cited their infant domestic manufacturing and technology industries as evidence of the policy's bluntness.\n\nTRIPS-plus conditions mandating standards beyond TRIPS have also been the subject of scrutiny.<ref>Jean-Frederic Morin, '[https://www.chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/sites/chaire-epi.ulaval.ca/files/publications/morin_tripping.pdf Tripping up TRIPs Debate: IP and Health]', International Journal of Intellectual Property Management 1(1/2), 2006:37-53.</ref> These [[Free trade area|FTA]] agreements contain conditions that limit the ability of governments to introduce competition for generic producers.

Krohg.jpg|thumb|A drawing from the 1890s depicting 10th century ruler [[Haakon the Good]] commanding Christian clergy|alt=|380x380px]]\n'''Freedom of religion in Norway''' refers to the extent to which people in [[Norway]] are freely able to practice their religious beliefs, taking into account both government policies and societal attitudes toward religious groups.\n\nWhile the constitution of Norway establishes that the [[King of Norway]] must be [[Evangelical-Lutheran]], it also establishes that all individuals have the right to exercise their religion. The government's policies generally support the free practice of religion in the country, and it provides funding to religious organizations and anti-discrimination programs on a regular basis. According to [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs) and the [[Norwegian Police Service|Norwegian police]], religiously motivated hate speech is prevalent, particularly online, and primarily targeting the Muslim and Jewish communities.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe origins of the modern Kingdom of Norway can be traced to the kingdoms established by Vikings during the [[Middle Ages]]. During this period, Norwegian kings such as [[Olaf II of Norway]] converted to Christianity, and propagated it within their kingdoms to reify their authority.<ref name=\":1\" /> Accounts from this time period include graphic descriptions of gruesome torture perpetrated against pagans who refused to convert.<ref name=\":7\" /> The Catholic Church in Norway would be replaced by Evangelical-Lutheranism during the [[Reformation]] in the 16th century, and non-Protestants were persecuted.''<ref name=\":8\" />'' From the 16th to 19th centuries, Norway (under either a Danish or Swedish crown) forced the [[S\u00e1mi people]] of northeastern Scandinavia to convert to Christianity, suppressing and eventually all but eradicating their indigenous religion.<ref name=\":6\" /> Jews were at times tolerated in Norway, but in 1814 a new constitution banned Jews from the country\u2013\u2013this provision would be reversed in 1851, and by the end of the 19th century Norway would be home to a few thousand Jews.<ref name=\":9\" /> This population was devastated in the 1940s during the German occupation of Norway as part of World War II and [[the Holocaust]].<ref name=\":3\" /> Toward the end of the 20th century and in the 21st, Norwegian government has adopted some constitutional reforms to recognize the traditions of the S\u00e1mi people,<ref name=\":10\" /> to establish a separation between church and state,<ref name=\":4\" /> and to provide financial restitution for the Jewish community,<ref name=\":11\" /> but it has also imposed religious clothing bans targeting Muslim women.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n== Demographics ==\nThe [[National Bureau of Statistics (Norway)|National Statistics Bureau]] estimated that in 2017, 71 percent of the population belonged to the [[Church of Norway]], an evangelical Lutheran church. 6.4 percent of the population belong to other Christian denominations, of which the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] is the largest, with 2.9 percent of the population. [[Muslims]] comprise 2.9 percent of the population. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], and [[Judaism|Jews]] each make up less than 1 percent of the population. The [[Norwegian Humanist Association]], with a registered membership of around 6 percent of the population, accounts for nearly all those registered with [[Life stance|life-stance]] organizations (nonreligious or philosophical communities with organizational ethics based on humanist values).<ref name=\":0\">''[https://www.state.gov/reports/2017-report-on-international-religious-freedom/norway International Religious Freedom Report 2017 Norway],'' US Department of State, Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nImmigrants comprise the majority of members of religious groups outside the Church of Norway. Immigrants from [[Poland]] and the [[Philippines]] have increased the number of Catholics, while those from such countries as [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Somalia]] have increased the size of the Muslim community. Catholics and Muslims generally have greater representation in cities than in rural areas. Muslims are located throughout the country, but the population is concentrated in the [[Oslo]] region. Many recent immigrants from Muslim majority countries still reside in asylum reception centers. According to [[Norwegian Directorate of Immigration]] statistics, approximately 5,600 of the 6,300 persons residing in reception centers as of October 2017 come from Muslim majority countries.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Norway}}\n=== Unification and Christianization of the Kingdom of Norway (10th c.

The plan emphasizes data collection, training and education programs in schools, research on anti-Semitism and Jewish life in the country, and efforts to safeguard Jewish culture. Under the plan, police must work toward including anti-Semitism as a separate category of hate crime in police statistics.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe government conducts workshops and other intervention programs targeting practitioners working with groups at risk for radicalization, including religious minority groups.

The government's policies generally support the free practice of religion in the country, and it provides funding to religious organizations and anti-discrimination programs on a regular basis.

[[Muslims]] comprise 2.9 percent of the population. [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostalists]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], [[Hindus]], and [[Judaism|Jews]] each make up less than 1 percent of the population.

It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect. I bought it.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}} According to Sandford, Ava Cherry also claimed to have been the inspiration for the song.{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}\n\nMusically, \"Golden Years\" is a [[funk]] and [[disco]] song.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}}<ref name=\"Mojica CoS\">{{cite web | url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | title=David Bowie \u2013 ''Station to Station'' [Special Edition] | website=[[Consequence of Sound]] | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=1 June 2016 | last=Mojica |first= Frank | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192925/http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | archive-date=9 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 August 2019|quote=...as well as the disco stylings of 'Golden Years.'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As the lead single of ''Station to Station'', the song is noted as musically different than the rest of its parent album.<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"Golden Years\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-years-mt0054050615 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> While ''Station to Station'' is commonly regarded as the musical bridge between the funk and [[Soul music|soul]] of ''[[Young Americans]]'' to the experimental sound of his [[Berlin Trilogy]],{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} \"Golden Years\" is the only song on the album to showcase the similar funk sound of ''Young Americans'' compared to, in Pegg's words, \"the steelier musical landscape\" of ''Station to Station''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\" /> Pegg further comments that its American \"soul-pop\" roots are \"easily discernible\": he describes the main riff as \"owing a debt to\" the 1968 [[Cliff Nobles]] and Company song \"[[The Horse]]\" and the multi-tracked vocal refrain to 1958 single \"Happy Years\" by [[the Diamonds]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} The song is in the key of B major and begins with a \"simple two-chord\" riff (F{{music|sharp}}\u2013E),{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=288\u2013289}} which Buckley believes hooks the listener in instantly.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett calls the riff \"reminiscent\", albeit \"in very different circumstances\", to the [[Aladdin Sane (song)|title track]] of ''Aladdin Sane''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} According to Buckley, Bowie was looking to emulate something of the glitzy nostalgia of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", which he was playing on piano in the studio when he came up with \"Golden Years\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett writes: \"The magical ingredients were percussive: the rattling of sticks against the hi-hat cymbal from the start, the startling clack of woodblocks, the sudden drum fills.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}} These elements combined \"channel\" the spirit of Elvis Presley in the verses, with a \"haughtier, more strident tone\" in the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Golden Years\" was released on 21 November 1975 as the lead single to Bowie's tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] (as RCA 2640/PB-10441) with the ''[[Young Americans]]'' track \"[[Can You Hear Me?

It is also included on ''Re:Call 2'', part of the ''[[Who Can I Be Now? (1974\u20131976)]]'' compilation.\n* The song was included on the album ''[[Trainspotting (soundtrack)|Trainspotting #2: Music from the Motion Picture, Vol. #2]]'' (1997).\n* The song was included on the original soundtrack of ''[[A Knight's Tale (film)|A Knight's Tale]]'' (2001), starring [[Heath Ledger]]. The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack). Tony Visconti, who produced the original recording of the song, supervised the remix session, and Bowie dropped by as well to hear what they found in his multitrack.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |title=A Knight's Tale |publisher=Carter Burwell |date= |accessdate=2016-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906192026/http://www.carterburwell.com/projects/Knights_Tale.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Chart history==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1975\u201376)\n!Peak<br />position\n|-\n|Australia ([[Kent Music Report]])\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|34\n|-\n|Canada ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Top Singles\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|17\n|-\n|{{singlechart|Ireland2|9|song=Golden Years|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}\n|-\n|Netherlands \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|6\n|-\n|New Zealand (''[[New Zealand Listener|Listener]]'')<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |title=Flavour of New Zealand, 9 April 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923200644/http://www.flavourofnz.co.nz/index.php?qpageID=search%20rianz&qartistid=759#n_view_location |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|18\n|-\n|Sweden \n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|[[UK Singles Chart]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Official Charts Company |url=http://Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217061412/http://www.officialcharts.com/ |archive-date=17 February 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|8\n|-\n|US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]]<ref>''Joel Whitburn's Top Pop Singles 1955\u20131990'' \u2013 {{ISBN|0-89820-089-X}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|10\n|-\n|US [[Cash Box (magazine)|''Cash Box'']] Top 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |title=Cash Box Top 100 Singles, March 27, 1976 |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020004019/http://tropicalglen.com/Archives/70s_files/19760327.html |archive-date=20 October 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n|align=\"center\"|12\n|-\n|}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Year-end charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Chart (1976)\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"|Rank\n|-\n|Canada<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |title= Top Singles \u2013 Volume 26, No. 14 & 15, January 08 1977 |work= [[RPM (magazine)|RPM]] |publisher= [[Library and Archives Canada]] |accessdate= January 22, 2016 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20160610094136/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/rpm/028020-119.01-e.php?file_num=nlc008388.5173b&brws_s=&type=1&interval=20&PHPSESSID=u9874ano8k0c5b6bkp4r8qrbp3 |archive-date= 10 June 2016 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|144\n|-\n|US ''Billboard'' Hot 100<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |title=Musicoutfitters.com |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116082743/https://www.musicoutfitters.com/topsongs/1976.htm |archive-date=16 November 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|33\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==David Bowie vs KCRW==\n{{Infobox song\n| name       = Golden Years David Bowie vs KCRW\n| cover      = DavidBowie-GoldenYearsKCRW.jpg\n| alt        =\n| type       = single\n| artist     = [[David Bowie]]\n| album      =\n| released   = 2011\n| format     = [[CD single]]\n| recorded   =\n| studio     = \n| venue      =\n| genre      = \n| length     =\n| label      = [[Virgin Records|Virgin]]\n| writer     = \n| producer   = \n| prev_title = [[Rebel Never Gets Old]]\n| prev_year  = 2004\n| next_title = [[Where Are We Now?]]\n| next_year  = 2013\n}}\n\nAn updated single of \"Golden Years\" was released in 2011 to coincide with the re-release of ''Station to Station''.

It was released in November 1975 as the lead single of his tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' (1976). It was the first track completed during the album's sessions, a period when Bowie's [[cocaine]] addiction was at its peak. At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.\n\n==Composition and lyrics==\n\"Golden Years\" was the first track recorded for ''Station to Station'' in September 1975 at [[Cherokee Studios]] in Los Angeles.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} Regarding the recording, co-producer [[Harry Maslin]] recalled that the song was \"cut and finished very fast. We knew it was absolutely right within ten days. But the rest of the album took forever.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} At one stage it was slated to be the album's title track.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} Sources differ as to who the track was written for. According to authors [[Nicholas Pegg]], David Buckley and Christopher Sandford, the track was supposedly written for [[Elvis Presley]] to cover, who turned it down.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}}{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}} Bowie recalled that Presley had heard the demos and because both artists were signed to [[RCA Records]] at the time, Presley's manager [[Colonel Tom Parker]] thought that Bowie should write songs for Presley. Bowie stated that he had \"adored\" Presley and would have loved to work with him.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Although the artists' office contacted each other, nothing ever came to fruition. Presley sent a note to Bowie saying, \"All the best, and have a great tour\"; Bowie kept the note for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|pp=236\u2013237}} Bowie's first wife [[Angie Bowie]] later claimed that the song was written for her,{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} saying that he sang the track over the telephone to her, \"just the way, all those years before, he'd sung me [the ''[[Aladdin Sane]]'' track] \"[[The Prettiest Star]]\". It had a similar effect. I bought it.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=176}} According to Sandford, Ava Cherry also claimed to have been the inspiration for the song.{{sfn|Sandford|1998|p=146}}\n\nMusically, \"Golden Years\" is a [[funk]] and [[disco]] song.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}}<ref name=\"Mojica CoS\">{{cite web | url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | title=David Bowie \u2013 ''Station to Station'' [Special Edition] | website=[[Consequence of Sound]] | date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=1 June 2016 | last=Mojica |first= Frank | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709192925/http://consequenceofsound.net/2010/10/album-review-david-bowie-station-to-statio/ | archive-date=9 July 2016 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Erlewine AllMusic\">{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|title=''Station to Station'' \u2013 David Bowie |last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|website=[[AllMusic]]|access-date=4 August 2019|quote=...as well as the disco stylings of 'Golden Years.'|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190424115507/https://www.allmusic.com/album/station-to-station-mw0000098920|archive-date=24 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> As the lead single of ''Station to Station'', the song is noted as musically different than the rest of its parent album.<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\">{{cite web |last1=Thompson |first1=Dave |title=\"Golden Years\" \u2013 David Bowie |url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/golden-years-mt0054050615 |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=1 April 2020}}</ref> While ''Station to Station'' is commonly regarded as the musical bridge between the funk and [[Soul music|soul]] of ''[[Young Americans]]'' to the experimental sound of his [[Berlin Trilogy]],{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=78\u201380}} \"Golden Years\" is the only song on the album to showcase the similar funk sound of ''Young Americans'' compared to, in Pegg's words, \"the steelier musical landscape\" of ''Station to Station''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}}<ref name=\"Thompson AllMusic\" /> Pegg further comments that its American \"soul-pop\" roots are \"easily discernible\": he describes the main riff as \"owing a debt to\" the 1968 [[Cliff Nobles]] and Company song \"[[The Horse]]\" and the multi-tracked vocal refrain to 1958 single \"Happy Years\" by [[the Diamonds]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=175}} The song is in the key of B major and begins with a \"simple two-chord\" riff (F{{music|sharp}}\u2013E),{{sfn|Doggett|2012|pp=288\u2013289}} which Buckley believes hooks the listener in instantly.{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett calls the riff \"reminiscent\", albeit \"in very different circumstances\", to the [[Aladdin Sane (song)|title track]] of ''Aladdin Sane''.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=288}} According to Buckley, Bowie was looking to emulate something of the glitzy nostalgia of \"[[On Broadway (song)|On Broadway]]\", which he was playing on piano in the studio when he came up with \"Golden Years\".{{sfn|Buckley|2005|p=237}} Doggett writes: \"The magical ingredients were percussive: the rattling of sticks against the hi-hat cymbal from the start, the startling clack of woodblocks, the sudden drum fills.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}} These elements combined \"channel\" the spirit of Elvis Presley in the verses, with a \"haughtier, more strident tone\" in the chorus.{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=289}}\n\n==Release and aftermath==\n\"Golden Years\" was released on 21 November 1975 as the lead single to Bowie's tenth studio album ''[[Station to Station]]'' by [[RCA Records|RCA Victor]] (as RCA 2640/PB-10441) with the ''[[Young Americans]]'' track \"[[Can You Hear Me?

The original film score was written for the film by Hollywood composer [[Carter Burwell]]. One scene in the movie is a formal dance, which calls for courtly music based on Burwell's love theme to segue into David Bowie's song \"Golden Years\". It presented several challenges. First, the whole dance had been choreographed and filmed to an arbitrary tempo which begins at a slow courtly pace and speeds up and up until Bowie's song kicks in. Burwell had to match that tempo and the choreography after the fact and also find some credible path from a formal and restrained dance to a joyful '70s pop tune. They obtained Bowie's permission to pull tracks from his multitrack master of the song so they could mix these into Burwell's arrangement, helping to introduce his song before it has really begun. The end result is not on either of the CDs which were released (song or score soundtrack).
