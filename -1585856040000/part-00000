The act established a bipartisan board that consisted of nine voting members, eight of whom were to be appointed by the President for a three&ndash;year term. The ninth was the [[Secretary of State]] who would serve as an ''[[ex officio]]'' board member for the duration of his or her term as secretary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6203#fn002269|title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 6203 - Establishment of the Chief Executive Officer of the Broadcasting Board of Governors|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> At this point, BBG was considered a part of the [[U.S. Information Agency]].\n\nThe first voting members of the BBG, confirmed on August 11, 1995, were David W. Burke, [[Ted Kaufman]], [[Tom C. Korologos]], [[Bette Bao Lord]], [[Alberto J. Mora]], [[Cheryl Halpern]], [[Marc Nathanson]], and [[Carl Spielvogel]].<ref>https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-1995-07-19/html/CREC-1995-07-19-pt1-PgD883.htm Congressional Record of Senate Hearings</ref>\n\nOn October 1, 1999, the BBG became an independent agency through the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/broadcasting-board-of-governors |title=Broadcasting Board of Governors |publisher=}}</ref> Despite this change, the act maintained that the BBG would remain under the supervision of the Inspector General of the State Department and the Foreign Service.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/search|title=Legislative Search Results|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nSince the formation of BBG, U.S. international broadcasting expanded greatly, particularly in the post 9/11 foreign policy focus on the Middle East. In 2002, BBG launched [[Radio Sawa]], a 24/7 Arabic language radio network that broadcasts news and a mix of Western and Arabic music in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosawa.com/p/409.html|title=About Radio Sawa|publisher=}}</ref> According to the BBG website, Radio Sawa is \"one of the most popular radio stations\" where it\u2019s available on FM radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/broadcasters/mbn/|title=BBG Website|publisher=}}</ref> In 2004, Alhurra TV was created as a televised sister network to Radio Sawa and began broadcasting throughout the Middle East. Since its founding, it grew to establish programs like ''Al Youm'' (''Today'' in English), a daily three hour news program broadcast from five countries on three different continents,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alhurra.com/p/417.html|title=About Alhurra TV|publisher=}}</ref> and ''Musawat'' (''Equality'' in English), a program that focuses on women\u2019s issues and rights in the Arab world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.newamericamedia.org/news/view_article.html?article_id=9b393121ab0540099706d10f0d84ed0f |title=US-Sponsored Arab TV Station Spotlights Women Others Ignore |date=2010-04-15}}</ref>\n\nIn 2005, the Middle East Broadcasting Network, Inc (MBN) was initiated with the purpose of overseeing Arabic broadcasts. Under MBN, Arabic broadcasting had expanded, including the 2009 establishment of the groundbreaking program ''Al Youm'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sites.maxwell.syr.edu/luce/snow.html#_edn5|title=Case Studies - Religion, Media and International Affairs, SU|website=sites.maxwell.syr.edu}}</ref> expanding programming in Egypt, and covering the [[Iraq War]], the first Egyptian democratic elections, Arab viewpoints on U.S. elections, and more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/abouttheagency/history/|title=BBG|website=BBG}}</ref>\n\nIt was not only Arabic broadcasting that grew under BBG, other networks grew significantly as well. Voice of America worked with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to launch [[Radio Farda]], a Persian-language radio program targeting youth.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Radio_Farda|title=Radio Farda - SourceWatch|website=www.sourcewatch.org}}</ref> In 2006, VOA initiated TV Ashna, a one-hour televised news broadcast,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/voas-tv-ashna-signs-5-year-agreement-with-radio-television-afghanistan-123039623/178535.html |title=VOA's TV Ashna Signs 5 Year Agreement with Radio Television Afghanistan |date=2011-06-01}}</ref> and Radio Deewa, a daily radio program of sports, music, and local and international news.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.insidevoa.com/a/a-13-34-2009-01-08-deewa-111607089/178057.html|title=VOA Deewa Radio|website=VOA}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, the BBG changed its name to the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM).<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==Organization==\n[[File:John lansing ceo-sq.jpg|thumb|John F.

The act established a bipartisan board that consisted of nine voting members, eight of whom were to be appointed by the President for a three&ndash;year term. The ninth was the [[Secretary of State]] who would serve as an ''[[ex officio]]'' board member for the duration of his or her term as secretary.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/22/6203#fn002269|title=22 U.S. Code \u00a7 6203 - Establishment of the Chief Executive Officer of the Broadcasting Board of Governors|website=LII / Legal Information Institute}}</ref> At this point, BBG was considered a part of the [[U.S. Information Agency]].\n\nThe first voting members of the BBG, confirmed on August 11, 1995, were David W. Burke, [[Ted Kaufman]], [[Tom C. Korologos]], [[Bette Bao Lord]], [[Alberto J.

In 2002, BBG launched [[Radio Sawa]], a 24/7 Arabic language radio network that broadcasts news and a mix of Western and Arabic music in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosawa.com/p/409.html|title=About Radio Sawa|publisher=}}</ref> According to the BBG website, Radio Sawa is \"one of the most popular radio stations\" where it\u2019s available on FM radio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbg.gov/broadcasters/mbn/|title=BBG Website|publisher=}}</ref> In 2004, Alhurra TV was created as a televised sister network to Radio Sawa and began broadcasting throughout the Middle East.

He was named after his best-known owner, [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in [[Yemen]] and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age, he was exported, probably via Syria, to the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] of the [[bey of Tunis]]. From there he was given to [[Louis XV]] of France in 1730.<ref name=\"BHA\"/> It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Even so, he was not valued by his new French owner, and it is believed he was used as a [[carthorse]].{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}}\n\nThe horse was then imported from France by [[Edward Coke, Viscount Coke|Edward Coke]] and sent to his [[Stud farm|stud]] at [[Longford Hall, Derbyshire]], where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733.<ref name=Milner3>{{Citation|author=Milner, Mordaunt|title=The Godolphin Arabian: The Story of the Matchem Line |publisher=J.

He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin,<ref name=Milner3/> and placed at his stud at [[Babraham, Cambridgeshire]], until his death on Christmas Day 1753.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian was a [[bay (horse)|bay]] colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at {{hands|15}} and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest, which is noticeable from portraits of the horse.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}} Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=88}}\n\nThe veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner:\n\n{{quotation|There never was a horse\u2026 so well entitled to get racers as the Godolphin Arabian\u2026his shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than those of any horse yet seen. Behind the shoulders, there was but a very small space where the muscles of his loins rose exceedingly high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his quarters with greater strength and power than in any horse . . . yet seen.<ref>http://www.godolphin.com/about-us/our-heritage/the-godolphin-arabian/</ref>}}\n\n==Breed controversy==\n[[Image:Godolphin Arabian grave.jpg|right|thumb|The Godolphin Arabian was buried within the stable block at [[Wandlebury]] in 1753 at the age of 29.]]\nControversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], but [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]] of the [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]] concludes that it is most widely believed that he was [[Arabian horse|an Arabian]] or had primarily Arabian lineage.<ref>Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. ''The Authentic Arabian Horse,'' 3rd ed. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1979.</ref>\n\n\"Barb\" is a reference to his believed country of origin, [[Tunisia]], on the [[Barbary Coast]].  Whyte in the 1840 ''History of the British Turf'', refers to the horse as \"The Godolphin Barb, or ''as he has been improperly called'', the Godolphin Arabian\" (emphasis added){{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=64}} before further clarifying, \"he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs.\"{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}} However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian.<ref name=\"TBH1\"/> The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their [[phenotype]]s are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a [[Turkoman horse|Turkomen]], merely called an Arabian in order to raise the [[stud fee]].\n\nThe Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter [[George Stubbs]]. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a \"barb\". Both were of a similar bay colour, but the Barb had a [[star (horse)|star]]. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years.\n\nRecent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants' [[Y-DNA]] traces to the same general [[haplotype]] as the [[Darley Arabian]], though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Godolphin Arabian today.<ref name=\"Wallner 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Palmieri|first2=Nicola|last3=Vogl|first3=Claus|last4=Rigler|first4=Doris|last5=Bozlak|first5=Elif|last6=Druml|first6=Thomas|last7=Jagannathan|first7=Vidhya|last8=Leeb|first8=Tosso|last9=Fries|first9=Ruedi|last10=Tetens|first10=Jens|last11=Thaller|first11=Georg|last12=Metzger|first12=Julia|last13=Distl|first13=Ottmar|last14=Lindgren|first14=Gabriella|last15=Rubin|first15=Carl-Johan|last16=Andersson|first16=Leif|last17=Schaefer|first17=Robert|last18=McCue|first18=Molly|last19=Neuditschko|first19=Markus|last20=Rieder|first20=Stefan|last21=Schl\u00f6tterer|first21=Christian|last22=Brem|first22=Gottfried|title=Y Chromosome Uncovers the Recent Oriental Origin of Modern Stallions|journal=Current Biology|date=July 2017|volume=27|issue=13|pages=2029\u20132035.e5|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.086|pmid=28669755}}</ref>   This group may have been of [[Turkoman horse]] or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype.<ref name=\"Wallner 2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Vogl|first2=Claus|last3=Shukla|first3=Priyank|last4=Burgstaller|first4=Joerg P.|last5=Druml|first5=Thomas|last6=Brem|first6=Gottfried|last7=Ellegren|first7=Hans|title=Identification of Genetic Variation on the Horse Y Chromosome and the Tracing of Male Founder Lineages in Modern Breeds|journal=PLOS ONE|date=3 April 2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e60015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060015|pmc=3616054|pmid=23573227}}</ref>\n\n==Breeding career==\n[[File:Lord Godolphin's Lath by James Seymour.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]]'s [[Lath (horse)|Lath]] (by [[James Seymour]])]]\nThe Godolphin Arabian was the [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1738, 1745 and 1747.\n\nOriginally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as '[[Horse_breeding#Live_cover|teaser]]', a stallion used to gauge the mare's receptiveness. This changed when Lady Roxana, a [[mare]] brought to the stud specifically to be bred to a stallion called [[Hobgoblin (horse)|Hobgoblin]], rejected her intended mate, and so the Godolphin Arabian was allowed to [[Mating|cover]] her instead.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}\n\nThe result of this mating was [[Lath (horse)|Lath]], the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen's Plate nine times out of nine at the [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket races]]. The second colt from this pair was [[Cade (horse)|Cade]], and the third was [[Regulus (horse)|Regulus]].<ref name=\"SireLine\"/> All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high-crested [[horse conformation|conformation]]. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian's prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin's prize stallion, bred to England's finest mares.\n\nThe American connection began with the filly [[Selima (horse)|Selima]] (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by [[Benjamin Tasker Jr.]] of the [[Province of Maryland]] in [[Colonial America]], carried to the new world, and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 [[pistole]]s at [[Gloucester, Virginia]] which marked \"the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].\" After this, she became a successful broodmare at the [[Belair Stud]] in [[Collington, Maryland]].<ref name=Deubler>{{Citation | last = Deubler | first = Cindy | author-link =  | title = Belair Museums stand in path of \"Progress\" | journal = Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred | pages =  22\u201327 | date = May 2002  }}</ref><ref name=remly>{{Citation | last = Remly | first = Lynn L. | title = Art Among the Oats: Belair Stable Museum| journal = Equine Images | volume = 2000 | issue = 81 | pages = 5\u201356 | date = Fall 2002  }}</ref>\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian died on the [[Gog Magog Hills]], [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1753, aged around 29.  The horse's grave in the stable block of [[Wandlebury Hill|Wandlebury House]] can be visited.  When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAlthough today the majority of Thoroughbred horses\u2019 sire lines trace to the [[Darley Arabian]], several famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include [[Seabiscuit]], [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]], and [[War Admiral]]. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of [[Relaunch (horse)|Relaunch]] and his son Cee's Tizzy through dual [[Breeders' Cup Classic]] winner [[Tiznow]].\n\nIn Europe, his influence survives mainly through the [[2,000 Guineas]] winner [[Known Fact]], and his son, the champion miler [[Warning (horse)|Warning]]. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as [[Diktat (horse)|Diktat]] ([[Haydock Sprint Cup]]), [[Avonbridge (horse)|Avonbridge]] and [[Dream Ahead]].  The [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since [[Santa Claus (horse)|Santa Claus]] in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian.<ref name=\"BHA\"/>\n\nThe major Thoroughbred sire [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of [[Regulus (horse)|Regulus]] and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian.<ref name=\"Pedigree\"/>  This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the \"middle\" of pedigrees (as opposed to direct sire lines).\n\n==In fiction==\n''[[King of the Wind]]'' (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author [[Marguerite Henry]]. She wrote many [[Pony book|books about horses for children]], and perhaps is best known for ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' and its sequels. She won the [[Newbery Medal]]<!--only; Misty was a runner-up in 1946--> for ''King of the Wind'', recognizing it as the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\".<ref name=newbery>\n[http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.cfm \"Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922\u2013Present\"].

He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King [[Louis XV of France]] but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of [[Holkham Hall]], older brother of the 1st [[Earl of Leicester]] 5th

He was named after his best-known owner, [[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin]].\n\n==Origins==\nThe Godolphin Arabian was foaled about 1724 in [[Yemen]] and moved several times before reaching England. At some early age, he was exported, probably via Syria, to the [[Stud (animal)|stud]] of the [[bey of Tunis]]. From there he was given to [[Louis XV]] of France in 1730.<ref name=\"BHA\"/> It is believed he was a present from monarch to monarch. Even so, he was not valued by his new French owner, and it is believed he was used as a [[carthorse]].{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}}\n\nThe horse was then imported from France by [[Edward Coke, Viscount Coke|Edward Coke]] and sent to his [[Stud farm|stud]] at [[Longford Hall, Derbyshire]], where he remained until the death of his owner in 1733.<ref name=Milner3>{{Citation|author=Milner, Mordaunt|title=The Godolphin Arabian: The Story of the Matchem Line |publisher=J.

He was bought by the 2nd Earl of Godolphin,<ref name=Milner3/> and placed at his stud at [[Babraham, Cambridgeshire]], until his death on Christmas Day 1753.\n\n==Appearance==\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian was a [[bay (horse)|bay]] colour with some white on the off heel behind. He stood at {{hands|15}} and was distinguished by an unnaturally high crest, which is noticeable from portraits of the horse.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}} Most of his immediate offspring were also bay.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=88}}\n\nThe veterinary surgeon Osmer described the Godolphin Arabian in the following manner:\n\n{{quotation|There never was a horse\u2026 so well entitled to get racers as the Godolphin Arabian\u2026his shoulders were deeper, and lay farther into his back, than those of any horse yet seen. Behind the shoulders, there was but a very small space where the muscles of his loins rose exceedingly high, broad, and expanded, which were inserted into his quarters with greater strength and power than in any horse . . . yet seen.<ref>http://www.godolphin.com/about-us/our-heritage/the-godolphin-arabian/</ref>}}\n\n==Breed controversy==\n[[Image:Godolphin Arabian grave.jpg|right|thumb|The Godolphin Arabian was buried within the stable block at [[Wandlebury]] in 1753 at the age of 29.]]\nControversy exists over the ancestry of this horse; some writers referred to him as a [[Barb (horse)|Barb]], but [[Judith Blunt-Lytton, 16th Baroness Wentworth]] of the [[Crabbet Arabian Stud]] concludes that it is most widely believed that he was [[Arabian horse|an Arabian]] or had primarily Arabian lineage.<ref>Wentworth, Judith Anne Dorothea Blunt-Lytton. ''The Authentic Arabian Horse,'' 3rd ed. George Allen & Unwin Ltd., 1979.</ref>\n\n\"Barb\" is a reference to his believed country of origin, [[Tunisia]], on the [[Barbary Coast]].  Whyte in the 1840 ''History of the British Turf'', refers to the horse as \"The Godolphin Barb, or ''as he has been improperly called'', the Godolphin Arabian\" (emphasis added){{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=64}} before further clarifying, \"he was long considered an Arabian, although his points resembled more those of the highest breed of Barbs.\"{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=84}} However, portraits showing a horse with a high-carried tail and dished profile, features that differentiate the two types, lead modern experts to believe he was more likely an Arabian.<ref name=\"TBH1\"/> The confusion is understandable, but while the breeds have some characteristics in common and are distantly related, their [[phenotype]]s are quite distinct. There was also an argument raised that he was actually a [[Turkoman horse|Turkomen]], merely called an Arabian in order to raise the [[stud fee]].\n\nThe Earl of Godolphin referred to the horse as an Arabian, and he was described as such by the painter [[George Stubbs]]. Lord Godolphin later bought a second stallion in 1750. This one he clearly called a \"barb\". Both were of a similar bay colour, but the Barb had a [[star (horse)|star]]. Godolphin later bought a grey Barb, which has also caused some confusion over the years.\n\nRecent DNA studies disprove the theory that he was a Barb, as his descendants' [[Y-DNA]] traces to the same general [[haplotype]] as the [[Darley Arabian]], though to different sub-groups and there are relatively few male-line descendants of the Godolphin Arabian today.<ref name=\"Wallner 2017\">{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Palmieri|first2=Nicola|last3=Vogl|first3=Claus|last4=Rigler|first4=Doris|last5=Bozlak|first5=Elif|last6=Druml|first6=Thomas|last7=Jagannathan|first7=Vidhya|last8=Leeb|first8=Tosso|last9=Fries|first9=Ruedi|last10=Tetens|first10=Jens|last11=Thaller|first11=Georg|last12=Metzger|first12=Julia|last13=Distl|first13=Ottmar|last14=Lindgren|first14=Gabriella|last15=Rubin|first15=Carl-Johan|last16=Andersson|first16=Leif|last17=Schaefer|first17=Robert|last18=McCue|first18=Molly|last19=Neuditschko|first19=Markus|last20=Rieder|first20=Stefan|last21=Schl\u00f6tterer|first21=Christian|last22=Brem|first22=Gottfried|title=Y Chromosome Uncovers the Recent Oriental Origin of Modern Stallions|journal=Current Biology|date=July 2017|volume=27|issue=13|pages=2029\u20132035.e5|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.05.086|pmid=28669755}}</ref>   This group may have been of [[Turkoman horse]] or Arabian origins, as modern horses of both breeds have been linked to this haplotype.<ref name=\"Wallner 2013\">{{cite journal|last1=Wallner|first1=Barbara|last2=Vogl|first2=Claus|last3=Shukla|first3=Priyank|last4=Burgstaller|first4=Joerg P.|last5=Druml|first5=Thomas|last6=Brem|first6=Gottfried|last7=Ellegren|first7=Hans|title=Identification of Genetic Variation on the Horse Y Chromosome and the Tracing of Male Founder Lineages in Modern Breeds|journal=PLOS ONE|date=3 April 2013|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e60015|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0060015|pmc=3616054|pmid=23573227}}</ref>\n\n==Breeding career==\n[[File:Lord Godolphin's Lath by James Seymour.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Godolphin, 2nd Earl of Godolphin|Lord Godolphin]]'s [[Lath (horse)|Lath]] (by [[James Seymour]])]]\nThe Godolphin Arabian was the [[leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland]] in 1738, 1745 and 1747.\n\nOriginally, this small stallion was considered inferior to the larger European horses of the time and was not meant to be put to stud. Instead he was used as '[[Horse_breeding#Live_cover|teaser]]', a stallion used to gauge the mare's receptiveness. This changed when Lady Roxana, a [[mare]] brought to the stud specifically to be bred to a stallion called [[Hobgoblin (horse)|Hobgoblin]], rejected her intended mate, and so the Godolphin Arabian was allowed to [[Mating|cover]] her instead.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}\n\nThe result of this mating was [[Lath (horse)|Lath]], the first of his offspring, who went on to win the Queen's Plate nine times out of nine at the [[Newmarket Racecourse|Newmarket races]]. The second colt from this pair was [[Cade (horse)|Cade]], and the third was [[Regulus (horse)|Regulus]].<ref name=\"SireLine\"/> All three were the same gold-touched bay as their sire, with the same small build and high-crested [[horse conformation|conformation]]. All were exceptionally fast on the track, and went on to sire many foals themselves. This was the start of the Godolphin Arabian's prowess as a racing stud, and he spent the rest of his days as the Earl of Godolphin's prize stallion, bred to England's finest mares.\n\nThe American connection began with the filly [[Selima (horse)|Selima]] (born in 1745 out of Shireborn). She was purchased by [[Benjamin Tasker Jr.]] of the [[Province of Maryland]] in [[Colonial America]], carried to the new world, and raced between 1750 and 1753. She won the biggest prize of the era, 2,500 [[pistole]]s at [[Gloucester, Virginia]] which marked \"the beginning of the remarkable racing contests between the rival colonies of Maryland and [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]].\" After this, she became a successful broodmare at the [[Belair Stud]] in [[Collington, Maryland]].<ref name=Deubler>{{Citation | last = Deubler | first = Cindy | author-link =  | title = Belair Museums stand in path of \"Progress\" | journal = Mid-Atlantic Thoroughbred | pages =  22\u201327 | date = May 2002  }}</ref><ref name=remly>{{Citation | last = Remly | first = Lynn L. | title = Art Among the Oats: Belair Stable Museum| journal = Equine Images | volume = 2000 | issue = 81 | pages = 5\u201356 | date = Fall 2002  }}</ref>\n\nThe Godolphin Arabian died on the [[Gog Magog Hills]], [[Cambridgeshire]] in 1753, aged around 29.  The horse's grave in the stable block of [[Wandlebury Hill|Wandlebury House]] can be visited.  When he was interred, the occasion was marked with ale and cake.{{sfn|Whyte|1840|p=85}}\n\n==Legacy==\nAlthough today the majority of Thoroughbred horses\u2019 sire lines trace to the [[Darley Arabian]], several famous North American horses of the past trace their sire line back to the Godolphin Arabian. These include [[Seabiscuit]], [[Man o' War (horse)|Man o' War]], and [[War Admiral]]. Today, the sire line is primarily supported by descendants of [[Relaunch (horse)|Relaunch]] and his son Cee's Tizzy through dual [[Breeders' Cup Classic]] winner [[Tiznow]].\n\nIn Europe, his influence survives mainly through the [[2,000 Guineas]] winner [[Known Fact]], and his son, the champion miler [[Warning (horse)|Warning]]. This line has produced outstanding sprinters such as [[Diktat (horse)|Diktat]] ([[Haydock Sprint Cup]]), [[Avonbridge (horse)|Avonbridge]] and [[Dream Ahead]].  The [[Epsom Derby|Derby]] has not been won by a sire line descendant of the Godolphin Arabian since [[Santa Claus (horse)|Santa Claus]] in 1964 and is nowadays dominated by descendants of the Darley Arabian.<ref name=\"BHA\"/>\n\nThe major Thoroughbred sire [[Eclipse (horse)|Eclipse]] traces in his sire line to the Darley Arabian, but his dam was a daughter of [[Regulus (horse)|Regulus]] and thus also traces to the Godolphin Arabian.<ref name=\"Pedigree\"/>  This pattern continues to be seen today, with the Godolphin Arabian more heavily represented in dam lines and in the \"middle\" of pedigrees (as opposed to direct sire lines).\n\n==In fiction==\n''[[King of the Wind]]'' (Chicago: Rand McNally, 1948) is a fictional biography of the Godolphin Arabian by American author [[Marguerite Henry]]. She wrote many [[Pony book|books about horses for children]], and perhaps is best known for ''[[Misty of Chincoteague]]'' and its sequels. She won the [[Newbery Medal]]<!--only; Misty was a runner-up in 1946--> for ''King of the Wind'', recognizing it as the year's \"most distinguished contribution to American literature for children\".<ref name=newbery>\n[http://ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/alsc/awardsgrants/bookmedia/newberymedal/newberyhonors/newberymedal.cfm \"Newbery Medal and Honor Books, 1922\u2013Present\"].

He came to Europe as a diplomatic gift to King [[Louis XV of France]] but, due to his poor condition on arrival and relatively small size, was given to the cook as a cart horse. He was soon sold to a woodcarter in Paris, where he was treated poorly and then purchased by the Quaker Edward Coke of [[Holkham Hall]], older brother of the 1st [[Earl of Leicester]] 5th

Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>\n\nClimatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\nBy 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\n[[File:Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Five kings of Midian slain by Israel (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\nBy the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible.

Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.\n\nThe government has also made an attempt at \"[[Saudization|Saudizing]]\" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.<ref name=house-161>[[#House|House]], p. 161: \"Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail.

Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]\n\nSerious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.\nAs a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.\nThe country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.\nIn addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some 30 countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.\nThe Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia.

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name=\"GWI April 2011\">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}\n\nAlthough most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector.

The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.\n* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u062a\u0631\u0647}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth (\"scarf\"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].\n* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0644}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.\n* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|\u062b\u0648\u0628}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].\n* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0634\u062a}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.\n* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0629}}) is a woman's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq\u0101b and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n{{Main|Saudi Arabian art|Cinema of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Theatre in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name=\"Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics\">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters.

With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rab\u0101bah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the \u1e6dabl (drum) and the \u1e6d\u0101r (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the \u02bfar\u1e0dah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines.

Initial analysis of the discovery concluded that the eastern province of Saudi Arabia was the homeland of the earliest settlers of Mesopotamia, and by extension, the likely origin of the Sumerians. However, experts such as Joan Oates had the opportunity to see the Ubaid period sherds in eastern Arabia and consequently conclude that the sherds dates to the last two phases of Ubaid period (period three and four), while handful examples could be classified roughly as either Ubaid 3 or Ubaid 2. Thus the idea that colonists from Saudi Arabia had emigrated to southern Mesopotamia and founded the region's first sedentary culture was abandoned.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 175.</ref>\n\nClimatic change and the onset of aridity may have brought about the end of this phase of settlement, as little archaeological evidence exists from the succeeding millennium.<ref>Roads of Arabia p. 176.</ref> The settlement of the region picks up again in the period of [[Dilmun]] in the early 3rd millennium. Known records from Uruk refer to a place called [[Dilmun]], associated in several occasions with copper and in later period it was a source of imported woods in southern Mesopotamia. A number of scholars have suggested that Dilmun originally designated the eastern province of Saudi Arabia, notably linked with the major Dilmunite settlements of Umm an-Nussi and Umm ar-Ramadh in the interior and Tarout on the coast. It is likely that [[Tarout Island]] was the main port and the capital of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/> Mesopotamian inscribed clay tablets suggests that, in the early period of Dilmun, a form of hierarchical organized political structure existed. In 1966 an earthworks in Tarout exposed ancient burial field that yielded a large impressive statue dating to the Dilmunite period (mid 3rd millennium BC). The statue was locally made under strong Mesopotamian influence on the artistic principle of Dilmun.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\nBy 2200 BC, the centre of Dilmun shifted for unknown reasons from Tarout and the Saudi Arabian mainland to the island of [[Bahrain]], and a major developed settlements appeared in Bahrain for the first time, where a laborious temple complex and thousands of burial mounds that dates to this period were discovered.<ref name=\"Roads of Arabia p. 180\"/>\n\n[[File:Figures Five Kings of Midian Slain by Israel.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Five kings of Midian slain by Israel (illustration from the 1728 ''Figures de la Bible'')]]\nBy the Late Bronze Age, a historically recorded people and land (Median and the Medianites) in the north-western portion of Saudi Arabia are well-documented in the Bible.

Saudi Arabia maintains a list of sectors in which foreign investment is prohibited, but the government plans to open some closed sectors such as telecommunications, insurance, and power transmission/distribution over time.\n\nThe government has also made an attempt at \"[[Saudization|Saudizing]]\" the economy, replacing foreign workers with Saudi nationals with limited success.<ref name=house-161>[[#House|House]], p. 161: \"Over the past decade, the government has announced one plan after another to 'Saudize' the economy, but to no avail.

Al-Hasa has over 30 million palm trees which produce over 100 thousand tons of dates every year.]]\n\nSerious large-scale agricultural development began in the 1970s. The government launched an extensive program to promote modern farming technology; to establish rural roads, irrigation networks and storage and export facilities; and to encourage agricultural research and training institutions.\nAs a result, there has been a phenomenal growth in the production of all basic foods. Saudi Arabia is now completely self-sufficient in a number of foodstuffs, including meat, milk and eggs.\nThe country exports wheat, dates, dairy products, eggs, fish, poultry, fruits, vegetables and flowers to markets around the world. Dates, once a staple of the Saudi diet, are now mainly grown for global humanitarian aid.\nIn addition, Saudi farmers grow substantial amounts of other grains such as barley, sorghum and millet. As of 2016, in the interest of preserving precious water resources, domestic production of wheat has ended.<ref>{{cite web |title=Saudi Arabia ends domestic wheat production program|url = https://www.world-grain.com/articles/6275-saudi-arabia-ends-domestic-wheat-production-program|accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom likewise has some of the most modern and largest dairy farms in the Middle East. Milk production boasts a remarkably productive annual rate of 1,800 gallons per cow, one of the highest in the world. The local dairy manufacturing company [[Almarai]] is the largest vertically integrated dairy company in the Middle East.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|title=Innovation Drive Al-Marai|publisher=Elopak|accessdate=3 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113093305/http://www.elopak.com/site/cms.jsp?node=11449|archivedate=13 November 2008|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Kingdom's most dramatic agricultural accomplishment, noted worldwide, was its rapid transformation from importer to exporter of wheat. In 1978, the country built its first grain silos. By 1984, it had become self-sufficient in wheat. Shortly thereafter, Saudi Arabia began exporting wheat to some 30 countries, including China and the former Soviet Union, and in the major producing areas of Tabuk, Hail and Qasim, average yields reached 3.6 tons per acre.\nThe Kingdom has, however, stepped up fruit and vegetable production, by improving both agricultural techniques and the roads that link farmers with urban consumers. Saudi Arabia is a major exporter of fruits and vegetables to its neighbors. Among its most productive crops are watermelon, grapes, citrus fruits, onions, squash and tomatoes. At Jizan in the country's well-watered southwest, the Al-Hikmah Research Station is producing tropical fruits including pineapples, paw-paws, bananas, mangoes and guavas.<ref>{{cite web |title=Agriculture & Water|url = https://www.saudiembassy.net/agriculture-water |accessdate=8 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe [[olive]] tree is indigenous to Saudi Arabia.

About 50% of drinking water comes from desalination, 40% from the mining of non-renewable groundwater and 10% from surface water, especially in the mountainous southwest of the country. The capital [[Riyadh]], located in the heart of the country, is supplied with desalinated water pumped from the [[Persian Gulf]] over a distance of 467&nbsp;km. Given the substantial [[Economy of Saudi Arabia|oil wealth]], water is provided almost for free. Despite improvements service quality remains poor. For example, in Riyadh water was available only once every 2.5 days in 2011, while in Jeddah it is available only every 9 days.<ref name=\"GWI April 2011\">Global Water Intelligence: Becoming a world-class water utility, April 2011</ref> Institutional capacity and [[governance]] in the sector are weak, reflecting general characteristics of the public sector in Saudi Arabia. Since 2000, the government has increasingly relied on the private sector to operate water and sanitation infrastructure, beginning with desalination and wastewater treatment plants. Since 2008, the operation of urban water distribution systems is being gradually delegated to private companies as well.\n\n===Tourism===\n{{Main|Tourism in Saudi Arabia}}\n\nAlthough most tourism in Saudi Arabia still largely involves religious pilgrimages, there is growth in the leisure tourism sector.

The predominantly loose and flowing, but covering, garments are suited to Saudi Arabia's [[desert]] climate. Traditionally, men usually wear a white ankle length garment woven from wool or cotton (known as a [[thawb]]), with a [[keffiyeh]] (a large checkered square of cotton held in place by an [[agal]]) or a [[Keffiyeh|ghutra]] (a plain white square made of finer cotton, also held in place by an [[agal]]) worn on the head. For rare chilly days, Saudi men wear a [[camel]]-hair cloak ([[bisht (clothing)|bisht]]) over the top. In public women are required to wear a black [[abaya]] or other black clothing that covers everything under the neck with the exception of their hands and feet, although most women cover their head in respect for their religion. This requirement applies to non-Muslim women too and failure to abide can result in police action, particularly in more conservative areas of the country. Women's clothes are often decorated with tribal motifs, coins, sequins, metallic thread, and appliques.\n* [[Ghutrah]] ({{lang-ar|\u063a\u062a\u0631\u0647}}) is a traditional [[headdress]] typically worn by [[Arab]] men. It is made of a square of cloth (\"scarf\"), usually cotton, folded and wrapped in various styles around the head. It is commonly worn in areas with an [[arid]] climate, to provide protection from direct [[sun exposure]], and also protection of the mouth and eyes from blown dust and [[sand]].\n* [[Agal]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0642\u0627\u0644}}) is an item of [[Arab]] headgear constructed of cord which is fastened around the [[Ghutrah]] to hold it in place. The ''agal'' is usually black in colour.\n* [[Thawb]] ({{lang-ar|\u062b\u0648\u0628}}) is the standard Arabic word for garment. It is ankle-length, usually with long sleeves, similar to a [[robe]].\n* [[Bisht (clothing)|Bisht]] ({{lang-ar|\u0628\u0634\u062a}}) is a traditional Arabic men's [[cloak]] usually only worn for prestige on special occasions such as weddings.\n* [[Abaya]] ({{lang-ar|\u0639\u0628\u0627\u0626\u0629}}) is a woman's garment. It is a black cloak which loosely covers the entire body except the head. Some women choose to cover their faces with a niq\u0101b and some do not. Some abayas cover the top of the head as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |title=Traditional dress of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia |date=29 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018115808/http://www.thelovelyplanet.net/traditional-dress-of-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia/ |archivedate=18 October 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Arts and entertainment===\n{{Main|Saudi Arabian art|Cinema of Saudi Arabia|Music of Saudi Arabia|Theatre in Saudi Arabia}}\n[[File:King Abdullah in his youth.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|King Abdullah practising [[falconry]], a traditional pursuit in the country]]\n\nDuring the 1970s, cinemas were numerous in the Kingdom although they were seen as contrary to Wahhabi norms.<ref name=\"Return of cinema in Saudi Arabia provokes critics\">[http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/01/05/return-of-cinema-in-saudi-arabia-provokes-critics/3473/ World Focus]. 5 January 2009</ref> During the [[Islamic revival]] movement in the 1980s, and as a political response to an increase in [[Islamist]] activism including the 1979 [[Grand Mosque Seizure|seizure of the Grand Mosque in Mecca]], the government closed all cinemas and theaters.

With the advent of oil-wealth in the 20th century came exposure to outside influences, such as Western housing styles, furnishings, and clothes. Music and dance have always been part of Saudi life. Traditional music is generally associated with poetry and is sung collectively. Instruments include the rab\u0101bah, an instrument not unlike a three-string fiddle, and various types of percussion instruments, such as the \u1e6dabl (drum) and the \u1e6d\u0101r (tambourine). Of the native dances, the most popular is a martial line dance known as the \u02bfar\u1e0dah, which includes lines of men, frequently armed with swords or rifles, dancing to the beat of drums and tambourines.
