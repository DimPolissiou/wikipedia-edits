The occupation, officially known known as '''[[bail]] agency enforcer''', '''bail enforcement agent''', '''bail agent''', '''recovery agent''', '''bail recovery agent''', or '''fugitive recovery agent''', has traditionally operated outside the legal constraints that govern [[police officer]]s and other agents of the state. This is because a bail agreement between a [[defendant]] and a [[bail bondsman]] is essentially a [[civil contract]] that is incumbent upon the bondsman to enforce. As a result, bounty hunters hired by a bail bondsman enjoy significant legal privileges, such as forcibly enter a defendant's home without [[probable cause]] or a [[search warrant]]; however, since they are not police officers, bounty hunters are legally exposed to [[Legal liability|liabilities]] that normally exempt agents of the state\u2014as these immunities enable police to perform their designated functions effectively without fear\u2014and everyday citizens approached by a bounty hunter are neither required to answer their questions nor allowed to be detained. Bounty hunters are typically [[independent contractor]]s paid a commission of the total bail amount that is owed by the fugitive; they provide their own [[Professional liability insurance|PLI]] and only get paid if they are able to find the \"[[Skiptrace|skip]]\" and bring them in.\n\nBounty hunting is a vestige of [[Common law]] which was created during the Middle Ages. Bounty hunters primarily draw their legal [[imprimatur]] from an 1872 Supreme Court decision, [[Taylor v. Taintor]]. The practice historically existed in many parts of the world; however, as of the [[21st century]], it is found almost exclusively in most of the [[United States]], [[India]], and the [[Philippines]], as the practice is illegal under the laws of most other countries. State laws vary widely as to the legality of the practice; Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds, while Wyoming offer few (if any) regulations governing the practice.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/29bail.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1 ''Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S.''], Adam Liptak, 29Jan2008, The New York Times</ref>\n[[File:Capitao-mato.jpg|thumb|220px|The Afro-Brazilian bounty hunter looking for escaped slaves in an 1823 portrait by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]].]]\n\n==United States==\n===History===\n====Before the Civil War====\n{{see|Slave catchers}}\n====The Old West====\nIn 1873, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that bounty hunters were a part of the U.S. law enforcement system with a decision in ''[[Taylor v.

Their domain is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up to his discharge; and if it cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another state; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of due process. None is needed. It is likened to the arrest by the [[sheriff]] of an escaped prisoner.}}\n\n====Modern times====\nIn modern times, bounty hunters are known as bail enforcement agent or fugitive recovery agents ([[bail bondsman|bail bondsmen]]), and carry out arrests mostly of those who have skipped bail.<ref name=\"insi_Bail\">{{cite web| title = Bail Enforcement Agent| website=Insidejobs.com| accessdate = 2015-07-08| url = http://www.insidejobs.com/careers/bail-enforcement-agent}}</ref><ref name=\"dos._NYSD\">{{cite web| title = NYS Division of Licensing Services| website=Dos.ny.gov| accessdate = 2015-07-08| url = http://www.dos.ny.gov/licensing/bailagent/bailagent.html}}</ref> The term \"bounty hunting\" is neither often used nor liked by many in the profession due to its historical associations.{{citation needed|reason=|date=March 2016}}\n\nBounty hunters are sometimes misleadingly called ''[[skiptracer]]s'', where ''skiptracing'' is searching for an individual through less direct methods than active pursuit and apprehension.\n\nWhen undertaking arrest warrants, agents may wear [[Bulletproof vest|bullet-resistant vests]], badges, and other clothing bearing the inscription \"bail enforcement agent\" or similar titles.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-yN7LJcxZA |work=Secrets Of A Modern Day Bounty Hunter|title=Tools Of The Trade |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2016-12-20}}</ref> Many agents also use [[two-way radio]]s to communicate with each other.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} Many agents arm themselves with firearms; or sometimes with less lethal weapons, such as [[taser]]s,<ref name=\"youtube.com\" /> [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], [[tear gas]] ([[CS gas]], [[pepper spray]])<ref name=\"youtube.com\" /> or [[pepper-spray projectile|pepper spray projectiles]].{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn the United States, the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents is the professional association representing this industry.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fugitive-recovery.org/media.htm|title=Media Inquiries|last=|first=|date=September 30, 2016|website=Fugitive-recovery.org|access-date=September 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Practice===\nMost bounty hunters in the United States are employed by [[Bail bondsman|bail bondsmen]]: the bounty hunter is usually paid about 10% of the total [[bail]] amount, but this commission can vary on an individual, case-by-case basis; usually depending upon the difficulty level of the assignment and the approach used to exonerate the bail bond. If the fugitive eludes bail, the bondsman, not the bounty hunter, is responsible for 100% of the total bail amount. This is a way of ensuring clients arrive at trial. As of 2003, bounty hunters claimed to catch 31,500 bail jumpers per year, about 90% of people who jump bail.<ref name=\"BBC20070922\">{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3003886.stm|title=Above the law: US bounty hunters|first=Rachel|last=Clarke|date=19 June 2003|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2007-09-22}}</ref>\n\nBounty hunters have varying levels of authority in their duties with regard to their targets depending on which states they operate in.

Connecticut has strict standards which require bail enforcement agents to pass an extensive background check and, while engaging in fugitive recovery operations, wear a uniform, notify the local police barrack, wear a badge, and only carry licensed and approved firearms, including handguns and long guns which are permitted.

The occupation, officially known known as '''[[bail]] agency enforcer''', '''bail enforcement agent''', '''bail agent''', '''recovery agent''', '''bail recovery agent''', or '''fugitive recovery agent''', has traditionally operated outside the legal constraints that govern [[police officer]]s and other agents of the state. This is because a bail agreement between a [[defendant]] and a [[bail bondsman]] is essentially a [[civil contract]] that is incumbent upon the bondsman to enforce. As a result, bounty hunters hired by a bail bondsman enjoy significant legal privileges, such as forcibly enter a defendant's home without [[probable cause]] or a [[search warrant]]; however, since they are not police officers, bounty hunters are legally exposed to [[Legal liability|liabilities]] that normally exempt agents of the state\u2014as these immunities enable police to perform their designated functions effectively without fear\u2014and everyday citizens approached by a bounty hunter are neither required to answer their questions nor allowed to be detained. Bounty hunters are typically [[independent contractor]]s paid a commission of the total bail amount that is owed by the fugitive; they provide their own [[Professional liability insurance|PLI]] and only get paid if they are able to find the \"[[Skiptrace|skip]]\" and bring them in.\n\nBounty hunting is a vestige of [[British common law]] of the Middle Ages. Bounty hunters primarily draw their legal [[imprimatur]] from an 1872 Supreme Court decision, [[Taylor v. Taintor]]. The practice historically existed in many parts of the world; however, as of the [[21st century]], it is found almost exclusively in most of the [[United States]], [[India]], and the [[Philippines]], as the practice is illegal under the laws of most other countries. State laws vary widely as to the legality of the practice; Illinois, Kentucky, Oregon and Wisconsin have outlawed commercial bail bonds, while Wyoming offer few (if any) regulations governing the practice.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/us/29bail.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1 ''Illegal Globally, Bail for Profit Remains in U.S.''], Adam Liptak, 29Jan2008, The New York Times</ref>\n[[File:Capitao-mato.jpg|thumb|220px|The Afro-Brazilian bounty hunter looking for escaped slaves in an 1823 portrait by [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]].]]\n\n==United States==\n===History===\n====Before the Civil War====\n{{see|Slave catchers}}\n====The Old West====\nIn 1873, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that bounty hunters were a part of the U.S. law enforcement system with a decision in ''[[Taylor v.

Their domain is a continuance of the original imprisonment. Whenever they choose to do so, they may seize him and deliver him up to his discharge; and if it cannot be done at once, they may imprison him until it can be done. They may exercise their rights in person or by agent. They may pursue him into another state; may arrest him on the Sabbath; and if necessary, may break and enter his house for that purpose. The seizure is not made by virtue of due process. None is needed.

If the fugitive eludes bail, the bondsman, not the bounty hunter, is responsible for 100% of the total bail amount. This is a way of ensuring clients arrive at trial.

The brief passages have the kazoo chorus sliding up and down the scale as the \"cheering\" rises and falls.\n\nIn [[Frank Loesser]]'s score for the 1961 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] musical comedy ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'', several kazoos produce the effect of electric razors used in the executive washroom during a dance reprise of the ballad ''I Believe in You''.\n\nIn 1961 [[Del Shannon|Del Shannon's]] \"So Long Baby\" issued on Big Top Records featured a kazoo on the instrumental break.

But there is much more to the Jewish state than missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that is too often overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel's parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, and a pair of dads raising their kids.

I'm ready to shout about it. Here's what helped convince me: Dr. Robert Grant of UCSF, the researcher who led the multinational study on PrEP, was quoted at an AIDS conference as saying that 'No one in iPrEx [the PrEP study] acquired HIV infection with a drug level that would have been expected with daily dosing.' Was this really possible?

Lucas wrote the following in his column: \"Despite all the attempted distractions, the focus must remain on the simple message in the new study: If you take PrEP, you will not get HIV. Period. It is time to wake up, stop the endless debating, and take action. The war against HIV rages on, and when scientists actually win a battle, we must avail ourselves of the powerful weapon they have developed.\"<ref>Op-Ed: PrEP Works, So Stop The Backlash (Out.com) http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2015/9/12/op-ed-prep-works-so-drop-backlash</ref> On February 24, 2016, PrEP was formally approved in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/israel-approves-prep-prime-minister-addresses-lgbt-rights-at-knesset/02/2016/|title=Israel Approves PrEP, Prime Minister Addresses LGBT Rights At Knesset}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qnews.com.au/israel-approves-prep-to-fight-hiv/|title=ISRAEL APPROVES PREP TO FIGHT HIV - Q News|website=www.qnews.com.au|date=2016-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==== Israel ====\n{{see also|Men of Israel}}\n[[File:Michael Lucas Men of Israel film shoot.jpg|200px|thumb|Lucas, under the microphone, on the set of the 2009 release ''Men of Israel'', the first adult film to use exclusively Jewish models.<ref name=\"LAB\">[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/07/men-of-israel-the-new-box-office-hottie.html 'Men of Israel': The new box-office stud?], ''Los Angeles Times'' blog, July 27, 2009.</ref>]]\nThe core of Lucas' [[worldview]] is his [[Jewish]] identity, and particularly his deep affinity for the state of Israel.<ref name=\"Kerchik\" /> His time growing up in the [[Soviet Union]], which was notorious for its [[antisemitism]], meant that like many [[Russian Jews]], Lucas had to repress his identity.

But there is much more to the Jewish state than missiles and prayers. In his debut as a documentary filmmaker, adult-film entrepreneur and political columnist Michael Lucas examines a side of Israel that is too often overlooked: its thriving gay community. Undressing Israel features interviews with a diverse range of local men, including a gay member of Israel's parliament, a trainer who served openly in the army, a young Arab-Israeli journalist, and a pair of dads raising their kids.

I'm ready to shout about it. Here's what helped convince me: Dr. Robert Grant of UCSF, the researcher who led the multinational study on PrEP, was quoted at an AIDS conference as saying that 'No one in iPrEx [the PrEP study] acquired HIV infection with a drug level that would have been expected with daily dosing.' Was this really possible?

Lucas wrote the following in his column: \"Despite all the attempted distractions, the focus must remain on the simple message in the new study: If you take PrEP, you will not get HIV. Period. It is time to wake up, stop the endless debating, and take action. The war against HIV rages on, and when scientists actually win a battle, we must avail ourselves of the powerful weapon they have developed.\"<ref>Op-Ed: PrEP Works, So Stop The Backlash (Out.com) http://www.out.com/news-opinion/2015/9/12/op-ed-prep-works-so-drop-backlash</ref> On February 24, 2016, PrEP was formally approved in Israel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/israel-approves-prep-prime-minister-addresses-lgbt-rights-at-knesset/02/2016/|title=Israel Approves PrEP, Prime Minister Addresses LGBT Rights At Knesset}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qnews.com.au/israel-approves-prep-to-fight-hiv/|title=ISRAEL APPROVES PREP TO FIGHT HIV - Q News|website=www.qnews.com.au|date=2016-02-24}}</ref>\n\n==== Israel ====\n{{see also|Men of Israel}}\n[[File:Michael Lucas Men of Israel film shoot.jpg|200px|thumb|Lucas, under the microphone, on the set of the 2009 release ''Men of Israel'', the first adult film to use exclusively Jewish models.<ref name=\"LAB\">[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/the_big_picture/2009/07/men-of-israel-the-new-box-office-hottie.html 'Men of Israel': The new box-office stud?], ''Los Angeles Times'' blog, July 27, 2009.</ref>]]\nThe core of Lucas' [[worldview]] is his [[Jewish]] identity, and particularly his deep affinity for the state of Israel.<ref name=\"Kerchik\" /> His time growing up in the [[Soviet Union]], which was notorious for its [[antisemitism]], meant that like many [[Russian Jews]], Lucas had to repress his identity.

The battle was a decisive victory for the rebels fighting against the regime of General [[Fulgencio Batista]]: within 12 hours of the city's capture, Batista fled [[Cuba]] and [[Fidel Castro]]'s forces claimed overall victory. It features prominently on the back of the three [[convertible peso]] bill.\n\n==Attack on the city==\nGuevara's column travelled on the 28 December 1958 from the coastal port of [[Caibari\u00e9n]] along the road to the town of [[Camajuani]], which lay between Caibari\u00e9n and Santa Clara. Their journey was received by cheering crowds of peasants, and Caibari\u00e9n's capture within a day reinforced the sense among the rebel fighters that overall victory was imminent. Government troops guarding the army garrison at Camajuani deserted their posts without incident, and Guevara's column proceeded to Santa Clara. They arrived at the city's university on the outskirts of the town at dusk.\n\n[[Image:Revolution Map of progress.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Cuba showing the location of the arrival of the rebels on the [[Granma (yacht)|Granma]] yacht in late 1956, the rebels' stronghold in the [[Sierra Maestra]], and Guevara's route towards [[Havana]] via Santa Clara in December 1958.]]\n\nThere, Guevara, who was wearing his arm in a sling after falling off a wall during the fighting in Caibari\u00e9n, divided his forces, numbering about 300, into two columns. The southern column was the first to meet the defending army forces commanded by Colonel Casillas Lumpuy. An [[armoured train]], sent by [[Batista]] to reinforce supplies of ammunition, weapons and other equipment, traveled along to the foot of the hill of Capiro, northeast of the city, establishing a command post there. Guevara dispatched his \"suicide squad\", a force under 23-year-old Roberto Rodr\u00edguez (known as \"El Vaquerito\"), to capture the hill. The defenders of the hill withdrew with surprising speed and the train, containing officers and soldiers from the command post, withdrew towards the centre of the town.\n\nIn the city itself a series of skirmishes were taking place between government forces and the second rebel column, led by Rolando Cubela, with the assistance of civilians providing [[Molotov cocktails]]. Two army garrisons (the barracks of the Leoncio Vidal Regiment and the barracks of the 31 Regiment of the Rural Guard) were under siege from Cubela's forces despite army support from aircraft, snipers and tanks.\n\n===Capture of the train===\n{{see also|Tren Blindado}}\n[[File:Tren blindado-Santa Clara (Cuba)-Che Guevara-Flikr-emeryjl-388610245 (CC-BY).jpg|thumb|right|The armored train, today a museum.]]\n[[File:Cuba - Santa Clara - st\u00e8le du Che.JPG|thumb|right|A memorial of the attack on Santa Clara at the armored train memorial.]]\nGuevara, who viewed the capture of the [[armoured train]] as a priority, successfully mobilized the tractors of the school of Agronomy at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within tumbled out asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they were tired of fighting against their own people. Shortly afterwards the armored train was in the hands of the rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.\n\nThe train contained a considerable amount of weaponry, a huge bonus to revolutionary forces, which would become a basis of further attack in the hands of both the rebels and supportive peasants. Guevara himself described how the men were forced out by a volley of Molotov cocktails, causing the armored train to become a \"veritable oven for the soldiers\".\n\nThe capture of the train, and the subsequent media broadcasts from both the government and the rebels proved to be a key tipping point in the revolution. It is reported by witnesses, that at some point during the battle, Guevara's machine gun jammed. A local mechanic, Alberto Garcia, was taken in the midst of gunfire to his shop about a block away in order to repair the machine gun.

The battle was a decisive victory for the rebels fighting against the regime of General [[Fulgencio Batista]]: within 12 hours of the city's capture, Batista fled [[Cuba]] and [[Fidel Castro]]'s forces claimed overall victory. It features prominently on the back of the three [[convertible peso]] bill.\n\n==Attack on the city==\nGuevara's column travelled on the 28 December 1958 from the coastal port of [[Caibari\u00e9n]] along the road to the town of [[Camajuani]], which lay between Caibari\u00e9n and Santa Clara. Their journey was received by cheering crowds of peasants, and Caibari\u00e9n's capture within a day reinforced the sense among the rebel fighters that overall victory was imminent. Government troops guarding the army garrison at Camajuani deserted their posts without incident, and Guevara's column proceeded to Santa Clara. They arrived at the city's university on the outskirts of the town at dusk.\n\n[[Image:Revolution Map of progress.jpg|right|thumb|Map of Cuba showing the location of the arrival of the rebels on the [[Granma (yacht)|Granma]] yacht in late 1956, the rebels' stronghold in the [[Sierra Maestra]], and Guevara's route towards [[Havana]] via Santa Clara in December 1958.]]\n\nThere, Guevara, who was wearing his arm in a sling after falling off a wall during the fighting in Caibari\u00e9n, divided his forces, numbering about 300, into two columns. The southern column was the first to meet the defending army forces commanded by Colonel Casillas Lumpuy. An [[armoured train]], sent by [[Batista]] to reinforce supplies of ammunition, weapons and other equipment, traveled along to the foot of the hill of Capiro, northeast of the city, establishing a command post there. Guevara dispatched his \"suicide squad\", a force under 23-year-old Roberto Rodr\u00edguez (known as \"El Vaquerito\"), to capture the hill. The defenders of the hill withdrew with surprising speed and the train, containing officers and soldiers from the command post, withdrew towards the centre of the town.\n\nIn the city itself a series of skirmishes were taking place between government forces and the second rebel column, led by Rolando Cubela, with the assistance of civilians providing [[Molotov cocktails]]. Two army garrisons (the barracks of the Leoncio Vidal Regiment and the barracks of the 31 Regiment of the Rural Guard) were under siege from Cubela's forces despite army support from aircraft, snipers and tanks.\n\n===Capture of the train===\n{{see also|Tren Blindado}}\n[[File:Tren blindado-Santa Clara (Cuba)-Che Guevara-Flikr-emeryjl-388610245 (CC-BY).jpg|thumb|right|The armored train, today a museum.]]\n[[File:Cuba - Santa Clara - st\u00e8le du Che.JPG|thumb|right|A memorial of the attack on Santa Clara at the armored train memorial.]]\nGuevara, who viewed the capture of the [[armoured train]] as a priority, successfully mobilized the tractors of the school of Agronomy at the university to raise the rails of the railway. The train was therefore derailed as it transported troops away from the Capiro hill. The officers within tumbled out asking for a truce. At this, ordinary soldiers, whose morale was very low, began to fraternize with the rebels, saying that they were tired of fighting against their own people. Shortly afterwards the armored train was in the hands of the rebels and its 350 men and officers were transported as prisoners.\n\nThe train contained a considerable amount of weaponry, a huge bonus to revolutionary forces, which would become a basis of further attack in the hands of both the rebels and supportive peasants. Guevara himself described how the men were forced out by a volley of Molotov cocktails, causing the armored train to become a \"veritable oven for the soldiers\".\n\nThe capture of the train, and the subsequent media broadcasts from both the government and the rebels proved to be a key tipping point in the revolution. It is reported by witnesses, that at some point during the battle, Guevara's machine gun jammed. A local mechanic, Alberto Garcia, was taken in the midst of gunfire to his shop about a block away in order to repair the machine gun. Mr. Garcia's new home had just been built right next to the train tracks and it served as Che's headquarters during the battle. Mr. Garcia was still living in his old house with his young family just across the street. In an effort to capture Che Guevara and in retaliation for the taking of the train, Mr. Garcia's new home was subsequently bombarded by Batista's army. Despite the next day's newspapers hailing Batista's \"victory\" at Santa Clara, contrary broadcasts from Castro's rebel forces accelerated the succession of army surrenders.
