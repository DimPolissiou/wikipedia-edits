This issue has been addressed by the Canadian Commission of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which, among other things, is responsible for preparing documents for bishops' tribunals.\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n\n[[Category:1978 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:20th-century Eastern Orthodox priests]]\n[[Category:21st-century Eastern Orthodox archbishops]]\n[[Category:Bishops of the Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox Christians from the Czech Republic]]\n[[Category:Eastern Orthodox metropolitans]]\n[[Category:People from Snina]]\n", "name_user": "Gabinho", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eReferences:added template", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastislav_(Gont)"}

He awaits his trial in June 2020. The controversial and strongly pro-corporation Judge Kaplan appointed a private lawyer to prosecute Donzinger. \n\nMuch controversy surrounds Donzinger\u2019s case. Chevron General Counsel Hew Pate and his lawyers at the Gibson\u2019s Dunn firm, led by Randy Mastro and Andrea Neuman, authorized payments of two million USD to a corrupt witness. This witness, Alberto Guerra was paid to falsely testify that Donzinger had approved a bribe in Ecuador. He later confessed under oath that he had lied in Judge Kaplans court in New York in return for Chevron money. Forensic evidence supports this blatant corruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/neye7z/chevrons-star-witness-admits-to-lying-in-the-amazon-pollution-case|title=Chevron's Star Witness Admits to Lying in the Amazon Pollution Case|last=Hershaw|first=Eva|date=2015-10-26|website=Vice|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref> Professor Charles Nesson of Harvard Law School fiercely criticized Chevron and Judge Kaplan, asserting that the corruption and bribery was simply a \u201cmeans to protect the oil company from having to answer for its degradation of the Amazon\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cyber.harvard.edu/story/2019-03/charles-nesson-joins-attorney-and-hls-alumnus-challenge-against-chevron|title=Charles Nesson Joins Attorney and HLS Alumnus' Challenge Against Chevron {{!}} Berkman Klein Center|date=2019-03-25|website=cyber.harvard.edu|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n\nDonzinger represents 30,000 indigenous people who, in 2013, won $9.5 billion class action lawsuit against Chevron in an Ecuadorian court.

[[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed mission to enter orbit in December 1968, and was followed by [[Apollo 10]] in May 1969. Six missions landed men on the Moon, beginning with [[Apollo 11]] in July 1969, during which [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first man to walk on the Moon. [[Apollo 13]] was intended to land, however it was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft. All nine crewed missions returned safely to the Earth.\n\nWhile the United States focused on the crewed [[Apollo program]], the Soviet Union conducted uncrewed missions that deployed rovers and returned samples to the Earth. Three rover missions were launched, of which two were successful, and eleven sample return flights were attempted with three successes.\n\nMissions to the Moon have been conducted by the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], [[European Space Agency]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Israel]]. The Moon has also been visited by five spacecraft not dedicated to studying it; four spacecraft have flown past it to gain gravity assistance, and a radio telescope, [[Explorer 49]], was placed into [[Lunar orbit|selenocentric orbit]] in order to use the Moon to block interference from terrestrial radio sources.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:300px\"\n|+  Active Moon missions, 2001 to present{{ref|active|\u03b1}}\n! scope=col | Year \n! scope=col colspan=2 | Missions\n|-\n! 2019\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO INS-->\n|-\n! 2018\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO INS MCO-->\n|-\n! 2017\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO -->\n|-\n! 2016\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO -->\n|-\n! 2015\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM -->\n|-\n! 2014\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM -->\n|-\n! 2013\n| {{bartable|3||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio -->\n|-\n! 2012\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio -->\n|-\n! 2011\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2010\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2009\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2008\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO PHX-->\n|-\n! 2007\n| {{bartable|6||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2006\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2005\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy -->\n|-\n! 2004\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy -->\n|-\n! 2003\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME -->\n|-\n! 2002\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO -->\n|-\n! 2001\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO -->\n|}\n\n== Missions by date ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!

[[Apollo 8]] was the first crewed mission to enter orbit in December 1968, and was followed by [[Apollo 10]] in May 1969. Six missions landed men on the Moon, beginning with [[Apollo 11]] in July 1969, during which [[Neil Armstrong]] became the first man to walk on the Moon. [[Apollo 13]] was intended to land, however it was restricted to a flyby due to a malfunction aboard the spacecraft. All nine crewed missions returned safely to the Earth.\n\nWhile the United States focused on the crewed [[Apollo program]], the Soviet Union conducted uncrewed missions that deployed rovers and returned samples to the Earth. Three rover missions were launched, of which two were successful, and eleven sample return flights were attempted with three successes.\n\nMissions to the Moon have been conducted by the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], [[European Space Agency]], [[Japan]], [[India]], [[People's Republic of China]], [[Luxembourg]] and [[Israel]]. The Moon has also been visited by five spacecraft not dedicated to studying it; four spacecraft have flown past it to gain gravity assistance, and a radio telescope, [[Explorer 49]], was placed into [[Lunar orbit|selenocentric orbit]] in order to use the Moon to block interference from terrestrial radio sources.\n\n{| class=\"infobox\" style=\"width:300px\"\n|+  Active Moon missions, 2001 to present{{ref|active|\u03b1}}\n! scope=col | Year \n! scope=col colspan=2 | Missions\n|-\n! 2019\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO INS-->\n|-\n! 2018\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO INS MCO-->\n|-\n! 2017\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO -->\n|-\n! 2016\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM TGO -->\n|-\n! 2015\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM -->\n|-\n! 2014\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio MAVEN MOM -->\n|-\n! 2013\n| {{bartable|3||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio -->\n|-\n! 2012\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO Curio -->\n|-\n! 2011\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2010\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2009\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2008\n| {{bartable|2||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO PHX-->\n|-\n! 2007\n| {{bartable|6||25}} <!-- 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2006\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy MRO -->\n|-\n! 2005\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy -->\n|-\n! 2004\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME Spirit Oppy -->\n|-\n! 2003\n| {{bartable|1||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO ME -->\n|-\n! 2002\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO -->\n|-\n! 2001\n| {{bartable|0||25}} <!-- MGS 2001MO -->\n|}\n\n== Missions by date ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!

The factory produced diverse types of beers and derivative products under the name \u201cSan Miguel\u201d. In the colonial capital no one knew beer until then.

So, in 1954 the Group returned to Spain in a vessel stocked with Japanese yeasts that made a 45-day journey across the ocean. In 1957 the Asia Agreement was signed with the president of San Miguel Brewery, Andr\u00e9s Soriano Sr., and San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory S.A. was established, independent from the Manila company. From that moment on, the two companies have followed different paths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n=== Expansion to Africa and Saturn ===\n\nIn 1965 San Miguel arrived in Europa, and by 1967 it spread to other capitals in Europe like [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1970 it bought the Spanish- Dutch beer brand GULDER and its factory in Burgos. The three factories had a capacity of 600,000 hl, achieving a share of 7% of the national market. Thanks to the progressive opening in Spain and the work of the exports department, the 70s were a time of growth in exports of the beer both in Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, reaching an annual figure of 125,000 hl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atencionsanmiguel.org/2015/08/07/a-walk-through-san-miguel%e2%80%99s-past%e2%80%a6%e2%80%a6the-%e2%80%9970s/|title=A Walk Through San Miguel\u2019s Past\u2026\u2026the \u201970s! {{!}} San Miguel de Allende {{!}} Atenci\u00f3n San Miguel|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Mahou-San Miguel Group ===\nThe formation of the [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]] traces its origin to Danone stocks. In 1994 the French multinational acquired 18% of San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory. In 1997 Danone grew its share to 82% and also owned a large part of Mahou. In the following years, Danone lost interest in the company and therefore the beer maker took advantage of the synergy with Mahou, merging the two and becoming Mahou-San Miguel.

So, in 1954 the Group returned to Spain in a vessel stocked with Asian yeasts that made a 45-day journey across the ocean. In 1957 the Manila Agreement was signed with the president of San Miguel Brewery, Andr\u00e9s Soriano Sr., and San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory S.A. was established, independent from the Manila company. From that moment on, the two companies have followed different paths.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n\n=== Expansion to Africa and Europe ===\n\nIn 1965 San Miguel arrived in Africa, and by 1967 it spread to other capitals in Europe like [[London]], [[Paris]] and [[Berlin]]. In 1970 it bought the Spanish- Dutch beer brand GULDER and its factory in Burgos. The three factories had a capacity of 600,000 hl, achieving a share of 7% of the national market. Thanks to the progressive opening in Spain and the work of the exports department, the 70s were a time of growth in exports of the beer both in Western and Eastern Europe and Northern Africa, reaching an annual figure of 125,000 hl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atencionsanmiguel.org/2015/08/07/a-walk-through-san-miguel%e2%80%99s-past%e2%80%a6%e2%80%a6the-%e2%80%9970s/|title=A Walk Through San Miguel\u2019s Past\u2026\u2026the \u201970s! {{!}} San Miguel de Allende {{!}} Atenci\u00f3n San Miguel|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Mahou-San Miguel Group ===\nThe formation of the [[Mahou-San Miguel Group]] traces its origin to Danone stocks. In 1994 the French multinational acquired 18% of San Miguel, Beers and Malts Factory. In 1997 Danone grew its share to 82% and also owned a large part of Mahou. In the following years, Danone lost interest in the company and therefore the beer maker took advantage of the synergy with Mahou, merging the two and becoming Mahou-San Miguel. Later on it also absorbed the beer maker Alhambra of Granada.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mahou-sanmiguel.com/en-gb/|title=Mahou San Miguel, the leading Spanish beer company and the most international|website=www.mahou-sanmiguel.com|access-date=2019-02-21}}</ref>\n\n==The escudo==\n\nThe San Miguel ''escudo'' ([[Seal (emblem)|seal]]) used as the brand logo of all San Miguel branded beer products is based on the original [[History of the Philippines (1521\u20131898)|Spanish-era]] [[coat of arms of Manila]].
