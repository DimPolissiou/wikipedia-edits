The [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s defending champion [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] defeated the [[American Football League]] (AFL) champion [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] by the score of 33\u201314. This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium.\n\nComing into this game, like during [[Super Bowl I|the first Super Bowl]], many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL. The Packers, the defending champions, posted a 9\u20134\u20131 record during the [[1967 NFL season]] before defeating the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 21\u201317, in the [[1967 NFL Championship Game]] (also popularly known as the ''Ice Bowl''). The Raiders finished the [[1967 American Football League season|1967 AFL season]] at 13\u20131, and defeated the [[Houston Oilers]], 40\u20137, in the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship Game]].\n\nAs expected, Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II. The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]]. Meanwhile, Packers kicker [[Don Chandler]] made four field goals, including three in the first half, while defensive back [[Herb Adderley]] had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown. Green Bay quarterback [[Bart Starr]] was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] for the second straight time, becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown.\n\n==Background==\nThe game was awarded to Miami on May 25, 1967, at the owners meetings held in New York City.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1906&dat=19670525&id=MtgfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LtkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3999,1286543]\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n{{Main article|1967 Green Bay Packers season}}\n{{See also|1967 NFL Championship Game}}\n\nThe Packers advanced to their second straight AFL-NFL World Championship Game, but had a much more difficult time than in the previous season. Both of their starting running backs from the previous year, future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], had left the team. Their replacements, [[Elijah Pitts]] and [[Jim Grabowski]], were both injured early in the season, forcing Green Bay coach [[Vince Lombardi]] to use veteran reserve running back [[Donny Anderson]] and rookie [[Travis Williams (running back)|Travis Williams]]. Fullbacks [[Chuck Mercein]] and [[Ben Wilson (American football)|Ben Wilson]], who were signed as free agents after being discarded by many other teams, were also used to help compensate for the loss of Hornung and Taylor. Meanwhile, the team's 33-year-old veteran quarterback [[Bart Starr]] had missed 4 games during the season with injuries, and finished the season with nearly twice as many interceptions (17) as touchdown passes (9).\n\nThe team's deep threat was provided by veteran receivers [[Carroll Dale]], who recorded 35 receptions for 738 yards (a 21.1 average), and 5 touchdowns; and [[Pro Bowl]]er [[Boyd Dowler]], who had 54 catches for 846 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Packers still had the superb blocking of linemen [[Jerry Kramer]], [[Fred Thurston]] and [[Forrest Gregg]]. On special teams, Williams returned 18 kickoffs for 749 yards and an NFL record 4 touchdowns, giving him a whopping 41.1 yards per return average. But overall the team ranked just 9th out of 16 NFL teams in scoring with 332 points.\n\nThe Packers defense, however, allowed only 209 points, the 3rd best in the NFL. Even this figure was misleading, since Green Bay had yielded only 131 points in the first 11 games (when they clinched their division), the lowest total in professional football. Three members of Green Bay's secondary, the strongest aspect of their defense, were named to the Pro Bowl: defensive backs [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Herb Adderley]], and [[Bob Jeter]]. The Packers also had a superb defensive line led by [[Henry Jordan]] and [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]]. Behind them, the Packers linebacking core was led by [[Ray Nitschke]].\n\nThe Packers won the NFL's Central Division with a 9\u20134\u20131 regular season record, clinching the division in the 11th week of the season. During the last three weeks, the Packers gave up an uncharacteristic total of 78 points, after having yielded only about a dozen points per game in their first 11 contests. In the playoffs, Green Bay returned to its dominant form, blowing away their first playoff opponent, the [[Los Angeles Rams]], in the Western Conference Championship Game, 28\u20137. The next week, Green Bay then came from behind to defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFL championship game for the second year in a row, in one of the most famous games in NFL lore: The [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]].\n\n===Oakland Raiders===\n{{Main article|1967 Oakland Raiders season}}\n{{See also|1967 American Football League Championship Game}}\n\nThe Raiders, led by head coach [[John Rauch]], had stormed to the top of the AFL with a 13\u20131 regular season record (their only defeat was an October 7 loss to the [[New York Jets]], 27\u201314), and went on to crush the [[Houston Oilers]], 40\u20137, in the AFL Championship game. They had led all AFL and NFL teams in scoring with 468 points. And starting quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]] had thrown for 3,228 yards and an AFL-best 30 touchdown passes.\n\nThe offensive line was anchored by center [[Jim Otto]] and guard [[Gene Upshaw]], along with Pro Bowlers [[Harry Schuh]] and [[Wayne Hawkins]]. Wide receiver [[Fred Biletnikoff]] led the team with 40 receptions for 876 yards, an average of 21.3 yards per catch. On the other side of the field, tight end [[Billy Cannon]] caught 32 passes for 629 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. In the backfield, the Raiders had three running backs, [[Clem Daniels]], [[Hewritt Dixon]], and [[Pete Banaszak]], who carried the ball equally and combined for 1,510 yards and 10 touchdowns. On special teams, defensive back [[Rodger Bird]] led the AFL with 612 punt return yards and added another 148 yards returning kickoffs.\n\nThe main strength of the Raiders was their defense, nicknamed \"The 11 Angry Men\". The defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowlers [[Tom Keating (American football)|Tom Keating]] and [[Ben Davidson]]. Davidson was an extremely effective pass rusher who had demonstrated his aggressiveness in a regular season game against the [[New York Jets]] by breaking the jaw of Jets quarterback [[Joe Namath]] while sacking him. Behind them, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Dan Conners]] excelled at blitzing and pass coverage, recording 3 interceptions. The Raiders also had two Pro Bowl defensive backs: [[Willie Brown (football player)|Willie Brown]], who led the team with 7 interceptions, and [[Kent McCloughan]], who had 2 interceptions. Safety [[Warren Powers]] recorded 6 interceptions, returning them for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nDespite Oakland's accomplishments, and expert consensus that this was the weakest of all the Packer NFL championship teams, Green Bay was a 14-point favorite to win the Super Bowl. Like the previous year, most fans and sports writers believed that the top NFL teams were superior to the best AFL teams.\n\nThus, most of the drama and discussions surrounding the game focused not on which team would win, but on the rumors that Lombardi might retire from coaching after the game. The game also proved to be the final one for Packers [[wide receiver]] [[Max McGee]], one of the heroes of [[Super Bowl I]], and place kicker [[Don Chandler]].\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to use the Y-shaped goalposts (with one supporting post instead of two) invented by [[Jim Trimble]] and Joel Rottman; they had made their debut at the start of the season for both the AFL and NFL, and first appeared at the pro level in [[Canadian Football League|Canada]].<ref>https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vum8Q7qG1CQ/VrUjHP2fDFI/AAAAAAAAa4k/IihICZ_23Ig/s1600/11-AP%2BSuper%2BBowl%2BII.png</ref>\n\n==Television==\nThe game was televised in the [[United States]] by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], with [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]]s [[Pat Summerall]] and [[Jack Kemp]] in the broadcast booth. Kemp was the first Super Bowl commentator who was still an active player (with [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]]) at the time of the broadcast. The CBS telecast of this game is considered lost; all that survives are in-game photos, most of which were shown in the January 8, 1969 edition of [[Sports Illustrated]]. Not even [[NFL Films]], the league's official filmmaker, has a copy of the full game available; however, they do have game footage that they used for their game highlight film.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000622357/article/the-mystery-of-the-super-bowl-i-tapes</ref><ref>http://www.nflfilms.com/specialorders/twNFL.php</ref>\n\nUnlike the previous year's game, Super Bowl II was televised live on only one network, which has been the case for all subsequent Super Bowl games. While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the NFL's unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in place then prevented the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area.\n\nDuring the latter part of the second quarter, and again for three minutes of halftime, almost 80 percent of the country (with the exceptions of [[New York, New York|New York City]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and much of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]) lost the video feed of the CBS broadcast. CBS, who had paid $2.5 million for broadcast rights, blamed the glitch on a breakdown in [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[Coaxial cable|cable lines]]. The overnight [[Arbitron]] rating was 43.0, a slight increase from Super Bowl I's combined CBS-NBC rating of 42.2.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-22-BC.pdf</ref>\n\n==Ceremonies and entertainment==\nThe pregame ceremonies featured two giant figures, one dressed as a Packers player and the other dressed as a Raiders player. They appeared on opposite ends of the field and then faced each other near the 50-yard line.\n\nThe [[Grambling State University]] band performed the national anthem as well as during the halftime show.<ref name=SB_Entertainment>{{cite web|title=Super Bowl - Entertainment|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/entertainment|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref> The same band was part of the halftime show of Super Bowl I the previous year.\n\n==Game summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nOn Oakland's first offensive play, [[Ray Nitschke]] shot through a gap and literally upended fullback [[Hewritt Dixon]] in what was one of Nitschke's signature plays of his entire career. The hit was so vicious, it prompted Jerry Green, a ''[[Detroit News]]'' columnist sitting in the press box with fellow journalists, to say in a deadpan, that the game was ''over''.<ref>Gruver, 2002 pg. 266</ref> The Packers opened up the scoring with Don Chandler's 39-yard field goal after marching 34 yards on their first drive of the game. Meanwhile, the Raiders were forced to punt on their first two possessions.\n\n===Second quarter===\nThe Packers then started their second possession at their own 3-yard line, and in the opening minutes of the second quarter, they drove 84 yards to the Raiders 13-yard line. However, they once again had to settle for a Chandler field goal to take a 6\u20130 lead. Later in the period, the Packers took the ball on their own 38-yard line following an Oakland punt. Raider cornerback Kent McCloughan jammed Packer split end Boyd Dowler at the line of scrimmage but then allowed him to head downfield, thinking that a safety would pick him up.<ref>''The Ultimate Super Bowl Book,'' Bob McGinn. MVP Books, 2009, p. 22.</ref> However, McCloughan and left safety Howie Williams were both influenced by the Packer backs who were executing a \"flood\" pattern, with halfback Travis Williams and fullback Ben Wilson running pass routes to the same side as Dowler. Dowler ran a quick post and was wide open down the middle. He grabbed Starr's pass well behind middle linebacker Dan Conners, and right safety Rodger Bird could not get over quickly enough.  Dowler outran the defense to score on a 62-yard touchdown reception, increasing the Packer lead to 13\u20130.\n\n[[File:1994 Super Bowl II Packers vs Raiders, Orange Bowl Jan 14th 1968 Coke Bottle (3444192815).jpg|thumb|180px|A commemorative [[Coca-Cola]] bottle produced in 1994]]\nAfter being completely dominated until this point, the Raiders offense finally struck back their next possession, advancing 79 yards in 9 plays, and scoring on a 23-yard touchdown pass from [[Daryle Lamonica]] to receiver Bill Miller. The score seemed to fire up the Raiders' defense, and they forced the Packers to punt on their next drive. Raiders returner [[Rodger Bird]] gave them great field position with a 12-yard return to Green Bay's 40-yard line, but Oakland could only gain 1 yard with their next 3 plays and came up empty when [[George Blanda]]'s 47-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. Oakland's defense again forced Green Bay to punt after 3 plays on the ensuing drive, but this time after calling for a fair catch, Bird fumbled punter [[Donny Anderson]]'s twisting, left footed kick, and Green Bay's Dick Capp recovered the ball. After 2 incomplete passes, Starr threw a 9-yard completion to Dowler (despite a heavy rush from Ike Lassiter) to set up Chandler's third field goal from the 43 as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 16\u20137 lead.\n\nAt halftime, Packers guard [[Jerry Kramer]] said to his teammates (referring to Lombardi), \"Let's play the last 30 minutes for the old man.\"<ref>Jerry Kramer, \"Super Bowl II,\" ''Super Bowl: The Game of Their Lives,'' Danny Peary, editor. Macmillan, 1997. {{ISBN|0-02-860841-0}}</ref>\n\n===Third quarter===\nAny chance the Raiders might have had to make a comeback seemed to completely vanish in the second half. The Packers had the ball three times in the third quarter, and held it for all but two and a half minutes. On the Packers second drive of the half starting at their own 17, Ben Wilson ripped up the middle for 14 yards on a draw play.  Anderson picked up 8 yards on a sweep, and Wilson carried to within inches of the first down.  Starr then pulled one of his favorite plays on third down and short yardage, faking to Wilson and completing a 35-yard pass to wide receiver [[Max McGee]] who had slipped past three Raiders at the line of scrimmage.  This was McGee's only reception of the game, and the final one of his career.  Starr then hit Carroll Dale on a sideline route at the Oakland 13.  Starr overthrew Donny Anderson wide open in the end zone, but on the next play he rolled out to the right and threw back to Anderson who was tackled on the two by linebacker Gus Otto.  The next play was a broken play, as Anderson thought he saw daylight to the right but ran into Starr. The Packers were not rattled, and the line and fullback Ben Wilson wiped out the Raiders on Anderson's 2-yard touchdown run over right tackle, making the score 23\u20137.\n\nPacker guard Jerry Kramer must have taken to heart his plea to play the second half for Coach Lombardi.  On this drive, game films show him blowing Dan Conners out of Wilson's path on the draw play, then flattening Conners again on Anderson's scoring run.\n\nAgain the Green Bay defense forced Oakland to go three-and-out, and the Raiders punted.  The Packers drove from their own 39 to the Raider 24 and increased their lead to 26\u20137 as Chandler kicked his fourth field goal (which hit the crossbar from 31 yards out and bounced over).\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Starr was knocked out of the game when he jammed the thumb on his throwing hand on a sack by Davidson. (Starr was replaced by [[Zeke Bratkowski]], who was then sacked on his only pass attempt.) But later in the period, the Packers put the game completely out of reach when defensive back [[Herb Adderley]] intercepted a pass intended for [[Fred Biletnikoff]] and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33\u20137. Adderley laid back as the Raider end ran a curl route, then dashed in front of him to snare the ball and scored with the help of a crushing downfield block by tackle Ron Kostelnik.  \n\nOakland did manage to score on their next drive after the turnover with a second 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Miller, set up by [[Pete Banaszak]]'s 41-yard reception on the previous play. But all the Raiders' second touchdown did was make the final score look remotely more respectable, 33\u201314.\n\nAt the end of the game, coach Lombardi was carried off the field by his victorious Packers in one of the more memorable images of early Super Bowl history. It was in fact Lombardi's last game as Packer coach and his ninth consecutive playoff victory.\n\nOakland's Bill Miller was the top receiver of the game with 5 receptions for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns. Green Bay fullback [[Ben Wilson (American football)|Ben Wilson]] was the leading rusher of the game with 62 yards despite missing most of the fourth quarter while looking for a lost contact lens on the sidelines. [[Don Chandler]] ended his Packer career in style with 4 field goals. Lamonica finished the game with 15 out of 34 pass completions for 208 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Bart Starr completed 13 of 24 (with a couple of dropped passes) for 202 yards and one touchdown; his passer rating for the game was 96.2 to Lamonica's 71.7. The Packers outgained the Raiders in rushing yardage 160 to 107, led in time of possession by 35:54 to 24:06, had no turnovers, and only one penalty. Packer guard Jerry Kramer later recalled the mental mistakes his team made in the game, which only highlights the impossibly high standards held by Lombardi's team.<ref>''The Ultimate Super Bowl Book,'' Bob McGinn.

The [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s defending champion [[1967 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] defeated the [[American Football League]] (AFL) champion [[1967 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] by the score of 33\u201314. This game and Super Bowl III are the only two Super Bowl games to be played in back-to-back years in the same stadium.\n\nComing into this game, like during [[Super Bowl I|the first Super Bowl]], many sports writers and fans believed that any team in the NFL was vastly superior to any club in the AFL. The Packers, the defending champions, posted a 9\u20134\u20131 record during the [[1967 NFL season]] before defeating the [[Dallas Cowboys]], 21\u201317, in the [[1967 NFL Championship Game]] (also popularly known as the ''Ice Bowl''). The Raiders finished the [[1967 American Football League season|1967 AFL season]] at 13\u20131, and defeated the [[Houston Oilers]], 40\u20137, in the [[1967 American Football League Championship Game|1967 AFL Championship Game]].\n\nAs expected, Green Bay dominated Oakland throughout most of Super Bowl II. The Raiders could only score two touchdown passes from quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]]. Meanwhile, Packers kicker [[Don Chandler]] made four field goals, including three in the first half, while defensive back [[Herb Adderley]] had a 60-yard interception return for a touchdown. Green Bay quarterback [[Bart Starr]] was named the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]] for the second straight time, becoming the first back-to-back Super Bowl MVP for his 13 of 24 passes for 202 yards and one touchdown.\n\n==Background==\nThe game was awarded to Miami on May 25, 1967, at the owners meetings held in New York City.[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1906&dat=19670525&id=MtgfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LtkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3999,1286543]\n\n===Green Bay Packers===\n{{Main article|1967 Green Bay Packers season}}\n{{See also|1967 NFL Championship Game}}\n\nThe Packers advanced to their second straight AFL-NFL World Championship Game, but had a much more difficult time than in the previous season. Both of their starting running backs from the previous year, future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]]rs [[Paul Hornung]] and [[Jim Taylor (fullback)|Jim Taylor]], had left the team. Their replacements, [[Elijah Pitts]] and [[Jim Grabowski]], were both injured early in the season, forcing Green Bay coach [[Vince Lombardi]] to use veteran reserve running back [[Donny Anderson]] and rookie [[Travis Williams (running back)|Travis Williams]]. Fullbacks [[Chuck Mercein]] and [[Ben Wilson (American football)|Ben Wilson]], who were signed as free agents after being discarded by many other teams, were also used to help compensate for the loss of Hornung and Taylor. Meanwhile, the team's 33-year-old veteran quarterback [[Bart Starr]] had missed 4 games during the season with injuries, and finished the season with nearly twice as many interceptions (17) as touchdown passes (9).\n\nThe team's deep threat was provided by veteran receivers [[Carroll Dale]], who recorded 35 receptions for 738 yards (a 21.1 average), and 5 touchdowns; and [[Pro Bowl]]er [[Boyd Dowler]], who had 54 catches for 846 yards and 4 touchdowns. The Packers still had the superb blocking of linemen [[Jerry Kramer]], [[Fred Thurston]] and [[Forrest Gregg]]. On special teams, Williams returned 18 kickoffs for 749 yards and an NFL record 4 touchdowns, giving him a whopping 41.1 yards per return average. But overall the team ranked just 9th out of 16 NFL teams in scoring with 332 points.\n\nThe Packers defense, however, allowed only 209 points, the 3rd best in the NFL. Even this figure was misleading, since Green Bay had yielded only 131 points in the first 11 games (when they clinched their division), the lowest total in professional football. Three members of Green Bay's secondary, the strongest aspect of their defense, were named to the Pro Bowl: defensive backs [[Willie Wood (American football)|Willie Wood]], [[Herb Adderley]], and [[Bob Jeter]]. The Packers also had a superb defensive line led by [[Henry Jordan]] and [[Willie Davis (defensive end)|Willie Davis]]. Behind them, the Packers linebacking core was led by [[Ray Nitschke]].\n\nThe Packers won the NFL's Central Division with a 9\u20134\u20131 regular season record, clinching the division in the 11th week of the season. During the last three weeks, the Packers gave up an uncharacteristic total of 78 points, after having yielded only about a dozen points per game in their first 11 contests. In the playoffs, Green Bay returned to its dominant form, blowing away their first playoff opponent, the [[Los Angeles Rams]], in the Western Conference Championship Game, 28\u20137. The next week, Green Bay then came from behind to defeat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFL championship game for the second year in a row, in one of the most famous games in NFL lore: The [[NFL Championship Game, 1967|Ice Bowl]].\n\n===Oakland Raiders===\n{{Main article|1967 Oakland Raiders season}}\n{{See also|1967 American Football League Championship Game}}\n\nThe Raiders, led by head coach [[John Rauch]], had stormed to the top of the AFL with a 13\u20131 regular season record (their only defeat was an October 7 loss to the [[New York Jets]], 27\u201314), and went on to crush the [[Houston Oilers]], 40\u20137, in the AFL Championship game. They had led all AFL and NFL teams in scoring with 468 points. And starting quarterback [[Daryle Lamonica]] had thrown for 3,228 yards and an AFL-best 30 touchdown passes.\n\nThe offensive line was anchored by center [[Jim Otto]] and guard [[Gene Upshaw]], along with Pro Bowlers [[Harry Schuh]] and [[Wayne Hawkins]]. Wide receiver [[Fred Biletnikoff]] led the team with 40 receptions for 876 yards, an average of 21.3 yards per catch. On the other side of the field, tight end [[Billy Cannon]] caught 32 passes for 629 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. In the backfield, the Raiders had three running backs, [[Clem Daniels]], [[Hewritt Dixon]], and [[Pete Banaszak]], who carried the ball equally and combined for 1,510 yards and 10 touchdowns. On special teams, defensive back [[Rodger Bird]] led the AFL with 612 punt return yards and added another 148 yards returning kickoffs.\n\nThe main strength of the Raiders was their defense, nicknamed \"The 11 Angry Men\". The defensive line was anchored by Pro Bowlers [[Tom Keating (American football)|Tom Keating]] and [[Ben Davidson]]. Davidson was an extremely effective pass rusher who had demonstrated his aggressiveness in a regular season game against the [[New York Jets]] by breaking the jaw of Jets quarterback [[Joe Namath]] while sacking him. Behind them, Pro Bowl linebacker [[Dan Conners]] excelled at blitzing and pass coverage, recording 3 interceptions. The Raiders also had two Pro Bowl defensive backs: [[Willie Brown (football player)|Willie Brown]], who led the team with 7 interceptions, and [[Kent McCloughan]], who had 2 interceptions. Safety [[Warren Powers]] recorded 6 interceptions, returning them for 154 yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n===Super Bowl pregame news and notes===\nDespite Oakland's accomplishments, and expert consensus that this was the weakest of all the Packer NFL championship teams, Green Bay was a 14-point favorite to win the Super Bowl. Like the previous year, most fans and sports writers believed that the top NFL teams were superior to the best AFL teams.\n\nThus, most of the drama and discussions surrounding the game focused not on which team would win, but on the rumors that Lombardi might retire from coaching after the game. The game also proved to be the final one for Packers [[wide receiver]] [[Max McGee]], one of the heroes of [[Super Bowl I]], and place kicker [[Don Chandler]].\n\nThis was the first Super Bowl to use the Y-shaped goalposts (with one supporting post instead of two) invented by [[Jim Trimble]] and Joel Rottman; they had made their debut at the start of the season for both the AFL and NFL, and first appeared at the pro level in [[Canadian Football League|Canada]].<ref>https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Vum8Q7qG1CQ/VrUjHP2fDFI/AAAAAAAAa4k/IihICZ_23Ig/s1600/11-AP%2BSuper%2BBowl%2BII.png</ref>\n\n==Television==\nThe game was televised in the [[United States]] by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], with [[Ray Scott (sportscaster)|Ray Scott]] handling the [[play-by-play]] duties and [[color commentator]]s [[Pat Summerall]] and [[Jack Kemp]] in the broadcast booth. Kemp was the first Super Bowl commentator who was still an active player (with [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]] of the [[American Football League|AFL]]) at the time of the broadcast. The CBS telecast of this game is considered lost; all that survives are in-game photos, most of which were shown in the January 8, 1969 edition of [[Sports Illustrated]]. Not even [[NFL Films]], the league's official filmmaker, has a copy of the full game available; however, they do have game footage that they used for their game highlight film.<ref>http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000622357/article/the-mystery-of-the-super-bowl-i-tapes</ref><ref>http://www.nflfilms.com/specialorders/twNFL.php</ref>\n\nUnlike the previous year's game, Super Bowl II was televised live on only one network, which has been the case for all subsequent Super Bowl games. While the Orange Bowl was sold out for the game, the NFL's unconditional [[blackout (broadcasting)|blackout]] rules in place then prevented the live telecast from being shown in the Miami area.\n\nDuring the latter part of the second quarter, and again for three minutes of halftime, almost 80 percent of the country (with the exceptions of [[New York, New York|New York City]], [[Cleveland]], [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and much of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]) lost the video feed of the CBS broadcast. CBS, who had paid $2.5 million for broadcast rights, blamed the glitch on a breakdown in [[AT&T Corporation|AT&T]] [[Coaxial cable|cable lines]]. The overnight [[Arbitron]] rating was 43.0, a slight increase from Super Bowl I's combined CBS-NBC rating of 42.2.<ref>http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1968/1968-01-22-BC.pdf</ref>\n\n==Ceremonies and entertainment==\nThe pregame ceremonies featured two giant figures, one dressed as a Packers player and the other dressed as a Raiders player. They appeared on opposite ends of the field and then faced each other near the 50-yard line.\n\nThe [[Grambling State University]] band performed the national anthem as well as during the halftime show.<ref name=SB_Entertainment>{{cite web|title=Super Bowl - Entertainment|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/history/entertainment|publisher=National Football League|accessdate=February 6, 2016}}</ref> The same band was part of the halftime show of Super Bowl I the previous year.\n\n==Game summary==\n\n===First quarter===\nOn Oakland's first offensive play, [[Ray Nitschke]] shot through a gap and literally upended fullback [[Hewritt Dixon]] in what was one of Nitschke's signature plays of his entire career. The hit was so vicious, it prompted Jerry Green, a ''[[Detroit News]]'' columnist sitting in the press box with fellow journalists, to say in a deadpan, that the game was ''over''.<ref>Gruver, 2002 pg. 266</ref> The Packers opened up the scoring with Don Chandler's 39-yard field goal after marching 34 yards on their first drive of the game. Meanwhile, the Raiders were forced to punt on their first two possessions.\n\n===Second quarter===\nThe Packers then started their second possession at their own 3-yard line, and in the opening minutes of the second quarter, they drove 84 yards to the Raiders 13-yard line. However, they once again had to settle for a Chandler field goal to take a 6\u20130 lead. Later in the period, the Packers took the ball on their own 38-yard line following an Oakland punt. Raider cornerback Kent McCloughan jammed Packer split end Boyd Dowler at the line of scrimmage but then allowed him to head downfield, thinking that a safety would pick him up.<ref>''The Ultimate Super Bowl Book,'' Bob McGinn. MVP Books, 2009, p. 22.</ref> However, McCloughan and left safety Howie Williams were both influenced by the Packer backs who were executing a \"flood\" pattern, with halfback Travis Williams and fullback Ben Wilson running pass routes to the same side as Dowler. Dowler ran a quick post and was wide open down the middle. He grabbed Starr's pass well behind middle linebacker Dan Conners, and right safety Rodger Bird could not get over quickly enough.  Dowler outran the defense to score on a 62-yard touchdown reception, increasing the Packer lead to 13\u20130.\n\n[[File:1994 Super Bowl II Packers vs Raiders, Orange Bowl Jan 14th 1968 Coke Bottle (3444192815).jpg|thumb|180px|A commemorative [[Coca-Cola]] bottle produced in 1994]]\nAfter being completely dominated until this point, the Raiders offense finally struck back their next possession, advancing 79 yards in 9 plays, and scoring on a 23-yard touchdown pass from [[Daryle Lamonica]] to receiver Bill Miller. The score seemed to fire up the Raiders' defense, and they forced the Packers to punt on their next drive. Raiders returner [[Rodger Bird]] gave them great field position with a 12-yard return to Green Bay's 40-yard line, but Oakland could only gain 1 yard with their next 3 plays and came up empty when [[George Blanda]]'s 47-yard field goal attempt fell short of the goal posts. Oakland's defense again forced Green Bay to punt after 3 plays on the ensuing drive, but this time after calling for a fair catch, Bird fumbled punter [[Donny Anderson]]'s twisting, left footed kick, and Green Bay's Dick Capp recovered the ball. After 2 incomplete passes, Starr threw a 9-yard completion to Dowler (despite a heavy rush from Ike Lassiter) to set up Chandler's third field goal from the 43 as time expired in the first half, giving the Packers a 16\u20137 lead.\n\nAt halftime, Packers guard [[Jerry Kramer]] said to his teammates (referring to Lombardi), \"Let's play the last 30 minutes for the old man.\"<ref>Jerry Kramer, \"Super Bowl II,\" ''Super Bowl: The Game of Their Lives,'' Danny Peary, editor. Macmillan, 1997. {{ISBN|0-02-860841-0}}</ref>\n\n===Third quarter===\nAny chance the Raiders might have had to make a comeback seemed to completely vanish in the second half. The Packers had the ball three times in the third quarter, and held it for all but two and a half minutes. On the Packers second drive of the half starting at their own 17, Ben Wilson ripped up the middle for 14 yards on a draw play.  Anderson picked up 8 yards on a sweep, and Wilson carried to within inches of the first down.  Starr then pulled one of his favorite plays on third down and short yardage, faking to Wilson and completing a 35-yard pass to wide receiver [[Max McGee]] who had slipped past three Raiders at the line of scrimmage.  This was McGee's only reception of the game, and the final one of his career.  Starr then hit Carroll Dale on a sideline route at the Oakland 13.  Starr overthrew Donny Anderson wide open in the end zone, but on the next play he rolled out to the right and threw back to Anderson who was tackled on the two by linebacker Gus Otto.  The next play was a broken play, as Anderson thought he saw daylight to the right but ran into Starr. The Packers were not rattled, and the line and fullback Ben Wilson wiped out the Raiders on Anderson's 2-yard touchdown run over right tackle, making the score 23\u20137.\n\nPacker guard Jerry Kramer must have taken to heart his plea to play the second half for Coach Lombardi.  On this drive, game films show him blowing Dan Conners out of Wilson's path on the draw play, then flattening Conners again on Anderson's scoring run.\n\nAgain the Green Bay defense forced Oakland to go three-and-out, and the Raiders punted.  The Packers drove from their own 39 to the Raider 24 and increased their lead to 26\u20137 as Chandler kicked his fourth field goal (which hit the crossbar from 31 yards out and bounced over).\n\n===Fourth quarter===\nEarly in the fourth quarter, Starr was knocked out of the game when he jammed the thumb on his throwing hand on a sack by Davidson. (Starr was replaced by [[Zeke Bratkowski]], who was then sacked on his only pass attempt.) But later in the period, the Packers put the game completely out of reach when defensive back [[Herb Adderley]] intercepted a pass intended for [[Fred Biletnikoff]] and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown, making the score 33\u20137. Adderley laid back as the Raider end ran a curl route, then dashed in front of him to snare the ball and scored with the help of a crushing downfield block by tackle Ron Kostelnik.  \n\nOakland did manage to score on their next drive after the turnover with a second 23-yard touchdown pass from Lamonica to Miller, set up by [[Pete Banaszak]]'s 41-yard reception on the previous play. But all the Raiders' second touchdown did was make the final score look remotely more respectable, 33\u201314.\n\nAt the end of the game, coach Lombardi was carried off the field by his victorious Packers in one of the more memorable images of early Super Bowl history. It was in fact Lombardi's last game as Packer coach and his ninth consecutive playoff victory.\n\nOakland's Bill Miller was the top receiver of the game with 5 receptions for 84 yards and 2 touchdowns. Green Bay fullback [[Ben Wilson (American football)|Ben Wilson]] was the leading rusher of the game with 62 yards despite missing most of the fourth quarter while looking for a lost contact lens on the sidelines. [[Don Chandler]] ended his Packer career in style with 4 field goals. Lamonica finished the game with 15 out of 34 pass completions for 208 yards, 2 touchdowns, and 1 interception. Bart Starr completed 13 of 24 (with a couple of dropped passes) for 202 yards and one touchdown; his passer rating for the game was 96.2 to Lamonica's 71.7. The Packers outgained the Raiders in rushing yardage 160 to 107, led in time of possession by 35:54 to 24:06, had no turnovers, and only one penalty.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

[[Endemic (ecology)|Endemic]] to [[Africa]], it is usually found in the open grasslands and savannah of the [[Sub-Saharan Africa|sub-Saharan region]]. [[John Frederick Miller]] described the species in 1779. Although a member of the order [[Accipitriformes]], which also includes many other [[Diurnal animal|diurnal]] birds of prey such as [[kite (bird)|kites]], [[hawk]]s, [[vulture]]s, and [[harrier (bird)|harriers]], it is placed in its own family, [[Sagittariidae]]. The secretarybird is instantly recognisable as a very large bird with an eagle-like body on [[crane (bird)|crane-like]] legs which increases the bird's height to as much as {{convert|1.3|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar in appearance. Adults have a featherless red-orange face and predominantly grey plumage, with a flattened dark crest and black [[flight feather]]s and thighs.\n\nBreeding can take place at any time of year, but tends to be late in the dry season. The nest is built at the top of a thorny tree, and a clutch of one to three eggs is laid. In years with plentiful food all three young can survive to fledging. The secretarybird hunts and catches prey on the ground, often stomping on victims to kill them. Insects and small vertebrates make up its diet. \n\nAlthough the secretarybird occurs over a very large range, the results of localised surveys suggest that the total population is experiencing a rapid decline, probably as a result of habitat degradation.

This short time of contact suggests that the secretarybird relies on superior visual targeting to determine the precise location of the prey's head. Although little is known about its visual field, it is assumed that it is large, frontal and binocular. Secretarybirds have unusually long legs (nearly twice as long as other ground birds of the same body mass), which is thought to be an adaptation for the bird's unique stomping/striking hunting method. However, these long limbs appear to also lower its running efficiency.

References are also made to the ''Varshtm\u0101nsar'' section, which also included information about '''Gay\u014dmart''' which Ahura Mazda had given to [[Zoroaster]]: \"For 30 centuries I kept the world from corruption and decay, when the 30th century came to an end the [[Daeva|D\u012bvs]] assaulted Gay\u014dmart ...

Responding to a reported head injury after an altercation with others in the park, upon arrival the paramedics determined that the issue was not medically urgent, and requested that the police who were present take the subject to the hospital, claiming that he was intoxicated and unruly.

At Stanford, Weaver was a contributor to the ''[[Stanford Chaparral]]'' humor magazine. He was also known to engage in numerous pranks and practical jokes and earned the nickname \"The Mad Monk\". He was reportedly suspended from Stanford in 1937 (the year he graduated) for pulling a prank on the train home from the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].<ref name=pittsburg /><ref>{{cite news|title=DOODLES WEAVER AT TIMES DINNER|date=December 17, 1950|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=B11}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio and recordings===\nOn radio during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was heard as an occasional guest on [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]'s program and on the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.\n\nIn 1946, Weaver signed on as a member of [[Spike Jones]]'s City Slickers band. Weaver was heard on Jones's 1947\u201349 radio shows, where he introduced his comedic Professor Feetlebaum (which Weaver sometimes spelled as Feitlebaum),<ref name=young/> a character who spoke in [[Spoonerism]]s. Part of the Professor's shtick was mixing up words and sentences in various songs and recitations as if he were suffering from myopia and/or dyslexia.<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike1.htm ''Spike Jones Murders Them All'']</ref> Weaver toured the country with the Spike Jones Music Depreciation Revue until 1951. The radio programs were often broadcast from cities where the Revue was staged.<ref>Dunning, John (1998). ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.</ref>\n\nOne of Weaver's most popular recordings is the Spike Jones parody of [[Rossini]]'s \"[[William Tell Overture (Spike Jones song)|William Tell Overture]]\". Weaver gives a close impression of the gravel-voiced sports announcer [[Clem McCarthy]] in a satire of a horse race announcer who forgets whether he's covering a horse race or a boxing match (\"It's Girdle in the stretch! Locomotive is on the rail! Apartment House is second with plenty of room! It's Cabbage by a head!\"). The race features a [[List of fictional horses|nag]] named Beetlebaum, who begins at long odds, runs the race a distant last\u2014and yet suddenly emerges as the winner. The oft-repeated \"Beetlebaum\" became so identified with the record that RCA reprinted the record label, adding \"Beetlebaum\" in parentheses after the song title. Jones and Weaver followed this hit with a 1949 parody of the [[Indianapolis 500]] automobile race, again with Weaver as commentator, and set to Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\". The surprise winner? Beetlebaum. When an angry listener named Beetlebaum threatened a lawsuit, Weaver changed the name to Feetlebaum.\n\nIn 1966, Weaver recorded a novelty version of \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"\u2014singing, mixing up the words, insulting, and interrupting, while playing the piano.\n\n===Writing===\nWeaver was a contributor to the early ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as described by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s Richard Corliss:\n:Among the funny stuff: Doodles Weaver's strict copy editing of the [[Gettysburg Address]], advising Lincoln to change \"fourscore and seven\" to eighty-seven (\"Be specific\"), noting that there are six \"dedicates\" (\"Study your [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]\"), wondering if \"proposition\" isn't misspelled and, finally exasperated, urging the writer to omit \"of the people, by the people, and for the people\" as \"superfluous.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,633658-3,00.html Corliss, Richard. \"That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!\" ''Time'', May 5, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109000247/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,633658-3,00.html |date=January 9, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Films and television===\nWeaver made his television debut on ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' in 1951. He performed an [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax]] cleanser commercial with a pig, and the audience reaction prompted the network to give him his own series. In 1951, ''The Doodles Weaver Show'' was NBC's summer replacement for [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''; it was telecast from June to September with Weaver, his wife Lois, vocalist Marian Colby, and the comedy team of Dick Dana and Peanuts Mann. The show's premise involved Weaver dealing with an assignment to stage a no-budget television series using only the discarded costumes, sets and props left behind by more popular network television shows away for the summer.<ref name=party/> The series ended in July 1951.\n\nWeaver went on to guest star on numerous television shows including ''[[Spike Jones#Television|The Spike Jones Show]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', and ''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]''. He also hosted several children's television series. In 1965, he starred in ''[[A Day With Doodles]]'', a series of six-minute shorts sold as alternative fare to cartoons for locally hosted kiddie television programs. Each episode featured Weaver in a first-person plural adventure (e.g., \"Today we are a movie actor\"), portraying himself and, behind false mustaches and costume hats, all the other characters in slapstick comedy situations with a voice over narration and minimal sets.<ref name=party>[http://www.tvparty.com/lostdoodles.html TV Party: Lost Kids Shows]</ref> The ending credits would invariably list \"Doodles... Doodles Weaver\" and \"Everybody Else... Doodles Weaver.\"\n\nHe portrayed eccentric characters in guest appearances on such television series as ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (where he played The Archer's henchman Crier Tuck), ''[[Land of the Giants]]'', ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet 1967]]'' and ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''. He appeared in more than 90 films, including ''[[The Great Imposter]]'' (1961), [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) (as the man helping [[Tippi Hedren]]'s character with her rental boat), [[Jerry Lewis]]'s ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963), ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961) and, in a cameo, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). He appeared in ''[[Six Pack Annie]]'' (1975). His last movie was ''[[Earthbound (1981 film)|Earthbound]]'' (1981).\n\n==Personal life==\nWeaver was married four times and had three children. His first marriage was to Beverly Masterman in 1939.<ref>{{cite news|title=BEAU PEEP WHISPERS|date=October 22, 1939|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=D4}}</ref> They had one child. They later divorced. His second marriage was to Evelyn Irene Paulsen from 1946 to 1949.

[[character actor]], comedian, and musician.\n\nBorn into a wealthy West Coast family, Weaver began his career in radio. In the late 1930s, he performed on [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]'s radio programs and ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''. He later joined [[Spike Jones]]' City Slickers. In 1957, Weaver hosted his own [[NBC]] variety show ''The Doodles Weaver Show''. In addition to his radio work, he also recorded a number of comedy records, appeared in films and guest starred on numerous television series from the 1950s through the 1970s. Weaver made his last onscreen appearance in 1981. Despondent over poor health, Weaver fatally shot himself in January 1983.\n\n==Early life==\nBorn in Los Angeles, Weaver was one of four children born to Sylvester Laflin Weaver, a wealthy roofing contractor, and Annabel (n\u00e9e Dixon) Weaver.<ref>{{cite book|title=Current Biography Yearbook|year=1956|publisher=H.

At Stanford, Weaver was a contributor to the ''[[Stanford Chaparral]]'' humor magazine. He was also known to engage in numerous pranks and practical jokes and earned the nickname \"The Mad Monk\". He was reportedly suspended from Stanford in 1937 (the year he graduated) for pulling a prank on the train home from the [[Rose Bowl Game|Rose Bowl]].<ref name=pittsburg /><ref>{{cite news|title=DOODLES WEAVER AT TIMES DINNER|date=December 17, 1950|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=B11}}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Radio and recordings===\nOn radio during the late 1930s and early 1940s, he was heard as an occasional guest on [[Rudy Vall\u00e9e]]'s program and on the ''[[Kraft Music Hall]]''.\n\nIn 1946, Weaver signed on as a member of [[Spike Jones]]'s City Slickers band. Weaver was heard on Jones's 1947\u201349 radio shows, where he introduced his comedic Professor Feetlebaum (which Weaver sometimes spelled as Feitlebaum),<ref name=young/> a character who spoke in [[Spoonerism]]s. Part of the Professor's shtick was mixing up words and sentences in various songs and recitations as if he were suffering from myopia and/or dyslexia.<ref>[http://www.ibras.dk/comedy/spike1.htm ''Spike Jones Murders Them All'']</ref> Weaver toured the country with the Spike Jones Music Depreciation Revue until 1951. The radio programs were often broadcast from cities where the Revue was staged.<ref>Dunning, John (1998). ''On The Air: The Encyclopedia of Old-Time Radio''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1998. {{ISBN|0-19-507678-8}}.</ref>\n\nOne of Weaver's most popular recordings is the Spike Jones parody of [[Rossini]]'s \"[[William Tell Overture (Spike Jones song)|William Tell Overture]]\". Weaver gives a close impression of the gravel-voiced sports announcer [[Clem McCarthy]] in a satire of a horse race announcer who forgets whether he's covering a horse race or a boxing match (\"It's Girdle in the stretch! Locomotive is on the rail! Apartment House is second with plenty of room! It's Cabbage by a head!\"). The race features a [[List of fictional horses|nag]] named Beetlebaum, who begins at long odds, runs the race a distant last\u2014and yet suddenly emerges as the winner. The oft-repeated \"Beetlebaum\" became so identified with the record that RCA reprinted the record label, adding \"Beetlebaum\" in parentheses after the song title. Jones and Weaver followed this hit with a 1949 parody of the Indianapolis 500 automobile race, again with Weaver as commentator, and set to Ponchielli's \"Dance of the Hours\". The surprise winner? Beetlebaum. When an angry listener named Beetlebaum threatened a lawsuit, Weaver changed the name to Feetlebaum.\n\nIn 1966, Weaver recorded a novelty version of \"[[Eleanor Rigby]]\"\u2014singing, mixing up the words, insulting, and interrupting, while playing the piano.\n\n===Writing===\nWeaver was a contributor to the early ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'', as described by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'''s Richard Corliss:\n:Among the funny stuff: Doodles Weaver's strict copy editing of the [[Gettysburg Address]], advising Lincoln to change \"fourscore and seven\" to eighty-seven (\"Be specific\"), noting that there are six \"dedicates\" (\"Study your [[Peter Mark Roget|Roget]]\"), wondering if \"proposition\" isn't misspelled and, finally exasperated, urging the writer to omit \"of the people, by the people, and for the people\" as \"superfluous.\"<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,633658-3,00.html Corliss, Richard. \"That Old Feeling: Hail, Harvey!\" ''Time'', May 5, 2004.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090109000247/http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,633658-3,00.html |date=January 9, 2009 }}</ref>\n\n===Films and television===\nWeaver made his television debut on ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'' in 1951. He performed an [[Ajax (cleanser)|Ajax]] cleanser commercial with a pig, and the audience reaction prompted the network to give him his own series. In 1951, ''The Doodles Weaver Show'' was NBC's summer replacement for [[Sid Caesar]]'s ''[[Your Show of Shows]]''; it was telecast from June to September with Weaver, his wife Lois, vocalist Marian Colby, and the comedy team of Dick Dana and Peanuts Mann. The show's premise involved Weaver dealing with an assignment to stage a no-budget television series using only the discarded costumes, sets and props left behind by more popular network television shows away for the summer.<ref name=party/> The series ended in July 1951.\n\nWeaver went on to guest star on numerous television shows including ''[[Spike Jones#Television|The Spike Jones Show]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'', ''[[Dennis the Menace (1959 TV series)|Dennis the Menace]]'', and ''[[The Tab Hunter Show]]''. He also hosted several children's television series. In 1965, he starred in ''[[A Day With Doodles]]'', a series of six-minute shorts sold as alternative fare to cartoons for locally hosted kiddie television programs. Each episode featured Weaver in a first-person plural adventure (e.g., \"Today we are a movie actor\"), portraying himself and, behind false mustaches and costume hats, all the other characters in slapstick comedy situations with a voice over narration and minimal sets.<ref name=party>[http://www.tvparty.com/lostdoodles.html TV Party: Lost Kids Shows]</ref> The ending credits would invariably list \"Doodles... Doodles Weaver\" and \"Everybody Else... Doodles Weaver.\"\n\nHe portrayed eccentric characters in guest appearances on such television series as ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'' (where he played The Archer's henchman Crier Tuck), ''[[Land of the Giants]]'', ''[[Dragnet (franchise)|Dragnet 1967]]'' and ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]''. He appeared in more than 90 films, including ''[[The Great Imposter]]'' (1961), [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]'' (1963) (as the man helping [[Tippi Hedren]]'s character with her rental boat), [[Jerry Lewis]]'s ''[[The Nutty Professor (1963 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' (1963), ''[[Pocketful of Miracles]]'' (1961) and, in a cameo, ''[[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World]]'' (1963). He appeared in ''[[Six Pack Annie]]'' (1975). His last movie was ''[[Earthbound (1981 film)|Earthbound]]'' (1981).\n\n==Personal life==\nWeaver was married four times and had three children. His first marriage was to Beverly Masterman in 1939.<ref>{{cite news|title=BEAU PEEP WHISPERS|date=October 22, 1939|work=The Los Angeles Times|page=D4}}</ref> They had one child. They later divorced.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager. Jones left the band less than a month before his death in 1969, having already been replaced by [[Mick Taylor]]. Taylor left in 1974 and was replaced in 1975 by [[Ronnie Wood]] who has since remained. Since Wyman's departure in 1993, [[Darryl Jones]] has served as touring bassist and contracted musician. The Stones have not had an official keyboardist since 1963, but have employed several musicians in that role, including [[Jack Nitzsche]] (1965\u20131971), [[Nicky Hopkins]] (1967\u20131982), [[Billy Preston]] (1971\u20131981), [[Ian McLagan]] (1978\u20131981), and [[Chuck Leavell]] (1982\u2013present).\n\nThe Rolling Stones were at the forefront of the [[British Invasion]] of bands that became popular in the United States in 1964 and were identified with the youthful and rebellious [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. Rooted in [[blues]] and early [[rock and roll]], the band started out playing covers but found more success with their own material; songs such as \"[[(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction]]\" and \"[[Paint It Black]]\" became international hits, and ''[[Aftermath (Rolling Stones album)|Aftermath]]'' (1966) \u2013 their first entirely original album \u2013 has been considered the most important of the band's formative records.<ref name=\"telegraph\">{{cite news|date=17 May 2018|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/music/what-to-listen-to/rolling-stones-defining-moments/aftermath-released-1966although-their-first-two-albums--the-roll/|title=Aftermath released, 1966|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=27 November 2018}}</ref> After a short period of experimentation with [[psychedelic rock]] in the mid-1960s, the group returned to its \"bluesy\" roots with ''[[Beggars Banquet]]'' (1968), ''[[Let It Bleed]]'' (1969), ''[[Sticky Fingers]]'' (1971), and ''[[Exile on Main St.]]'' (1972).

During the 1980s, the band infighting curtailed their output and they only released two more underperforming albums and did not tour for the rest of the decade. Their fortunes changed at the end of the decade, when they released ''[[Steel Wheels]]'' (1989), promoted by a large stadium and arena tour, the [[Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle Tour]]. Since the 1990s, new material has been less frequent. Despite this, the Rolling Stones continue to be a huge attraction on the live circuit. By 2007, the band had four of the top five [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing concert tours]] of all time: [[Voodoo Lounge Tour]] (1994\u20131995), [[Bridges to Babylon Tour]] (1997\u20131998), [[Licks Tour]] (2002\u20132003) and [[A Bigger Bang (concert tour)|A Bigger Bang]] (2005\u20132007).{{sfn|Nelson|2010|p=141}} Musicologist [[Robert Palmer (writer)|Robert Palmer]] attributes the endurance of the Rolling Stones to their being \"rooted in traditional verities, in rhythm-and-blues and soul music\", while \"more ephemeral pop fashions have come and gone\".<ref>{{cite news|first=Robert|last=Palmer|authorlink=Robert Palmer (writer)|date=27 December 1981|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|title=The Year of the Rolling Stones|newspaper=New York Times|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701174542/http://www.nytimes.com/1981/12/27/arts/the-year-of-the-rolling-stones.html|archivedate=1 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe Rolling Stones were inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in 1989 and the [[UK Music Hall of Fame]] in 2004. ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked them fourth on the \"[[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]]\" list and their [[List of best-selling music artists|estimated record sales]] is 240 million. They have [[The Rolling Stones discography|released]] 30 studio albums, 23 live albums and numerous compilations. ''Let It Bleed'' (1969) marked the first of five consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio and live albums in the UK. ''Sticky Fingers'' (1971) was the first of eight consecutive No.&nbsp;1 studio albums in the US. In 2008, the band ranked 10th on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 All-Time Top Artists chart. In 2012, the band celebrated its 50th anniversary.

The first stable line-up consisted of bandleader [[Brian Jones]] (guitar, harmonica, keyboards), [[Mick Jagger]] (lead vocals, harmonica), [[Keith Richards]] (guitar, vocals), [[Bill Wyman]] (bass guitar), [[Charlie Watts]] (drums), and [[Ian Stewart (musician)|Ian Stewart]] (piano). Stewart was removed from the official line-up in 1963 but continued to work with the band as a contracted musician until his death in 1985. The band's primary songwriters, [[Jagger\u2013Richards]], assumed leadership after [[Andrew Loog Oldham]] became the group's manager.

Brian Jones experimented with the use of non-traditional instruments such as the [[sitar]] and [[slide guitar]] in their early days.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170725181034/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-rolling-stones-songs/|archivedate=25 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|title=Top 10 Brian Jones Rolling Stones Multi-Instrumentalist Songs|website=Ultimate Classic Rock|language=en-US|access-date=18 August 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710161316/http://ultimateclassicrock.com/brian-jones-multi-instrumentalist-songs/|archivedate=10 July 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Gn24CgAAQBAJ&pg=PA23&lpg=PA23&dq=Brian+Jones+non-traditional+instruments+such+as+the+sitar+and+slide+guitar+in+their+early+days#v=onepage&q=Brian%20Jones%20non-traditional%20instruments%20such%20as%20the%20sitar%20and%20slide%20guitar%20in%20their%20early%20days&f=false|title=Massive Pissed Love: Nonfiction 2001\u20132014|last=Hell|first=Richard|date=1 October 2015|publisher=Soft Skull Press|isbn=9781619026742|pages=23|language=en}}</ref> The group started out covering early rock 'n' roll and blues songs, and have never stopped playing live or recording [[cover song]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|title=Time Is on My Side \u2013 The Rolling Stones : Songs, Reviews, Credits, Awards|website=AllMusic|accessdate=22 November 2014|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904024728/http://www.allmusic.com/song/time-is-on-my-side-mt0004159585|archivedate=4 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nJagger and Richards had a shared admiration of [[Jimmy Reed]], Muddy Waters,<ref name=\":18\">{{Cite journal|last=Hellmann|first=John M.|date=1973|title='I'm a Monkey': The Influence of the Black American Blues Argot on the Rolling Stones|journal=The Journal of American Folklore|volume=86|issue=342|pages=367\u2013373|doi=10.2307/539360|jstor=539360}}</ref> and [[Howlin' Wolf]].<ref name=\":18\" /> [[Little Walter]] influenced Brian Jones.
