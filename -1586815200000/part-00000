The resulting [[Piasecki PV-3|PV-3]] became the world's first successful tandem rotor design.

The name would later be applied to other Piasecki tandem-rotor helicopters of similar design.\n\nAn evolutionary follow-on design to the HRP-1, designated HRP-2, used an all-metal skin and switched crew seating to side-by-side instead of tandem; however, the limited power meant only five were built, all for the Coast Guard.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> In 1949, Piasecki provided the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21 Workhorse]] to the [[United States Air Force]], an improved version of the HRP-2 with a more powerful [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] radial engine.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>  Piasecki's tandem-rotor helicopters flew higher than competing single rotor designs, and offered a smoother ride.\n\nAt approximately the same time the HRP-1 and HRP-2 were being developed, the Navy commissioned Piasecki to design a smaller tandem-rotor utility helicopter; the resulting prototype, which Piasecki called the PV-14, was designated XHJP-1.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> These went into production as the [[Piasecki HUP Retriever|HUP-1]] (PV-18), with the first variants delivered to both the Navy and the [[United States Army]] (as the H-25) in 1949; in total, 339 were delivered to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and France by 1954.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> The HUP was designed with overlapping main rotor blades, which reduced the size so they could be carried on aircraft carrier elevators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhelicopter.museum/aircraft/piasecki-pv-14-hup-2-retriever |title=Piasecki PV-14 / HUP-2 Retriever |publisher=American Helicopter Museum & Education Center |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Piasecki is forced out===\n[[File:Piasecki YH-16 helicopter in flight.jpg|thumb|right|YH-16 prototype in flight]]\n[[Donovan Berlin|Don R.

Under Piasecki, the company began the PV-15 large transport tandem helicopter project (designated [[Piasecki H-16 Transporter|H-16]]).

He had formed a new company, [[Piasecki Aircraft|Piasecki Aircraft Corporation]] to pursue the development of compound helicopters and other rotorcraft. In two successive special stockholders' meetings the board then changed the name of Piasecki Helicopter to '''Vertol''' (for [[vertical take-off and landing]]) Aircraft Corporation and amended the bylaws to bar Piasecki's re-election as a director, on the grounds that he was running a rival company.<ref name=\"trimble\"/>{{rp|257\u20138}}\n\n===Acquisition by Boeing===\nIn 1956, Vertol began developing a successor to the HUP with improved lift capacity by using [[turboshaft]] engines.

Impressed, the Army awarded a contract for ten production aircraft (then designated YHC-1A) in June and later asked Vertol in March 1959 to produce a larger version, which was designated [[CH-47 Chinook|V-114]].

The name would later be applied to other Piasecki tandem-rotor helicopters of similar design.\n\nAn evolutionary follow-on design to the HRP-1, designated HRP-2, used an all-metal skin and switched crew seating to side-by-side instead of tandem; however, the limited power meant only five were built, all for the Coast Guard.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> In 1949, Piasecki provided the [[Piasecki H-21|H-21 Workhorse]] to the [[United States Air Force]], an improved version of the HRP-2 with a more powerful [[Wright R-1820 Cyclone]] radial engine.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/>  Piasecki's tandem-rotor helicopters flew higher than competing single rotor designs, and offered a smoother ride.\n\nAt approximately the same time the HRP-1 and HRP-2 were being developed, the Navy commissioned Piasecki to design a smaller tandem-rotor utility helicopter; the resulting prototype, which Piasecki called the PV-14, was designated XHJP-1.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> These went into production as the [[Piasecki HUP Retriever|HUP-1]] (PV-18), with the first variants delivered to both the Navy and the [[United States Army]] (as the H-25) in 1949; in total, 339 were delivered to the militaries of the United States, Canada, and France by 1954.<ref name=Vertical-legacy/> The HUP was designed with overlapping main rotor blades, which reduced the size so they could be carried on aircraft carrier elevators.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://americanhelicopter.museum/aircraft/piasecki-pv-14-hup-2-retriever |title=Piasecki PV-14 / HUP-2 Retriever |publisher=American Helicopter Museum & Education Center |accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Piasecki is forced out===\n[[File:Piasecki YH-16 helicopter in flight.jpg|thumb|right|YH-16 prototype in flight]]\n[[Donovan Berlin|Don R.

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.\n\n==History==\nThe original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago \u00c1lvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carre\u00f3n, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, \u00c1guedo del Rosario, Cen\u00f3n Nicdao, Nicol\u00e1s Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantale\u00f3n Torres, Valent\u00edn Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, P\u00edo H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valent\u00edn Sol\u00eds and Jos\u00e9 Palma.\n\nThe party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907\u20131916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916\u20131935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935\u20131941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].\n\nBy the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).

The populist ideology of the party remained to present day as described on their website.\n\n==History==\nThe original Nacionalista Party that was founded on August 21, 1901 in Calle Gunao, Quiapo, Manila, was forgotten. In that Quiapo Assembly, the following officers of the true Nacionalista were elected, namely Santiago \u00c1lvarez and Pascual Poblete as presidents; Andres Villanueva, vice president; Macario Sakay, secretary general; Francisco Carre\u00f3n, Alejandro Santiago, Domingo Moriones, \u00c1guedo del Rosario, Cen\u00f3n Nicdao, Nicol\u00e1s Rivera, Salustiano Santiago, Aurelio Tolentino, Pantale\u00f3n Torres, Valent\u00edn Diza, Briccio Pantas, Lope K. Santos, P\u00edo H. Santos, Salustiano Cruz, Valent\u00edn Sol\u00eds and Jos\u00e9 Palma.\n\nThe party began as the country's vehicle for independence, through the building of a modern nation-state and the advocacy of efficient self-rule, dominating the [[Philippine Assembly]] (1907\u20131916), the [[Philippine Legislature]] (1916\u20131935) and the pre-war years of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] (1935\u20131941). During the [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese occupation]], political parties were replaced by the [[KALIBAPI]].\n\nBy the second half of the century, the party was one of the main political contenders for leadership in the country in competition with the Liberals and the Progressives during the decades between the devastation of World War II and the violent suppression of partisan politics of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship.\n\nIn 1978, in a throwback to the Japanese occupation, political parties were asked to merge into the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]], although the Nacionalistas preferred to go into hibernation. Eventually, the party was revived during the late 1980s and early 1990s by the Laurel family, which has dominated the party since the 1950s. The Nacionalista Party is now being led by party president and former Seanator [[Manuel Villar]] and had three vice presidential candidates running independently or in tandem with other political parties ([[Alan Peter Cayetano]], [[Bongbong Marcos]] and [[Antonio Trillanes]]) in the [[2016 Philippine general election|2016 general elections]]. Two of the other present parties, the Liberal Party and the [[Nationalist People's Coalition]], are breakaways from the Nacionalista Party.<ref name=\"Neoliberalism\">Dayley, Robert (2016).
