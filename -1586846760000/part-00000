Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n== Schedule ==\n<small>All times are Greece Standard Time ([[UTC+2]])</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Like all other judo events, bouts lasted five minutes. If the bout was still tied at the end, it was extended for another five-minute, sudden-death period; if neither judoka scored during that period, the match is decided by the judges. The tournament bracket consisted of a single-elimination contest culminating in a gold medal match. There was also a repechage to determine the winners of the two bronze medals. Each judoka who had lost to a semifinalist competed in the repechage. The two judokas who lost in the semifinals faced the winner of the opposite half of the bracket's repechage in bronze medal bouts.\n\n== Schedule ==\n<small>All times are Greece Standard Time ([[UTC+2]])</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Lack of self-control, including in managing one's [[sex life]], indicated that a man was incapable of governing others; too much indulgence in \"low sensual pleasure\" threatened to erode the elite male's identity as a cultured person.<ref>Catharine Edwards, \"Unspeakable Professions: Public Performance and Prostitution in Ancient Rome,\" in ''Roman Sexualities'', pp. 67\u201368.</ref>\n\n=== Ancient Japan ===\n{{See also|Homosexuality in Japan}}\n\n[[File:Japanesepederasty18thcentury.jpg|left|thumb|250px|A ''[[wakash\u016b]]'' (wearing headscarf) sneaks a kiss from a female prostitute behind his patron's back.

In the book, he argued that bisexuality was the baseline sexual orientation for humans.

According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.<ref name=myers>Myers, David G.

In 1972 bisexual activist Don Fass founded the National Bisexual Liberation group in New York City, which issued ''The Bisexual Expression'', most likely the earliest bisexual newsletter.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1973 bisexual activist Woody Glenn was interviewed by a radio show of the [[National Organization for Women]] on WICC in Bridgeport, Connecticut.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1974, both ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' ran stories on \"bisexual chic,\" bringing bisexuality to mainstream attention as never before.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1976 the landmark book ''View from Another Closet: Exploring Bisexuality in Women,'' by Janet Mode, was published.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/bisex_lit.html |title=>> literature >> Bisexual Literature |publisher=glbtq |accessdate=2012-11-06 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106225852/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/bisex_lit.html |archivedate=2012-11-06 }}</ref>\n\nBisexuals were also important contributors to the larger LGBT rights movement. In 1972, Bill Beasley, a bisexual activist in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as well as the LGBT movement, was the core organizer of the first Los Angeles Gay Pride March. He was also active with the [[Gay Liberation Front]].<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1975, activist [[Carol Queen]] came out as bisexual and organized GAYouth in Eugene, Ore.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1977 [[Alan Rockway]], a psychologist and bisexual activist, co-authored America's first successful gay rights ordinance put to public vote, in Dade County, Florida. [[Anita Bryant]] campaigned against the ordinance, and Rockway began a boycott of Florida orange juice, which she advertised, in response. The San Francisco Bisexual Center also helped sponsor a press conference with lesbian activists [[Del Martin]] and [[Phyllis Lyon]], and pediatrician Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]], in opposition to Bryant. Bisexual activist Alexei Guren founded the Gay Teen Task Force in Miami, Fla., in response to Bryant's campaign. The Florida Citrus Commission canceled her contract as a direct response to this pressure.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1979, Dr. Marvin Colter founded ARETE, a support and social group for bisexuals in Whittier, Calif., which marched in the 1983 Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade and had a newsletter.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1979 A. Billy S. Jones, a bisexual founding member of the [[National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays]], helped organize the first black gay delegation to meet with President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s White House staff. Jones was also a core organizer of the 1979 March On Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights, and \"Third world conference: When will the ignorance end?,\" the first national conference for gay and lesbian people of color.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe bisexual movement had its own successes as well. Most notably, in 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the \"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\" supporting bisexuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |title=BiMedia &#124; Bisexual News & Opinion from |publisher=BiMedia.org |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015231948/http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |archive-date=2015-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Statement, which may have been \"the first public declaration of the bisexual movement\" and \"was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly,\" appeared in the Quaker ''[[Friends Journal]]'' and ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1972.<ref name=donaldson>{{Cite book | last = Donaldson | first = Stephen | year = 1995 | contribution = The Bisexual Movement's Beginnings in the 70s: A Personal Retrospective | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bisexualpolitics00tuck/page/31 31\u201345] | editor-last = Tucker | editor-first = Naomi | title = Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, & Visions | place = New York | publisher = Harrington Park Press | isbn = 1-56023-869-0 | postscript = <!--None--> | url = https://archive.org/details/bisexualpolitics00tuck/page/31 }}</ref><ref name=highleyman>{{cite news\n  |url=http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm\n  |title=PAST Out: What is the history of the bisexual movement?\n  |accessdate=2008-03-18\n  |last=Highleyman\n  |first=Liz\n  |date=2003-07-11\n  |work=LETTERS From CAMP Rehoboth\n  |volume=13\n  |number=8\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531051440/http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Martin 8\">{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Robert|title=Quakers 'come out' at conference|journal=The Advocate|date=1972-08-02|issue=91|page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 Harriet Levi and Maggi Rubenstein founded the San Francisco Bisexual Center.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> It was the longest surviving bisexual community center, offering counseling and support services to Bay Area bisexuals, as well as publishing a newsletter, ''The Bi Monthly'', from 1976 to 1984.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1978, bisexual activist Dr. [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] introduced the [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]] in his book ''The bisexual option: A concept of one-hundred percent intimacy,'' in which he examined the incidence and nature of bisexuality, the attitudes of bisexual persons, and the rewards of bisexuality.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Bisexual activism also began to spread beyond the coasts, as from 1978 until 1979, several Midwestern bisexual groups were created, such as One To Five (founded by Scott Bartell and Gary Lingen for Minneapolis/St.Paul, Minn), BI Women Welcome in Minneapolis, The BI Married Men's Group in the Detroit suburbs, and BI Ways in Chicago.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\n====1980s====\nIn the 1980s AIDS began to affect the LGBT community, and bisexual people took an important role in combating it. In 1981 bisexual activists [[David Lourea]] and [[Cynthia Slater]] presented safer-sex education in bathhouses and [[BDSM]] clubs in San Francisco. Also in 1981, bisexual activist Alexei Guren, on the founding board of the Health Crisis Network (now CareResource) in Miami, Fla., began outreach and advocacy for Latino married men who have sex with men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1984, bisexual activist David Lourea finally persuaded the San Francisco Department of Public Health to recognize bisexual men in their official AIDS statistics (the weekly \"New AIDS cases and mortality statistics\" report), after two years of campaigning. Health departments throughout the United States began to recognize bisexual men because of this, whereas before they had mostly only recognized gay men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Bisexual activists also fought for the recognition of women in the AIDS epidemic. From 1984 until 1986, bisexual activist Veneita Porter, of the Prostitute\u2019s Union of Massachusetts and COYOTE ([[Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics]]), advocated for women, transgender people, and injection drug users with AIDS.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1985, HIV-Positive bisexual activist Cynthia Slater organized the first Women\u2019s HIV/AIDS Information Switchboard.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> This sort of activism was particularly important for bisexuals as they were often blamed for spreading AIDS to their heterosexual partners. For example, in 1987, ''[[Newsweek]]'' portrayed bisexual men as \"the ultimate pariahs\" of the AIDS epidemic, and bisexual activist and person with AIDS Alan Rockway of BiPOL was quoted speaking against the stereotype.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> An October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter-writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe bisexual movement enjoyed some important firsts during the 1980s. The Boston Bisexual Women's Network, the oldest existing bisexual women's group, was founded in 1983 and began publishing their bi-monthly newsletter, ''BI Women''. It is the longest-existing bisexual newsletter in the US.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1983, BiPOL, the first and oldest bisexual political organization, was founded in San Francisco by bisexual activists Autumn Courtney, [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]], Arlene Krantz, David Lourea, Bill Mack, Alan Rockway, and Maggi Rubenstein.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1984, BiPOL sponsored the first bisexual rights rally, outside the [[Democratic National Convention]] in San Francisco.  The rally featured nine speakers from civil rights groups allied with the bisexual movement.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1984, the First East Coast Conference on Bisexuality (which was also the first regional bisexual conference in the US) was held at the Storrs School of Social Work at the University of Connecticut, with about 150 people participating.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Participants in the conference then founded the East Coast Bisexual Network in 1985, which later was renamed the [[Bisexual Resource Center]] (BRC) in 1993. In 1987, the East Coast Bisexual Network established the first Bisexual History Archives with bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]]\u2019 initial collection; archivist Clare Morton hosted researchers.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1987, the [[Bay Area Bisexual Network]], the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded by [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]], [[Ann Justi]] and Maggi Rubenstein.<ref name=\"ebar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=68259|title=Bisexual network celebrates 25 years|publisher=www.ebar.com |year=2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, [[Gary North (journalist)|Gary North]] published the first national bisexual newsletter, called ''Bisexuality: News, Views, and Networking.''<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1989 [[Cliff Arnesen]] testified before the U.S. Congress on behalf of bisexual, lesbian, and gay veteran's issues.<ref name=\"binetusa.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihistory2.html |title=BiNet USA |publisher=BiNet USA |date=1990-06-23 |accessdate=2015-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923135539/http://www.binetusa.org/bihistory2.html |archive-date=2017-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was the first veteran to testify about bisexual, lesbian, and gay issues and the first openly non-heterosexual veteran to testify on Capitol Hill about veteran's issues in general.<ref name=\"binetusa.org\"/> He testified on May 3rd, 1989, during formal hearings held before the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/2009/09/23/first-person-biography-of-a-bisexual-us-army-veteran |title=First Person Biography of a Bisexual US Army Veteran |publisher=GLAAD |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2015-08-05}}</ref> He also testified before the same Subcommittee on May 16, 1990, as part of an HIV/AIDS panel.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bisexuality/firstperson/cliff |title=2010 Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repealed!

The article \"[http://www.lanikaahumanu.com/OUT%20OUTRAGED.pdf The Bisexual Movement: Are We Visible Yet?]\", by [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]], appeared in the official Civil Disobedience Handbook for the March.

Bisexual health was one of eight workshop tracks at the conference, and the \"NAMES Project\" quilt was displayed with bisexual quilt pieces. Over 450 people attended from 20 states and 5 countries, and the mayor of San Francisco sent a proclamation \"commending the bisexual rights community for its leadership in the cause of social justice,\" and declaring June 23, 1990 Bisexual Pride Day.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> The conference also inspired attendees from Dallas to create the first bisexual group in Texas, called BiNet Dallas.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe bisexual movement also became more accepted as part of established institutions. In 1990, Susan Carlton offered the first academic course on bisexuality in America at [[UC Berkeley]], and in 1991, psychologists Sari Dworkin and Ron Fox became the founding co-chairs of the Task Force on Bisexual Issues of Division 44, the gay and lesbian group in the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1997, bisexual activist and psychologist Pat Ashbrook pioneered a national model for LGBT support groups within the Veterans Administration hospital system.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nBisexual literature became more prominent in the 1990s. In 1991, the [[Bay Area Bisexual Network]] began publishing the USA's first national bisexual quarterly magazine, ''Anything That Moves: Beyond The Myths Of Bisexuality,'' founded by [[Karla Rossi]], who was the managing editor of the editorial collective until 1993.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /><ref name=\"ebar.com\"/> 1991 also saw the publication of one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, ''[[Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out]]'', an anthology edited by [[Loraine Hutchins]] and [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]]. After this anthology was forced to compete (and lost) in the [[Lambda Literary Awards]] under the category Lesbian Anthology, and in 2005, ''Directed by Desire: Collected Poems''<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Directed by Desire: Collected Poems\n |publisher=Copper Canyon Press\n |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/178530\n |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> a posthumous collection of the bisexual [[Jamaican American]] writer [[June Jordan|June Jordan's]] work had to compete (and won) in the category \"Lesbian Poetry\",<ref>{{cite web\n |title=2005 Lambda Literary Awards Recipients \n |publisher=Lambda Literary Foundation \n |url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/09/lambda-literary-awards-2005/ \n |accessdate=2011-10-16 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105334/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/09/lambda-literary-awards-2005/ \n |archivedate=2013-12-11 \n |df= \n}}</ref> [[BiNet USA]] led the bisexual community in a multi-year campaign eventually resulting in the addition of a Bisexual category, starting with the 2006 Awards. In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made the academic case for bisexuality with her book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for \"repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender.\"<ref>{{Cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92661-0 |page=249}}</ref> [[Bi Community News]] began publishing as a monthly print journal in the UK in 1995.  In 1997, bisexual activist Dr. [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] founded the ''Journal of Bisexuality'', the first academic, quarterly journal on bisexuality.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> However, other media proved more mixed in terms of representing bisexuals. In 1990, a film with a relationship between two bisexual women, called ''[[Henry and June]],'' became the first film to receive the NC-17 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).<ref name=\"glbtq2004\">{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film,2.html |title=>> arts >> Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |date=2004-12-28 |accessdate=2012-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922074844/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film%2C2.html |archive-date=2012-09-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But in 1993, bisexual activist [[Sheela Lambert]] wrote, produced, and hosted the first television series by and for bisexuals, called ''Bisexual Network.'' It aired for 13 weeks on NYC Public Access Cable.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nRegional organizations in the bisexual movement also began to have more impact. In 1992 the Bisexual Connection (Minnesota) sponsored the First Annual Midwest Regional Bisexual Conference, called \"BECAUSE (Bisexual Empowerment Conference: A Uniting, Supportive Experience).\"<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> That year Minnesota changed its State Civil Rights Law to grant the most comprehensive civil rights protections for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the country.  Minnesota's bisexual community had united with lesbian, gay, and transgender groups to lobby for this statute.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1992, the South Florida Bisexual Network (founded in 1989) and the Florida International University's Stonewall Students Union co-sponsored the First Annual Southeast Regional Bisexual Conference. Thirty-five people from at least four southeastern states attended.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1993 the First Annual Northwest Regional Conference was sponsored by [[BiNet USA]], the Seattle Bisexual Women's Network, and the Seattle Bisexual Men's Union. It was held in Seattle, and fifty-five people representing Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia attended.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In the UK, [[BiPhoria]] was formed in 1994, the oldest bi organisation extant in the UK today.\n\nAn important event in the LGBT rights movement in this decade was the 1993 [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation]]. As a result of lobbying by BiPOL (San Francisco), openly bisexual people held key leadership roles in local and regional organizing for the March, and for the first time bisexuals were included in the title of the March. Also, openly bisexual activist and author [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]] spoke at the rally, and over 1,000 people marched with the bisexual group. Coinciding with the March, [[BiNet USA]], the [[Bisexual Resource Center]] (BRC), and the Washington, DC-based Alliance of Multicultural Bisexuals (AMBi) sponsored the Second National Conference Celebrating Bisexuality in Washington, DC. Over than 600 people attended from the US and Europe, making it at the time the largest Bisexual Conference ever held.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nSeveral important surveys concerning bisexuality were conducted around this time. In 1993, Ron Fox authored the first large scale research study on bisexual identity, and established and maintained a comprehensive bibliography on bi research.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1993, ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'' showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual.<ref name=\"Kinsey FAQ\"/> In 1995 [[BiNet USA]] Bisexual Youth Initiative, Fayetteville, N.C., developed and mailed a national survey to LGBT youth programs. The survey was published and sent back to agencies, offering assistance to improve services to bisexual youth.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nIn 1992, Colorado voters approved by [[initiative]] an amendment to the [[Colorado]] state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize bisexuals or gay people as a [[protected class]].<ref name=\"lawdigitalcommons221\">{{cite journal | url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1986&context=bclr | title =Colorado's Amendment 2 and Homosexuals' Right to Equal Protection of the Law |last1= Zamansky |first= Stephen |journal= [[Boston College Law Review]] |volume= 35 |issue= 1 |pages= 221\u2013258 |date= December 1993}}</ref><ref name=opinion /> The amendment stated:\n \t\n<blockquote>Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.

'' Prior to this, \"bisexual\" was usually used to mean [[hermaphroditic]], often in reference to plants.\n\nUnder any label, openly bisexual people were rare in early American life.

In 1972, Bill Beasley, a bisexual activist in the [[Civil Rights Movement]] as well as the LGBT movement, was the core organizer of the first Los Angeles Gay Pride March. He was also active with the [[Gay Liberation Front]].<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1975, activist [[Carol Queen]] came out as bisexual and organized GAYouth in Eugene, Ore.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1977 [[Alan Rockway]], a psychologist and bisexual activist, co-authored America's first successful gay rights ordinance put to public vote, in Dade County, Florida. [[Anita Bryant]] campaigned against the ordinance, and Rockway began a boycott of Florida orange juice, which she advertised, in response. The San Francisco Bisexual Center also helped sponsor a press conference with lesbian activists [[Del Martin]] and [[Phyllis Lyon]], and pediatrician Dr. [[Benjamin Spock]], in opposition to Bryant. Bisexual activist Alexei Guren founded the Gay Teen Task Force in Miami, Fla., in response to Bryant's campaign. The Florida Citrus Commission canceled her contract as a direct response to this pressure.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1979, Dr. Marvin Colter founded ARETE, a support and social group for bisexuals in Whittier, Calif., which marched in the 1983 Los Angeles Gay Pride Parade and had a newsletter.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1979 A. Billy S. Jones, a bisexual founding member of the [[National Coalition of Black Lesbians and Gays]], helped organize the first black gay delegation to meet with President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s White House staff. Jones was also a core organizer of the 1979 March On Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights, and \"Third world conference: When will the ignorance end?,\" the first national conference for gay and lesbian people of color.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe bisexual movement had its own successes as well. Most notably, in 1972 a Quaker group, the Committee of Friends on Bisexuality, issued the \"Ithaca Statement on Bisexuality\" supporting bisexuals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |title=BiMedia &#124; Bisexual News & Opinion from |publisher=BiMedia.org |date=2012-02-10 |accessdate=2013-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015231948/http://bimedia.org/1984/june-1972-the-ithaca-statement/ |archive-date=2015-10-15 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Statement, which may have been \"the first public declaration of the bisexual movement\" and \"was certainly the first statement on bisexuality issued by an American religious assembly,\" appeared in the Quaker ''[[Friends Journal]]'' and ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' in 1972.<ref name=donaldson>{{Cite book | last = Donaldson | first = Stephen | year = 1995 | contribution = The Bisexual Movement's Beginnings in the 70s: A Personal Retrospective | pages = [https://archive.org/details/bisexualpolitics00tuck/page/31 31\u201345] | editor-last = Tucker | editor-first = Naomi | title = Bisexual Politics: Theories, Queries, & Visions | place = New York | publisher = Harrington Park Press | isbn = 1-56023-869-0 | postscript = <!--None--> | url = https://archive.org/details/bisexualpolitics00tuck/page/31 }}</ref><ref name=highleyman>{{cite news\n  |url=http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm\n  |title=PAST Out: What is the history of the bisexual movement?\n  |accessdate=2008-03-18\n  |last=Highleyman\n  |first=Liz\n  |date=2003-07-11\n  |work=LETTERS From CAMP Rehoboth\n  |volume=13\n  |number=8\n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080531051440/http://www.camprehoboth.com/issue07_11_03/pastout.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-05-31}}</ref><ref name=\"Martin 8\">{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Robert|title=Quakers 'come out' at conference|journal=The Advocate|date=1972-08-02|issue=91|page=8}}</ref>\n\nIn 1976 Harriet Levi and Maggi Rubenstein founded the San Francisco Bisexual Center.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> It was the longest surviving bisexual community center, offering counseling and support services to Bay Area bisexuals, as well as publishing a newsletter, ''The Bi Monthly'', from 1976 to 1984.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1978, bisexual activist Dr. [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] introduced the [[Klein Sexual Orientation Grid]] in his book ''The bisexual option: A concept of one-hundred percent intimacy,'' in which he examined the incidence and nature of bisexuality, the attitudes of bisexual persons, and the rewards of bisexuality.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Bisexual activism also began to spread beyond the coasts, as from 1978 until 1979, several Midwestern bisexual groups were created, such as One To Five (founded by Scott Bartell and Gary Lingen for Minneapolis/St.Paul, Minn), BI Women Welcome in Minneapolis, The BI Married Men's Group in the Detroit suburbs, and BI Ways in Chicago.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\n====1980s====\nIn the 1980s AIDS began to affect the LGBT community, and bisexual people took an important role in combating it. In 1981 bisexual activists [[David Lourea]] and [[Cynthia Slater]] presented safer-sex education in bathhouses and [[BDSM]] clubs in San Francisco. Also in 1981, bisexual activist Alexei Guren, on the founding board of the Health Crisis Network (now CareResource) in Miami, Fla., began outreach and advocacy for Latino married men who have sex with men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1984, bisexual activist David Lourea finally persuaded the San Francisco Department of Public Health to recognize bisexual men in their official AIDS statistics (the weekly \"New AIDS cases and mortality statistics\" report), after two years of campaigning. Health departments throughout the United States began to recognize bisexual men because of this, whereas before they had mostly only recognized gay men.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Bisexual activists also fought for the recognition of women in the AIDS epidemic. From 1984 until 1986, bisexual activist Veneita Porter, of the Prostitute\u2019s Union of Massachusetts and COYOTE ([[Call Off Your Old Tired Ethics]]), advocated for women, transgender people, and injection drug users with AIDS.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1985, HIV-Positive bisexual activist Cynthia Slater organized the first Women\u2019s HIV/AIDS Information Switchboard.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> This sort of activism was particularly important for bisexuals as they were often blamed for spreading AIDS to their heterosexual partners. For example, in 1987, ''[[Newsweek]]'' portrayed bisexual men as \"the ultimate pariahs\" of the AIDS epidemic, and bisexual activist and person with AIDS Alan Rockway of BiPOL was quoted speaking against the stereotype.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> An October 1989 Cosmopolitan magazine article that stereotyped bisexual men as dishonest spreaders of AIDS led to a letter-writing campaign by the New York Area Bisexual Network (NYABN). Cosmopolitan has printed no articles defaming bisexuals since the campaign.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nThe bisexual movement enjoyed some important firsts during the 1980s. The Boston Bisexual Women's Network, the oldest existing bisexual women's group, was founded in 1983 and began publishing their bi-monthly newsletter, ''BI Women''. It is the longest-existing bisexual newsletter in the US.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1983, BiPOL, the first and oldest bisexual political organization, was founded in San Francisco by bisexual activists Autumn Courtney, [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]], Arlene Krantz, David Lourea, Bill Mack, Alan Rockway, and Maggi Rubenstein.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1984, BiPOL sponsored the first bisexual rights rally, outside the [[Democratic National Convention]] in San Francisco.  The rally featured nine speakers from civil rights groups allied with the bisexual movement.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1984, the First East Coast Conference on Bisexuality (which was also the first regional bisexual conference in the US) was held at the Storrs School of Social Work at the University of Connecticut, with about 150 people participating.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Participants in the conference then founded the East Coast Bisexual Network in 1985, which later was renamed the [[Bisexual Resource Center]] (BRC) in 1993. In 1987, the East Coast Bisexual Network established the first Bisexual History Archives with bisexual activist [[Robyn Ochs]]\u2019 initial collection; archivist Clare Morton hosted researchers.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1987, the [[Bay Area Bisexual Network]], the oldest and largest bisexual group in the San Francisco Bay Area, was founded by [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]], [[Ann Justi]] and Maggi Rubenstein.<ref name=\"ebar.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&article=68259|title=Bisexual network celebrates 25 years|publisher=www.ebar.com |year=2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 1988, [[Gary North (journalist)|Gary North]] published the first national bisexual newsletter, called ''Bisexuality: News, Views, and Networking.''<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1989 [[Cliff Arnesen]] testified before the U.S. Congress on behalf of bisexual, lesbian, and gay veteran's issues.<ref name=\"binetusa.org\">{{cite web |url=http://www.binetusa.org/bihistory2.html |title=BiNet USA |publisher=BiNet USA |date=1990-06-23 |accessdate=2015-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170923135539/http://www.binetusa.org/bihistory2.html |archive-date=2017-09-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was the first veteran to testify about bisexual, lesbian, and gay issues and the first openly non-heterosexual veteran to testify on Capitol Hill about veteran's issues in general.<ref name=\"binetusa.org\"/> He testified on May 3rd, 1989, during formal hearings held before the U.S. House Committee on Veterans Affairs: Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/2009/09/23/first-person-biography-of-a-bisexual-us-army-veteran |title=First Person Biography of a Bisexual US Army Veteran |publisher=GLAAD |date=2009-09-23 |accessdate=2015-08-05}}</ref> He also testified before the same Subcommittee on May 16, 1990, as part of an HIV/AIDS panel.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.binetusa.org/bisexuality/firstperson/cliff |title=2010 Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repealed!

In 1990, Susan Carlton offered the first academic course on bisexuality in America at [[UC Berkeley]], and in 1991, psychologists Sari Dworkin and Ron Fox became the founding co-chairs of the Task Force on Bisexual Issues of Division 44, the gay and lesbian group in the [[American Psychological Association]].<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1997, bisexual activist and psychologist Pat Ashbrook pioneered a national model for LGBT support groups within the Veterans Administration hospital system.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nBisexual literature became more prominent in the 1990s. In 1991, the [[Bay Area Bisexual Network]] began publishing the USA's first national bisexual quarterly magazine, ''Anything That Moves: Beyond The Myths Of Bisexuality,'' founded by [[Karla Rossi]], who was the managing editor of the editorial collective until 1993.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /><ref name=\"ebar.com\"/> 1991 also saw the publication of one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, ''[[Bi Any Other Name: Bisexual People Speak Out]]'', an anthology edited by [[Loraine Hutchins]] and [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]]. After this anthology was forced to compete (and lost) in the [[Lambda Literary Awards]] under the category Lesbian Anthology, and in 2005, ''Directed by Desire: Collected Poems''<ref>{{cite web\n |title=Directed by Desire: Collected Poems\n |publisher=Copper Canyon Press\n |url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/178530\n |accessdate=2011-10-16}}</ref> a posthumous collection of the bisexual [[Jamaican American]] writer [[June Jordan|June Jordan's]] work had to compete (and won) in the category \"Lesbian Poetry\",<ref>{{cite web\n |title=2005 Lambda Literary Awards Recipients \n |publisher=Lambda Literary Foundation \n |url=http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/09/lambda-literary-awards-2005/ \n |accessdate=2011-10-16 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211105334/http://www.lambdaliterary.org/winners-finalists/04/09/lambda-literary-awards-2005/ \n |archivedate=2013-12-11 \n |df= \n}}</ref> [[BiNet USA]] led the bisexual community in a multi-year campaign eventually resulting in the addition of a Bisexual category, starting with the 2006 Awards. In 1995, Harvard Shakespeare professor [[Marjorie Garber]] made the academic case for bisexuality with her book ''Vice Versa: Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life,'' in which she argued that most people would be bisexual if not for \"repression, religion, repugnance, denial, laziness, shyness, lack of opportunity, premature specialization, a failure of imagination, or a life already full to the brim with erotic experiences, albeit with only one person, or only one gender.\"<ref>{{Cite book|author=Garber, Marjorie B. |authorlink=Marjorie Garber |title=Bisexuality and the Eroticism of Everyday Life |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |year=2000 |isbn=0-415-92661-0 |page=249}}</ref> [[Bi Community News]] began publishing as a monthly print journal in the UK in 1995.  In 1997, bisexual activist Dr. [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]] founded the ''Journal of Bisexuality'', the first academic, quarterly journal on bisexuality.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> However, other media proved more mixed in terms of representing bisexuals. In 1990, a film with a relationship between two bisexual women, called ''[[Henry and June]],'' became the first film to receive the NC-17 rating from the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA).<ref name=\"glbtq2004\">{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film,2.html |title=>> arts >> Bisexuality in Film |publisher=glbtq |date=2004-12-28 |accessdate=2012-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922074844/http://www.glbtq.com/arts/bisex_film%2C2.html |archive-date=2012-09-22 |url-status=dead }}</ref> But in 1993, bisexual activist [[Sheela Lambert]] wrote, produced, and hosted the first television series by and for bisexuals, called ''Bisexual Network.'' It aired for 13 weeks on NYC Public Access Cable.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nRegional organizations in the bisexual movement also began to have more impact. In 1992 the Bisexual Connection (Minnesota) sponsored the First Annual Midwest Regional Bisexual Conference, called \"BECAUSE (Bisexual Empowerment Conference: A Uniting, Supportive Experience).\"<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> That year Minnesota changed its State Civil Rights Law to grant the most comprehensive civil rights protections for bisexual, lesbian, gay, and transgender people in the country.  Minnesota's bisexual community had united with lesbian, gay, and transgender groups to lobby for this statute.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1992, the South Florida Bisexual Network (founded in 1989) and the Florida International University's Stonewall Students Union co-sponsored the First Annual Southeast Regional Bisexual Conference. Thirty-five people from at least four southeastern states attended.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In 1993 the First Annual Northwest Regional Conference was sponsored by [[BiNet USA]], the Seattle Bisexual Women's Network, and the Seattle Bisexual Men's Union. It was held in Seattle, and fifty-five people representing Washington, Oregon, Alaska, Montana, and British Columbia attended.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> In the UK, [[BiPhoria]] was formed in 1994, the oldest bi organisation extant in the UK today.\n\nAn important event in the LGBT rights movement in this decade was the 1993 [[March on Washington for Lesbian, Gay and Bi Equal Rights and Liberation]]. As a result of lobbying by BiPOL (San Francisco), openly bisexual people held key leadership roles in local and regional organizing for the March, and for the first time bisexuals were included in the title of the March. Also, openly bisexual activist and author [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]] spoke at the rally, and over 1,000 people marched with the bisexual group. Coinciding with the March, [[BiNet USA]], the [[Bisexual Resource Center]] (BRC), and the Washington, DC-based Alliance of Multicultural Bisexuals (AMBi) sponsored the Second National Conference Celebrating Bisexuality in Washington, DC. Over than 600 people attended from the US and Europe, making it at the time the largest Bisexual Conference ever held.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nSeveral important surveys concerning bisexuality were conducted around this time. In 1993, Ron Fox authored the first large scale research study on bisexual identity, and established and maintained a comprehensive bibliography on bi research.<ref name=\"binetusa\" /> Also in 1993, ''The Janus Report on Sexual Behavior'' showed that 5 percent of men and 3 percent of women considered themselves bisexual.<ref name=\"Kinsey FAQ\"/> In 1995 [[BiNet USA]] Bisexual Youth Initiative, Fayetteville, N.C., developed and mailed a national survey to LGBT youth programs. The survey was published and sent back to agencies, offering assistance to improve services to bisexual youth.<ref name=\"binetusa\" />\n\nIn 1992, Colorado voters approved by [[initiative]] an amendment to the [[Colorado]] state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive, or judicial action to recognize bisexuals or gay people as a [[protected class]].<ref name=\"lawdigitalcommons221\">{{cite journal | url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1986&context=bclr | title =Colorado's Amendment 2 and Homosexuals' Right to Equal Protection of the Law |last1= Zamansky |first= Stephen |journal= [[Boston College Law Review]] |volume= 35 |issue= 1 |pages= 221\u2013258 |date= December 1993}}</ref><ref name=opinion /> The amendment stated:\n \t\n<blockquote>Neither the State of Colorado, through any of its branches or departments, nor any of its agencies, political subdivisions, municipalities or school districts, shall enact, adopt or enforce any statute, regulation, ordinance or policy whereby homosexual, lesbian or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships shall constitute or otherwise be the basis of or entitle any person or class of persons to have or claim any minority status, quota preferences, protected status or claim of discrimination.

''You Fail Me Redux'' also features updated cover artwork with an inverted color scheme, a black-outlined hand on a white background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/converge_reveal_you_fail_me_redux|title=Converge Reveal 'You Fail Me Redux'|last=Adams|first=Gregory|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Exclaim!]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> The redux had the same track list as the vinyl version of the original album.\n\nKurt Ballou explained in an interview with [[Noisey]] why he felt that the album needed to be remixed/remastered:<blockquote>\"Probably since we did ''[[No Heroes]]'' [in 2006]. ''You Fail Me'' was the last time Converge did a record where I wasn\u2019t involved in the entire engineering process. The record that followed ''You Fail Me'', which was ''No Heroes,'' was the first time that I both recorded and mixed a Converge record, with the exception of ''[[The Poacher Diaries]]'', which was an EP or a split. Upon completing ''No Heroes'' and managing to make my bandmates happy with the work I did on that record, I thought that I\u2019d really like to go back and remix ''You Fail Me''. I recorded that one, but Matt Ellard, who did most of the engineering work on ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]'', was the one who mixed it. But it was also mixed under less than ideal circumstances.\"</blockquote><blockquote>''\"Jane Doe'' was mixed at [[Fort Apache Studios|Fort Apache]] on a console that Matt was familiar with, and we had sufficient time to do those mixes. With ''You Fail Me'', he came up and mixed in my studio, which he\u2019d never worked in before, and it was an unfamiliar console. He\u2019s a very malleable engineer and can work anywhere, but it probably wasn\u2019t his top choice to mix at my place. We also kept having power outages during the mixes. I can\u2019t remember the exact details, but I think we booked six days of mixing with him, but he ended up having to do it in about three because he\u2019d come in, work for half an hour, and the power would go out. It was mixed in the summer under brownout conditions, so we\u2019d have electricity in the morning while it was still relatively cool but then as things heated up in the afternoon we\u2019d lose power. So he spent a lot of time lying on the couch waiting for the power to come back on. I still think it turned out great, but there was something about the lack of consistency from song to song and a few other details that made me want to remix it. Sonically, I wanted to make it fit more logically between ''Jane Doe'' and ''No Heroes''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/convege-kurt-ballou-you-fail-me|title=Converge Guitarist/Producer Kurt Ballou Explains Why He Remixed 'You Fail Me' {{!}} NOISEY|access-date=2016-07-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Musical style and theme ==\nWhen asked about the concept of the album, Bannon said:<blockquote>\"Lyrically/Thematically: After ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]'' was recorded and released, I thought I was going to feel the emotional burden I was carrying lift from my shoulders. I had all the puzzle pieces there in front of me. Outlets bring closure, or at least that's what I thought. With that, I put myself out on the line looking for an emotional resolve with \"Jane...\" and it never came. When the album was released I didn't feel any better, nothing was changed. My depression kept collapsing on itself. At that point I stopped hoping and searching and I took a long hard look at my life and at my heart. I did a huge amount of soul searching and found so much failure within myself. That discovery was a massive realization. As I started to see clear again, I also saw the failure in friends and loved ones around me. How we fail each other, and how we fail ourselves. These are songs of failure. And ultimately, surviving self destruction and tragedy we all face in our lives. Musically our only goal was to write an album that moved us and challenged us.

The band was \"never quite content with the original mix\" and had guitarist [[Kurt Ballou]] remix the album and Alan Douches remaster it. ''You Fail Me Redux'' also features updated cover artwork with an inverted color scheme, a black-outlined hand on a white background.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://exclaim.ca/music/article/converge_reveal_you_fail_me_redux|title=Converge Reveal 'You Fail Me Redux'|last=Adams|first=Gregory|date=April 29, 2016|work=[[Exclaim!]]|accessdate=April 29, 2016}}</ref> The redux had the same track list as the vinyl version of the original album.\n\nKurt Ballou explained in an interview with [[Noisey]] why he felt that the album needed to be remixed/remastered:<blockquote>\"Probably since we did ''[[No Heroes]]'' [in 2006]. ''You Fail Me'' was the last time Converge did a record where I wasn\u2019t involved in the entire engineering process. The record that followed ''You Fail Me'', which was ''No Heroes,'' was the first time that I both recorded and mixed a Converge record, with the exception of ''[[The Poacher Diaries]]'', which was an EP or a split. Upon completing ''No Heroes'' and managing to make my bandmates happy with the work I did on that record, I thought that I\u2019d really like to go back and remix ''You Fail Me''. I recorded that one, but Matt Ellard, who did most of the engineering work on ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]'', was the one who mixed it. But it was also mixed under less than ideal circumstances.\"</blockquote><blockquote>''\"Jane Doe'' was mixed at [[Fort Apache Studios|Fort Apache]] on a console that Matt was familiar with, and we had sufficient time to do those mixes. With ''You Fail Me'', he came up and mixed in my studio, which he\u2019d never worked in before, and it was an unfamiliar console. He\u2019s a very malleable engineer and can work anywhere, but it probably wasn\u2019t his top choice to mix at my place. We also kept having power outages during the mixes. I can\u2019t remember the exact details, but I think we booked six days of mixing with him, but he ended up having to do it in about three because he\u2019d come in, work for half an hour, and the power would go out. It was mixed in the summer under brownout conditions, so we\u2019d have electricity in the morning while it was still relatively cool but then as things heated up in the afternoon we\u2019d lose power. So he spent a lot of time lying on the couch waiting for the power to come back on. I still think it turned out great, but there was something about the lack of consistency from song to song and a few other details that made me want to remix it. Sonically, I wanted to make it fit more logically between ''Jane Doe'' and ''No Heroes''.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://noisey.vice.com/blog/convege-kurt-ballou-you-fail-me|title=Converge Guitarist/Producer Kurt Ballou Explains Why He Remixed 'You Fail Me' {{!}} NOISEY|access-date=2016-07-10}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n== Musical style and theme ==\nWhen asked about the concept of the album, Bannon said:<blockquote>\"Lyrically/Thematically: After ''[[Jane Doe (album)|Jane Doe]]'' was recorded and released, I thought I was going to feel the emotional burden I was carrying lift from my shoulders. I had all the puzzle pieces there in front of me. Outlets bring closure, or at least that's what I thought. With that, I put myself out on the line looking for an emotional resolve with \"Jane...\" and it never came. When the album was released I didn't feel any better, nothing was changed. My depression kept collapsing on itself. At that point I stopped hoping and searching and I took a long hard look at my life and at my heart. I did a huge amount of soul searching and found so much failure within myself. That discovery was a massive realization. As I started to see clear again, I also saw the failure in friends and loved ones around me. How we fail each other, and how we fail ourselves. These are songs of failure. And ultimately, surviving self destruction and tragedy we all face in our lives. Musically our only goal was to write an album that moved us and challenged us.

Fried eggs are traditionally eaten for [[breakfast]] in many countries but may also be served at other times of the day.\n\n== Regional adaptations and specialities ==\n\n=== Austria, Germany, and Switzerland ===\n[[File:pecena jaja1.jpg|thumb|right|Fried eggs served with [[Vegeta (food)|Vegeta spice]] in [[Croatia]]]]\n\nFried eggs (''{{lang|de|Spiegeleier}}'') are a crucial part of such traditional German dishes as ''{{lang|de|[[Strammer Max]]}}'' (the egg is fried on one side with an unbroken yolk, and served \"sunny side up\" atop an open ham sandwich) or ''{{lang|de|Hamburger Schnitzel}}'' / ''{{lang|de|Holsteiner Schnitzel}}'' / ''Fernfahrerschnitzel'' (\"trucker's schnitzel\") \u2013 a similarly prepared fried egg served on a ''{{lang|de|[[Wiener Schnitzel]]}}''.\n\nFried eggs over (or side-by-side with) pan-fried potatoes is another common dish, sometimes served with spinach as a third component of the meal. Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the [[Egg white|white]] during the frying.\n\nAll of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or [[scrambled eggs]]) are a common part of a German breakfast.\n\n=== Cambodia ===\nIn Cambodia, a common dish is called loc lok, is a fried egg served on top of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven and tomato with either a portion of venison or beef with gravy, topped with a fried egg either duck or chicken egg.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nFried egg prepared sunny side up is known as \"''volsk\u00e9 oko''\" or \"''buli\u010d\u00ed oko''\" (bull's eye) in [[Czech cuisine]] and they are served either alone as part of breakfast, or for lunch with side of spinach and boiled potatoes.\n\n=== Egypt ===\nIn [[Egypt]], fried eggs are a common breakfast food. They are fried in fat such as [[vegetable oil]], [[butter]] or [[ghee]] and served either plain or with other foodstuffs such as [[tomato]]es, cheese, sausage or [[Ground meat|minced meat]] with onions and spices; they may also be served with [[ful medames]] (slow-cooked [[fava bean]]s).\n\n=== India ===\nIn [[India]], fried eggs are commonly served alone or as an accompaniment to bread. It may also occasionally be served with [[dosa]], [[paratha]], or [[roti]]. During or after the frying stage, they are sometimes sprinkled lightly with condiments such as [[black pepper]], [[chili powder]], [[Chili pepper|green chili]], and salt.\n\nA fried egg is commonly referred to as a \"poached egg\" in Indian English. In central and northern India's English-speaking middle classes and mid-level restaurants, \"single-fried\" refers to sunny side up (also known as a \"bullseye\") and \"double-fried\" to over hard. Street food parlance uses \"half-fry\" as a base term with \"half fry bina palti\" (un-flipped) meaning sunny side up and \"half fry palti maarke\" or \"alti palti\" (flipped) meaning over easy/medium/hard where the customer oversees the flip and says when.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 1.JPG|thumb|''[[Mi Goreng]]'' noodle served with fried egg and vegetables.]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], fried eggs are served either as ''telur ceplok'' or ''telur mata sapi'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for \"bull's eye egg\") which refer to sunny side up eggs, as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]) or as ''telur orak-arik'' (scrambled eggs). The fried eggs are either ''setengah matang'' which is half cooked with still runny yolk or ''matang'' which is well done. Fried eggs, especially as bull's eye egg, is a popular toppings for Indonesian fried rice (''[[nasi goreng]]'') and fried noodle (''[[mie goreng]]''), either freshly prepared noodle or cooked from [[instant noodle]] [[Indomie Mi goreng]]. A simple dish of fried sunny side up egg, served on top of steamed rice drizzled with ''[[kecap manis]]'' sweet soy sauce, is a favourite dish among Indonesian children. Other than served with rice, fried eggs might be served with bread as sandwich for breakfast. Seasoning include salt and pepper, sweet soy sauce, sometimes hot and spicy ''[[sambal]]'' chili paste.\n\n=== Ireland and the United Kingdom ===\n[[File:Lyme Regis harbour 02b.JPG|thumb|right|This traditional [[Full breakfast#England|full English breakfast]] includes bacon, fried egg, black pudding, grilled tomatoes, fried mushrooms, hash browns (not traditional), baked beans, and sausages.]]\nFried eggs can be served on [[toast]], or in a sandwich, with [[bacon]], [[sausage]]s, and a variety of condiments. Eggs are often part of the [[full breakfast]] commonly eaten in Britain and Ireland. Fried eggs are often served with [[ham]] or [[Bacon|gammon]] steak as a popular [[pub]] meal. The egg is cooked on a high heat and hot fat, oil or water may be splashed onto the top of the egg to baste it and cook the white. They are usually cooked without turning over. Sometimes the egg is turned to ensure the white is thoroughly cooked (\"over easy\", though this is more an American phrase), but the egg is almost always served with the yolk runny.\n\n=== Latin America, Portugal, and Spain ===\nIn [[Portuguese cuisine|Portugal]] and [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazil]], a runny egg placed over a steak with a side dish of rice and black beans is called a ''{{lang|pt-BR|[[bife a cavalo]]}}'', literally \"horse-riding steak\".\n\nA similar dish, with the name ''{{lang|es|bife a caballo}}'' in Spanish, is also common in Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay (called ''churrasco''); fried [[potato]]es and salad replace the beans and rice.\n\nIn [[Chilean cuisine|Chile]] and [[Peruvian cuisine|Peru]], a fried egg is included in ''{{lang|es|[[Lomo a lo Pobre|lomo a lo pobre]]}}'', ''{{lang|es|[[Chorrillana]]}}'', ''{{lang|es|[[Paila de huevo]]}}'', and several other dishes.\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Llapingacho|''llapingachos'']] include a sunny side up egg served over pan-seared cheesy mashed potatoes and fried sausage.\n\nIn northern [[Mexico]], ''{{lang|es|huevos montados}}'' (riding eggs) are served with [[refried beans]] and fried potatoes (or french fries).  Another common method of serving eggs in Mexico is ''{{lang|es|[[huevos a la mexicana]]}}'', which blends fried eggs with diced tomato, onion and green chili pepper; the amount of pepper added is often to order.\n\nThere are several other egg dishes in [[Mexican cuisine|Mexico]] which combine different ingredients: [[Huevos motule\u00f1os]] (in Yucat\u00e1n), ''{{lang|es|aporreados}}'' (mixed with refried beans), and ''{{lang|es|[[huevos rancheros]]}}'' (sunny side up eggs served over a corn [[tortilla]], covered with spicy salsa).  Also, in some parts of Mexico, fried eggs are served with a fresh tomato, onions, and [[cilantro]] salsa.  Red chili is optional, as is a blended sauce.\n\nIn [[Spanish cuisine|Spain]] fried eggs (''huevos fritos'') are a common dish. They are eaten alone, with meat, or with sausages. In this country, a fried egg served with boiled rice covered in tomato sauce is called ''[[arroz a la cubana]]'' in Spanish and the same dish is served in parts of Latin America, Italy (so-called ''occhio di bue'', transl: ox's eye), the Philippines, and Portugal as well.\n\nPoet [[Naz\u0131m Hikmet]] says, in an interview, that he stayed with a Spanish friend for a month and ate fried eggs almost every day.<ref name=\"Hikmet1989\">{{cite book|author=Vera Tulyakova Hikmet|title=N\u00e2z\u0131m\u02bela s\u00f6yle\u015fi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7GjiAAAAMAAJ|year=1989|publisher=Cem Yay\u0131nevi}}</ref>\n\nSpanish painter [[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez]] painted a portrait of an elderly lady frying eggs in 1618.<ref>[[:es:Vieja friendo huevos|Spanish painter Vel\u00e1zquez painted a portrait of an elderly lady frying eggs in 1618]]</ref>\n\n=== Japan ===\nCalled \"medama yaki\" (\u76ee\u7389\u713c\u304d, lit.: cooked eyeball), fried eggs are usually made sunny side up. They may be served with salt and pepper, soy sauce or Japanese style [[Worcestershire sauce]]. Fried eggs are a popular breakfast dish, with toasted sliced bread or rice.\n\n=== Korea ===\nCalled \uacc4\ub780\ubd80\uce68 (gyeranbuchim, 'egg pancake') or more commonly \uacc4\ub780\ud6c4\ub77c\uc774 (gyeran hurai, 'egg fry'). Eggs are fried in [[cooking oil]], sometimes with a sprinkle of salt. It is common to put a fried egg on top of ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[bibimbap]]}}'' or ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[Kimchi bokkeumbap]]}}''. Sometimes, rice dishes, such as ''{{lang|ko-Latn|bokkeumbap}}'', are simply made by applying a fried egg on a top of a bowl of hot rice, drizzled with a spoonful of ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[gochujang]]}}'' and [[sesame oil]]. Occasionally, [[sodium chloride|salt]] is added to fried eggs, and served as ''{{lang|ko-Latn|[[Banchan]]}}'', which refers to small dishes of food served along with [[Bap (food)|bap]]. In [[Busan]] area, fried eggs are often served with [[Jjajangmyeon]].\n\n=== Malaysia and Singapore ===\nJust like in Indonesia, [[nasi goreng]], one of the popular [[fried rice]] dish in [[Cuisine of Malaysia|Malaysia]] and [[Cuisine of Singapore|Singapore]] is often served with a fried egg.\n\n=== Netherlands ===\n[[File:Uitsmijter bacon kaas.jpg|upright|thumb|A [[Netherlands|Dutch]] ''{{lang|nl|uitsmijter spek en kaas}}'': fried eggs with bacon and cheese]]\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], a fried egg (''{{lang|nl|spiegelei}}'') is normally served on top of a slice of bread (white or whole wheat), often with fried bacon, for breakfast or lunch.<ref>{{cite book|author=van Limburg Stirum, C.

One version is fried together with ham and cheese (''{{lang|nl|uitsmijter ham en kaas}}''), or bacon and cheese (''{{lang|nl|uitsmijter spek en kaas}}'').  Another version is placed on buttered bread over a generous slice of cold meat, e.g., cooked beef or ham, and usually garnished with a dill pickle. It is a common lunch dish served in many [[Restaurant|cafe]]s, canteens, and [[lunch room]]s in the Netherlands.

It is served in the morning with garlic rice and a choice of breakfast meat such as beef [[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|''tapa'']], [[Longaniza#Philippines|longaniza]], fried milkfish, dried fish, ''[[tocino]]'' (caramelised pork), [[Spam (food)|Spam]], or [[corned beef]], such as in [[tapsilog]] and its variants.  In addition, fried eggs are eaten in a dish called [[Arroz a la cubana]], which is seasoned ground beef with raisins, cubed potatoes, tomato sauce, and olives, along with white rice and fried ripe plantains. Fried eggs are also a main ingredient in the noodle dish Pancit Batil Patong, where a fried egg is topped over stir-fried noodles.\n\n=== Russia ===\n[[File:Eggs 20072007.jpg|thumb|right|''{{lang|ru-Latn|Yaichnitsa}}'']]\n\nThe two most popular fried egg dishes commonly eaten in Russia are ''{{lang|ru-Latn|yaichnitsa}}'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|\u044f\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0446\u0430}}), a generic term for pure fried eggs, and ''omlet'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|\u043e\u043c\u043b\u0435\u0442}}), an [[omelet]] distinguished from simple eggs by addition of milk or other liquids.\n\nYaichnitsa has two main varieties, a ''{{lang|ru-Latn|glazun'ja}}'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0437\u0443\u043d\u044c\u044f}}), usually referring to the sunny-side up but generally meaning any variant with the unbroken yolk, and a scramble called ''{{lang|ru-Latn|boltunya}}'' (Russian: {{lang|ru|\u0431\u043e\u043b\u0442\u0443\u043d\u044c\u044f}}), which may have various toppings such as fried [[bacon]], [[ham]], [[salt pork]] or other [[cold cuts]], [[fried bread]] or onion, or other vegetables added. A common way of preparing both types is to have multiple eggs cracked into a saucepan or frying pan and cooked without flipping.

Some German cooks break the yolk and distribute it across the surface of the [[Egg white|white]] during the frying.\n\nAll of the above are typically lunch, rather than breakfast, dishes, although eggs themselves (like boiled or [[scrambled eggs]]) are a common part of a German breakfast.\n\n=== Cambodia ===\nIn Cambodia, a common dish is called loc lok, is a fried egg served on top of a ring of spinach, onion finely shaven and tomoto with either a portion of deer or beef and gravy topped with a fried egg either duck or chicken.\n\n=== Czech Republic ===\nFried egg prepared sunny side up is known as \"''volsk\u00e9 oko''\" or \"''buli\u010d\u00ed oko''\" (bull's eye) in [[Czech cuisine]] and they are served either alone as part of breakfast, or for lunch with side of spinach and boiled potatoes.\n\n=== Egypt ===\nIn [[Egypt]], fried eggs are a common breakfast food.

In central and northern India's English-speaking middle classes and mid-level restaurants, \"single-fried\" refers to sunny side up (also known as a \"bullseye\") and \"double-fried\" to over hard. Street food parlance uses \"half-fry\" as a base term with \"half fry bina palti\" (un-flipped) meaning sunny side up and \"half fry palti maarke\" or \"alti palti\" (flipped) meaning over easy/medium/hard where the customer oversees the flip and says when.\n\n=== Indonesia ===\n[[File:Indomie Mie Goreng Iga Penyet 1.JPG|thumb|''[[Mi Goreng]]'' noodle served with fried egg and vegetables.]]\nIn [[Indonesia]], fried eggs are served either as ''telur ceplok'' or ''telur mata sapi'' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] for \"bull's eye egg\") which refer to sunny side up eggs, as ''telur dadar'' ([[omelette]]) or as ''telur orak-arik'' (scrambled eggs).

Eggs are often part of the [[full breakfast]] commonly eaten in Britain and Ireland. Fried eggs are often served with [[ham]] or [[Bacon|gammon]] steak as a popular [[pub]] meal. The egg is cooked on a high heat and hot fat, oil or water may be splashed onto the top of the egg to baste it and cook the white. They are usually cooked without turning over. Sometimes the egg is turned to ensure the white is thoroughly cooked (\"over easy\", though this is more an American phrase), but the egg is almost always served with the yolk runny.\n\n=== Latin America, Portugal, and Spain ===\nIn [[Portuguese cuisine|Portugal]] and [[Brazilian cuisine|Brazil]], a runny egg placed over a steak with a side dish of rice and black beans is called a ''{{lang|pt-BR|[[bife a cavalo]]}}'', literally \"horse-riding steak\".\n\nA similar dish, with the name ''{{lang|es|bife a caballo}}'' in Spanish, is also common in Argentina, Ecuador, and Uruguay (called ''churrasco''); fried [[potato]]es and salad replace the beans and rice.\n\nIn [[Chilean cuisine|Chile]] and [[Peruvian cuisine|Peru]], a fried egg is included in ''{{lang|es|[[Lomo a lo Pobre|lomo a lo pobre]]}}'', ''{{lang|es|[[Chorrillana]]}}'', ''{{lang|es|[[Paila de huevo]]}}'', and several other dishes.\n\nIn [[Cuisine of Ecuador|Ecuador]], [[Llapingacho|''llapingachos'']] include a sunny side up egg served over pan-seared cheesy mashed potatoes and fried sausage.\n\nIn northern [[Mexico]], ''{{lang|es|huevos montados}}'' (riding eggs) are served with [[refried beans]] and fried potatoes (or french fries).  Another common method of serving eggs in Mexico is ''{{lang|es|[[huevos a la mexicana]]}}'', which blends fried eggs with diced tomato, onion and green chili pepper; the amount of pepper added is often to order.\n\nThere are several other egg dishes in [[Mexican cuisine|Mexico]] which combine different ingredients: [[Huevos motule\u00f1os]] (in Yucat\u00e1n), ''{{lang|es|aporreados}}'' (mixed with refried beans), and ''{{lang|es|[[huevos rancheros]]}}'' (sunny side up eggs served over a corn [[tortilla]], covered with spicy salsa).  Also, in some parts of Mexico, fried eggs are served with a fresh tomato, onions, and [[cilantro]] salsa.  Red chili is optional, as is a blended sauce.\n\nIn [[Spanish cuisine|Spain]] fried eggs (''huevos fritos'') are a common dish. They are eaten alone, with meat, or with sausages.
