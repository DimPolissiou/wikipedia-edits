The team competes in {{English football updater|Walsall}}, the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's nickname, \"The Saddlers\", reflects Walsall's status as a traditional centre for [[saddle]] manufacture. Walsall moved into their [[Bescot Stadium]] in 1990, having previously played at nearby [[Fellows Park]] for almost a century. The team play in a red and white kit and their club crest features a [[swift]]. They hold rivalries with nearby [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], as well as farther away but more regularly contested rivalries with [[Coventry City]] ,[[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]].\n\nThe club was founded in 1888 as '''Walsall Town Swifts''', an amalgamation of Walsall Town and Walsall Swifts.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\">{{Cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Complete Record of Walsall Football Club|publisher=Breedon Books|date=1999|isbn=978-1859831564}}</ref>{{rp|9}} The club moved to the [[Football Alliance]] from the Midland Association the following year, before being invited to help found the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892. They failed re-election in 1895, but were elected back into the [[English Football League|Football League]] after one season in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]. They failed re-election again in 1901 and this time spent two decades outside the Football League, primarily in the [[Birmingham & District Football League|Birmingham & District League]]. Invited to help form the [[Football League Third Division North]] in 1921, they would remain in the third tier for the next 37 years before becoming founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. Walsall won the Fourth Division title in 1959\u201360 and then secured promotion out of the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] the following season, though were relegated in 1963 and again in 1979.\n\nWalsall won promotion out of the Fourth Division in 1979\u201380, but suffered two successive relegations after winning promotion into the Second Division at the end of the 1987\u201388 campaign. Promoted in 1994\u201395 and again in 1998\u201399, they spent four of the next five seasons in the second tier, punctuated by a successful third tier promotion campaign in 2000\u201301. Two relegations in three years left Walsall back in the fourth tier in 2006, but they secured an immediate promotion as 2006\u201307 [[EFL League Two|League Two]] champions. Their first match at [[Wembley Stadium]] came in the [[2015 Football League Trophy Final]], which they lost to [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]], and they ended an 11-year stay in [[EFL League One|League One]] with relegation in 2019.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Walsall F.C. seasons}}\n\n===Formation and early years (1888\u20131939)===\n[[File:WalsallFC1893.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Walsall team pictured in 1893]]\nWalsall were formed as '''Walsall Town Swifts F.C.''' in 1888 when Walsall Town F.C. and Walsall Swifts F.C. amalgamated.<ref name=\"social\">{{cite web|title=Walsall Social Life|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36201|work=A History of the County of Stafford: Volume 17: Offlow hundred (part)|publisher=British History Online|accessdate=4 October 2010|editor=M Greenslade |year=1976}}</ref> Walsall Town had been founded in 1877 and Walsall Swifts in 1879.<ref name=social/> Both clubs had played at [[the Chuckery]], and the newly formed club remained at the same ground.

Walsall's first league campaign in the Midland Association started with a 2\u20132 draw at home to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] on 22 September 1888. They went on to finish in 3rd place in the league.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|141}}\n\nThe club were first admitted to the [[The Football League|Football League]] in 1892, as founder members of the new [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]]. They moved to the [[West Bromwich Road]] ground in 1893 after complaints from local residents about them playing at the Chuckery. After finishing 14th out of 16 teams in [[1894\u201395 Football League|1894\u201395]] the club failed to be re-elected to the Football League. At the start of the 1895 season the club once again moved grounds, this time to [[Fellows Park]] which remained the club's home for over a century.\n\nIn 1896 the club changed their name to simply '''Walsall F.C.'''<ref name=social/> and joined the [[Midland League (1889)|Midland League]]. A year later, they returned to the Second Division. The team finished in 6th place in [[1898\u201399 Football League|1898\u201399]] in a season that, to this day, proves to be their highest ever league finish. Despite this relative success, the club once again failed re-election two years later and dropped back into the Midland League. A move to the [[Birmingham & District Football League|Birmingham League]] followed in 1903 and in 1910 the club were elected to the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]]. With the expansion of the Football League after [[World War I]], Walsall became a founding member of the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] in 1921 and have remained a [[Football League]] side ever since.\n\nWalsall's highest \"home\" attendance was set in 1930, when they played in of front of 74,646 fans in a 3\u20131 defeat to [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] in the [[FA Cup]] fourth round.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/aston-villa-v-walsall-25-january-1930-207839/|title=Aston Villa v Walsall, 25 January 1930|website=www.11v11.com|accessdate=10 October 2018}}</ref> Although a home match for Walsall, the tie was played at their opponents' [[Villa Park]] ground to ensure as many people could watch the local ''David vs Goliath'' match as possible.

The decent results in the early 1930s were spearheaded by the emergence of one of Walsall's greatest ever players, [[Gilbert Alsop]], who scored a remarkable 169 goals between 1931 and 1935.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|29}}\n\nAlsop also inspired Walsall's finest ever FA Cup result, scoring the opening goal in a 2\u20130 home win against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in 1933.

''The Saddlers'' fell at the final hurdle, however, with a 2\u20130 defeat to [[Stockport County]] at [[Maine Road]].<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|178}}\n\n===Post-war era and first league title (1945\u20131980)===\n1945\u201346 signalled the final season of local war-time competitions.

Walsall reached the final to face [[A.F.C.

In the [[1947\u201348 in English football|1947\u201348]] season a number of impressive turnouts at Fellows Park, including a season-best 20,383 for the visit of [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], saw the club record its highest average league attendance to date of 15,711.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|191}} In the same season Walsall finished in 3rd place but once again missed out on promotion to the Second Division.\n\nThe early 1950s saw some of Walsall's most troubling and dismal times in the Football League, as the club faced the [[Re-election (Football League)|re-election process]] four years in a row. They finished bottom of the league in [[1951\u201352 in English football|1951\u201352]], [[1952\u201353 in English football|1952\u201353]] and [[1953\u201354 in English football|1953\u201354]] and improved to only second bottom in [[1954\u201355 in English football|1954\u201355]]. The club, however, managed to retain its Football League status through this period, largely thanks to the high attendances at Fellows Park demonstrating a healthy desire for League football in Walsall.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|41\u201342}}\n\nIn 1958, following a reorganisation of the Football League, Walsall became founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] \u2014 now holding the distinction of having being founder members of the Second, Third and Fourth tiers. Under the management of [[Bill Moore (footballer)|Bill Moore]], the club achieved successive promotions, scoring 102 goals on their way to winning the Fourth Division title in [[1959\u201360 in English football|1959\u201360]] and finishing as Third Division runners-up in [[1960\u201361 in English football|1960\u201361]]. The league title in 1960 was the club's first in their 72-year history.\n\nIn the club's first season in the second tier of English football since the early 1900s a post-war record 14th-place finish was achieved.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|203\u2013205}} It was during this season that the club also recorded its record attendance, as 25,453 crammed into Fellows Park to see ''The Saddlers'' beat [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] 1\u20130 in August 1961.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\"/>{{rp|47}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.11v11.com/matches/walsall-v-newcastle-united-29-august-1961-110629/|title=Walsall v Newcastle United, 29 August 1961|website=www.11v11.com|accessdate=25 July 2019}}</ref> However, after just two seasons in the Second Division, the club were relegated back to the Third Division in [[1962\u201363 in English football|1962\u201363]].

Once again ''The Saddlers'' rose from the ashes of adversity as they secured an immediate promotion. At one stage in [[1979\u201380 in English football|1979\u201380]] Walsall recorded 21 consecutive matches without defeat, a record that still stands today.

The team competes in {{English football updater|Walsall}}, the fourth tier of the [[English football league system]]. The club's nickname, \"The Saddlers\", reflects Walsall's status as a traditional centre for [[saddle]] manufacture. Walsall moved into their [[Bescot Stadium]] in 1990, having previously played at nearby [[Fellows Park]] for almost a century. The team play in a red and white kit and their club crest features a [[swift]]. They hold rivalries with nearby [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] and [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], as well as farther away but more regularly contested rivalries with [[Coventry City]] ,[[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]] and [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]].\n\nThe club was founded in 1888 as '''Walsall Town Swifts''', an amalgamation of Walsall Town and Walsall Swifts.<ref name=\"HistoryBook\">{{Cite book|last=Matthews|first=Tony|title=The Complete Record of Walsall Football Club|publisher=Breedon Books|date=1999|isbn=978-1859831564}}</ref>{{rp|9}} The club moved to the [[Football Alliance]] from the Midland Association the following year, before being invited to help found the [[Football League Second Division]] in 1892. They failed re-election in 1895, but were elected back into the [[English Football League|Football League]] after one season in the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]. They failed re-election again in 1901 and this time spent two decades outside the Football League, primarily in the [[Birmingham & District Football League|Birmingham & District League]]. Invited to help form the [[Football League Third Division North]] in 1921, they would remain in the third tier for the next 37 years before becoming founder members of the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]].

It was the first World Cup win for India.\n\n==Background==\nThe match was the third consecutive World Cup final hosted at Lord's, following those in [[1975 Cricket World Cup Final|1975]] and [[1979 Cricket World Cup Final|1979]].\n\nIndia was making their first appearance at a World Cup final after defeating England by 6 wickets in the first semi-finals.

Gavaskar, who had an unsuccessful tournament was the first batsman got dismissed.  Andy Roberts had Gavaskar caught by Jeff Dujon for 2. But K Srikkanth and M Amarnath had a good partnership taking India past the 50 mark.  Soon Srikkanth lost his wicket for an aggresive 38 to Marshall. His seven boundaries included one memorable on-the-knees square drive off Andy Roberts. As India was approaching the 100 runs mark, M Amarnath lost his wicket to a beauty from Holding for 26. Yashpal Sharma fell to part time spinner L Gomes and suddenly Indian score slipped to 92/4. Skipper Kapil Dev struck 3 boundaries in his 8 balls 15 as he was caught at boundary off Gomes and Kirti Azad was back in the pavilion without scoring reeling India at 111/6. Roger Binny too could n't cross the double figure mark. Sandeep Patil made 27 before he was dismissed as the 8th wicket as the total read 153/8. All rounder Madan Lal soon followed for 17 with last man Balwinder Sandhu joining wicket keeper Syed Kirmani. Both had a 10th wicket partnership of 22 runs before Holding clean bowled Kirmani for 14. India could n't survive the stipulated 60 overs as they were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs, a below par score in a final. Only three sixes were hit in the Indian innings, one from Srikkanth, one from [[Sandeep Patil]] (27 from 29 balls), and one from [[Madan Lal]] (17 from 27 balls) For West Indies, Roberts claimed 3 wickets with Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Larry Gomes claiming 2 wickets apiece. Joel Garner was the most economical bowler with 2 runs per over claiming the wicket of Patil. \n\nChasing the target of 184 to win the third World cup in a row, West Indies were surprised by Sandhu as he famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a huge inswinger to which the batsman had shouldered arms. Soon West Indies crossed 50 with Desmond Haynes and Viv Richards batting smoothly. Madan Lal struck for India by dismissing Haynes first and later Viv Richards as West Indies fell to 57/3. Viv Richards was in aggressive mood as he struck 7 boundaries in his quickfire 33 off 28, however Indian skipper Kapil Dev, who had deployed himself at short mid-wicket, ran backwards and caught Richards over his shoulder, as the batsman mistimed a pull shot off Madan Lal, who also claimed his 3rd wicket in the form of Larry Gomes with the score reading 66/4. Kapil Dev once again rose to the occasion as he caught West Indies Skipper Clive Lloyd off Roger Binny reeling West Indies at 66/5. Soon Faoud Bacchus lost his wicket to Sandhu. Wicket keeper Jeff Dujon and all rounder Malcolm Marshall tried a resue act with a 43 runs partnership. But M Amarnath dismissed both of them in quick succession as the defending champions fell to 124/8. Soon Kapil Dev trapped Holding in front of the wicket and Amarnath clean bowled Michael Holding dismissing West indies for 140 in 52 overs, helping India to lift their maiden Cricket World cup. Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the best batting line-up of the era, winning by 43 runs and completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history, defeating the previously invincible West Indies. For India, Madan Lal claimed 3 wickets, while Sandhu claimed 2 wickets. Kapil Dev had an economical rate of 1.90 runs per over, but Amarnath was the most successful bowler, conceding just 12 runs from his seven overs while taking 3 wickets, and was once again awarded the Man of the Match award for his all-round performance. <ref name=almanack>{{cite web|title=India defy the odds|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150434.html|work=Wisden|publisher=reprinted by ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref> There was no \"Man of the Series\" award in 1983.\n\n==Scorecard==\n===Indian Innings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|R|Runs}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|M|Minutes}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|B|Balls}}\t\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|4s|Fours}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|6s|Sixes}}\n!width=50{{!}}{{Tooltip|SR|Strike Rate}}\n|-\n|align=left width=200 |[[Sunil Gavaskar]]\n|align=left width=200 |c [[Jeff Dujon|Dujon]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|2\n|14\n|20\n|0\n|0\n|10.0\n|-\n|align=left |[[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]\n|align=left |lbw b [[Malcolm Marshall|Marshall]]\n|38\n|82\n|57\n|7\n|1\n|66.66\n|-\n|align=left |[[Mohinder Amarnath]]\n|align=left |b [[Michael Holding|Holding]]\n|26\n|108\n|80\n|3\n|0\n|32.50\n|-\n|align=left |[[Yashpal Sharma (cricketer)|Yashpal Sharma]]\n|align=left |c sub [[Gus Logie|(Logie)]] b [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]]\n|11\n|45\n|32\n|1\n|0\n|34.37\n|-\n|align=left |[[Sandeep Patil]]\n|align=left |c [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]] b [[Joel Garner|Garner]]\n|27\n|48\n|29\n|0\n|1\n|93.10\n|-\n|align=left |[[N Kapil Dev]] ([[Captain (cricket)|c]])\n|align=left |c [[Michael Holding|Holding]] b [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]]\n|15\n|10\n|8\n|3\n|0\n|187.50\n|-\n|align=left |[[Kirti Azad]]\n|align=left |c [[Joel Garner|Garner]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|0\n|3\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0.00\n|-r\n|align=left |[[Roger Binny]]\n|align=left |c [[Joel Garner|Garner]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|2\n|9\n|8\n|0\n|0\n|25.00\n|-\n|align=left |[[Madan Lal]]\n|align=left |b [[Malcolm Marshall|Marshall]]\n|17\n|31\n|27\n|0\n|1\n|62.96\n|-\n|align=left |[[Syed Kirmani]] ([[Wicket-keeper|wk]])\n|align=left |b [[Michael Holding|Holding]]\n|14\n|55\n|43\n|0\n|0\n|32.55\n|-\n|align=left |[[Balwinder Sandhu]]\n|align=left |[[not out]]\n|11\n|42\n|30\n|1\n|0\n|36.66\n|-\n|align=left |<small>Extras</small>\n|align=left |([[Bye (cricket)|b]] 5, [[Leg bye|lb]] 5, [[Wide (cricket)|w]] 9, [[No-ball|nb]] 1)\n|20\n|colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n!Total\n!(all out;

Gavaskar, who had an unsuccessful tournament was the first batsman got dismissed.  Andy Roberts had Gavaskar caught by Jeff Dujon for 2. But K Srikkanth and M Amarnath had a good partnership taking India past the 50 mark.  Soon Srikkanth lost his wicket for an aggresive 38 to Marshall. His seven boundaries included one memorable on-the-knees square drive off Andy Roberts. As India was approaching the 100 runs mark, M Amarnath lost his wicket to a beauty from Holding for 26. Yashpal Sharma fell to part time spinner L Gomes and suddenly Indian score slipped to 92/4. Skipper Kapil Dev struck 3 boundaries in his 8 balls 15 as he was caught at boundary off Gomes and Kirti Azad was back in the pavilion without scoring reeling India at 111/6. Roger Binny too could n't cross the double figure mark. Sandeep Patil made 27 before he was dismissed as the 8th wicket as the total read 153/8. All rounder Madan Lal soon followed for 17 with last man Balwinder Sandhu joining wicket keeper Syed Kirmani. Both had a 10th wicket partnership of 22 runs before Holding clean bowled Kirmani for 14. India could n't survive the stipulated 60 overs as they were bowled out for 183 in 54.4 overs, a below par score in a final. Only three sixes were hit in the Indian innings, one from Srikkanth, one from [[Sandeep Patil]] (27 from 29 balls), and one from [[Madan Lal]] (17 from 27 balls) For West Indies, Roberts claimed 3 wickets with Malcolm Marshall, Michael Holding and Larry Gomes claiming 2 wickets apiece. Joel Garner was the most economical bowler with 2 runs per over claiming the wicket of Patil. \n\nChasing the target of 184 to win the third World cup in a row, West Indies were surprised by Sandhu as he famously clean bowled Gordon Greenidge with a huge inswinger to which the batsman had shouldered arms. Soon West Indies crossed 50 with Desmond Haynes and Viv Richards batting smoothly. Madan Lal struck for India by dismissing Haynes first and later Viv Richards as West Indies fell to 57/3. Viv Richards was in aggressive mood as he struck 7 boundaries in his quickfire 33 off 28, however Indian skipper Kapil Dev, who had deployed himself at short mid-wicket, ran backwards and caught Richards over his shoulder, as the batsman mistimed a pull shot off Madan Lal, who also claimed his 3rd wicket in the form of Larry Gomes with the score reading 66/4. Kapil Dev once again rose to the occassion as he caught West Indies Skipper Clive Lloyd off Roger Binny reeling West Indies at 66/5. Soon Faoud Bacchus lost his wicket to Sandhu. Wicket keeper Jeff Dujon and all rounder Malcolm Marshall tried a resue act with a 43 runs partnership. But M Amarnath dismissed both of them in quick succession as the defending champions fell to 124/8. Soon Kapil Dev trapped Holding in front of the wicket and Amarnath clean bowled Michael Holding dismissing West indies for 140 in 52 overs, helping India to lift their maiden Cricket World cup. Indian bowling exploited the weather and pitch conditions perfectly to bowl out the best batting line-up of the era, winning by 43 runs and completing one of the most stunning upsets in cricket history, defeating the previously invincible West Indies. For India, Madan Lal claimed 3 wickets, while Sandhu claimed 2 wickets. Kapil Dev had an economical rate of 1.90 runs per over, but Amarnath was the most successful bowler, conceding just 12 runs from his seven overs while taking 3 wickets, and was once again awarded the Man of the Match award for his all-round performance. <ref name=almanack>{{cite web|title=India defy the odds|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/150434.html|work=Wisden|publisher=reprinted by ESPNcricinfo|accessdate=4 November 2013}}</ref> There was no \"Man of the Series\" award in 1983.\n\n==Scorecard==\n===Indian Innings===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|R|Runs}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|M|Minutes}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|B|Balls}}\t\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|4s|Fours}}\n!width=20{{!}}{{Tooltip|6s|Sixes}}\n!width=50{{!}}{{Tooltip|SR|Strike Rate}}\n|-\n|align=left width=200 |[[Sunil Gavaskar]]\n|align=left width=200 |c [[Jeff Dujon|Dujon]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|2\n|14\n|20\n|0\n|0\n|10.0\n|-\n|align=left |[[Krishnamachari Srikkanth]]\n|align=left |lbw b [[Malcolm Marshall|Marshall]]\n|38\n|82\n|57\n|7\n|1\n|66.66\n|-\n|align=left |[[Mohinder Amarnath]]\n|align=left |b [[Michael Holding|Holding]]\n|26\n|108\n|80\n|3\n|0\n|32.50\n|-\n|align=left |[[Yashpal Sharma (cricketer)|Yashpal Sharma]]\n|align=left |c sub [[Gus Logie|(Logie)]] b [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]]\n|11\n|45\n|32\n|1\n|0\n|34.37\n|-\n|align=left |[[Sandeep Patil]]\n|align=left |c [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]] b [[Joel Garner|Garner]]\n|27\n|48\n|29\n|0\n|1\n|93.10\n|-\n|align=left |[[N Kapil Dev]] ([[Captain (cricket)|c]])\n|align=left |c [[Michael Holding|Holding]] b [[Larry Gomes|Gomes]]\n|15\n|10\n|8\n|3\n|0\n|187.50\n|-\n|align=left |[[Kirti Azad]]\n|align=left |c [[Joel Garner|Garner]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|0\n|3\n|3\n|0\n|0\n|0.00\n|-r\n|align=left |[[Roger Binny]]\n|align=left |c [[Joel Garner|Garner]] b [[Andy Roberts (cricketer)|Roberts]]\n|2\n|9\n|8\n|0\n|0\n|25.00\n|-\n|align=left |[[Madan Lal]]\n|align=left |b [[Malcolm Marshall|Marshall]]\n|17\n|31\n|27\n|0\n|1\n|62.96\n|-\n|align=left |[[Syed Kirmani]] ([[Wicket-keeper|wk]])\n|align=left |b [[Michael Holding|Holding]]\n|14\n|55\n|43\n|0\n|0\n|32.55\n|-\n|align=left |[[Balwinder Sandhu]]\n|align=left |[[not out]]\n|11\n|42\n|30\n|1\n|0\n|36.66\n|-\n|align=left |<small>Extras</small>\n|align=left |([[Bye (cricket)|b]] 5, [[Leg bye|lb]] 5, [[Wide (cricket)|w]] 9, [[No-ball|nb]] 1)\n|20\n|colspan=\"5\" |\n|-\n!Total\n!(all out;

Rashid, a young [[Jihadism|jihadist]] leaves the mountains to return to his village. In keeping with the law of \"pardon and national harmony\", he has to surrender to the police and give up his weapon. He thus receives amnesty and becomes a \"repenti\". He is given a job in a caf\u00e9 and a place to live. But the law cannot erase his crimes, and for Rashid, it is the beginning of a one way journey of violence, secrets and manipulation. He attempts to atone for his crimes by giving closure to a family that his \"brothers\" hurt. Not everyone is as thrilled by Rachid's return as his parents, and some of the men from his village accuse him of having been at a massacre where their families were killed. Rachid denies having been there, but they do not all believe him. One of the men attacks Rachid one night. Rachid fights back, and ends up killing the man with his knife. The police investigate his disappearance and the murder.\n\nLakhdar is a pharmacist in the same neighborhood where Rachid works. He receives a shocking and mysterious call which prompts him to call his estranged wife back to town. Even once she returns, they are distant and both in great emotional pain. They impatiently await another call from the mystery caller, which finally leads them on a journey to the mountains, still inhabited by terrorists, to get closure from the trauma that drove them apart. Lakhdar's wife is very angry with Rachid, and yells at him for making them pay for closure on the trauma that she accuses him of having caused them. He once again denies involvement, saying that he only heard the story of what had happened and not participated, adding that those responsible had died a month later. This does nothing to alleviate the loss that she feels.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nabil Asli]] as Rashid\n* [[Adila Bendimerad]]\n* [[Khaled Benaissa]] as Lakhdar\n\n==Awards==\n2012 [[IFFK|17th International Film Festival of Kerala]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/suvarna-chakoram-for-sta-nina/article4202911.ece|title=Suvarna Chakoram for Sta.

Rashid, a young [[Jihadism|jihadist]] leaves the mountains to return to his village. In keeping with the law of \"pardon and national harmony\", he has to surrender to the police and give up his weapon. He thus receives amnesty and becomes a \"repenti\". He is given a job in a caf\u00e9 and a place to live. But the law cannot erase his crimes, and for Rashid, it is the beginning of a one way journey of violence, secrets and manipulation. He attempts to atone for his crimes by giving closure to a family that his \"brothers\" hurt. Not everyone is as thrilled by Rachid's return as his parents, and some of the men from his village accuse him of having been at a massacre where their families were killed. Rachid denies having been there, but they do not all believe him. One of the men attacks Rachid one night. Rachid fights back, and ends up killing the man with his knife. The police investigate his disappearance and the murder.\n\nLakhdar is a pharmacist in the same neighborhood where Rachid works. He receives a shocking and mysterious call which prompts him to call his estranged wife back to town. Even once she returns, they are distant and both in great emotional pain. They impatiently await another call from the mystery caller, which finally leads them on a journey to the mountains, still inhabited by terrorists, to get closure from the trauma that drove them apart. Lakhdar's wife is very angry with Rachid, and yells at him for making them pay for closure on the trauma that she accuses him of having caused them.
