Of his 102 aerial victories achieved over the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], 46 were against [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters.\n\nBorn in [[Darskowo, Drawsko County|Friedrichsdorf]], M\u00fcncheberg volunteered for military service in the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1936. Initially serving in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]], he transferred to the Luftwaffe (air force) in 1938. Following flight training, he was posted to ''Jagdgeschwader'' 234 (JG&nbsp;234\u2014234th Fighter Wing) in October 1938. He was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 26|''Jagdgeschwader'' 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing) a year later and was appointed [[adjutant]] of the III. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd Group). He fought in the [[Battle of France]] and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] following his 20th aerial victory and during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Serving as a ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Squadron Leader) he fought in the aerial battles during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]] and [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] and Italian [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] ({{Lang|it|Medaglia d'oro al Valore Militare}}) after 43 aerial victories.\n\nM\u00fcncheberg then briefly served in North Africa in support of the [[Afrika Korps]] before transferring to France. He was given command of JG&nbsp;26's II. ''Gruppe'' (2nd Group) in September 1941 and was then posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&nbsp;51 \u201451st Fighter Wing), on the Eastern Front, in July 1942. Serving as a ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) in training under JG&nbsp;51 wing commander [[Karl-Gottfried Nordmann]], he claimed his 100th aerial victory on 5 September 1942 for which he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|Schwerter}}) on 9 September 1942, his score then at 103 aerial victories. On 1 October 1942 M\u00fcncheberg was given command of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&nbsp;77\u201477th Fighter Wing), operating in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]]. He died of wounds following a [[mid-air collision]] during combat near [[Meknassy]], Tunisia on 23 March 1943.\n\n==Childhood, education and early career==\nJoachim \"Jochen\" M\u00fcncheberg was born on 31 December 1918 in [[Darskowo, Drawsko County|Friedrichsdorf]] near [[Drawsko Pomorskie|Dramburg]] in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]], at the time a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Today it is Darskowo in the administrative district of [[Gmina Z\u0142ocieniec]], within [[Drawsko County]], Poland. He was the second child of Paul M\u00fcncheberg, a farmer, and his wife Erika, n\u00e9e Ulrich. His sister Eva-Brigitte was one and a half years older.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}} His father had served as a cavalry officer of the [[Military reserve force|reserves]] during World War I. The [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] in the [[Weimar Republic]] forced his father to sell their farm Friedrichshof in 1923; they resettled in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], where M\u00fcncheberg started his elementary schooling (''Grundschule''). His father was able to repurchase their old farm in 1927 and the family moved back to Friedrichshof. M\u00fcncheberg completed his elementary school in [[Z\u0142ocieniec|Falkenburg]], Pomerania. He walked or rode on a horse-drawn wagon {{Convert|24|km|mi}} each way to school. In 1928 he transferred to the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' (a type of secondary school) in Dramburg and graduated with his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) in 1936.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}}\n\n[[File:RilaMon2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The interior of the monastery with the Tower of Hrelyu visible|Rila Monastery|alt=Colour photo of the Rila Monastery]]\nM\u00fcncheberg, who was talented in sports and athletics, played [[Association football|football]] for the T.V. Falkenburg youth team in the early 1930s. He attended the [[Sturmabteilung]]-sports school in [[Hammerstein]] for a few weeks in 1934 and in 1935 spent his summer vacation in [[Bulgaria]] where he, among other places, stayed at the [[Rila Monastery]]. In early 1936 he attended a [[Nazism|National Socialism]] course in [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg]], Pomerania. He completed his compulsory labour service (''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'') in October 1936 with ''Abteilung'' (department) 5/50 in L\u00fcttmannshagen, district of [[Kamie\u0144 Pomorski|Cammin]]. As an athlete, he especially excelled in the [[decathlon]]; almost daily he practised the ten different disciplines. Aged 17, he attended a summer camp held in conjunction with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}}\n\nHis interest in flying was kindled by his cousin Hermann Hackbusch, a pilot during World War I, who often took M\u00fcncheberg to the [[Berlin]]-[[Staaken]] airfield for sightseeing flights.{{sfn|Schumann|Westerwelle|2010|p=2}} He volunteered for service in the then newly emerging [[Luftwaffe]] and started his [[recruit training]] on 4 December 1936 in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]] of the [[Wehrmacht]]. M\u00fcncheberg spent his 1936/37 winter vacation in [[Altenberg, Saxony|Altenberg]] in the [[Erzgebirge]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}} He then attended the III.

He was then posted to I. ''Gruppe'' (1st group) of ''Jagdgeschwader'' 234 (JG&nbsp;234\u2014234th Fighter Wing) stationed at [[Cologne]] on 23 September 1938.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2005|p=59}}{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}}<ref group=\"Note\">For an explanation of Luftwaffe unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)|Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].</ref> He was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) on 8 November 1938.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=154}}\n\nWhile stationed in Cologne, M\u00fcncheberg trained for the decathlon at the [[ASV K\u00f6ln]] (sports club in Cologne) during his spare time and competed in various national and international track and field events. He even had a training field built on the family estate at Friedrichshof in Pomerania and at the time had strong ambitions to compete in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]]. His commanding officers supported him in this athletic vision and gave him additional time off to practice for the Olympics. M\u00fcncheberg owned a [[dachshund]] (''Dackel''), which his mother had bred, named Seppl. The dog accompanied him from the start of World War II until his death on 23 March 1943.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}}\n\nI./JG&nbsp;234 was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]&nbsp;E-3 in December 1938 and re-designated as I.

M\u00fcncheberg filed claim for his second victory on 11 May 1940 when he shot down an ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force) [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] northwest of [[Antwerp]]. On 13 May 1940, III.

III. ''Gruppe'' flew fighter protection for bomber formations attacking allied shipping in the [[English Channel]] on 24 July. These missions were referred to as ''[[Kanalkampf]]'' (channel combat) by the Germans. The unit flew its next mission one day later, providing fighter protection for Stuka's again targeting shipping. M\u00fcncheberg, who had been promoted to ''Oberleutnant'' on 19 July 1940, claimed his 10th aerial victory on 28 July when he shot down a [[No. 257 Squadron RAF|No. 257 Squadron]] [[Hawker Hurricane]] {{Convert|15|km|mi}} northeast of [[Dover]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=50}} The claim was made at 15:15.

In consequence, ''Hauptmann'' [[Gerhard Sch\u00f6pfel]], who had led 9. ''Staffel'', was appointed ''Gruppenkomandeur'' of the III. ''Gruppe'' and M\u00fcncheberg was given command of the 7. ''Staffel'' as ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Squadron Leader), replacing ''Oberleutnant'' Georg Beyer who left to become Galland's adjutant and became a [[prisoner of war]] on 28 August after being shot down.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=61, 65}}\n\nFlying another fighter escort mission on 24 August in an attack south of London, M\u00fcncheberg claimed a victory over a Hurricane from [[No. 151 Squadron RAF|No. 151 Squadron]] and another Hurricane on 31 August. This brought his total to 15 aerial victories, which increased to 16 the next day. On 13 September 1940, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) the same day he achieved his 20th aerial victory - the third in JG&nbsp;26.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=73}} The No.&nbsp;151 pilot was Pilot Officer F Czajkowski, who force-landed wounded.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=69}} He returned in early October, after the third phase of the Battle of Britain where the Luftwaffe had targeted the British airfields, had come to an end. He claimed his first victory following his vacation on 17 October over a [[Free French Air Force]] [[Bloch MB.150]]. He shot down a Spitfire on 25 October. The weather then deteriorated, and fog and heavy rain prevented further flight operations and III. Gruppe had to abandon the airfield at Caffiers, relocating to [[Aerodrome Abbeville|Abbeville-Drucat]] on 10 November.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2002|p=326}} He claimed his last victory in the Battle of Britain, and his last of 1940, on 14 November, when Galland and M\u00fcncheberg each claimed a Spitfire in combat with [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|No. 66.

Of his 102 aerial victories achieved over the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]], 46 were against [[Supermarine Spitfire]] fighters.\n\nBorn in [[Darskowo, Drawsko County|Friedrichsdorf]], M\u00fcncheberg volunteered for military service in the [[Wehrmacht]] of [[Nazi Germany]] in 1936. Initially serving in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]], he transferred to the Luftwaffe (air force) in 1938. Following flight training, he was posted to ''Jagdgeschwader'' 234 (JG&nbsp;234\u2014234th Fighter Wing) in October 1938. He was transferred to [[Jagdgeschwader 26|''Jagdgeschwader'' 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing) a year later and was appointed [[adjutant]] of the III. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Gruppe|Gruppe]]'' (3rd Group). He fought in the [[Battle of France]] and received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] following his 20th aerial victory and during the [[Battle of Britain]]. Serving as a ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Squadron Leader) he fought in the aerial battles during the [[Siege of Malta (World War II)|siege of Malta]] and [[Balkans Campaign (World War II)|Balkans Campaign]]. He received the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves]] and Italian [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]] ({{Lang|it|Medaglia d'oro al Valore Militare}}) after 43 aerial victories.\n\nM\u00fcncheberg then briefly served in North Africa in support of the [[Afrika Korps]] before transferring to France. He was given command of JG&nbsp;26's II. ''Gruppe'' (2nd Group) in September 1941 and was then posted to [[Jagdgeschwader 51|''Jagdgeschwader'' 51]] (JG&nbsp;51 \u201451st Fighter Wing), on the Eastern Front, in July 1942. Serving as a ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) in training under JG&nbsp;51 wing commander [[Karl-Gottfried Nordmann]], he claimed his 100th aerial victory on 5 September 1942 for which he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords]] ({{Lang|de|Schwerter}}) on 9 September 1942, his score then at 103 aerial victories. On 1 October 1942 M\u00fcncheberg was given command of [[Jagdgeschwader 77|''Jagdgeschwader'' 77]] (JG&nbsp;77\u201477th Fighter Wing), operating in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean Theatre]]. He died of wounds following a [[mid-air collision]] during combat near [[Meknassy]], Tunisia on 23 March 1943.\n\n==Childhood, education and early career==\nJoachim \"Jochen\" M\u00fcncheberg was born on 31 December 1918 in [[Darskowo, Drawsko County|Friedrichsdorf]] near [[Drawsko Pomorskie|Dramburg]] in the [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Province of Pomerania]], at the time a [[Provinces of Prussia|province]] of the [[Free State of Prussia]]. Today it is Darskowo in the administrative district of [[Gmina Z\u0142ocieniec]], within [[Drawsko County]], Poland. He was the second child of Paul M\u00fcncheberg, a farmer, and his wife Erika, n\u00e9e Ulrich. His sister Eva-Brigitte was one and a half years older.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}} His father had served as a cavalry officer of the [[Military reserve force|reserves]] during World War I. The [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]] in the [[Weimar Republic]] forced his father to sell their farm Friedrichshof in 1923; they resettled in [[K\u00f6nigsberg]], where M\u00fcncheberg started his elementary schooling (''Grundschule''). His father was able to repurchase their old farm in 1927 and the family moved back to Friedrichshof. M\u00fcncheberg completed his elementary school in [[Z\u0142ocieniec|Falkenburg]], Pomerania. He walked or rode on a horse-drawn wagon {{Convert|24|km|mi}} each way to school. In 1928 he transferred to the ''[[Realgymnasium]]'' (a type of secondary school) in Dramburg and graduated with his ''[[Abitur]]'' (diploma) in 1936.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}}\n\n[[File:RilaMon2.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The interior of the monastery with the Tower of Hrelyu visible|Rila Monastery|alt=Colour photo of the Rila Monastery]]\nM\u00fcncheberg, who was talented in sports and athletics, played [[Association football|football]] for the T.V. Falkenburg youth team in the early 1930s. He attended the [[Sturmabteilung]]-sports school in [[Hammerstein]] for a few weeks in 1934 and in 1935 spent his summer vacation in [[Bulgaria]] where he, among other places, stayed at the [[Rila Monastery]]. In early 1936 he attended a [[Nazism|National Socialism]] course in [[L\u0119bork|Lauenburg]], Pomerania. He completed his compulsory labour service (''[[Reichsarbeitsdienst]]'') in October 1936 with ''Abteilung'' (department) 5/50 in L\u00fcttmannshagen, district of [[Kamie\u0144 Pomorski|Cammin]]. As an athlete, he especially excelled in the [[decathlon]]; almost daily he practised the ten different disciplines. Aged 17, he attended a summer camp held in conjunction with the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] in Berlin.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}}\n\nHis interest in flying was kindled by his cousin Hermann Hackbusch, a pilot during World War I, who often took M\u00fcncheberg to the [[Berlin]]-[[Staaken]] airfield for sightseeing flights.{{sfn|Schumann|Westerwelle|2010|p=2}} He volunteered for service in the then newly emerging [[Luftwaffe]] and started his [[recruit training]] on 4 December 1936 in the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Army]] of the [[Wehrmacht]]. M\u00fcncheberg spent his 1936/37 winter vacation in [[Altenberg, Saxony|Altenberg]] in the [[Erzgebirge]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=59}} He then attended the III. ''Lehrgang'' (3rd training course) in the 4. ''Sch\u00fclerkompanie'' (4th student company) at the [[Air War School Klotzsche|''Luftkriegsschule'' 1]] (1st Air War School) in [[Dresden]] as a ''[[Fahnenjunker]]'' (Officer Applicant) from 1 April to 30 June 1937.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|pp=59\u201360}} A year later he completed his flight training there and was promoted to ''[[F\u00e4hnrich]]'' (Officer Cadet) on 16 December 1937.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|pp=60, 154}}<ref group=\"Note\">Flight training in the Luftwaffe progressed through the levels A1, A2 and B1, B2, referred to as A/B flight training. A training included theoretical and practical training in aerobatics, navigation, long-distance flights and dead-stick landings. The B courses included high-altitude flights, instrument flights, night landings and training to handle the aircraft in difficult situations.</ref> He transferred to the Luftwaffe in 1938 and attended the ''[[Jagdfliegerschule]]'' (Fighter Pilot School) in [[Werneuchen]], under the command of ''[[Oberst]]'' (Colonel) [[Theodor Osterkamp]]. He was then posted to I. ''Gruppe'' (1st group) of ''Jagdgeschwader'' 234 (JG&nbsp;234\u2014234th Fighter Wing) stationed at [[Cologne]] on 23 September 1938.{{sfn|Williamson|Bujeiro|2005|p=59}}{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}}<ref group=\"Note\">For an explanation of Luftwaffe unit designations, see [[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)|Organisation of the Luftwaffe during World War II]].</ref> He was promoted to ''[[Leutnant]]'' (Second Lieutenant) on 8 November 1938.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=154}}\n\nWhile stationed in Cologne, M\u00fcncheberg trained for the decathlon at the [[ASV K\u00f6ln]] (sports club in Cologne) during his spare time and competed in various national and international track and field events. He even had a training field built on the family estate at Friedrichshof in Pomerania and at the time had strong ambitions to compete in the [[1940 Summer Olympics]]. His commanding officers supported him in this athletic vision and gave him additional time off to practice for the Olympics. M\u00fcncheberg owned a [[dachshund]] (''Dackel''), which his mother had bred, named Seppl. The dog accompanied him from the start of World War II until his death on 23 March 1943.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}}\n\nI./JG&nbsp;234 was equipped with the [[Messerschmitt Bf 109]]&nbsp;E-3 in December 1938 and re-designated as I. ''Gruppe'' of [[Jagdgeschwader 26]] \"Schlageter\" (JG&nbsp;26\u201426th Fighter Wing), named after [[Albert Leo Schlageter]], on 1 May 1939. M\u00fcncheberg was transferred to 11. ''[[Organization of the Luftwaffe (1933\u201345)#Staffel|Staffel]]'' of [[Lehrgeschwader 2]] (11./LG&nbsp;2\u201411th squadron of the 2nd Demonstration Wing) in mid-1939. 11.(Nacht)/LG&nbsp;2 was formed on 1 August 1939 and experimented with [[Night fighter|night fighting]] techniques. Only pilots with excellent flying abilities, especially [[blind flying]], were chosen.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}}\n\n==World War II==\nWorld War II in Europe began on Friday 1 September 1939 when German forces [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]]. 11.(Nacht)/LG 2 was re-designated to 10.(Nachtjagd) ''Staffel'' of Jagdgeschwader 26 which was led by ''[[Oberleutnant]]'' (First Lieutenant) [[Johannes Steinhoff]]. III. ''Gruppe'' was formed on 23 September 1939 in [[Werl]] and M\u00fcncheberg was appointed its [[adjutant]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=60}} III. ''Gruppe'' relocated to [[Essen|Essen-M\u00fclheim]] in early November 1939 during the [[Phoney War]] period (October 1939 \u2013 April 1940). From this airfield, he claimed his first victory on 7 November 1939, a [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) [[Bristol Blenheim]] Mk. I bomber L1325 of [[No. 57 Squadron RAF]], piloted by Pilot Officer H.R. Bewlay. This achievement earned him the [[Iron Cross]] 2nd Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz zweiter Klasse}}) on 9 November 1939.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|pp=11\u201314, 60, 154}}{{sfn|Warner|2002|p=149}}{{sfn|Caldwell|1991|p=14}}\n\n===Battle of France===\nThe [[Battle of France]], the German invasion of France and the [[Low Countries]], began on 10 May 1940. II. and III. ''Gruppe'' flew [[close air support]] missions in support of German [[Airborne forces|airborne landings]] by the ''[[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger]]'' (paratroopers) in the Netherlands. M\u00fcncheberg filed claim for his second victory on 11 May 1940 when he shot down an ''[[Arm\u00e9e de l'Air]]'' (French Air Force) [[Curtiss P-36 Hawk]] northwest of [[Antwerp]]. On 13 May 1940, III. ''Gruppe'' was moved to [[M\u00f6nchengladbach|M\u00fcnchen Gladbach]], present-day M\u00f6nchengladbach, closer to the border with the Netherlands and Belgium.{{sfn|Schumann|Westerwelle|2010|p=6}}{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=15}} On 14 May, JG&nbsp;26 escorted bombers of III./[[LG 1]].

Two pilots were wounded but [[Squadron Leader]] Parnall was killed.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|p=120}} On 15 May M\u00fcncheberg claimed a Hurricane over [[Overijse]], near [[Brussels]] as the ''Gruppe'' supported German forces in the [[Battle of Belgium]]. [[Sergeant]] Jim Williams, [[No. 3 Squadron RAF|3 Squadron]] was his opponent. Williams was killed when ''L1645'' crashed near Overijse.{{sfn|Cull|Lander|Weiss|1999|p=151}} After the [[Battle of the Netherlands|surrender of the Netherlands]] on 17 May 1940, III. ''Gruppe'' moved to [[Peer, Belgium|Peer]] in Belgium and again moved on 19 May, this time to [[Beauvechain Air Base|Beauvechain]] near Brussels.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2000|p=222}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-058-1784A-14, Frankreich, Jagdflugzeuge Me 109 auf Feldflugplatz.jpg|thumb|right|Bf 109 Es, similar to those flown by M\u00fcncheberg over France and Belgium.|alt=four Messerschmidt Bf 109 E of Fighter Wing 51 \"M\u00f6lders\" on a grass airfield]]\nOperating from [[Chi\u00e8vres Air Base]] from 27 May 1940, M\u00fcncheberg claimed his fifth aerial victory over a [[Supermarine Spitfire]] on 29 May 1940. This achievement earned him the Iron Cross 1st Class ({{lang|de|Eisernes Kreuz erster Klasse}}). At the time, III. ''Gruppe'' was providing [[Escort fighter|fighter escort]] for [[Junkers Ju 87]] \"Stuka\" dive bombers and [[Messerschmitt Bf 110]] [[heavy fighter]]s operating against the [[beachhead]] held by [[British Expeditionary Force (World War II)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) in the [[Battle of Dunkirk]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=19}} On 4 June 1940, III. ''Gruppe'' relocated to [[La Capelle]] near [[Boulogne]]. The second and decisive phase, ''[[Fall Rot]]'' (Case Red), of the Battle of France began on 5 June. ''[[Major (Germany)|Major]]'' (Major) [[Adolf Galland]] was appointed ''[[Gruppenkommandeur]]'' (group commander) of the III. ''Gruppe'' on 6 June and M\u00fcncheberg became his first adjutant. The ''Gruppe'' was again relocated on 13 June, this time to [[Les Thilliers-en-Vexin]] and on 17 June to [[V\u00e9lizy \u2013 Villacoublay Air Base|Villacoublay]] near Paris. M\u00fcncheberg flew ground support missions against the retreating French forces at the time. [[Second Armistice at Compi\u00e8gne|France surrendered]] on 22 June 1940 and III. ''Gruppe'' of JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" moved back to M\u00fcnchen Gladbach in Germany.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=24}} In total, M\u00fcncheberg claimed eight Allied aircraft shot down during the invasion of France, including four on 31 May 1940, bringing his total to nine.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=34}} The ''Gruppe'' then moved to [[D\u00f6beritz]] on 1 July to provide fighter protection for Berlin. The time was also used to repair and upgrade the Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-3s to Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;E-4s.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=24}}\n\n===Battle of Britain===\nOn 21 July 1940, III ''gruppe'' JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" received orders to relocate to [[Caffiers]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] in preparation for actions against Britain in what would become the [[Battle of Britain]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=47, 55}} [[Adolf Hitler]] had issued [[F\u00fchrer Directives|F\u00fchrer Directive]] no. 17 (''Weisung Nr.'' 17) on 1 August 1940; the strategic objective was to engage and defeat the RAF to achieve [[air supremacy]], or at least [[air superiority]], in preparation for [[Operation Sea Lion]] (''Unternehmen Seel\u00f6we''), the proposed amphibious invasion of Great Britain. III. ''Gruppe'' flew fighter protection for bomber formations attacking allied shipping in the [[English Channel]] on 24 July. These missions were referred to as ''[[Kanalkampf]]'' (channel combat) by the Germans. The unit flew its next mission one day later, providing fighter protection for Stuka's again targeting shipping. M\u00fcncheberg, who had been promoted to ''Oberleutnant'' on 19 July 1940, claimed his 10th aerial victory on 28 July when he shot down a [[No. 257 Squadron RAF|No. 257 Squadron]] [[Hawker Hurricane]] {{Convert|15|km|mi}} northeast of [[Dover]].{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=50}} The claim was made at 15:15. No other German pilot from JG&nbsp;26 claimed a Hurricane at that time.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=50}} The only loss suffered by 257 Squadron was Sergeant Ronald V. Forward who bailed out wounded. M\u00fcncheberg is credited with downing Forward.{{sfn|Bergstr\u00f6m|2015|p=88}} However, RAF records appear to show he was shot down at 18:40, almost three and a half hours after M\u00fcncheberg's claim.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=195}}\n\nM\u00fcncheberg was credited with his 11th victory on 8 August, claiming a [[No. 65 Squadron RAF|No. 65 Squadron]] Spitfire piloted by [[Flight Sergeant]] Norman T. Phillips shot down.{{sfn|Kershaw|2007|p=97}} The claim would seem unlikely. The war diary for JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" shows that M\u00fcncheberg made his claim at 12:55 in the afternoon as did three other pilots. No. 65 Squadron lost only two Spitfires that day, one flown by Phillips.

''Gruppe'' continued to fly [[combat air patrol]]s over the English Channel on 11 and 12 August, however M\u00fcncheberg did not claim any aircraft shot down on these days. The fighting reached a climax on 13 August when [[Adlertag|Eagle Day]] was launched (code name ''Adlertag'').{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=165\u2013166}} M\u00fcncheberg claimed a Hurricane shot down from either [[No. 32 Squadron RAF|No. 32 Squadron]] or [[No. 615 Squadron RAF|No. 615.

On 15 August he claimed a Spitfire at 16:01 [[CET]] near Dover{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2002|p=336}} while the ''gruppe'' flew as escort for [[Kampfgeschwader 1|''Kampfgeschwader'' 1]] ''Hindenburg'' (KG&nbsp;1\u20141st Bomber Wing) and [[Kampfgeschwader 2|''Kampfgeschwader'' 2]] ''Holzhammer'' (KG&nbsp;2\u20142nd Bomber Wing).{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=258}} The battles fought on this date became known as \"Black Thursday\" in the Luftwaffe after it sustained heavy casualties. The bombers broke through RAF defences, and fanned out. They attacked [[RAF Hawkinge]], [[Maidstone]], Dover, [[Rye]] and the radar station at [[Foreness Point|Foreness]].{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=258}} A pair of Spitfires from [[No. 64 Squadron RAF|64 Squadron]] were reported shot down near [[Dungeness]] at the same time.{{sfn|Mason|1969|p=260}} One pilot was killed, and the other captured after force-landing near Calais.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=56}} Galland was appointed ''[[Geschwaderkommodore]]'' (Wing Commander) of JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" on 22 August 1940. In consequence, ''Hauptmann'' [[Gerhard Sch\u00f6pfel]], who had led 9. ''Staffel'', was appointed ''Gruppenkomandeur'' of the III. ''Gruppe'' and M\u00fcncheberg was given command of the 7. ''Staffel'' as ''[[Staffelkapit\u00e4n]]'' (Squadron Leader), replacing ''Oberleutnant'' Georg Beyer who left to become Galland's adjutant and became a [[prisoner of war]] on 28 August after being shot down.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|pp=61, 65}}\n\nFlying another fighter escort mission on 24 August in an attack south of London, M\u00fcncheberg claimed a victory over a Hurricane from [[No. 151 Squadron RAF|No. 151 Squadron]] and another Hurricane on 31 August. This brought his total to 15 aerial victories, which increased to 16 the next day. On 13 September 1940, he was awarded the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]] ({{lang|de|Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes}}) the same day he achieved his 20th aerial victory - the third in JG&nbsp;26.{{sfn|Caldwell|1996|p=73}} The No.&nbsp;151 pilot was Pilot Officer F Czajkowski, who force-landed wounded.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=69}} He returned in early October, after the third phase of the Battle of Britain where the Luftwaffe had targeted the British airfields, had come to an end. He claimed his first victory following his vacation on 17 October over a [[Free French Air Force]] [[Bloch MB.150]]. He shot down a Spitfire on 25 October. The weather then deteriorated, and fog and heavy rain prevented further flight operations and III. Gruppe had to abandon the airfield at Caffiers, relocating to [[Aerodrome Abbeville|Abbeville-Drucat]] on 10 November.{{sfn|Prien|Stemmer|Rodeike|Bock|2002|p=326}} He claimed his last victory in the Battle of Britain, and his last of 1940, on 14 November, when Galland and M\u00fcncheberg each claimed a Spitfire in combat with [[No. 66 Squadron RAF|No. 66. Squadron]] and [[No. 74 Squadron RAF|No. 74. Squadron]]. This was M\u00fcncheberg's 23rd victory, and was claimed southeast of Dover. Pilot Officer W Armstrong, No.&nbsp;74 Squadron baled out. Pilot Officer W R\u00f3zycki survived a crash-landing but the Hurricane was written off.{{sfn|Franks|1997|p=101}} Hitler visited JG&nbsp;26 \"Schlageter\" at Christmas 1940.

''Staffel'' alone lost 13 pilots, and the entire ''Geschwader'' had to be moved back to Germany to reform and re-equip in early 1941. III. ''Gruppe'' was stationed at [[Bonn-Hangelar]], in [[Sankt Augustin]]. Before the ''Gruppe'' received new aircraft, the men were sent on a skiing vacation at [[Sankt Anton am Arlberg]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=62}}\n\n===Malta, Balkans and North Africa in 1941===\nOn 4 February 1941, M\u00fcncheberg was informed by ''Gruppenkommandeur'' Sch\u00f6pfel that the 7. ''Staffel'' had to relocate to [[Sicily]] in support of [[10th Air Corps (Germany)|X. Fliegerkorps]], under the command of ''[[General der Flieger]]'' (General of the Flyers) [[Hans Geisler]], for actions against the strategically important island of [[Malta]]. With the opening of a [[North African Campaign|new front in North Africa]] in mid-1940, British air and sea forces based on the island could attack Axis ships transporting vital supplies and reinforcements from Europe to North Africa. To counter this threat the Luftwaffe and the ''[[Regia Aeronautica]]'' (Italian Royal Air Force) were tasked with bombing raids in an effort to neutralise the RAF defences and the ports.\n\n[[File:Geschwaderwappen Jagdgeschwader 77.svg|thumb|left|The red heart was displayed on both sides of the Bf&nbsp;109 engine [[Aircraft fairing|cowling]], earning the unit the nickname \"Red Hearts\".{{sfn|Caldwell|2012|p=110}}|alt=red heart in black square]]\nFollowing a brief stopover in Rome, 7.

On 16 February M\u00fcncheberg claimed his 26th victory over No. 261 Squadron Hurricane of ace [[Flight Lieutenant]] [[James MacLachlan]], who baled out severely wounded.

The seven-victory ace [[Flying Officer]] Frederic Frank 'Eric' Taylor [[DFC]] was probably M\u00fcncheberg's victory. Taylor was declared [[missing in action]] but reported killed when his [[Mae West]] lifejacket washed ashore with 20mm cannon shell hole in the chest area.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=159\u2013158}} Pilot Officers P Kearsey and C E Langdon were killed in the same battle.{{sfn|Shores|Cull|Malizia|1987|pp=159\u2013158}} M\u00fcncheberg said of Taylor, \"the fighting spirit of the British pilot was fantastic.

The original intent was to participate in the [[Battle of Crete]]. The relatively quick but [[Pyrrhic victory|costly victory]] made these plans obsolete. The ''Staffel'' was then given two weeks of rest at Catania before moving on to Molaoi. Here the pilots were initially tasked with long range combat air patrols before [[Operation Battleaxe]], a [[British Army]] operation with the goal of clearing eastern [[Cyrenaica]] of German and Italian forces, was initiated on 15 June. 7.

Under the leadership of M\u00fcncheberg, the ''[[Stab (Luftwaffe designation)|Geschwaderstab]]'' (headquarters unit) which was equipped with new Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;G-2s, arrived on 1 November.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|pp=394, 396}}\n\nHe scored over a [[No. 92 Squadron RAF|No. 92 Squadron]] Spitfire piloted by Flight Sergeant Blade on 9 November.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|p=206}}{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|pp=394, 396}} Lieutenant M Marshall, 1 SAAF, was killed in combat on 27 November 1942 when M\u00fcncheberg dived to attack ten of their fighters. Marshall's Spitfire shed a wing before spinning into the ground. Three other SAAF pilots were killed in the engagement\u2014the Germans reported no losses.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|pp=461\u2013462}} Promoted to ''Major'' on 30 November 1942, he claimed a [[No. 601 Squadron RAF]] fighter 10 December and made a forced landing in his Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;G-2 (''Werknummer'' 10 725\u2014factory number; 35% damage) following combat with a P-40 of the [[66th Fighter-Interceptor Squadron]], [[57th Operations Group|57th Fighter Group]], [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF). Warrant Officer B. Raises was posted missing in action from 601 Squadron.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|pp=470\u2013471}} On 15 December M\u00fcncheberg took off with seven Bf&nbsp;109s from III./JG&nbsp;77 and attacked eleven British P-40s practicing ground attack tactics; he claimed one shot down. The pilot, RCAF Sgt N. E. McKee, crashed onto the shore and was captured.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|1969|p=215}}\n\nOn 22 January 1943 M\u00fcncheberg accounted for two 3 RAAF P-40s. Sergeant Righetti parachuted out and Flying Officer Russell was wounded and his aircraft damaged.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|p=510}} Another success claimed on 28 January was a P-40 belonging to the 33rd Fighter Group which crashed.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=180}} On 10 March M\u00fcncheberg claimed Flight Lieutenant R. R. Smith DFC, a Canadian pilot with 8 victory claims who was captured. [[No. 112 Squadron RAF]] lost six in that fight, but claimed their 200th victory.{{sfn|Shores|Massimello|Guest|2012|pp=536\u2013537}} A [[Bell P-39 Airacobra]] from [[93d Fighter Squadron]], 81st Fighter Group was claimed that day.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=244}} Three days later, 10 P-39s of the 92nd Squadron and two from the 91st Squadron, 81st Fighter Group were ordered to attack targets of opportunity in the La Fauconnerie area. Spitfires of the 307th and 308th Squadrons of the 31st Fighter Group acted as escort but were distracted by Fw 190s and left the P-39s unprotected. M\u00fcncheberg claimed one, [[Ernst-Wilhelm Reinert]], claimed four and [[Siegfried Freytag]] claimed two.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=247}} The US units lost seven; Lieutenants Murray, Turkington, Smith, Leech, McCreight and Lewis of the 93rd and Lt Lyons of the 91st were lost.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=247}} Murray escaped and returned the following day.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=247}} The success was added to another claimed earlier in the morning when his unit engaged 34 P-40s from the US 57th Fighter Group, containing the 64th, 65th and 66th Squadrons. Reinert and another pilot claimed two each\u2014the Americans lost four, with one pilot escaping to Allied lines, and most likely the pilot shot down by M\u00fcncheberg.{{sfn|Shores|Ring|Hess|1975|p=247}}\n\n===Death===\nM\u00fcncheberg [[died of wounds]] after an engagement in his Bf&nbsp;109&nbsp;G-6 (''Werknummer'' 16 381) on 23 March 1943 over Tunisia when his 135th victim, a USAAF [[52d Operations Group|52nd Fighter Group]] Spitfire exploded in front of him after a close range burst of cannon fire, incapacitating Muncheberg's aircraft. The Spitfire was piloted by Captain Theodore Sweetman.{{sfn|Scutts|1994|p=88}}{{sfn|Molesworth|2011|p=50}} Captain Hugh L. Williamson, who was also shot down in the engagement, later stated that he thought Sweetmann had deliberately [[Aerial ramming|rammed]] M\u00fcncheberg's aircraft with his burning Spitfire.{{sfn|Schumann|Westerwelle|2010|p=39}} M\u00fcncheberg's body was originally buried at [[El Aouina]]; it was later moved to the \"Heroes' Cemetery\" at [[Tunis]]. In the 1950s it was moved again and re-buried at the German Military Cemetery at [[Borj C\u00e9dria, Tunisia|Bordj-Cedria]].{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=148}} The ''Wehrmachtbericht'' announced his death on 25 March 1943.{{sfn|R\u00f6ll|2010|p=149}}\n\n==Summary of career==\n\n===Aerial victory claims===\nM\u00fcncheberg was credited with 135 aerial victories, claimed in more than 500 combat missions, 102 on the Western Front - including 19 over Malta, one in Yugoslavia and 24 in North Africa - and 33 on the Eastern Front. His tally includes at least 46 Supermarine Spitfire fighter aircraft shot down.{{sfn|Schumann|Westerwelle|2010|p=ii}} Matthews and Foreman, authors of ''Luftwaffe Aces - Biographies and Victory Claims'', researched the [[German Federal Archives]] and found documentation for 135 aerial victory claims, plus nine further unconfirmed claims. This number includes 102 on the Western Front and 33 on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Matthews|Foreman|2015|pp=889\u2013892}}\n\nVictory claims were logged to a map-reference (PQ = ''Planquadrat''), for example \"PQ 47591\". The Luftwaffe grid map ({{lang|de|J\u00e4germeldenetz}}) covered all of Europe, western Russia, and North Africa. It was composed of rectangles measuring 15 [[Minute of arc|minutes]] of [[latitude]] by 30 minutes of [[longitude]], an area of about {{Convert|360|sqmi|sqkm}}.

(1998).

A prime example of this problem is the [[BBC Domesday Project]] from the 1980s, although its data was eventually recovered with significant effort. \n\n==Obsolescence in software==\nMany versions of word-processing programs, data-storage media, and formats for encoding images and films were in the past considered industry standards but have since been replaced by new software versions or even by completely new hardware. Files meant to be read or edited with a certain program (for example [[Microsoft Word]]) might be unreadable in other programs, and as operating systems and hardware move on, even old versions of programs developed by the same company become impossible to use on the new platform (for instance, older versions of [[Microsoft Works]], before Works 4.5, cannot be run under [[Windows 2000]] or later).  Some industry experts actually consider obsolescence to be a security feature in some contexts, arguing that outdated software is more difficult to hack, but this idea has not been widely accepted.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/security-through-obsolescence|title=Security through obsolescence|last=Miller|first=Robin}}</ref>  Many entities now consider formatting obsolescence to be a key concern.  In 2002, for example, the National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage cited uncompressed [[TIFF]] and [[ASCII]] and [[Rich Text Format|RTF]] as \"de facto\" formats unlikely to be rendered obsolete in the near future.<ref>National Initiative for a Networked Cultural Heritage.

When the system that a game was designed for becomes obsolete the game itself is frequently forgotten entirely by its manufacturer, becoming [[abandonware]], a kind of [[orphan work]].

In addition to the individual copyrights of the estimated 1 million people who took part in the project, there are also copyright issues that relate to the [[LaserDisc|technologies employed]]. It is likely that the Domesday Project will not be completely free of copyright restrictions until at least 2090, unless copyright laws are revised for earlier [[Copyright term|expiration]] of software into the [[Public domain software|public domain]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc|title=The CAMiLEON Project: Legal issues arising from the work aiming to preserve elements of the interactive multimedia work entitled \"The BBC Domesday Project.\"|last=Charlesworth|first=Andrew|date=5 November 2002|publisher=Information Law and Technology Unit, [[University of Hull]]|location=Kingston upon Hull|format=Microsoft Word|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206080418/http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc|archivedate=6 February 2011|url-status=dead|accessdate=23 March 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Obsolescence in hardware ==\nContrary to widespread belief, most data storage formats are quite durable.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub121/contents/|title=Care and Handling of CDs and DVDs: A Guide for Librarians and Archivists|last=Byers|first=Fred R.|work=Council on Library and Information Resources}}</ref>  If properly maintained and kept in a controlled environment, magnetic or digital/optical audiovisual data can be accessed thousands of times without any perceptible loss of quality.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Sch\u00fcller|first=Dietrich|date=2008|title=Audio and video carriers|url=http://www.tape-online.net/docs/audio_and_video_carriers.pdf|journal=Training for Audiovisual Preservation in Europe|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  However, replaying these files and accessing the data requires the necessary equipment to be in full working order.<ref name=\":2\" />  Even if the storage devices themselves ([[Videotape|tapes]], [[Compact disc|CDs]], [[Phonograph cylinder|wax cylinders]], [[DVD|DVDs]], etc.) are in perfect working order, without the machine to read and play the data they are essentially worthless because they are inaccessible.  Therefore, it is not always enough to simply preserve that data itself, organizations must also preserve all of the hardware that the data format requires.  \n\nThis is a challenge on many different levels because machines are subject to mechanical failure and need repair on a semi-frequent basis.  Many machines require frequent maintenance like cleaning and [[degaussing]] in order to remain functional.<ref name=\":2\" />  Occasionally, especially in more recent devices, certain parts may need to be replaced regularly in order to function optimally, even if the part in question is still intact.  In addition to maintaining machines like [[Phonograph|phonographs]] and [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], organizations must maintain stocks of replacement parts for their machines.  Unfortunately, once a particular technology becomes obsolete companies generally stop making machines and replacement parts, turning instead to making equipment to support whatever new technology is now dominant.<ref name=\":2\" />  In doing this, many machines that were once commonplace become rare as there are only limited supplies of replacement machines or parts, with no new replacements forthcoming.  This has actually become more of a challenge as the technology in question has become more sophisticated; while it is possible for a skilled technician to create a phonograph which works at least as well as one from 1905, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to maintain a tape recorder or digital video recorder without prefabricated parts from the original manufacturing company.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIronically, paper documents such as books are almost entirely immune to these problems.  Non-acidic paper and inks are extremely [[Chemical stability|chemically stable]] and can last for centuries if not millennia when kept in a controlled environment.

Therefore, it is not always enough to simply preserve that data itself, organizations must also preserve all of the hardware that the data format requires.  \n\nThis is a challenge on many different levels because machines are subject to mechanical failure and need repair on a semi-frequent basis.  Many machines require frequent maintenance like cleaning and [[degaussing]] in order to remain functional.<ref name=\":2\" />  Occasionally, especially in more recent devices, certain parts may need to be replaced regularly in order to function optimally, even if the part in question is still intact.  In addition to maintaining machines like [[Phonograph|phonographs]] and [[Videocassette recorder|VCRs]], organizations must maintain stocks of replacement parts for their machines.  Unfortunately, once a particular technology becomes obsolete companies generally stop making machines and replacement parts, turning instead to making equipment to support whatever new technology is now dominant.<ref name=\":2\" />  In doing this, many machines that were once commonplace become rare as there are only limited supplies of replacement machines or parts, with no new replacements forthcoming.  This has actually become more of a challenge as the technology in question has become more sophisticated; while it is possible for a skilled technician to create a phonograph which works at least as well as one from 1905, it is extremely difficult if not impossible to maintain a tape recorder or digital video recorder without prefabricated parts from the original manufacturing company.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIronically, paper documents such as books are almost entirely immune to these problems.

Its programming focuses on premium adult programming, including motion pictures, first-run television series and specials. The channel is available internationally in countries such as Sweden, Australia, Canada, Japan, Latin America, New Zealand, Greece, Israel, Russia, Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Norway.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe channel launched on November 1, 1982 as The Playboy Channel.  The original programming and style of the Playboy Channel was developed by [[Hugh Hefner]], and producer [[Michael Trikilis]]. Playboy hired its own sales and marketing staff and launched the channel on several major multiple system operators. At the time of its launch, programming featured on the channel consisted of R-rated films. It was broadcast for only ten hours each day, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. ET, during its first eleven years of existence. The channel re-launched as Playboy TV and adopted its current name on November 1, 1989. The network expanded its programming with the adoption of a 24-hour schedule in 1994.\n\n==Programming==\nPlayboy TV was originally developed as a video version of [[Playboy Magazine]]. Programming featured music reviews, celebrity interviews, men\u2019s fashion and segments on cars. It was a video extension of the magazine - an established lifestyle brand.

Channel''') is an [[American]], adults-only premium television network that is owned by [[MindGeek]] under license from [[Playboy Enterprises]]. Its programming focuses on premium adult programming, including motion pictures, first-run television series and specials. The channel is available internationally in countries such as Sweden, Australia, Canada, Japan, Latin America, New Zealand, Greece, Israel, Russia, Iberia (Spain and Portugal) and Norway.\n\n==Background==\n\nThe channel launched on November 1, 1982 as The Playboy Channel.  The original programming and style of the Playboy Channel was developed by [[Hugh Hefner]], and producer [[Michael Trikilis]]. Playboy hired its own sales and marketing staff and launched the channel on several major multiple system operators. At the time of its launch, programming featured on the channel consisted of R-rated films. It was broadcast for only ten hours each day, from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. ET, during its first eleven years of existence. The channel re-launched as Playboy TV and adopted its current name on November 1, 1989. The network expanded its programming with the adoption of a 24-hour schedule in 1994.\n\n==Programming==\nPlayboy TV was originally developed as a video version of [[Playboy Magazine]]. Programming featured music reviews, celebrity interviews, men\u2019s fashion and segments on cars. It was a video extension of the magazine - an established lifestyle brand. Slowly the programming on the channel evolved to feature more attractive women and eventually soft core features. This then evolved to what would become more standard television programming with a focus primarily on a male demographic.\n\nIn 2010, Playboy TV unveiled a new slate of TV For 2 programming,<ref>NY Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/17/arts/television/17playboy.html\\ \"Playboy TV Puts Emphasis on Intimacy\"]</ref> which featured premium series tailored to both male and female viewers.

{"title_page": "Calisthenics", "text_new": "{{About|the form of physical exercise|the Australian competitive performing art|calisthenics (Australia)}}\n\n[[File:US Navy 090611-N-3271W-003 Local area children test their fitness skills during a Junior Seal Fitness.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of school children doing sit-ups|School children perform [[Sit-up (exercise)|sit-ups]], a common type of calisthenic, during a school [[Physical fitness|fitness]] day.]]\n\n'''Calisthenics''' is a form of exercise consisting of a variety of movements which exercise large muscle groups (gross motor movements), such as running, standing, grasping, pushing, etc. These exercises are often performed rhythmically and with minimal equipment, as bodyweight exercises. They are intended to increase strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's bodyweight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination.\n\nUrban calisthenics are a form of street workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups, levers, and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.\n\nSports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of synchronized physical training (often including a customized \"call and response\" routine) to increase group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics are also popular as a component of physical education in primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.\n\nIn addition to general fitness, calisthenic exercises are often used as baseline physical evaluations for military organizations around the world. Two examples are the [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|U.S. Army Physical Fitness Test]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test|U.S.M.C. Physical Fitness Test]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roper's gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831.jpg|thumb|350px|Roper's Gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831. Climbing, balancing and gymnastics have been popular forms of calisthenic exercise throughout history and are still practiced in the modern day.]]\nThe word ''calisthenics'' comes from the ancient Greek words ''kallos'' (\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), which means \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sthenos}}'' (\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"strength\" (great mental strength, courage, strength and determination). It is the art of using one's bodyweight as resistance in order to develop physique. The practice was recorded in use in [[Ancient Greece]], including the armies of [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Spartans]] at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0757qbx/how-ancient-greeks-trained-for-war|title=How ancient Greeks trained for war |date=2019-04-02 |work=BBC |language=en-US|issn=0458-3035 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404071244/https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0757qbx/how-ancient-greeks-trained-for-war |archivedate=2019-04-04 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nDisciples of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] brought their version of [[gymnastics]] to the United States, while Catherine Beecher and Dio Lewis set up [[physical education]] programs for women in the 19th century.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |title=calisthenics (exercise) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-08-04 |url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/calisthenics}}</ref> Organized systems of calisthenics in America took a back seat to competitive sports after the [[Battle of the Systems]], when the states mandated physical education systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calisthenics-gear.com/calisthenics-history/|title=Calisthenics History- How Calisthenics Once Ruled the Schools and Lost the Battle to Sports|last=Higgins|first=Chris|date=2020-01-03|website=Calisthenics Gear|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans|Royal Canadian Air Force's calisthenics program]] published in the 1960s helped to launch modern [[fitness culture]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/22/health/he-62349|title=Going Back to the Basics With Calisthenics|last=KRUCOFF|first=CAROL|date=1998-06-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|quote=In fact, the popularity of the Royal Canadian Air Force's calisthenics program in the late 1950s helped launch the modern fitness movement.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadas-fitness-movement-5-basic-exercises|title=Five basic exercises for fitness in 1961|last=|first=|date=|work=CBC Archives|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en|quote=The program became famous worldwide.}}</ref>\n\nCalisthenics is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called [[street workout]]. Street workout consists of athletes performing calisthenics routines in timed sessions in front of a panel of judges. The World Street Workout & Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF) based in Riga, Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition. The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO) based in Los Angeles, CA. promotes a series of  competitions known globally as the Battle of the Bars. The WCO created the first ever set of rules for formal competitions, including weight classes, timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions.\n\n==Common exercises==\n[[File:Kniebeuge.jpg|thumb|A squat exercise. After squatting down the exerciser stands up again while moving their hands back to their sides.]]\nThe more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include: \n\n=== Most common === \n* [[Push-up]]s\n:Performed face down on the floor, palms against floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position, while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.\n* [[Sit-up]]s\n: A person lies on their back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to the start position.\n* [[Squat (exercise)|Squats]]\n:Standing with feet shoulder width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides. Squats train the [[quadriceps]], [[hamstring]]s, calves, [[gluteal muscles]], and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual i.e. if someone struggles with exercise they can do half squats. They are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises because they can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space.  \n\n=== Common ===\n*[[Burpee (exercise)|Burpees]]\n: A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and some parts of the back.\n* [[Chin-up]]s and [[pull up]]s\n[[File:Marine Pull-ups.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a US Marine performing a pull-up.|A [[US Marine]] performs a [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]], a common calisthenic exercise.]]\n: ''Chin-ups'' and ''pull-ups'' are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips.\n: For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the [[chin-up bar]]. The chin-up focuses on the [[biceps]] muscles, rather than the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle]] which is the focus of the pull-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/main/popup/name/chin-up|title=Chin-Up Exercise Guide and Video|website=Bodybuilding.com}}</ref>\n: For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]] or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms.\n* [[Dip (exercise)|Dips]]\n:Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoids]], especially the anterior portion.\n* [[Front lever]] and [[back lever]]\n:A ''front lever'' is performed by performing a lat pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. May be done on rings or pull-up bar.\n:A ''back lever'' is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.\n* [[Handstand]]\n[[File:Maurice Ruiz and Ben Poon.jpg | thumb | 220px | The wall walk is an exercise for achieving handstands ]]\n:A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.\n* [[Hyperextension (exercise)|Hyperextensions]]\n: Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.\n* [[Leg raise]]s\n:Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.\n* [[L-sit]] \n:The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable \"L\" shape, hence the name \"L-sit\". The L sit requires you to keep your core tensed and hold your legs horizontal so your body sits in a perfect 'L' position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.\n* [[Muscle-up]]s\n:One of the basic calisthenics routines. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pullup bars or rings.\n*[[Planche (exercise)|Planche]]\n* [[Plank (exercise)|Planks]]\n[[File:Plank with medicine ball.JPG|thumb|Plank on medicine balls]]\n:This is the name for holding the 'top' position of a [[press-up|push-up]] for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis.\n* [[Multi-stage fitness test|Shuttle runs]]\n:This is running back and forth between two points (or cones) typically separated by 5-40 meters, as fast as possible, with a touchdown. The emphasis should be on stopping, turning back and accelerate back to a sprint as quickly as possible.\n*Squat jumps\n:A variant of the [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]. Performed by entering a [[squatting position]], then using a [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] jumping movement to jump as high as possible.\n\n==Co-operative calisthenics==\nCo-operative calisthenics refers to calisthenic exercises which involve two or more participants helping each other to perform the exercise. Such exercises are also known as partner exercises, or bodyweight exercises with a partner. Usually one person performs the exercise and the other person adds resistance. For example, a person performing squats with someone on their back. Some exercises also involve the use of equipment. Two people may hold onto different ends of a rope and pull in different directions. One person would deliberately provide a lesser amount of resistance, which adds resistance to the exercise whilst also allowing the other person to move through a full range of motion as their superior level of force application pulls the rope along. A disadvantage such exercises have is that it can be hard to measure how much resistance is being added by the partner when considered in comparison to free weights or machines. The advantages they have is that they allow for relatively high levels of resistance to be added with equipment being optional. On this basis, co-operative calisthenics can be just as easily performed on a playing field as in a gym.<ref>Kraemer, W.J. & Fleck S.J., 'Partner exercises' in ''Strength Training for Young Athletes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, pp.83-86</ref> They are also versatile enough to allow them to be used for training goals other than simply strength.

They are intended to increase strength, fitness and flexibility, through movements such as pulling, pushing, bending, jumping, or swinging, using one's bodyweight for resistance. Calisthenics can provide the benefits of muscular and aerobic conditioning, in addition to improving psychomotor skills such as balance, agility and coordination.\n\nUrban calisthenics are a form of street workout; calisthenics groups perform exercise routines in urban areas. Individuals and groups train to perform advanced calisthenics skills such as muscle-ups, levers, and various freestyle moves such as spins and flips.\n\nSports teams and military units often perform leader-directed group calisthenics as a form of synchronized physical training (often including a customized \"call and response\" routine) to increase group cohesion and discipline. Calisthenics are also popular as a component of physical education in primary and secondary schools over much of the globe.\n\nIn addition to general fitness, calisthenic exercises are often used as baseline physical evaluations for military organizations around the world. Two examples are the [[United States Army Physical Fitness Test|U.S. Army Physical Fitness Test]] and the [[United States Marine Corps Physical Fitness Test|U.S.M.C. Physical Fitness Test]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Roper's gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831.jpg|thumb|350px|Roper's Gymnasium, Philadelphia, circa 1831. Climbing, balancing and gymnastics have been popular forms of calisthenic exercise throughout history and are still practiced in the modern day.]]\nThe word ''calisthenics'' comes from the ancient Greek words ''kallos'' (\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2), which means \"beauty\" or \"beautiful\" (to emphasize the aesthetic pleasure that derives from the perfection of the human body), and ''{{lang|grc-Latn|sthenos}}'' (\u03c3\u03b8\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2), meaning \"strength\" (great mental strength, courage, strength and determination). It is the art of using one's bodyweight as resistance in order to develop physique. The practice was recorded in use in [[Ancient Greece]], including the armies of [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Spartans]] at the [[Battle of Thermopylae]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0757qbx/how-ancient-greeks-trained-for-war|title=How ancient Greeks trained for war |date=2019-04-02 |work=BBC |language=en-US|issn=0458-3035 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190404071244/https://www.bbc.com/reel/video/p0757qbx/how-ancient-greeks-trained-for-war |archivedate=2019-04-04 |accessdate=30 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nDisciples of [[Friedrich Ludwig Jahn]] brought their version of [[gymnastics]] to the United States, while Catherine Beecher and Dio Lewis set up [[physical education]] programs for women in the 19th century.<ref name=\"EB\">{{cite web |title=calisthenics (exercise) -- Britannica Online Encyclopedia |accessdate=2010-08-04 |url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/calisthenics}}</ref> Organized systems of calisthenics in America took a back seat to competitive sports after the [[Battle of the Systems]], when the states mandated physical education systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.calisthenics-gear.com/calisthenics-history/|title=Calisthenics History- How Calisthenics Once Ruled the Schools and Lost the Battle to Sports|last=Higgins|first=Chris|date=2020-01-03|website=Calisthenics Gear|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-03}}</ref> The [[Royal Canadian Air Force Exercise Plans|Royal Canadian Air Force's calisthenics program]] published in the 1960s helped to launch modern [[fitness culture]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/22/health/he-62349|title=Going Back to the Basics With Calisthenics|last=KRUCOFF|first=CAROL|date=1998-06-22|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|quote=In fact, the popularity of the Royal Canadian Air Force's calisthenics program in the late 1950s helped launch the modern fitness movement.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/canadas-fitness-movement-5-basic-exercises|title=Five basic exercises for fitness in 1961|last=|first=|date=|work=CBC Archives|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en|quote=The program became famous worldwide.}}</ref>\n\nCalisthenics is associated with the rapidly growing international sport called [[street workout]]. Street workout consists of athletes performing calisthenics routines in timed sessions in front of a panel of judges. The World Street Workout & Calisthenics Federation (WSWCF) based in Riga, Latvia orchestrates the annual National Championships and hosts the World Championships for all the national champions to compete at one competition. The World Calisthenics Organization (WCO) based in Los Angeles, CA. promotes a series of  competitions known globally as the Battle of the Bars. The WCO created the first ever set of rules for formal competitions, including weight classes, timed round system, original judging criteria and a 10-point must system - giving increasing number of athletes worldwide an opportunity to compete in these global competitions.\n\n==Common exercises==\n[[File:Kniebeuge.jpg|thumb|A squat exercise. After squatting down the exerciser stands up again while moving their hands back to their sides.]]\nThe more commonly performed calisthenic exercises include: \n\n=== Most common === \n* [[Push-up]]s\n:Performed face down on the floor, palms against floor under the shoulders, toes curled upwards against the floor. The arms are used to lift the body while maintaining a straight line from head to heel. The arms go from fully extended in the high position to nearly fully flexed in the low position, while avoiding resting on the floor. Chest, shoulders, and triceps are trained with this exercise.\n* [[Sit-up]]s\n: A person lies on thier back with their legs bent. They bend at the waist and move their head and torso towards their legs. They then lower themselves back down to the start position.\n* [[Squat (exercise)|Squats]]\n:Standing with feet shoulder width apart, the subject squats down until their thighs are parallel with the floor; during this action they move their arms forwards in front of them. They then return to a standing position whilst moving their arms back to their sides. Squats train the [[quadriceps]], [[hamstring]]s, calves, [[gluteal muscles]], and core. The height of the squat can be adjusted to be deeper or shallower depending on the fitness level of the individual i.e. if someone struggles with exercise they can do half squats. They are among the most versatile calisthenic exercises because they can be performed easily in most environments and with a limited amount of space.  \n\n=== Common ===\n*[[Burpee (exercise)|Burpees]]\n: A full body calisthenics workout that works abdominal muscles, chest, arms, legs, and some parts of the back.\n* [[Chin-up]]s and [[pull up]]s\n[[File:Marine Pull-ups.jpg|thumb|alt=Picture of a US Marine performing a pull-up.|A [[US Marine]] performs a [[Pull-up (exercise)|pull-up]], a common calisthenic exercise.]]\n: ''Chin-ups'' and ''pull-ups'' are similar exercises but use opposite facing grips.\n: For a chin-up, the palms of the hands are facing the person as they pull up their body using the [[chin-up bar]]. The chin-up focuses on the [[biceps]] muscles, rather than the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle]] which is the focus of the pull-up.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/main/popup/name/chin-up|title=Chin-Up Exercise Guide and Video|website=Bodybuilding.com}}</ref>\n: For a pull-up, the bar is grasped using a shoulder-width grip. The subject lifts their body up, chin level with the bar, and keeping the back straight throughout. The bar remains in front of the subject at all times. The subject then slowly returns to starting position in a slow controlled manner. This primarily trains the [[Latissimus dorsi muscle|lats]] or upper back muscles, as well as the forearms.\n* [[Dip (exercise)|Dips]]\n:Done between parallel bars or facing either direction of trapezoid bars found in some gyms. Feet are crossed with either foot in front and the body is lowered until the elbows are in line with the shoulders. The subject then pushes up until the arms are fully extended, but without locking the elbows. Dips focus primarily on the chest, triceps, and [[Deltoid muscle|deltoids]], especially the anterior portion.\n* [[Front lever]] and [[back lever]]\n:A ''front lever'' is performed by performing a lat pulldown of the bar with straight arms until the body is parallel to the ground, with the front of the body facing upwards. May be done on rings or pull-up bar.\n:A ''back lever'' is performed by lowering from an inverted hang from rings or bar, until the gymnast's body is parallel to the ground and facing towards the floor.\n* [[Handstand]]\n[[File:Maurice Ruiz and Ben Poon.jpg | thumb | 220px | The wall walk is an exercise for achieving handstands ]]\n:A handstand is the act of supporting the body in a stable, inverted vertical position by balancing on the hands. In a basic handstand the body is held straight with arms and legs fully extended, with hands spaced approximately shoulder-width apart.\n* [[Hyperextension (exercise)|Hyperextensions]]\n: Performed in a prone position on the ground, the individual raises the legs, arms and upper body off the ground.\n* [[Leg raise]]s\n:Lying on the back, hands in fists under buttocks, move feet up and down.\n* [[L-sit]] \n:The L-sit is an acrobatic body position in which all body weight rests on the hands, with the torso held in a slightly forward-leaning orientation, with legs held horizontally so that each leg forms a nominal right-angle with the torso. The right-angle causes the body to have a notable \"L\" shape, hence the name \"L-sit\". The L sit requires you to keep your core tensed and hold your legs horizontal so your body sits in a perfect 'L' position. This requires significant abdominal strength and a high level of hamstring flexibility.\n* [[Muscle-up]]s\n:One of the basic calisthenics routines. Performed by a combination routine of a pull-up followed by a dip. May be done on pullup bars or rings.\n*[[Planche (exercise)|Planche]]\n* [[Plank (exercise)|Planks]]\n[[File:Plank with medicine ball.JPG|thumb|Plank on medicine balls]]\n:This is the name for holding the 'top' position of a [[press-up|push-up]] for extended periods of time. The primary muscle involved in this exercise is the rectus abdominis.\n* [[Multi-stage fitness test|Shuttle runs]]\n:This is running back and forth between two points (or cones) typically separated by 5-40 meters, as fast as possible, with a touchdown. The emphasis should be on stopping, turning back and accelerate back to a sprint as quickly as possible.\n*Squat jumps\n:A variant of the [[Squat (exercise)|Squat]]. Performed by entering a [[squatting position]], then using a [[Plyometrics|plyometric]] jumping movement to jump as high as possible.\n\n==Co-operative calisthenics==\nCo-operative calisthenics refers to calisthenic exercises which involve two or more participants helping each other to perform the exercise. Such exercises are also known as partner exercises, or bodyweight exercises with a partner. Usually one person performs the exercise and the other person adds resistance. For example, a person performing squats with someone on their back. Some exercises also involve the use of equipment. Two people may hold onto different ends of a rope and pull in different directions. One person would deliberately provide a lesser amount of resistance, which adds resistance to the exercise whilst also allowing the other person to move through a full range of motion as their superior level of force application pulls the rope along. A disadvantage such exercises have is that it can be hard to measure how much resistance is being added by the partner when considered in comparison to free weights or machines. The advantages they have is that they allow for relatively high levels of resistance to be added with equipment being optional. On this basis, co-operative calisthenics can be just as easily performed on a playing field as in a gym.<ref>Kraemer, W.J. & Fleck S.J., 'Partner exercises' in ''Strength Training for Young Athletes'', Leeds: Human Kinetics, pp.83-86</ref> They are also versatile enough to allow them to be used for training goals other than simply strength. For example a squat with a partner can be turned into a power focused exercise by jumping or hopping with the partner instead, or even lifting them up on one knee.\n\n==Calisthenics parks==\n[[File:Calisthenics in Osdorp.jpg|thumb|Park in [[Osdorp]], Amsterdam, NLD where one can practice calisthenics.]]\nAn increasing number of [[outdoor fitness]] training areas and [[Outdoor gym|outdoor gyms]] are being built around the world.

The region of Kalinga has a rich cultural history. The Cordillera Mountain region\u2014where Kalinga is located\u2014is currently known for its mineral resources and at one point was renowned for its gold mines. Since Kalinga was abundant with gold Spaniards and missionaries tried to pacify and colonize the region in hopes of gaining access to the gold and own the land therefore owning the mines and monopolizing the gold. However, after many attempts they were not successful and the colonizers often encountered hostility and defiance from the Ygorretes. It was not until the 1880s when colonizers were successful in gaining control over the region, and much of that was attributed to the recent gun technology advancements which allowed the Spanish colonizers established a militia in the Kalinga area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Archaeological Anthropology: Perspectives on Method and Theory, Chapter 6 : A History of the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project|last=Stark, Miriam T., & Skibo, James M.|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=Tucson, AZ|pages=97}}</ref>  After the Philippine\u2013American War U.S. colonization occurred and the U.S. began constructing roads and firms in Kalinga.<ref name=\":14\" /> However, the establishment of these entities were drawn to a halt after World War II.

Due to the decline of Kalinga post WWII there have been pressures to assimilate to non-mountain\u2014more specifically Ilocano\u2014ways of life.\n\n== William Longacre and the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project ==\nThe site was introduced to Longacre by Edward Dozier, who had previously worked with the Kalingas. He suggested Longacre study the ceramics of the Kalinga because they were a tribal society who lived in small villages. He knew that women used pottery in a way that it was not always traded out of the community. Lastly, he knew that since the Kalinga had previously been studied, long-term research with the Kalingas could be achieved more easily.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276919275 | title=A History of the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project| pages=93\u2013110| date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nLongacre was determined to follow the [[Processual archaeology|New Archaeology]] movement which emphasized explanation over description. Longacre proposed that the pottery the Kalinga made (and still make) could reveal their past. Previously, Longacre studied the pottery of Carter Ranch Pueblo, Arizona. It was here that he made the inference that \"certain aspects of social organization could be inferred through such a distributional study\".<ref name=\":21\">http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/Faculty/Stark/pdfs/Longacre_et_al_1991.pdf</ref> Longacre chose to study a community that still lives and uses the pottery today so that the truth behind the pottery could be revealed. He chose the Kalinga because they are a culture that uses the pottery not only for commercial use, but also for household use. He also wanted a culture that had been previously studied by anthropologists in order to have a foundation of ethnoarchaeological research to rely on.<ref name=\":21\" /> When Longacre went to see the area, the Kalinga convinced him to come back and study their pottery.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=L9oJ1z7U0uQC&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=why+did+william+longacre+conduct+the+kalinga+ethnoarchaeological+project#v=onepage&q=why%20did%20william%20longacre%20conduct%20the%20kalinga%20ethnoarchaeological%20project&f=false | title=Archaeological Anthropology: Perspectives on Method and Theory| isbn=9780816525171| last1=Skibo| first1=James M.| last2=Graves| first2=Michael W.| last3=Stark| first3=Miriam T.| year=2007}}</ref>\n\nThe main idea of the Kalinga ethnoarchaeological project was to compare inferences made in Carter Ranch Pueblo to the results of the Kalinga project about the social context of pottery making. Later, in 1975, \"the new research goal\" was added to the Kalinga ethnoarchaeological project. Longacre and his researchers wished to investigate how long artifacts lasted before they were discarded by the people who used them. Within the Kalinga project specifically, this meant studying how long pots were used before they were discarded.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== Determining relationships between pottery and household kinship ===\nThe Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project was a comparative study proposed by William Longacre to verify whether or not the social relations (kinship systems) observed at his Carter Ranch Pueblo study were applicable to all pottery making societies or just Carter Ranch itself.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nMethods of Longacre's research included: mapping the pottery-making villages in Dangtalan and Dalupa, determining relationships among different households, and identifying stylistic changes in pottery between pottery makers who knew one another vs. pottery makers who did not know each other.<ref name=\":20\" /> The exchange of pottery in the Kalinga community led to a dominance of kinship in the primary social order. The pottery is exchanged via kinship channels, modeling the Kalinga's social relationships. Therefore, this means that the Kalinga's pottery exchange used social relationships in order to frame their economy. {{cite thesis|last=Takaki|first=Michiko|title=Aspects of Exchange in a Kalinga Society, Northern Luzon|date=1977|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|type=Phd|chapter=}}\n\nIn his dissertation, \u201cAspects of Exchange in a Kalinga society, Northern Luzon\u201d, Michiko Takaki focused on the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project, specifically how \u201ca particular agricultural people [the Kalinga] make their living and regulate their social relations\u201d.<ref name=\"Takaki 1977\">{{cite thesis|last=Takaki|first=Michiko|title=Aspects of Exchange in a Kalinga Society, Northern Luzon|date=1977|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|type=Phd|chapter=iii}}</ref> Takaki's field work with the Kalinga as part of the Ethnoarchaeological project took place from 1964-1968. He found that social relations among the Kalinga were one of the main ways that made it possible for pottery to be part of their economic process.\n\nThe ranking of goods one receives in the Kalinga community parallel to the relationship they have to the member they are receiving from.

Many of the pots found in Danglatan were not actually made from residents mainly because in Kalinga barter and gift-giving were utilized as the major form of distribution.<ref name=\":19\" /> The increase of ceramic production in Dalupa is coupled with a wider expansion of pottery, allowing potters to trade their products past the boundaries of the Pasil Valley. When trading past the boundaries, potters encounter areas with new social and ethnic practices and some areas that still do not have producer-consumer kinship ties.<ref name=\":18\" /> \u201c Balanced exchange\u201d negotiations are enacted and earthward pots are one of the artifacts that are bargained. In a traditional Kalinga pottery business deal pounded rice is the method of payment and the amount of uncooked rice contained by each pot dictates its worth.<ref name=\":18\" /> However, there is limited knowledge on the size and methods on which ceramic is distributed in places that do not utilize market methods to exchange.\n\nA significant event that led to changes in the Pasil River valley was the controversy that was developed due to the Chico River dam which initiated in the 1970s.<ref name=\":17\" /> Dams were to be created in the Kalinga region in order to generate electricity for the urban areas, which did not house native Kalinga's.<ref name=\":17\" /> This project would force movement of the Kalingas, which elicited resistance from the people leading to military involvement. Kalinga has undergone construction such as, building, motor vehicles and roads that unite the older more primitive Kalinga villages.<ref name=\":17\" /> Increased developments has made it easier to transport goods to various places.\n\nKalinga is a region with resources wanted to be exploited by other places, like the mines of gold present and logging. Longacre discovered that many of the water pots in Dangtalan had their exteriors polished with ''lebu'', which is a resin from the ''almaciga tree''.<ref name=\":17\" /> People were able to obtain resin supplies from the migratory traders that lived in areas with the almaciga tree and then traveled to places like Dalupa and Dagnlatan to deliver resin supplies. However, the supply of resin for the Dulapa potters began to dwindle due to governmental changes. One of the main resin deposits is located near the Batong Buhay gold mine that was reopened for mining in the 1970s depriving Dalupa potters from resin because the traders were able to obtain a new form of income.<ref name=\":17\" /> The gold mine has also endangered local resin harvesters due to an increase in highway robberies.<ref name=\":17\" /> The mining of gold in the region would in turn destroy riverine resources that are important for the region.\n\nKalinga is also getting stripped of its magnificent tropical forests and the vast animal and plant diversity present. The Philippine government has allowed the cutting of trees for lumber having a trickle effect on the native Kalingas. The clearing of land results in less land for Swidden agriculture, mainly with rice cultivation and also forces the natives to modify the materials utilized in the production of artifacts and tools like ceramics. Trees are one of the main ingredients to create pots and other pottery designs. Another major resin reservoir is found in the areas owned by big logging companies like the Cellophil Resources Corporation. Their logging has caused major deforestation in the Kalinga region leaving no trees in which to create resin. Kalinga potters are not only losing forests that allows the manufacture of resin, but are also banned from the remaining forest areas by have fines placed up by the Cellophil corporation.  With the newly found rarity for resin, potters need to investigate new materials they could use to polish the exterior of their creations.\n\nAlthough the mining and logging industries have allowed the introduction of non Kalinga goods into the region since the 1930s, they have still managed to keep a low influx of Filipino populations.<ref name=\":18\" /> The economy in Kalinga is heavily influenced by intensive rice cultivation and the barter system. The Kalinga economy also has a foundation of specialization with different people specializing in different jobs. The Pasil settlements are all composed of bilateral kin groups following the trend of matrilocal communities and endogamy.<ref name=\":18\" /> Within the Kalinga region they are \u201cpolitically

Since Kalinga was abundant with gold Spaniards and missionaries tried to pacify and colonize the region in hopes of gaining access to the gold and own the land therefore owning the mines and monopolizing the gold. However, after many attempts they were not successful and the colonizers often encountered hostility and defiance from the Ygorretes.

He suggested Longacre study the ceramics of the Kalinga because they were a tribal society who lived in small villages. He knew that women used pottery in a way that it was not always traded out of the community. Lastly, he knew that since the Kalinga had previously been studied, long-term research with the Kalingas could be achieved more easily.<ref name=\":20\">{{Cite web | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276919275 | title=A History of the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project| pages=93\u2013110| date=January 2007}}</ref>\n\nLongacre was determined to follow the [[Processual archaeology|New Archaeology]] movement which emphasized explanation over description. Longacre proposed that the pottery the Kalinga made (and still make) could reveal their past. Previously, Longacre studied the pottery of Carter Ranch Pueblo, Arizona. It was here that he made the inference that \"certain aspects of social organization could be inferred through such a distributional study\".<ref name=\":21\">http://www.anthropology.hawaii.edu/people/Faculty/Stark/pdfs/Longacre_et_al_1991.pdf</ref> Longacre chose to study a community that still lives and uses the pottery today so that the truth behind the pottery could be revealed. He chose the Kalinga because they are a culture that uses the pottery not only for commercial use, but also for household use. He also wanted a culture that had been previously studied by anthropologists in order to have a foundation of ethnoarchaeological research to rely on.<ref name=\":21\" /> When Longacre went to see the area, the Kalinga convinced him to come back and study their pottery.<ref>{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=L9oJ1z7U0uQC&pg=PA101&lpg=PA101&dq=why+did+william+longacre+conduct+the+kalinga+ethnoarchaeological+project#v=onepage&q=why%20did%20william%20longacre%20conduct%20the%20kalinga%20ethnoarchaeological%20project&f=false | title=Archaeological Anthropology: Perspectives on Method and Theory| isbn=9780816525171| last1=Skibo| first1=James M.| last2=Graves| first2=Michael W.| last3=Stark| first3=Miriam T.| year=2007}}</ref>\n\nThe main idea of the Kalinga ethnoarchaeological project was to compare inferences made in Carter Ranch Pueblo to the results of the Kalinga project about the social context of pottery making. Later, in 1975, \"the new research goal\" was added to the Kalinga ethnoarchaeological project. Longacre and his researchers wished to investigate how long artifacts lasted before they were discarded by the people who used them. Within the Kalinga project specifically, this meant studying how long pots were used before they were discarded.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\n=== Determining relationships between pottery and household kinship ===\nThe Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project was a comparative study proposed by William Longacre to verify whether or not the social relations (kinship systems) observed at his Carter Ranch Pueblo study were applicable to all pottery making societies or just Carter Ranch itself.<ref name=\":21\" />\n\nMethods of Longacre's research included: mapping the pottery-making villages in Dangtalan and Dalupa, determining relationships among different households, and identifying stylistic changes in pottery between pottery makers who knew one another vs. pottery makers who did not know each other.<ref name=\":20\" /> The exchange of pottery in the Kalinga community led to a dominance of kinship in the primary social order. The pottery is exchanged via kinship channels, modeling the Kalinga's social relationships. Therefore, this means that the Kalinga's pottery exchange used social relationships in order to frame their economy. {{cite thesis|last=Takaki|first=Michiko|title=Aspects of Exchange in a Kalinga Society, Northern Luzon|date=1977|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|type=Phd|chapter=}}\n\nIn his dissertation, \u201cAspects of Exchange in a Kalinga society, Northern Luzon\u201d, Michiko Takaki focused on the Kalinga Ethnoarchaeological Project, specifically how \u201ca particular agricultural people [the Kalinga] make their living and regulate their social relations\u201d.<ref name=\"Takaki 1977\">{{cite thesis|last=Takaki|first=Michiko|title=Aspects of Exchange in a Kalinga Society, Northern Luzon|date=1977|publisher=Xerox University Microfilms|type=Phd|chapter=iii}}</ref> Takaki's field work with the Kalinga as part of the Ethnoarchaeological project took place from 1964-1968. He found that social relations among the Kalinga were one of the main ways that made it possible for pottery to be part of their economic process.\n\nThe ranking of goods one receives in the Kalinga community parallel to the relationship they have to the member they are receiving from. Receiving goods based on kinship relationships is optional once a fifth degree of genealogical distance is reached.<ref name=\"Takaki 1977\" /> Longacre's study led to the term \"ceramic sociology\".<ref name=\":20\" />\n\n== Ceramic production and exchange ==\n\n=== Analysis of Previously unpublished data ===\nIn a study, William A. Longacre and Taylor R.

(2015), these findings suggest that the exchange of pottery arbitrated each household's labor in the rice fields as \"a function of cooperative work through social relations.\" <ref name=\":22\" /> The trading of pottery centered on specific households that specialized in the making of pottery, and households that specialized in rice cultivation.<ref name=\":22\" /> The exchange of pottery between the two groups surfaces the existence of specialization in both pottery, and rice cultivation.\n\n=== Ceramic function and technique ===\nIn the Kalinga society, pottery serves as an extra source of income, and is made by women.<ref name=\":42\">{{Cite journal|last=Longacre|first=William A.|last2=Hermes|first2=Taylor R.|title=Rice farming and pottery production among the Kalinga: New ethnoarchaeological data from the Philippines|journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology|volume=38|pages=35\u201345|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2014.09.005|year=2015}}</ref> The women use their hands to form the vessel, and do not use a wheel.

Pots made for cooking and water jars often are coated with organic resins to reduce water permeability, and also are decorated with red ochre.<ref name=\":32\" /> Open fire is used to fire the pots, and the pots are also air dried.<ref name=\":32\" /> The gifts, such as pottery, that are given are often reciprocated with rice in the Kalinga culture.<ref name=\":32\" /> In addition, the women are responsible for the exchange of pottery that takes place outside of the household, and the amount of uncooked rice that a vessel can hold determines the value of that vessel.<ref name=\":32\" />\n\n=== Work of other archaeologists ===\nIn another study, Miriam T.

The Cordilleras has two distinct ways rain falls throughout the year.

Many of the pots found in Danglatan were not actually made from residents mainly because in Kalinga barter and gift-giving were utilized as the major form of distribution.<ref name=\":19\" /> The increase of ceramic production in Dalupa is coupled with a wider expansion of pottery, allowing potters to trade their products past the boundaries of the Pasil Valley. When trading past the boundaries, potters encounter areas with new social and ethnic practices and some areas that still do not have producer-consumer kinship ties.<ref name=\":18\" /> \u201c Balanced exchange\u201d negotiations are enacted and earthward pots are one of the artifacts that are bargained. In a traditional Kalinga pottery business deal pounded rice is the method of payment and the amount of uncooked rice contained by each pot dictates its worth.<ref name=\":18\" /> However, there is limited knowledge on the size and methods on which ceramic is distributed in places that do not utilize market methods to exchange.\n\nA significant event that led to changes in the Pasil River valley was the controversy that was developed due to the Chico River dam which initiated in the 1970s.<ref name=\":17\" /> Dams were to be created in the Kalinga region in order to generate electricity for the urban areas, which did not house native Kalinga's.<ref name=\":17\" /> This project would force movement of the Kalingas, which elicited resistance from the people leading to military involvement. Kalinga has undergone construction such as, building, motor vehicles and roads that unite the older more primitive Kalinga villages.<ref name=\":17\" /> Increased developments has made it easier to transport goods to various places.\n\nKalinga is a region with resources wanted to be exploited by other places, like the mines of gold present and logging. Longacre discovered that many of the water pots in Dangtalan had their exteriors polished with ''lebu'', which is a resin from the ''almaciga tree''.<ref name=\":17\" /> People were able to obtain resin supplies from the migratory traders that lived in areas with the almaciga tree and then traveled to places like Dalupa and Dagnlatan to deliver resin supplies. However, the supply of resin for the Dulapa potters began to dwindle due to governmental changes. One of the main resin deposits is located near the Batong Buhay gold mine that was reopened for mining in the 1970s depriving Dalupa potters from resin because the traders were able to obtain a new form of income.<ref name=\":17\" /> The gold mine has also endangered local resin harvesters due to an increase in highway robberies.<ref name=\":17\" /> The mining of gold in the region would in turn destroy riverine resources that are important for the region.\n\nKalinga is also getting stripped of its magnificent tropical forests and the vast animal and plant diversity present. The Philippine government has allowed the cutting of trees for lumber having a trickle effect on the native Kalingas. The clearing of land results in less land for Swidden agriculture, mainly with rice cultivation and also forces the natives to modify the materials utilized in the production of artifacts and tools like ceramics. Trees are one of the main ingredients to create pots and other pottery designs. Another major resin reservoir is found in the areas owned by big logging companies like the Cellophil Resources Corporation. Their logging has caused major deforestation in the Kalinga region leaving no trees in which to create resin. Kalinga potters are not only losing forests that allows the manufacture of resin, but are also banned from the remaining forest areas by have fines placed up by the Cellophil corporation.  With the newly found rarity for resin, potters need to investigate new materials they could use to polish the exterior of their creations.\n\nAlthough the mining and logging industries have allowed the introduction of non Kalinga goods into the region since the 1930s, they have still managed to keep a low influx of Filipino populations.<ref name=\":18\" /> The economy in Kalinga is heavily influenced by intensive rice cultivation and the barter system. The Kalinga economy also has a foundation of specialization with different people specializing in different jobs. The Pasil settlements are all composed of bilateral kin groups following the trend of matrilocal communities and endogamy.<ref name=\":18\" /> Within the Kalinga region they are \u201cpolitically

Bosch later made this a factory option, and was designated as BCN LP.\n* Bosch also offered SLP BCN, a \"long-play\" variant of the format.  It moved the tape at 1/3 speed so that up to 6 hours could be recorded one reel. The unit has a special [[Slant azimuth#Slant azimuth recording|head wheel]] with [[Azimuth recording|azimuth head]].

Unlike lindy hop, however, it is a [[choreographed]] prance designed for performance. It is danced by both couples (usually of mixed gender) and groups, either all-female or four to eight couples together.  This is normally a very fast and physically demanding dance.\n\n== History   ==\n\nDuring the development of the musical genre [[rock and roll]], dances to go with the music were also created. From [[swing (dance)|swing]], which came into being around 1920, [[Lindy Hop]] emerged, the first [[partner dance]] ever to feature [[Acrobatics|acrobatic]] elements. Lindy Hop was modified around 1940 to suit faster music, creating the style known as [[boogie woogie (dance)|boogie woogie]]. \n\n== Technique and basics ==\n\nLike other forms of dance, Rock and Roll has evolved around the world over time.  Depending on your location, the basic kick step style  starts with the Basic 6 step: \n\n'''[[Partner dance#Leader and follower|Leader]]''' starts with left foot kick ball change, kick step (left), kick step (right)\n\n'''Follower''' starts with right foot kick ball change, kick step (right), kick step (left)\n\nThere is another form of tap step basic footwork that is quite easy to learn:\n\n'''Leader''' starts with their left foot and does a back step, then a tap step (left), tap step (right)\n\n'''Follower''' starts with the right foot and does a back step, then a tap step(right), tap step(left) \n\nThe most obvious feature of the '''Acrobatic''' rock and roll dance are its '''kicks''' (into thin air) and its acrobatic elements like ''lifts'', ''jumps'', ''throws'' and ''flips''. Today's rock and roll is focused on [[show dance|show]] and [[competition dance]] and - with the exception of its name - has nearly nothing in common with the former rock and roll movement. It is danced in pairs or in [[formation dancing|formation]] and can even be danced with one male and two females simultaneously which is called \"triples\". Over the years rock and roll dancing has experienced several important changes: the former 6-basic step was converted into the modern tournament's 9-basic step with its typical [[kick ball change]]. Other characteristics are techniques such as the man's [[body wave (dance move)|body wave]] movement, that he uses to fling his partner from a sitting position upwards, and the [[throwing basic]] movement, where she steps onto his hands and is catapulted upwards into neck breaking jumps. Because of its demanding technique, high speed, and acrobatics, Rock and Roll is a straining high-performance dance and is most often performed by young dancers.\n\nThe name of the basic comes from the number of separate actions. With the 6-basic one counts ''(1)step (2)step (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle'' or ''(1)kick (2)settle (3)kick (4)settle (5)kick (6)settle'', with the 9-basic it is ''(1)kick (2)ball (3)change (4)kick (5)settle (6)settle (7)kick (8)settle (9)settle.'' This means that a correct rock and roll kick will have the [[ballroom glossary#Supporting foot|supporting foot]] settling on the floor a tiny moment before the kicking foot settles.\n\n== Dance categories ==\n[[File:Rocknroll-dancing-swan.jpg|thumb|The \"swan\", a popular acrobatic move in the Junior class.]]\n\nThe [[World Rock'n'Roll Confederation]] recognizes the following dance categories for international competitions:\n<ref>[http://www.wrrc.org/index.jsp?mandant=wrrc.org&actualMode=Public&homePage=0&mainRessort=67&subRessort=378 WRRC - Rules - Rock'n'Roll] retrieved 2010-03-10</ref>\n* '''Youth:''' No acrobatics allowed. Couples are 14 years old or younger.\n* '''Juniors:''' A maximum of four acrobatic moves are allowed under the category's safety regulations. Couples are between 12 and 17 years of age.\n* '''B-Class:''' Two dances per couple and round. One is a dance program with no acrobatics allowed (''footwork'', or ''foot technique''), the other an acrobatic program (''acrobatic'') requiring six acrobatic moves. The male may throw the female into the air, but no flips are allowed. Minimum age is 14 years.\n* '''Main Class:''' Two dances, like in B-Class. Only difference to B-Class is that almost all acrobatics (e.g. lifts, jumps, throws and flips) are allowed.

However, all have the four classes listed above (though some rules may differ).\n\n== Rhythm and music ==\n\nRock and roll dance works on the 4/4 measure. One basic comprises six beats and therefore one and a half measures. Differently than the offbeat of rock and roll music, the dance puts stress on the first and third beats of each measure. The music is very fast, between 176 and 208 [[tempo|bpm]]. Due to non-off beat stressing and speed traditional rock and roll music has been replaced by modern disco and pop music.\n\n== Clothes ==\n\nCurrently advanced tournament rock and roll dancers don't wear [[petticoats]] and [[jeans]] - as the original rock and roll dancers did - but rather '''multi-coloured''' costumes that are made of elastic artificial [[fibre]] and can only be purchased as individual pieces by special [[tailor]]s. One reason for that is that acrobatic elements have grown more and more dangerous, requiring both freedom of movement and enough durability to avoid tearing.\n\nThe shoes worn is one of the most important elements in Rock & Roll dancing. Their soles need to possess both \"slip\" & \"grip\" characteristics.  The most common footwear are light [[jazz shoes]] for the dance programs, while the acrobatic programs require more support for the female so [[Sneakers (footwear)|sneakers]] made for [[aerobics]] dancers are usually chosen.{{fact|date=September 2009}}\n\n== Organization ==\n\nThe ''[[World Rock \u2019n\u2019 Roll Confederation|World Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Confederation]]'' is the organization that takes care of national and international rules and guidelines for tournaments.

Juju focuses on reducing the operation overhead of today's software by facilitating quickly deploying, configuring, scaling, integrating, and performing operational tasks on a wide choice of public and private cloud services along with bare metal servers and local container based deployments.\n\n==Juju modeling complex software topologies ==\n\nJuju's mission is to provide a modeling language for users that abstracts the specifics of operating complex big software topologies. Doing so reduces the cost of operations and provides flexibility. A Juju Model is an environment to manage and operate a set of software applications. Models can be operated on many clouds: Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Compute Engine, OpenStack, etc. A Juju Controller is the service that tracks the events, state, and user activity across multiple models. You can think of it a bit like a database server where the controller is the server and models are different databases available on that server. Each model can have different configuration, sets of operating software, and different users with access at various levels. Some examples of models could be a web application, load balancer, and database in a \"web-app\" model. By using models deployments can be isolated into logical solutions and managed separately.\n \nJuju can also be used to operate software on bare-metal servers by using Canonical's [[Metal as a Service]], in containers using [https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/introduction/ LXD], and more. Juju models provide an abstraction with allows the operations know-how to be cloud agnostic. This means that Charms and Bundles can help operate the same software with the same tooling on a public cloud, private cloud, or a local laptop.\n\n== Juju charms ==\n\nThe central mechanism behind Juju is called ''Charms''. Charms can be written in any programming language that can be executed from the command line. A Charm is a collection of [[YAML]] configuration files and a selection of \"hooks\". A hook is a naming convention to install software, start/stop a service, manage relationships with other charms, upgrade charms, scale charms, configure charms, etc. Charms can have many properties. Charm helpers allow boiler-plate code to be automatically generated hence accelerating the creation of charms.\n\n== Juju client and environments ==\n\nJuju has two components: a client and a bootstrap node. Currently clients exist for Ubuntu, CentOS, Mac and Windows. After installing the client, one or more environments can be bootstrapped. Juju environments can be bootstrapped on many clouds: [[Amazon Web Services]], [[HP Cloud Services]], [[Microsoft Azure]], [[OpenStack]], ''etc.'' By creating a Juju Provider, additional cloud environments can be supported. Juju can also be bootstrapped on [[bare-metal server]]s. Large deployments can use Canonical's '''Metal as a Service'''. Small deployments can use the manual provider, which allows any SSH Ubuntu machine to be converted into a Juju-managed machine. Juju can also be installed on a local Ubuntu machine via [[LXC]] [[operating system\u2013level virtualization]] and the local provider.\n\n== Command line and GUI ==\n\nJuju has both a command line and a GUI. The GUI allows users to visually see what software is currently running in which models in a very clear fashion. It also gives the user the power to search the Charmstore and browse results with detailed Charm information presented. It also allows the deployment of complex software stacks via drag-and-drop. The Juju GUI is automatically available on every controller.\n\n== Bundles ==\n\nJuju also has a concept of Bundles. A Bundle is a portable specification for a model with charms, configuration, and relations all specified in a declarative YAML format. A Bundle YAML file can later be imported into another Juju model and shared with others. Bundles can also be uploaded to the charm store, allowing anybody to deploy a bundle via drag-and-drop or one command.\nIn this example bundle, two applications are modeled; mediawiki, and mysql. Users can modify attributes declared in the bundle to customize their deployment:\n\n <nowiki>\nservices:\n  mediawiki:\n    charm: cs:trusty/mediawiki-3\n    num_units: 1\n    options:\n      debug: false\n      name: Please set name of wiki\n      skin: vector\n  mysql:\n    charm: cs:trusty/mysql-29\n    num_units: 1\n    options:\n      binlog-format: MIXED\n      dataset-size: 80%\n      tuning-level: safest\nseries: trusty\nrelations:\n- - mediawiki:db\n  - mysql:db\n</nowiki>\n\n== Charm Store ==\n\nThe Juju Charm Store launched on April 3, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Castro |first=Jorge O. |url=http://www.jorgecastro.org/2012/04/03/the-juju-charm-store-will-change-the-way-you-use-ubuntu-server/ |title=Why the juju charm store will change the way you use Ubuntu Server |website=Jorge's Stompbox |date=April 3, 2012 |accessdate=September 1, 2012}}</ref> The Charm Store regularly tests charms to notify charm authors when code breaks in addition to ensuring that Juju users have access to the latest versions of charms.\n\n== Supported platforms ==\n\nJuju is available on Ubuntu server, with agents available for Ubuntu, [[CentOS]]<ref>{{cite web | url = https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/2066 | title = Juju CentOS support patches}}</ref> and [[Microsoft Windows]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://github.com/juju/juju/pull/189 | title = Juju Windows support patches}}</ref> Support for both CentOS and Windows has been contributed by [http://www.cloudbase.it Cloudbase Solutions].\n\n== References ==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{Official website|https://jaas.ai/}}\n* {{GitHub|juju/juju}}\n\n{{Ubuntu}}\n\n[[Category:Canonical (company)]]\n[[Category:Free software programmed in Go]]\n[[Category:Python software]]\n[[Category:Software using the GNU AGPL license]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Advert|date=March 2014}}\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox software\n|name                   = Juju\n|logo                   = Logo for the Juju software project by Canonical in Orange, Black and White.svg\n|collapsible            = \n|author                 = [[Canonical Ltd.|Canonical]]\n|developer              = \n|discontinued           = \n|latest release version = 2.7.5\n|latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2020|04|02}}<ref>{{cite web|title=Releases - juju/juju|url=https://github.com/juju/juju/releases|via=[[GitHub]]|accessdate=02 April 2020}}</ref>\n|released               = 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ubuntu.com/blog/juju-logo|title=Juju: a logo with a story|work=Ubuntu Blog|first=Marcus|last=Haslam|date=3 November 2011}}</ref>\n|programming language   = [[Go (programming language)|Go]]\n|operating system       = [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[CentOS]], [[MacOS]]\n|platform               = \n|size                   = \n|language               = \n|genre                  = [[Orchestration (computing)|Orchestration]]\n|license                = [[Affero General Public License|GNU Affero GPL v3]] [[LGPL]]\n|website                = {{URL|https://jaas.ai/}}\n}}\n'''Juju''' is an open source application modeling tool developed by [[Canonical Ltd]].
