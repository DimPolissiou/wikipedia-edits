Throughout the generation, Sony and Microsoft continued to release hardware upgrades to their flagship consoles. In August 2016 and September 2016, Microsoft and Sony respectively both released \"slim\" revisions of their consoles, the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Slim. The Xbox One S notably added support for [[HDR video]] and [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], while Sony released a software update to add HDR to all existing PlayStation 4 consoles; the PlayStation 4 Slim does not support UHD Blu-ray. Following this was an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4, the [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], which was released later in November 2016; meanwhile, Microsoft also announced an upgraded version of the Xbox One in 2016 under the name ''Project Scorpio.'' This would become the [[Xbox One X]], released a year later in November 2017. Both of these consoles were aimed at providing upgraded hardware to support rendering games at up to [[4K resolution]].\n\nIn contrast to Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo began to phase out the Wii U in favor of a completely new hardware platform announced in April 2016 as ''NX''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|title=Nintendo dates its successor to the Wii U, the NX|date=April 27, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616200346/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-access=limited}}</ref> This would become the Nintendo Switch, released in March 2017.

Instead, each of the major manufacturers (Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) produced new systems with similar designs and capabilities as their predecessors, but with increased performance (speed, graphics, storage capacity, etc.) Even the major innovation of the seventh generation, motion capture gaming, was greatly diminished in prevalence as most games that included it opted to make it optional or secondary to traditional button-based controls. [[Virtual reality]] gaming hit the home console market in the middle of the generation with Sony releasing the [[PlayStation VR]], a [[virtual reality headset]] compatible with all PlayStation 4, in October 2016. Sales remained modest, with only 4% of PS4 owners purchasing one.

Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January 31, 2017, about a month before the release of the Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/1/31/14452066/wii-u-discontinued|title=Final Wii U models discontinued in Japan - Polygon|website=www.polygon.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== PlayStation 4 ===\n{{Main|PlayStation 4}}\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Sony announced the PlayStation 4 during a press conference in [[New York City]], and it was released on November 15, 2013, in North America. The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the [[PlayStation Network]] and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]). The PS4's [[DualShock 4]] controller is similar to [[DualShock 3|the previous model]], but adds a [[touchpad]] and a \"Share\" button, along with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light bar on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated [[PlayStation Eye|camera accessory]] will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280\u00d7800px [[stereo camera]]s with support for depth sensing similar to [[Kinect]], and remains compatible with the [[PlayStation Move]] peripherals. The PS4 will also have [[second screen]] capabilities through both [[mobile app]]s and the [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[Cloud gaming|game streaming]] through the recently acquired [[Gaikai]] service.<ref name=\"PS4 announced - TheVerge\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4009410/sony-playstation-4-ps4-announcement | title=Sony announces the PlayStation 4 | work=The Verge | date=February 20, 2013 | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | last=Bishop | first=Bryan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/21/ps4-eye-has-two-cameras-one-to-watch-you-one-to-make-you-prett/ |title=PS4 Eye has two cameras: One to watch you, one to make you pretty |website=Joystiq |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/Fib3p |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released on November 15, 2013, in North America and November 29, 2013, in Australia and Europe at US$399.99, A$549 and \u20ac399 respectively.\n\n=== Xbox One ===\n{{Main|Xbox One}}\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One at an event in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The console has an increased focus on entertainment, including the ability to pass television programming from a [[set-top box]] over HDMI and use a built-in [[electronic program guide]], and the ability to [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] by snapping applications (such as [[Skype]] and [[Internet Explorer]]) to the side of the screen, similarly to [[Windows 8]]. The Xbox One features a new controller with \"Impulse Triggers\" that provide [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], and the ability to automatically [[Digital video recorder|record]] and save highlights from gameplay. An updated version of [[Kinect]] was developed for Xbox One, with a [[1080p]] camera and expanded voice controls. Originally bundled with the console, it has since been downplayed and excluded from later bundles.<ref name=\"verge-xbox1unveiling\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One: a next-gen console with a focus on interactive TV and apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4350918/xbox-one-microsoft-unveils-its-next-generation-console|work=The Verge|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-oneguide\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One guide brings HDMI in/out, overlays for live TV|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-hdmi-passthrough/|work=Engadget|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on November 22, 2013, at a launch price of US$499.99, \u20ac499 and A$599 respectively with Japan, and was later released in 26 other markets in 2014. It had two mid-generation upgrades, one released in 2016 called the Xbox One S, and the other called the Xbox One X.

Throughout the generation, Sony and Microsoft continued to release hardware upgrades to their flagship consoles. In August 2016 and September 2016, Microsoft and Sony respectively both released \"slim\" revisions of their consoles, the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Slim. The Xbox One S notably added support for [[HDR video]] and [[Ultra HD Blu-ray]], while Sony released a software update to add HDR to all existing PlayStation 4 consoles; the PlayStation 4 Slim does not support UHD Blu-ray. Following this was an upgraded version of the PlayStation 4, the [[PlayStation 4 Pro]], which was released later in November 2016; meanwhile, Microsoft also announced an upgraded version of the Xbox One in 2016 under the name ''Project Scorpio.'' This would become the [[Xbox One X]], released a year later in November 2017. Both of these consoles were aimed at providing upgraded hardware to support rendering games at up to [[4K resolution]].\n\nIn contrast to Microsoft and Sony, Nintendo began to phase out the Wii U in favor of a completely new hardware platform announced in April 2016 as ''NX''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Martens|first=Todd|url=https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|title=Nintendo dates its successor to the Wii U, the NX|date=April 27, 2016|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=April 8, 2019|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170616200346/https://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-nintendo-dates-its-successor-to-the-wii-u-the-nx-20160427-story.html|archive-date=June 16, 2017|url-access=limited}}</ref> This would become the Nintendo Switch, released in March 2017.

Instead, each of the major manufacturers (Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo) produced new systems with similar designs and capabilities as their predecessors, but with increased performance (speed, graphics, storage capacity, etc.) Even the major innovation of the seventh generation, motion capture gaming, was greatly diminished in prevalence as most games that included it opted to make it optional or secondary to traditional button-based controls. [[Virtual reality]] gaming hit the home console market in the middle of the generation with Sony releasing the [[PlayStation VR]], a [[virtual reality headset]] compatible with all PlayStation 4, in October 2016. Sales remained modest, with only 4% of PS4 owners purchasing one.

Nintendo officially discontinued the Wii U on January 31, 2017, about a month before the release of the Nintendo Switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/platform/amp/2017/1/31/14452066/wii-u-discontinued|title=Final Wii U models discontinued in Japan - Polygon|website=www.polygon.com|accessdate=June 21, 2017}}</ref>\n\n=== PlayStation 4 ===\n{{Main|PlayStation 4}}\n\nOn February 20, 2013, Sony announced the PlayStation 4 during a press conference in [[New York City]], and it was released on November 15, 2013, in North America. The new console places a heavy emphasis on features surrounding social interaction; gameplay videos can be shared via the [[PlayStation Network]] and other services, and users can stream games being played by themselves or others (either through the console, or directly to services such as [[Twitch (service)|Twitch]]). The PS4's [[DualShock 4]] controller is similar to [[DualShock 3|the previous model]], but adds a [[touchpad]] and a \"Share\" button, along with an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] light bar on the front to allow motion tracking. An updated [[PlayStation Eye|camera accessory]] will also be offered for the system; it now uses 1280\u00d7800px [[stereo camera]]s with support for depth sensing similar to [[Kinect]], and remains compatible with the [[PlayStation Move]] peripherals. The PS4 will also have [[second screen]] capabilities through both [[mobile app]]s and the [[PlayStation Vita]], and [[Cloud gaming|game streaming]] through the recently acquired [[Gaikai]] service.<ref name=\"PS4 announced - TheVerge\">{{cite news | url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/20/4009410/sony-playstation-4-ps4-announcement | title=Sony announces the PlayStation 4 | work=The Verge | date=February 20, 2013 | accessdate=February 20, 2013 | last=Bishop | first=Bryan}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Conditt |first=Jessica |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/02/21/ps4-eye-has-two-cameras-one-to-watch-you-one-to-make-you-prett/ |title=PS4 Eye has two cameras: One to watch you, one to make you pretty |website=Joystiq |date=February 21, 2013 |accessdate=February 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://archive.is/Fib3p |archive-date=May 30, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe PlayStation 4 was released on November 15, 2013, in North America and November 29, 2013, in Australia and Europe at US$399.99, A$549 and \u20ac399 respectively.\n\n=== Xbox One ===\n{{Main|Xbox One}}\n\nOn May 21, 2013, Microsoft announced the Xbox One at an event in [[Redmond, Washington]]. The console has an increased focus on entertainment, including the ability to pass television programming from a [[set-top box]] over HDMI and use a built-in [[electronic program guide]], and the ability to [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] by snapping applications (such as [[Skype]] and [[Internet Explorer]]) to the side of the screen, similarly to [[Windows 8]]. The Xbox One features a new controller with \"Impulse Triggers\" that provide [[Haptic technology|force feedback]], and the ability to automatically [[Digital video recorder|record]] and save highlights from gameplay. An updated version of [[Kinect]] was developed for Xbox One, with a [[1080p]] camera and expanded voice controls. Originally bundled with the console, it has since been downplayed and excluded from later bundles.<ref name=\"verge-xbox1unveiling\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One: a next-gen console with a focus on interactive TV and apps|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4350918/xbox-one-microsoft-unveils-its-next-generation-console|work=The Verge|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"engadget-oneguide\">{{Cite web|title=Xbox One guide brings HDMI in/out, overlays for live TV|url=https://www.engadget.com/2013/05/21/xbox-one-hdmi-passthrough/|work=Engadget|accessdate=May 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox One was released in North America, Europe, and Australia on November 22, 2013, at a launch price of US$499.99, \u20ac499 and A$599 respectively with Japan, and was later released in 26 other markets in 2014. It had two mid-generation upgrades, one released in 2016 called the Xbox One S, and the other called the Xbox One X.

An accomplished painter and sculptor, she was also an art teacher, philanthropist, patron, and cultural advocate. Over the course of a long career, she made oil and acrylic paintings as well as drawings, watercolors, and other paper works. She also sculpted using found objects, Plexiglas, metals, and particleboard. Originally working in a realist style, she became well known for geometric abstractions based on figurative subjects. In 1993 a critic described this approach as \"[walking] a tightrope between the abstract and the representational with a suggestion of three-dimensional depth.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 1993\"/> Rothschild was by choice a regional artist. Although she occasionally exhibited elsewhere, she did not actively promote her career outside a mid-Atlantic region centered on Baltimore. Thus, in 1997 a critic wrote, \"Amalie Rothschild is a fixture and ornament of the Baltimore art world.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun May 1997\"/> At the time of her death a critic gave this career summary: \"She was one of the leading artists of her time in this area. Her work is thoroughly modern and related to geometric abstraction, but without losing the figure. It has emotional reserve, often contains a hint of humor and at times recalls the childlike sagacity of the great Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/>\n\n==Early life and training==\n\nIn her youth Rothschild attended a mix of public and private elementary schools. From age six to fifteen she took classes at a local art school once a week. She attended an accelerated public junior high called School 49 and then [[Western High School (Baltimore)|Western High School]] in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>{{refn|group=note|School 49, formally known as the Robert E. Lee Accelerate Junior High School, gave a rigorous academic education to boys and girls who had been selected from among all of Baltimore's elementary schools. Its curriculum compressed the normal three years of junior high into just two. It opened in 1909, using a building that had housed a private prep school, and closed in 1960.<ref name=\"School 49\"/>}}{{refn|group=note|Founded in 1844, and considered to be the first all-girls public high school in the United States, Western High School maintained selection criteria and high academic standards similar to those of School 49.<ref name=\"Knight-Ridder Mar 2006\"/> }} Having graduated at age 16 in 1932, Rothschild initially joined the freshman class at [[Goucher College]], but quickly changed her mind and began study at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]].<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her parents cautioned her against majoring in a subject, such as fine arts, where graduates' job prospects were practically nil.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> She chose fashion illustration and, graduating two years later, spent half a year at the [[Parsons School of Design]] (then called the The New York School of Fine and Applied Art).<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> Forced to return home when her father's death deprived the family of needed income, she began to [[freelancer|freelance]] as an illustrator, making drawings for department store ads.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> At the same time she took instruction from private art teachers and showed her work to a local artist, [[Herman Maril]].<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/>\n\n==Career in art==\n\nRothschild had a few small landscape oil paintings accepted for the seventh annual exhibition of Maryland painters, a juried show held in 1939 the Baltimore Museum of Art.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>{{refn|group=note|Known as the \"All Maryland Show\" these annual shows began in 1933 and twenty years later were expanded to include artists from Delaware and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Maryland Artists Annual BMA\"/> The shows became biennial and in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jul 1999\"/> }} Three years later her first appearance in a solo exhibition was also at the Baltimore Museum of Art.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Early in the 1940s she showed in the annual Christmas sales exhibition held at the [[The Phillips Collection|Phillips Collection]] in Washington, D.C. and the museum's founder, [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], bought her painting \"Slum Clearance\" for the collection.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> In 1951 she was commissioned to design a curtain for the [[Torah ark]] in the newly built synagogue of the [[Baltimore Hebrew Congregation]].<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Later in that decade the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] bought a painting of hers, \"Penelope\" and included her work along with works by Washington artists Anne E. Baum and [[Helene Herzbrun]] in a three-person exhibition.\n\nIn 1958 she began showing in commercial galleries, first in a group exhibition at the IFA Galleries in Washington (1958) and then, in the 1960s, in group shows at the Juster Gallery in Manhattan and the Rumsey Gallery (Rumsey Island, Maryland, 1966). In the 1970s and 1980s her work often appeared in solo exhibitions in commercial galleries, including Jacob's Ladder (Washington, 1972), B.R. Kornblatt (Baltimore, 1978, 1980), C. Grimaldis (Washington, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1999), and Franz Bader (Washington, 1989, 1991). Her gallery during the last decade of her life was Gomez (Baltimore).<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>\n\nBeginning in the 1960s she was given an increasing number of solo exhibitions in the museums and public galleries of the Baltimore area, including shows at Goucher College (1964, 1968), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1971), and the Maryland Institute of Art (1985).<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Her first major retrospective exhibition was held at [[Maryland Art Place]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> In 1986 she created two unusual cello case sculptures in the shape of women. The pair contained loudspeakers and were used in a piece of music performed by [[Vivian Adelberg Rudow]], a Baltimore composer, musician, and performance artist.<ref name=\"Washington Post Nov 1986\"/><ref name=\"Washington Post Apr 1987\"/> Rothschild made a conscious decision to remain a regional artist and did not energetically seek to establish a national reputation.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>\n\nRothschild has been portrayed as suffering from the male-oriented art culture of her time but, as one commentator has pointed out, she did not have to support herself through art and, to the contrary, had sufficient financial resources to be an art patron.<ref name=\"Spooners Quiet Feminist 2012 \"/> After the birth of her children, she had constant household help. In general, \"she had the freedom and opportunity to invest time into her art and advocate for artists.\"<ref name=\"Spooners Quiet Feminist 2012 \"/> A few months before she died, an oral historian, Jean Freedman, interviewed Rothschild for the [[Jewish Women's Archive]]. Asked about her experience as an artist and a woman, she said, \"Well, you know, I\u2019ve been asked that question as an artist, 'How does it feel to be a woman artist?  Have you felt discriminated against?'  And I say, 'Well, not that I\u2019m aware of.'  I\u2019ve been lucky, my art has prospered, and when I\u2019ve applied to galleries I\u2019ve frequently been accepted.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>\n\n===Artistic style===\n\n[[File:1955Resortscape.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Resortscape, oil on canvas, 18 x 24 inches]]\n[[File:1968RipeningOfOranges.jpg|left|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Ripening of the Oranges, Sicily, acrylic on canvas, 48 x 48 inches]]\n[[File:1996BirthOfAMermaid.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Birth of a Mermaid]]\n[[File:1984Josepha.jpg|left|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Josepha, cast handmade paper on linen]]\n[[File:1966ArtQuotes.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Art Quotes, pen and ink on paper 16 x 7 inches]]\n\nDuring the Jewish Women's Archive oral history interview Rothschild said that she her style gradually evolved from realist to abstract during the 1940s and early 1950s. She made the change entirely on her own in a slow self-taught process.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> In viewing a retrospective exhibition of her work, a critic said in 2012 that Rothschild's 1948 oil painting \"Portrait of Me (Self Portrait with Crossed Arms)\" seemed to be a transitional work, particularly as it emphasized Rothschild's angular shoulders and arms.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/> This painting can be seen in the 1984 photo of Rothschild along with an earlier self-portrait. The photo is shown in the box at top. In the interview she also said her experience as a volunteer art therapist in the 1950s helped her to move away from planned and structured work and to move toward a more spontaneous expression of emotion. In 1958 a gallerist described the paintings in her emerging geometric style as \"personal abstract statements characterized by subtlety of color, symbol, and pattern.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post Sep 1958\"/> Her interest in the human figure persisted even as what was seen as her \"distinctive take on geometric abstraction\" evolved, and many of her paintings contain elements that derive from parts of the body as seen from unusual angles.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/><ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Apr 2008\"/> The 1968 acrylic painting \"Ripening of the Oranges, Sicily\" (shown at left) is said to be a first-rate example of how she relied upon a \"gridded composition that allowed for both structural variation and representational allusion.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s Rothschild made a transition from being mainly a painter to being mainly a sculptor. She took evening sculpture classes at the Baltimore Museum of Art and began to make assemblages using found objects, including pieces of wood that she arranged to have cast in bronze at a foundry in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> She gradually expanded the scope of her sculptural work to include a wide variety of materials including found objects, Plexiglas, metals, and particleboard. She usually made her sculptures by herself, without outside help. In size they range from large outdoor and sometimes monumental pieces to small works that can be held in the hand.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Her 1996 sculpture, \"Birth of a Mermaid,\" (shown right) shows her mature style in this medium.\n\nIn the early 1980s Rothschild learned paper-making at the Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, Maryland. She used this new skill to make what one critic called \"highly embossed sculptural works.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post Nov 1982\"/> {{refn|group=note|[[Helen C. Frederick]] founded Pyramid Atlantic as a non-profit contemporary art center providing instruction and studio rentals for paper makers, print makers, and book arts craftspeople.<ref name=\"Pyramid Atlantic\"/> }} One of these sculptural works, \"Josepha\" (1984), can be seen at left.\n\nIn 1993 she contrasted two aspects of her method, one, called \"material to idea,\" in which she created sculptures with found materials, and the other, \"idea to material,\" in which she started with a drawing and then assembled the material to create the final product.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 15 1993\"/>\n\nDuring the years in which sculpture dominated her output she continued to make quick and spontaneous works on paper, both drawings and watercolors.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> One of these drawings, \"Art Quotes\" (1966) can bee seen at right. Shortly before her death she made a return to figuration in a set of small works on paper prepared for a solo exhibition at the C.Grimaldis Gallery called \"Artist and Model.\" A critic said that in these works (in ink, watercolor, and oil) she explored how the models the artists depicted could be \"reduced to their definitional lines,\" showing them as compositional elements rather than living beings.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Sep 1999\"/>\n\nWhen in 1997 a critic reviewed the whole body of her output he commented on her stylistic consistency. He wrote, \"A group of Baltimore artist Amalie Rothschild's sculptures and drawings demonstrate the consistency of this artist's work: its sure craftsmanship, its sly humor and its debt to the superficially childlike but deeply wise work of Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 1997\"/> Throughout her career she was similarly consistent in her work habits. In 2012 broadcast journalist Sheila Kast said \"Amalie Rothschild (1916-2001) was one of Baltimore\u2019s most prolific visual artists during the 20th century.\"<ref name=\"Maryland Morning May 2012\"/>\n\nIn the oral history interview she gave in the last year of her life Rothschild said that Matisse's practice of what she called \"automatic drawings\" helped her to achieve greater self-expressiveness. She said her earlier work had not successfully conveyed her inner feelings and that she had gradually changed her style to make it more expressive. All the same, a critic who reviewed a retrospective exhibition of her work at the Gomez Gallery saw her \"singular devotion to her vision of abstractions based on geometric forms\" as overly formal. \"Her work is pleasing, disciplined, often clever,\" he wrote, \"but not amply challenging,\" adding that there he saw too little sense of struggle or pushing of boundaries.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 1993\"/> Some years later, the same critic said her work had \"emotional reserve,\" but did not then see this characteristic as a flaw. He wrote, \"Her work is thoroughly modern and related to geometric abstraction, but without losing the figure. It has emotional reserve, often contains a hint of humor and at times recalls the childlike sagacity of the great Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/>\n\n==Art teacher==\n\nBetween 1956 and 1970 Rothschild volunteered as an art therapist at the  [[Springfield Hospital Center|Springfield State Mental Hospital]] where she and another volunteer gave what she called \"kindergarten level\" instruction to severely disabled adults.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her goal was not so much to teach them art as to help them to express themselves in some way through paint and paper.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> During the next four years she taught at a small school that had been established to offer an alternative to what the organizers saw as the extreme conservatism of the Maryland Institute of Art. Called the Metropolitan School of Art, it folded when the Maryland Institute brought in a new director and changed its policies.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> One of its students, Gladys Hack Goldstein, later became a prominent Baltimore abstract painter.<ref name=\"Tribune Business Mar 2010\"/> Beginning in 1960 Rothschild spent eight years as a part-time instructor at [[Goucher College]]. She taught students painting and drawing in one course each semester and resigned when asked to work full-time.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/><ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>\n\n==Philanthropist, art patron, advocate==\n\nSoon after the end of World War II Rothschild took the first of many influential positions within the Baltimore arts community. Between 1948 and 1950 she was president of the city's Artists' Union.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>{{refn|group=note|Local artists formed the union in 1934 to promote their work and make it available to purchasers.<ref name=\"Washington Post Aug 1934\"/> }} In 1952 she helped to found the Baltimore Outdoor Art Festival which was subsequently held for nearly a quarter of a century in [[Druid Hill Park]].<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> In the late 1950s she chaired the artists committee of the Baltimore Museum of Arts and helped to found an artists' cooperative called Gallery One.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/><ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> During the 1960s she pulled back from commitments such as these and for the rest of her life was somewhat more selective in the leadership roles she chose to take. In 2001 she commented on this change: \"I\u2019ve been on every committee imaginable...and always was a leader in all these various things when I was younger. And finally I got to the point of where I wasn\u2019t having enough time to do my own work, I was always on the telephone. And I started to say no to everything.

An accomplished painter and sculptor, she was also an art teacher, philanthropist, patron, and cultural advocate. Over the course of a long career, she made oil and acrylic paintings as well as drawings, watercolors, and other paper works. She also sculpted using found objects, Plexiglas, metals, and particleboard. Originally working in a realist style, she became well known for geometric abstractions based on figurative subjects. In 1993 a critic described this approach as \"[walking] a tightrope between the abstract and the representational with a suggestion of three-dimensional depth.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 1993\"/> Rothschild was by choice a regional artist. Although she occasionally exhibited elsewhere, she did not actively promote her career outside a mid-Atlantic region centered on Baltimore. Thus, in 1997 a critic wrote, \"Amalie Rothschild is a fixture and ornament of the Baltimore art world.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun May 1997\"/> At the time of her death a critic gave this career summary: \"She was one of the leading artists of her time in this area. Her work is thoroughly modern and related to geometric abstraction, but without losing the figure. It has emotional reserve, often contains a hint of humor and at times recalls the childlike sagacity of the great Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> \n\n==Early life and training==\n\nIn her youth Rothschild attended a mix of public and private elementary schools. From age six to fifteen she took classes at a local art school once a week. She attended an accelerated public junior high called School 49 and then [[Western High School (Baltimore)|Western High School]] in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>{{refn|group=note|School 49, formally known as the Robert E. Lee Accelerate Junior High School, gave a rigorous academic education to boys and girls who had been selected from among all of Baltimore's elementary schools. Its curriculum compressed the normal three years of junior high into just two. It opened in 1909, using a building that had housed a private prep school, and closed in 1960.<ref name=\"School 49\"/>}}{{refn|group=note|Founded in 1844, and considered to be the first all-girls public high school in the United States, Western High School maintained selection criteria and high academic standards similar to those of School 49.<ref name=\"Knight-Ridder Mar 2006\"/> }} Having graduated at age 16 in 1932, Rothschild initially joined the freshman class at [[Goucher College]], but quickly changed her mind and began study at the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]].<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her parents cautioned her against majoring in a subject, such as fine arts, where graduates' job prospects were practically nil.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> She chose fashion illustration and, graduating two years later, spent half a year at the [[Parsons School of Design]] (then called the The New York School of Fine and Applied Art).<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> Forced to return home when her father's death deprived the family of needed income, she began to [[freelancer|freelance]] as an illustrator, making drawings for department store ads.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> At the same time she took instruction from private art teachers and showed her work to a local artist, [[Herman Maril]].<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> \n\n==Career in art==\n\nRothschild had a few small landscape oil paintings accepted for the seventh annual exhibition of Maryland painters, a juried show held in 1939 the Baltimore Museum of Art.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>{{refn|group=note|Known as the \"All Maryland Show\" these annual shows began in 1933 and twenty years later were expanded to include artists from Delaware and Washington, D.C.<ref name=\"Maryland Artists Annual BMA\"/> The shows became biennial and in the 1980s.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jul 1999\"/> }} Three years later her first appearance in a solo exhibition was also at the Baltimore Museum of Art.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Early in the 1940s she showed in the annual Christmas sales exhibition held at the [[The Phillips Collection|Phillips Collection]] in Washington, D.C. and the museum's founder, [[Duncan Phillips (art collector)|Duncan Phillips]], bought her painting \"Slum Clearance\" for the collection.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> In 1951 she was commissioned to design a curtain for the [[Torah ark]] in the newly built synagogue of the [[Baltimore Hebrew Congregation]].<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Later in that decade the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] bought a painting of hers, \"Penelope\" and included her work along with works by Washington artists Anne E. Baum and [[Helene Herzbrun]] in a three-person exhibition.   \n\nIn 1958 she began showing in commercial galleries, first in a group exhibition at the IFA Galleries in Washington (1958) and then, in the 1960s, in group shows at the Juster Gallery in Manhattan and the Rumsey Gallery (Rumsey Island, Maryland, 1966). In the 1970s and 1980s her work often appeared in solo exhibitions in commercial galleries, including Jacob's Ladder (Washington, 1972), B.R. Kornblatt (Baltimore, 1978, 1980), C. Grimaldis (Washington, 1985, 1988, 1991, 1999), and Franz Bader (Washington, 1989, 1991). Her gallery during the last decade of her life was Gomez (Baltimore).<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>  \n\nBeginning in the 1960s she was given an increasing number of solo exhibitions in the museums and public galleries of the Baltimore area, including shows at Goucher College (1964, 1968), the Baltimore Museum of Art (1971), and the Maryland Institute of Art (1985).<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Her first major retrospective exhibition was held at [[Maryland Art Place]] in 1997.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> In 1986 she created two unusual cello case sculptures in the shape of women. The pair contained loudspeakers and were used in a piece of music performed by [[Vivian Adelberg Rudow]], a Baltimore composer, musician, and performance artist.<ref name=\"Washington Post Nov 1986\"/><ref name=\"Washington Post Apr 1987\"/> Rothschild made a conscious decision to remain a regional artist and did not energetically seek to establish a national reputation.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>\n\nRothschild has been portrayed as suffering from the male-oriented art culture of her time but, as one commentator has pointed out, she did not have to support herself through art and, to the contrary, had sufficient financial resources to be an art patron.<ref name=\"Spooners Quiet Feminist 2012 \"/> After the birth of her children, she had constant household help. In general, \"she had the freedom and opportunity to invest time into her art and advocate for artists.\"<ref name=\"Spooners Quiet Feminist 2012 \"/> A few months before she died, an oral historian, Jean Freedman, interviewed Rothschild for the [[Jewish Women's Archive]]. Asked about her experience as an artist and a woman, she said, \"Well, you know, I\u2019ve been asked that question as an artist, 'How does it feel to be a woman artist?  Have you felt discriminated against?'  And I say, 'Well, not that I\u2019m aware of.'  I\u2019ve been lucky, my art has prospered, and when I\u2019ve applied to galleries I\u2019ve frequently been accepted.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>   \n\n===Artistic style===\n\n[[File:1955Resortscape.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Resortscape, oil on canvas, 18 x 24 inches]]\n[[File:1968RipeningOfOranges.jpg|left|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Ripening of the Oranges, Sicily, acrylic on canvas, 48 x 48 inches]]\n[[File:1996BirthOfAMermaid.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Birth of a Mermaid]]\n[[File:1984Josepha.jpg|left|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Josepha, cast handmade paper on linen]]\n[[File:1966ArtQuotes.jpg|right|thumb|Amalie Rothschild, Art Quotes, pen and ink on paper 16 x 7 inches]]\n\nDuring the Jewish Women's Archive oral history interview Rothschild said that she her style gradually evolved from realist to abstract during the 1940s and early 1950s. She made the change entirely on her own in a slow self-taught process.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> In viewing a retrospective exhibition of her work, a critic said in 2012 that Rothschild's 1948 oil painting \"Portrait of Me (Self Portrait with Crossed Arms)\" seemed to be a transitional work, particularly as it emphasized Rothschild's angular shoulders and arms.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/> This painting can be seen in the 1984 photo of Rothschild along with an earlier self-portrait. The photo is shown in the box at top. In the interview she also said her experience as a volunteer art therapist in the 1950s helped her to move away from planned and structured work and to move toward a more spontaneous expression of emotion. In 1958 a gallerist described the paintings in her emerging geometric style as \"personal abstract statements characterized by subtlety of color, symbol, and pattern.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post Sep 1958\"/> Her interest in the human figure persisted even as what was seen as her \"distinctive take on geometric abstraction\" evolved, and many of her paintings contain elements that derive from parts of the body as seen from unusual angles.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/><ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Apr 2008\"/> The 1968 acrylic painting \"Ripening of the Oranges, Sicily\" (shown at left) is said to be a first-rate example of how she relied upon a \"gridded composition that allowed for both structural variation and representational allusion.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Jun 2012\"/>\n\nDuring the 1960s Rothschild made a transition from being mainly a painter to being mainly a sculptor. She took evening sculpture classes at the Baltimore Museum of Art and began to make assemblages using found objects, including pieces of wood that she arranged to have cast in bronze at a foundry in Pennsylvania.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> She gradually expanded the scope of her sculptural work to include a wide variety of materials including found objects, Plexiglas, metals, and particleboard. She usually made her sculptures by herself, without outside help. In size they range from large outdoor and sometimes monumental pieces to small works that can be held in the hand.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Her 1996 scuplture, \"Birth of a Mermaid,\" (shown right) shows her mature style in this medium.\n\nIn the early 1980s Rothschild learned paper-making at the Pyramid Atlantic Art Center in Hyattsville, Maryland. She used this new skill to make what one critic called \"highly embossed sculptural works.\"<ref name=\"Washington Post Nov 1982\"/> {{refn|group=note|[[Helen C. Frederick]] founded Pyramid Atlantic as a non-profit contemporary art center providing instruction and studio rentals for paper makers, print makers, and book arts craftspeople.<ref name=\"Pyramid Atlantic\"/> }} One of these sculptural works, \"Josepha\" (1984), can be seen at left.\n\nIn 1993 she contrasted two aspects of her method, one, called \"material to idea,\" in which she created sculptures with found materials, and the other, \"idea to material,\" in which she started with a drawing and then assembled the material to create the final product.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 15 1993\"/>\n\nDuring the years in which sculpture dominated her output she continued to make quick and spontaneous works on paper, both drawings and watercolors.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> One of these drawings, \"Art Quotes\" (1966) can bee seen at right. Shortly before her death she made a return to figuration in a set of small works on paper prepared for a solo exhibition at the C.Grimaldis Gallery called \"Artist and Model.\" A critic said that in these works (in ink, watercolor, and oil) she explored how the models the artists depicted could be \"reduced to their definitional lines,\" showing them as compositional elements rather than living beings.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Sep 1999\"/>\n\nWhen in 1997 a critic reviewed the whole body of her output he commented on her stylistic consistency. He wrote, \"A group of Baltimore artist Amalie Rothschild's sculptures and drawings demonstrate the consistency of this artist's work: its sure craftsmanship, its sly humor and its debt to the superficially childlike but deeply wise work of Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 1997\"/> Throughout her career she was similarly consistent in her work habits. In 2012 broadcast journalist Sheila Kast said \"Amalie Rothschild (1916-2001) was one of Baltimore\u2019s most prolific visual artists during the 20th century.\"<ref name=\"Maryland Morning May 2012\"/> \n\nIn the oral history interview she gave in the last year of her life Rothschild said that Matisse's practice of what she called \"automatic drawings\" helped her to achieve greater self-expressiveness. She said her earlier work had not successfully conveyed her inner feelings and that she had gradually changed her style to make it more expressive. All the same, a critic who reviewed a retrospective exhibition of her work at the Gomez Gallery saw her \"singular devotion to her vision of abstractions based on geometric forms\" as overly formal. \"Her work is pleasing, disciplined, often clever,\" he wrote, \"but not amply challenging,\" adding that there he saw too little sense of struggle or pushing of boundaries.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Aug 1993\"/> Some years later, the same critic said her work had \"emotional reserve,\" but did not then see this characteristic as a flaw. He wrote, \"Her work is thoroughly modern and related to geometric abstraction, but without losing the figure. It has emotional reserve, often contains a hint of humor and at times recalls the childlike sagacity of the great Paul Klee.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/>\n\n==Art teacher==\n\nBetween 1956 and 1970 Rothschild volunteered as an art therapist at the  [[Springfield Hospital Center|Springfield State Mental Hospital]] where she and another volunteer gave what she called \"kindergarten level\" instruction to severely disabled adults.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her goal was not so much to teach them art as to help them to express themselves in some way through paint and paper.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> During the next four years she taught at a small school that had been established to offer an alternative to what the organizers saw as the extreme conservatism of the Maryland Institute of Art. Called the Metropolitan School of Art, it folded when the Maryland Institute brought in a new director and changed its policies.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> One of its students, Gladys Hack Goldstein, later became a prominent Baltimore abstract painter.<ref name=\"Tribune Business Mar 2010\"/> Beginning in 1960 Rothschild spent eight years as a part-time instructor at [[Goucher College]]. She taught students painting and drawing in one course each semester and resigned when asked to work full time.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/><ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> \n\n==Philanthropist, art patron, advocate==\n\nSoon after the end of World War II Rothschild took the first of many influential positions within the Baltimore arts community. Between 1948 and 1950 she was president of the city's Artists' Union.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/>{{refn|group=note|Local artists formed the union in 1934 to promote their work and make it available to purchasers.<ref name=\"Washington Post Aug 1934\"/> }} In 1952 she helped to found the Baltimore Outdoor Art Festival which was subsequently held for nearly a quarter of a century in [[Druid Hill Park]].<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> In the late 1950s she chaired the artists committee of the Baltimore Museum of Arts and helped to found an artists' cooperative called Gallery One.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/><ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> During the 1960s she pulled back from commitments such as these and for the rest of her life was somewhat more selective in the leadership roles she chose to take. In 2001 she commented on this change: \"I\u2019ve been on every committee imaginable...and always was a leader in all these various things when I was younger. And finally I got to the point of where I wasn\u2019t having enough time to do my own work, I was always on the telephone. And I started to say no to everything. And after a while I became isolated, and I said, 'Oh, this won\u2019t do either.' So then gradually I started saying yes again. I try to reach a happy medium of being involved in the city.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> \n\nIn the late 1970s and early 1980s she was on the board of trustees, first of the Baltimore Museum of Art, then of [[Maryland Art Place]], and finally of the Maryland Institute.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/><ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> In 1993 the [[Maryland Department of Business and Economic Development#Maryland State Arts Council|State Arts Council]] and Maryland Citizens for the Arts organization gave Rothschild and her husband a Maryland Medici Award for their major contributions to the arts (his in music, hers in fine art).<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Oct 1993\"/>{{refn|group=note|The Medici Award was given annually to a person, business, or foundation that made major contributions to arts in the state.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Oct 31 1993\"/> }} In 2000, recognizing her many years of service to the arts community, the State of Maryland made her the second recipient of the Maryland Arts Lifetime Achievement Award.<ref name=\"Jewish Womens Archive bio\"/>\n\n==Personal life and family==\n\nRothschild was born January 1, 1916, in Baltimore, Maryland.<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/><ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her birth name was Amalie Getta Rosenfeld.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/> Her parents were Eugene Isaac Rosenfeld (about 1882 to about 1934) and Addye Goldsmith Rosenfeld (born about 1888), both born in Baltimore.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Her father served in the Navy during the [[Spanish-American War]] having enlisted under the name Clarence Schneider.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/><ref name=\"VA Pension Payment Card Rosenfeld\"/>{{refn|group=note|In her oral history interview Rothschild said, \"He joined the navy. And in those days, for a Jewish boy to join the Navy was very unusual. And he didn't think the name Rosenfeld was going to go over very well in the Navy, so he took the name of Clarence -- oh, gosh -- all of a sudden I have a blank. [It was Schneider.] <ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> }} Trained as an electrician while in the Navy, he subsequently founded and ran a Baltimore business called Eugene I. Rosenfeld & Co., electrical suppliers and contractors and still later owned a local automobile dealership.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/><ref name=\"Rosenfeld & Co 1911\"/><ref name=\"City Directory 1913\"/> Rothschild had two brothers, Eugene Jr. and Edwin. Eugene Jr. was a racehorse owner who ran thoroughbreds on tracks on the east coast.<ref name=\"Washington Post Oct 1954\"/> Once grown, Edwin changed his surname to Rogers and became a well-known Baltimore used car dealer.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun May 1996\"/> The Rosenfeld family belonged to a [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] congregation, Har Sinai.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>\n\nIn 1936 Rothschild married Randolph Schamberg Rothschild (1909&ndash;2003) in New Hampshire where his parents were summering.<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> Randolph, called Randy, was a lawyer who worked in a business owned by his family, the Sun Life Insurance Co. At the time of his retirement in 1972 he was the company's vice president and general counsel. His obituary called him \"a champion of modern composers for the past five decades\" and \"a major benefactor of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Peabody Conservatory and the old Chamber Music Society of Baltimore.\"<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Mar 2003\"/> \n\nThe couple had two children, Amalie Randolph Rothschild (born 1945) and Adrien Rothschild (born 1949).<ref name=\"Rothschild website\"/> Based in Manhattan, Amalie R. Rothschild is a prominent filmmaker and photographer. Adrien Rothschild is a textile artist specializing in quilts. Living in Aspers, Pennsylvania, she has exhibited at the Baltimore Museum of Arts.<ref name=\"Afro-American Dec 2015\"/>{{refn|group=note|In the 2001 oral history interview by the Jewish Women's Archive, Rothschild said Adrien was not making quilts at that time. She described her daughter as follows: \"Adrien is an award-winning designer and maker of quilts. She does every single stitch by hand. And she did that for quite a number of years, and she's in the collection of the White House, the craft collection of the White House. She won awards almost every place she exhibits in. And she's been written up in all the quilt magazines and one thing and another. And she was invited to do a Christmas ornament for the White House Christmas tree, and all that sort of thing. And that's what she was doing. And it's very demanding and tedious work.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/> }} In 2001 Rothschild said of her role as simultaneously both mother and professional artist, \"A lot of the artists go into Baltimore and rent big spaces. But I never wanted to be away from home, because I was always home when my children were little. They came home and a mom was always home. And I would be an artist most of the time. When they were home on vacation, I said, \u201cI\u2019m not an artist now, I\u2019m a mom.\u201d And so that\u2019s the way it went all those years.\"<ref name=\"Jewish Women's Archive interview\"/>\n\nRothschild died at her home in Pikesville, Maryland, November 4, 2001.<ref name=\"Baltimore Sun Nov 2001\"/>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist\n|colwidth=30em\n|refs=\n\n<!-- journals -->\n\n<!-- books -->\n\n<ref name=\"Rosenfeld & Co 1911\">{{cite book |author=Baltimore (Md.) |title=The Ordinances of the Mayor and City Council of Baltimore |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iD0tAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA329 |year=1911 |publisher=James Lucas and E.K.

Also [[political rights]] are in a high level, though the country suffered high-profile corruption scandals during 2007.

Pretrial detentions are long, police use [[excessive force]] against detainees, and prisons suffer from overcrowding and inadequate medical care. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, but they often face employment discrimination.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\nAlleged discrimination suffered by the Russian-speaking community continues to be debated.

As at January 2011, so-called non-citizens (more than by 99%\u2014representatives of the ethnic minorities, mostly Russians) exceed 14% of the population. Russian language, being native for more than 37% of residents according to 2000 census, is considered to be foreign language in the Official Language Law; the possibilities to use it in communication with authorities and in public education were significantly reduced after 1991.\n\nLike in many post-socialist countries, a restitution of real estate has taken place in Latvia. Therefore, a considerable part of former tenants of public housing found themselves in private housing, with higher rent. [[Rent control]] for such dwellings was, after multiple extensions, phased out in 2007.\n\nSince 2003, conflicts concerning freedom of assembly are often: on various occasions, gatherings of LGBT<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |title=Neat\u013cauj r\u012bkot g\u0101jienu \u00abR\u012bgas praids 2006\u00bb |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113043/http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>[http://www.delna.lv/index.php?q=ful&sec=140&story=1320 Jaunupu sauc pie atbild\u012bbas, Ulmi \u2013 ne]</ref> commemorations of Latvian Legion of SS soldiers<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015536/http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> meetings of the [[Russian School Defense Staff]]<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201434.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> were banned or limited.\n\nLimitations to eligibility and their enforcement were in the focus of several ECtHR judgments in cases against Latvia (''[[\u0100damsons v.

organisations ==\n===Amnesty International===\nAccording to [[Amnesty International]], non-citizens \u2013 including [[stateless persons]] \u2013 suffer from limited or no access to a broad range of [[rights]], including the right to participate in [[political process]]es, and the right to employment in the [[civil service]] and [[private sector]]. The majority of them were born or lived almost their entire lives in Latvia. Non-citizens also have restrictions on [[property]] [[ownership]].<ref name=\"amnesty2009\">{{cite web |url=http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |title=Amnesty International Report 2009 |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-06-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610075623/http://report2009.amnesty.org/en/regions/europe-central-asia/latvia |archivedate=2009-06-10 }}</ref>\n\nAmnesty International reported racially motivated attacks against [[Romani people]]. Latvia lacks of comprehensive national [[legislation]] dealing with all forms of [[discrimination]]. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people have faced discrimination by [[verbal abuse]]. There were reported allegations of deliberate physical [[ill-treatment]] of [[detainee]]s by [[prison]] staff.<ref name=\"amnesty2009\"/>\n\n===Human Rights Watch===\n[[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2006 the attacks on peaceful lesbian and gay pride activists in Riga on July 28. Earlier, Riga City Council denied an application by lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender ([[LGBT]]) organizations for \u201cRiga Pride 2006\u201d.

Also [[political rights]] are in a high level, though the country suffered high-profile corruption scandals during 2007. The government generally respects [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of press]], and [[freedom of religion]]. [[Academic freedom]] is respected in law and in practice. [[Freedom of assembly]] and [[Freedom of association|association]] are protected by law and in practice.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/> The highly competitive Latvian mass media are proving to be reliable sources of information and watchdogs against governmental [[abuses of power]].<ref name=\"freedomhouse2\"/>\n\nWhile the constitutional guarantee of [[judicial independence]] is generally respected, corruption in the judicial and [[Law enforcement agency|law enforcement]] systems continues to be a problem. Pretrial detentions are long, police use [[excessive force]] against detainees, and prisons suffer from overcrowding and inadequate medical care. Women enjoy the same legal rights as men, but they often face employment discrimination.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\nAlleged discrimination suffered by the Russian-speaking community continues to be debated. Parliament has appointed an [[ombudsman]] responsible for protecting the rights of individuals in relation to the government. Two men were sentenced to prison terms in January 2007 for attacking a [[Rwanda]]n citizen. The case marked the first sentencing under a law prohibiting instigation of racial hatred.<ref name=\"freedomhouse1\"/>\n\n===United States Department of State===\nAccording to Human Right Report of [[United States Department of State]], Latvia generally respects the human rights of citizens and the large resident noncitizen community. However, there were problems with serious police abuse of detainees and arrestees, poor conditions at police [[detention facilities]], poor prison conditions and overcrowding, [[judicial corruption]], obstacles to [[due process]], official pressure to limit [[freedom of speech]], [[violence against women]], [[child abuse]], [[human trafficking|trafficking]] in persons, incidents of violence against ethnic minorities, and [[societal]] violence and incidents of government discrimination against homosexuals.<ref name=\"departmentofstate1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226175739/http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2008/eur/119087.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2009-02-26 |title=2008 Human Rights Report: Latvia |publisher= [[United States Department of State]] |date=2009-02-25 |accessdate=2009-06-09}}</ref>\n\n==Specific issues of Latvia==\n{{Main|Non-citizens (Latvia)|Language policy in Latvia}}\nAfter restoration of independence in 1991, many residents of Latvia weren't acknowledged to be its citizens. As at January 2011, so-called non-citizens (more than by 99%\u2014representatives of the ethnic minorities, mostly Russians) exceed 14% of the population. Russian language, being native for more than 37% of residents according to 2000 census, is considered to be foreign language in the Official Language Law; the possibilities to use it in communication with authorities and in public education were significantly reduced after 1991.\n\nLike in many post-socialist countries, a restitution of real estate has taken place in Latvia. Therefore, a considerable part of former tenants of public housing found themselves in private housing, with higher rent. [[Rent control]] for such dwellings was, after multiple extensions, phased out in 2007.\n\nSince 2003, conflicts concerning freedom of assembly are often: on various occasions, gatherings of LGBT<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |title=Neat\u013cauj r\u012bkot g\u0101jienu \u00abR\u012bgas praids 2006\u00bb |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717113043/http://www.apollo.lv/portal/news/articles/78494 |archive-date=2011-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>[http://www.delna.lv/index.php?q=ful&sec=140&story=1320 Jaunupu sauc pie atbild\u012bbas, Ulmi \u2013 ne]</ref> commemorations of Latvian Legion of SS soldiers<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> and counter-meetings,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |title=\u0410\u043d\u0442\u0438\u0444\u0430\u0448\u0438\u0441\u0442\u044b \u0432\u043e\u0437\u043b\u043e\u0436\u0430\u0442 \u0432\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438 |access-date=2009-02-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015536/http://www.d-pils.lv/news/2/296464 |archive-date=2011-07-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> meetings of the [[Russian School Defense Staff]]<ref>[http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf Cilv\u0113kties\u012bbas Latvij\u0101 2004. g.]\u2014R\u012bga: LCESC, 2005. {{ISBN|9984-9707-7-9}}.\u201434.\u201435. lpp. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090117221424/http://www.humanrights.org.lv/upload_file/Parskats2004_lv.pdf |date=January 17, 2009 }}</ref> were banned or limited.\n\nLimitations to eligibility and their enforcement were in the focus of several ECtHR judgments in cases against Latvia (''[[\u0100damsons v.

It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a [[transition metal]] with a multifaceted array of industrial [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.\n\nHistorically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]]. \n\n[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].\n\nIn biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|pages=169\u2013201 |chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6|pmid=23595673 |pmc=6542352 }} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}</ref> Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]].

All of the remaining [[radioactive]] isotopes have half-lives of less than three hours, and the majority of less than one minute. The primary [[decay mode]] before the most abundant stable isotope, <sup>55</sup>Mn, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode after is [[beta decay]].<ref name=\"Audi\" /> Manganese also has three [[meta state]]s.<ref name=\"Audi\">{{NUBASE2016}}</ref>\n\nManganese is part of the [[iron]] group of elements, which are thought to be synthesized in large [[star]]s shortly before the [[supernova]] explosion. <sup>53</sup>Mn decays to <sup>53</sup>[[chromium|Cr]] with a [[half-life]] of 3.7 million years.

In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were considered to differ in [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. The masculine ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The feminine ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

First, [[hydrochloric acid]], or a mixture of dilute [[sulfuric acid]] and [[sodium chloride]] was made to react with manganese dioxide, later hydrochloric acid from the [[Leblanc process]] was used and the manganese dioxide was recycled by the [[Weldon process]]. The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.\n\nScheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].\n\nThe manganese content of some iron ores used in Greece led to speculations that steel produced from that ore contains additional manganese, making the [[Sparta]]n steel exceptionally hard.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ajim.20524|date=2007|title=From lead to manganese through mercury: mythology, science, and lessons for prevention|volume=50|issue=11|pages=779\u2013787 |journal=American Journal of Industrial Medicine|pmid=17918211|last1=Alessio|first1=L.|last2=Campagna|first2=M.|last3=Lucchini|first3=R.}}</ref> Around the beginning of the 19th century, manganese was used in steelmaking and several patents were granted.

This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150\u2013250 \u03bcm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese.

The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.\n\n=== Biological role in plants ===\nManganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants.

It is not found as a [[free element]] in nature; it is often found in [[mineral]]s in combination with [[iron]]. Manganese is a [[transition metal]] with a multifaceted array of industrial [[alloy]] uses, particularly in [[stainless steel]]s.\n\nHistorically, manganese is named for [[pyrolusite]] and other black minerals from the region of [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] in Greece, which also gave its name to [[magnesium]] and the [[iron]] ore [[magnetite]]. By the mid-18th century, [[Sweden|Swedish-]][[Germanic peoples|German]] [[chemist]] [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] had used pyrolusite to produce [[chlorine]]. Scheele and others were aware that pyrolusite (now known to be [[manganese dioxide]]) contained a new element, but they were unable to isolate it. [[Johan Gottlieb Gahn]] was the first to isolate an impure sample of manganese metal in 1774, which he did by [[reduction-oxidation|reducing]] the dioxide with [[carbon]].\n\n[[Phosphate conversion coating|Manganese phosphating]] is used for rust and corrosion prevention on [[steel]]. Ionized manganese is used industrially as [[pigment]]s of various colors, which depend on the oxidation state of the ions. The [[permanganate]]s of [[alkali metal|alkali]] and [[alkaline earth metal]]s are powerful oxidizers. Manganese dioxide is used as the [[cathode]] (electron acceptor) material in [[Zinc-carbon battery|zinc-carbon]] and [[Alkaline battery|alkaline batteries]].\n\nIn biology, manganese(II) ions function as [[cofactor (biochemistry)|cofactors]] for a large variety of [[enzymes]] with many functions.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roth |first1=Jerome |last2=Ponzoni |first2=Silvia |last3=Aschner |first3=Michael|editor1-first=Lucia |editor1-last=Banci |series=Metal Ions in Life Sciences |volume=12|pages=169\u2013201 |chapter=Chapter 6 Manganese Homeostasis and Transport|title=Metallomics and the Cell |date=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-94-007-5560-4|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5561-1_6|pmid=23595673 |pmc=6542352 }} electronic-book {{ISBN|978-94-007-5561-1}}</ref> Manganese enzymes are particularly essential in detoxification of [[superoxide]] free radicals in organisms that must deal with elemental [[oxygen]].

In ancient times, two black minerals from [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] (located within modern Greece) were both called ''magnes'' from their place of origin, but were considered to differ in [[Grammatical gender|gender]]. The masculine ''magnes'' attracted iron, and was the iron ore now known as [[lodestone]] or [[magnetite]], and which probably gave us the term [[magnet]]. The feminine ''magnes'' ore did not attract iron, but was used to decolorize glass. This feminine ''magnes'' was later called ''magnesia'', known now in modern times as [[pyrolusite]] or [[manganese dioxide]].{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Neither this mineral nor elemental manganese is magnetic. In the 16th century, manganese dioxide was called ''manganesum'' (note the two Ns instead of one) by glassmakers, possibly as a corruption and concatenation of two words, since alchemists and glassmakers eventually had to differentiate a ''magnesia negra'' (the black ore) from ''magnesia alba'' (a white ore, also from Magnesia, also useful in glassmaking). [[Michele Mercati]] called magnesia negra ''manganesa'', and finally the metal isolated from it became known as ''manganese'' (German: ''Mangan''). The name ''magnesia'' eventually was then used to refer only to the white [[magnesia alba]] (magnesium oxide), which provided the name [[magnesium]] for the free element when it was isolated much later.<ref>{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=J.

The production of chlorine and [[hypochlorite]] [[bleach]]ing agents was a large consumer of manganese ores.\n\nScheele and other chemists were aware that manganese dioxide contained a new element, but they were not able to isolate it.

This is done by percolating natural gas through the bottom of the heap; the natural gas provides the heat (needs to be at least 850&nbsp;\u00b0C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150\u2013250 \u03bcm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of [[sulfuric acid]] and ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form [[iron hydroxide]] and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese.

The Mn-SOD enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, for nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of [[superoxide]] ({{chem|O|2|-}}), formed from the 1-electron reduction of dioxygen. The exceptions, which are all bacteria, include ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' and related [[lactobacillus|lactobacilli]], which use a different nonenzymatic mechanism with manganese (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) ions complexed with polyphosphate, suggesting a path of evolution for this function in aerobic life.\n\n=== Biological role in plants ===\nManganese is also important in photosynthetic [[oxygen evolution]] in [[chloroplast]]s in plants.

The earliest study was conducted in the Chinese province of Shanxi. Drinking water there had been contaminated through improper sewage irrigation and contained 240\u2013350&nbsp;\u00b5g Mn/L. Although Mn concentrations at or below 300&nbsp;\u00b5g Mn/L were considered safe at the time of the study by the US EPA and 400&nbsp;\u00b5g Mn/L by the [[World Health Organization]], the 92 children sampled (between 11 and 13 years of age) from this province displayed lower performance on tests of manual dexterity and rapidity, short-term memory, and visual identification, compared to children from an uncontaminated area. More recently, a study of 10-year-old children in Bangladesh showed a relationship between Mn concentration in well water and diminished IQ scores. A third study conducted in Quebec examined school children between the ages of 6 and 15 living in homes that received water from a well containing 610&nbsp;\u00b5g Mn/L; controls lived in homes that received water from a 160&nbsp;\u00b5g Mn/L well.

Originally it simply meant \"commander\" or \"leader\", usually in reference to a group of people. It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"prince\".

It came to be used as a title of governors or rulers, typically in smaller states, and usually renders the English word \"prince\".

In a major blow to AQI, thousands of former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to actively fight AQI and also work with the American and Iraqi forces, starting with the creation of the Anbar Awakening Council, so called because of its [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]] origins. The group spread to all Sunni cities and communities and some Shiite areas and adopted the broader name [[Sons of Iraq]]. The Sons of Iraq was instrumental in giving tips to coalition forces about weapons caches and militants resulting in the destruction of over 2,500 weapons caches and over 800 militants being killed or captured. In addition, the 30,000 strong U.S. troop surge supplied military planners with more manpower for operations targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq, The Mujahadeen Shura Council, [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Ansar Al-Sunnah]] and other terrorist groups. The resulting events led to dozens of high-level AQI leaders being captured or killed. Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled due to its lack of vast weapons caches, leaders, safe havens, and Iraqis willing to support them. Accordingly, the bounty issued for Abu Ayyub-al-Masri AKA Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was eventually cut from $5 million down to a mere $100,000 in April 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOn January 8 and January 28, 2008, Iraqi and U.S. forces launched [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]] and the [[Nineveh campaign]] (AKA the Mosul Campaign) killing and capturing over 4,600 militants, and locating and destroying over 3,000 weapons caches, effectively leaving AQI with one last major insurgent stronghold\u2014Diyala. On July 29, 2008, Iraqi, U.S. and Sons Of Iraq forces launched Operation Augurs of Prosperity in [[Diyala Governorate]] and surrounding areas to clear AQI out of its last stronghold. Two operations had already been launched in Diyala with mixed results, and this campaign was expected to face fierce resistance. The resulting operation left over 500 weapons caches destroyed and five militants killed; 483 militants were captured due to the lack of resistance from the insurgent forces. Twenty four high level AQI terrorists were killed or captured in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Writings==\n''Kalim\u0101t mud\u012b\u2019a'' [Enlightening speech] is a more

In a major blow to AQI, thousands of former Sunni militants that previously fought along with the group started to actively fight AQI and also work with the American and Iraqi forces, starting with the creation of the Anbar Awakening Council, so called because of its [[Al Anbar Governorate|Anbar]] origins. The group spread to all Sunni cities and communities and some Shiite areas and adopted the broader name [[Sons of Iraq]]. The Sons of Iraq was instrumental in giving tips to coalition forces about weapons caches and militants resulting in the destruction of over 2,500 weapons caches and over 800 militants being killed or captured. In addition, the 30,000 strong U.S. troop surge supplied military planners with more manpower for operations targeting Al-Qaeda in Iraq, The Mujahadeen Shura Council, [[Jamaat Ansar al-Sunna|Ansar Al-Sunnah]] and other terrorist groups. The resulting events led to dozens of high-level AQI leaders being captured or killed. Al-Qaeda seemed to have lost its foothold in Iraq and appeared to be severely crippled due to its lack of vast weapons caches, leaders, safe havens, and Iraqis willing to support them. Accordingly, the bounty issued for Abu Ayyub-al-Masri AKA Abu Hamza al-Muhajer was eventually cut from $5 million down to a mere $100,000 in April 2008.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nOn January 8 and January 28, 2008, Iraqi and U.S. forces launched [[Operation Phantom Phoenix]] and the [[Nineveh campaign]] (AKA the Mosul Campaign) killing and capturing over 4,600 militants, and locating and destroying over 3,000 weapons caches, effectively leaving AQI with one last major insurgent stronghold\u2014Diyala. On July 29, 2008, Iraqi, U.S. and Sons Of Iraq forces launched Operation Augurs of Prosperity in [[Diyala Governorate]] and surrounding areas to clear AQI out of its last stronghold. Two operations had already been launched in Diyala with mixed results, and this campaign was expected to face fierce resistance. The resulting operation left over 500 weapons caches destroyed and five militants killed; 483 militants were captured due to the lack of resistance from the insurgent forces. Twenty four high level AQI terrorists were killed or captured in the campaign.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\n==Writings==\n''Kalim\u0101t mud\u012b\u2019a'' [Enlightening speech] is a more than 600-page compilation of his writings and transcribed speeches.<ref>Cole Bunzel, [https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/The-ideology-of-the-Islamic-State.pdf \"From Paper State to Caliphate: The Ideology of the Islamic State\"], The Brookings Project on U.S. Relations with the Islamic World Analysis Paper | No. 19, March 2015, p. 14</ref>\n\n==References and notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n{{S-start}}\n{{Succession box| title = Head of [[Al-Qaeda in Iraq]]| years = 1994\u20132006| before = Position Created|after = [[Abu Hamza al-Muhajir]] ([[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]])}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last1=Brisard |first1=Jean-Charles |author-link1=Jean-Charles Brisard |last2=Martinez |first2=Damien |date=2005 |title=Zarqaoui : le nouveau visage d'al-Qa\u00efda |publisher=Fayard |language=fr}}\n* {{cite book |last=Kepel |first=Gilles |date=2005 |title=Al-Qaida dans le texte : \u00e9crits d'Oussama ben Laden, Abdallah Azzam, Ayman al-Zawahiri et Abou Moussab al-Zarqawi |location=Paris, France |publisher=Presses universitaires de France (PUF) |isbn=9782130561514 |author-link=Gilles Kepel |language=fr}}\n* {{cite book |last=Milelli |first=Jean-Pierre |date=2005 |title=La lettre d'al-Zarqaoui \u00e0 Ben Laden |location=Paris, France |publisher=Choiseul |page= |isbn= |language=fr}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Jordan|Biography}}\n* [[Osama bin Laden]]\n* [[Abdel Majid al-Majali]]\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{commons-inline}}\n* {{NYTtopic|people/z/abu_musab_al_zarqawi}}\n;Articles\n* [http://www.flatearthnews.net/footnotes-book/page-205-zarqawi/how-zarqawi-myth-was-made-america/ 'How the Zarqawi myth was made in America'], [[Nick Davies]]\n* [http://search.informit.com.au/documentSummary;res=IELAPA;dn=200610624 Zarqawi: Taking Care of Business], [[Daniel Ross (Australian philosopher and filmmaker)|Daniel Ross]], August 1, 2006\n* [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/alzarqawi-a-life-drenched-in-blood-481636.html \"Al-Zarqawi: A life drenched in blood\"], Patrick Cockburn, ''[[The Independent]]'', June 9, 2006\n* [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2006/07/the-short-violent-life-of-abu-musab-al-zarqawi/304983/?single_page=true The Short, Violent Life of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi], Mary Anne Weaver, ''[[The Atlantic]]'', June 1, 2006\n\n{{3IC}}\n{{Al-Qaeda}}\n{{Militant Islamism in the Middle East}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Zarqawi, Abu Musab}}\n[[Category:1966 births]]\n[[Category:2006 deaths]]\n[[Category:20th-century criminals]]\n[[Category:21st-century criminals]]\n[[Category:Members of al-Qaeda in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Deaths by American airstrikes]]\n[[Category:Iraqi insurgency (2003\u20132011)]]\n[[Category:Jordanian al-Qaeda members]]\n[[Category:Jordanian expatriates in Afghanistan]]\n[[Category:Jordanian expatriates in Pakistan]]\n[[Category:Jordanian prisoners and detainees]]\n[[Category:People sentenced to death in absentia]]\n[[Category:Prisoners and detainees of Jordan]]\n[[Category:Terrorism in Iraq]]\n[[Category:Filmed assassinations]]\n[[Category:People from Zarqa]]\n[[Category:Critics of Shia Islam]]\n[[Category:Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]]\n[[Category:Millennium attack plots]]\n[[Category:Leaders of Islamic terror groups]]\n[[Category:People who memorized the Quran]]\n", "name_user": "2601:c6:8300:28c0:21db:f322:5e56:1e76", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abu_Musab_al-Zarqawi"}
