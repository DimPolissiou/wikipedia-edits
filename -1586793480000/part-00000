But they were later taken over by the neighboring [[Osmano\u011flu family|Osmano\u011flu]] dynasty, who were to found the [[Ottoman Empire]] later.\n\nGermiyans played a crucial role in settling [[Turkish people|Turkish]] populations along the coastal regions of the [[Aegean Sea]], the founders of the Beyliks of [[Aydinids|Aydin]], [[Sarukhanids|Sarukhan]], [[\u0130nan\u00e7o\u011flu]] and [[Beylik of Mente\u015fe|Mente\u015fe]] having started out as Germiyan commanders.\n\nThey rebelled against the central power in 1283, upon the execution of the sultan [[Kaykhusraw III]] by the Mongols, and placing of [[Mesud II]] on the Seljuq throne. The struggle between combined Mongol-Seljuq forces based in [[Konya]] and the rebel forces of Germiyan continued until 1290. An agreement could only be reached in 1299, upon which the Germiyan Dynasty also entered into possession of [[Ankara]]. When the [[Ilkhanid]] governor [[Chupan|Emir \u00c7oban]] took over Anatolia in 1314, they declared allegiance and concentrated on raids towards the regions to their west.\n\nTheir western offshoots that were the Beyliks of [[Beylik of Mente\u015fe|Mente\u015fe]], [[Aydinids|Aydin]], [[Beylik of L\u00e2dik|Ladik]], [[Sarukhanids|Sarukhan]] and [[Karasids|Karasi]] were all subject to the Germiyan in the early periods of their foundation, while the Beyliks of [[S\u00e2hib Ata]] and [[Hamidids]] to the south had to rely on them for protection against attacks from the [[Karamanids]].

Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as [[John Madden]], it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]''.\n\nMost games under this brand are the merda are developed by [[EA Vancouver]], the studio of Electronic Arts in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]] as well as [[EA Tiburon]] in [[Maitland, Florida]]. The main rival to EA Sports is [[2K Sports]]. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games. [[Konami]] is its rival in association football games.\n\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the bestselling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, ''[[FIFA: Road to World Cup 98|FIFA 98]]'', ''[[Madden NFL 98]]'', ''[[NBA Live 98]]'', and ''[[NHL 98]]'' were released for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] throughout 1997; ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' and ''[[FIFA Football 2005|FIFA 2005]]'' had [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] releases in 2004 (''FIFA 2005'' and ''Madden NFL 2005'' were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released); and ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'' had an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] release in 2007. ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' also had [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and Nintendo [[GameCube]] releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2003]]'' and ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2004]]'' were released not only for the [[PlayStation 2]], but for the original [[PlayStation]] as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English [[Football League Two]] team [[Swindon Town F.C.]] from the 2009\u201310 season onward and the [[EA Sports Cup]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Daryl Holt, Gamelab 2018 (42322570894).jpg|thumb|left|250px|COO and VP Daryl Holt in 2018]]\n\n=== Exclusivity deals ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn 2002, EA purchased the license to [[NASCAR]] for six years, ending competition from [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Infogrames]]. They lost the NASCAR license in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by [[Polyphony Digital]] for the [[Gran Turismo (series)|''Gran Turismo'' series]] starting with ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'', and also [[Eutechnyx]] for [[NASCAR The Game (series)|''NASCAR The Game'' series]] until its inception in 2015.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and its Players' Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the [[2012 NFL season]].\n\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] (AFL).\n\nOn April 11, 2005, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\n\nEA lost the rights for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) games to [[2K Sports]] in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made [[NCAA Baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.\n\nIn January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.\n\nIn 2005, EA Sports and [[ESPN]] signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from [[2K Sports]] and [[Sega]]. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'').\n\nIn 2012, EA signs a \"multi-year, multi-product\" partnership with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], taking over from [[THQ]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Rory McIlroy PGA Tour]]'' in 2015, EA Sports announced that they will end its [[PGA Tour (video game series)|PGA Tour]] series after 25 years, with the said game was pulled from digital storefronts in May 2018.

Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks by calling themselves the \"EA Sports Network\" (EASN) with pictures or endorsements with real commentators such as [[John Madden]], it soon grew up to become a sub-label on its own, releasing game series such as ''[[FIFA (video game series)|FIFA]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'' and ''[[Madden NFL]]''.\n\nMost games under this brand are developed by [[EA Vancouver]], the studio of Electronic Arts in [[Burnaby]], [[British Columbia]] as well as [[EA Tiburon]] in [[Maitland, Florida]]. The main rival to EA Sports is [[2K Sports]]. Notably, both companies compete over the realm of NBA games. [[Konami]] is its rival in association football games.\n\nUnlike some other sports game companies, EA Sports has no special ties to a single platform, which means that all games are released for the bestselling active platforms, sometimes long after most of the other companies abandon them. For example, ''[[FIFA: Road to World Cup 98|FIFA 98]]'', ''[[Madden NFL 98]]'', ''[[NBA Live 98]]'', and ''[[NHL 98]]'' were released for the [[Sega Genesis]] and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] throughout 1997; ''[[Madden NFL 2005]]'' and ''[[FIFA Football 2005|FIFA 2005]]'' had [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] releases in 2004 (''FIFA 2005'' and ''Madden NFL 2005'' were also the last two PlayStation titles to be released); and ''[[NCAA Football 08]]'' had an [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] release in 2007. ''[[Madden NFL 08]]'' also had [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] and Nintendo [[GameCube]] releases in 2007, and was the final title released for the GameCube, with ''[[Madden NFL 09]]'' following as the final Xbox title. Additionally, ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2003]]'' and ''[[NASCAR Thunder 2004]]'' were released not only for the [[PlayStation 2]], but for the original [[PlayStation]] as well. EA Sports brand name is used to sponsor English [[Football League Two]] team [[Swindon Town F.C.]] from the 2009\u201310 season onward and the [[EA Sports Cup]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]].\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Daryl Holt, Gamelab 2018 (42322570894).jpg|thumb|left|250px|COO and VP Daryl Holt in 2018]]\n\n=== Exclusivity deals ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\nIn 2002, EA purchased the license to [[NASCAR]] for six years, ending competition from [[Papyrus Design Group|Papyrus]] and [[Infogrames]]. They lost the NASCAR license in 2009 and the NASCAR license would be owned by [[Polyphony Digital]] for the [[Gran Turismo (series)|''Gran Turismo'' series]] starting with ''[[Gran Turismo 5]]'', and also [[Eutechnyx]] for [[NASCAR The Game (series)|''NASCAR The Game'' series]] until its inception in 2015.\n\nOn December 13, 2004, EA Sports signed an exclusive deal with the [[National Football League]] (NFL) and its Players' Union for five years. On February 12, 2008, EA Sports announced the extension of its exclusive deal until the [[2012 NFL season]].\n\nLess than a month after the NFL Exclusive deal, EA Sports signed a four-year exclusive deal with the [[Arena Football League (1987\u20132008)|Arena Football League]] (AFL).\n\nOn April 11, 2005, the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and EA Sports signed a deal to grant EA Sports the sole rights to produce college football games for six years.\n\nEA lost the rights for [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) games to [[2K Sports]] in 2005, ending EA's MVP series; however, EA made [[NCAA Baseball]] games in 2006 and 2007 after losing the MLB license.\n\nIn January 2008, EA Sports decided not to renew their NCAA College Baseball license while they evaluate the status of their MVP game engine.\n\nIn 2005, EA Sports and [[ESPN]] signed a massive 15-year deal for ESPN to be integrated into EA Sports video games from [[2K Sports]] and [[Sega]]. EA's use of the ESPN license has steadily increased over the early life of the deal. EA's early usage of the ESPN license began with ESPN Radio and a sports ticker in titles like Madden NFL, NBA Live, Tiger Woods PGA Tour, and NCAA Baseball and Football. The ESPN integration now includes streaming podcasts, text articles (including content only available previously to ESPN Insider subscribers), and ESPN Motion video (including such programs as ''[[Pardon the Interruption]]'').\n\nIn 2012, EA signs a \"multi-year, multi-product\" partnership with the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], taking over from [[THQ]].\n\nFollowing the release of ''[[Rory McIlroy PGA Tour]]'' in 2015, EA Sports announced that they will end its [[PGA Tour (video game series)|PGA Tour]] series after 25 years, with the said game was pulled from digital storefronts in May 2018. [[2K Sports]] announced that they will assumed their licensing agreement with the [[PGA Tour]] beginning with the release of ''[[The Golf Glub 2019 featuring the PGA Tour]]'' in 2018.\n\n=== PC games ===\nIn June 2009, EA Sports announced that for 2010, the games ''[[Madden NFL]]'', ''[[NCAA Football series|NCAA Football]]'', ''[[EA Sports NASCAR series|NASCAR]]'', ''[[NHL (video game series)|NHL]]'', ''[[NBA Live (video game series)|NBA Live]]'', and ''[[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]]'' would not be shipped for PC platforms.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |title=PC News: Peter Moore comes clean on EA SPORTS PC |magazine=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |access-date=May 29, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704130006/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=192214 |archive-date=July 4, 2008 |date=3 July 2008 |first=Andy |last=Robinson |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]]}}</ref> The NCAA Football series had not been released on the PC since 1998, The Tiger Woods series' last PC game was [[Tiger Woods PGA Tour 08]], the NASCAR series had not had a PC version since ''[[NASCAR SimRacing]]'' in 2005, and the last Madden series' to be released on PC was ''[[Madden NFL 08]]''.
