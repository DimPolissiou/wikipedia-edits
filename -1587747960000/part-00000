This low-budget [[B-movie]] starred Don Sullivan, a veteran of several low budget monster and [[zombie]] films, and Lisa Simone, the French contestant for [[Miss Universe]] of 1957, as well as [[comic relief]] [[Shug Fisher]] and [[KLIF (AM)|KLIF]] disc jockey Ken Knox. The effects included a live [[Mexican beaded lizard]] (not an actual [[Gila monster]]) filmed on a scaled-down model landscape. The film is considered a [[cult film|cult classic]].\n\n==Plot==\nThe movie opens with a young couple, Pat Wheeler (Grady Vaughn) and Liz Humphries (Yolanda Salas), parked in a bleak, rural locale overlooking a ravine. A giant Gila monster attacks the car, sending it into the ravine and killing the couple. Later, some friends of the couple decide to assist the local sheriff ([[Fred Graham (actor)|Fred Graham]]) in his search for the missing teens. Chase Winstead (Sullivan), a young mechanic and hot rod racer, locates the crashed car in the ravine and finds evidence of the giant lizard. However, it is only when the hungry reptile attacks a train (a model train set substituted as a low-budget effect) that the authorities realize they are dealing with a (roughly) 70-foot long venomous lizard. By this time, emboldened by its attacks and hungry for prey, the creature attacks the town. It heads for the local dance hall, where the town's teenagers are gathered for a [[sock hop]]. However, Chase packs his prized hot rod with [[nitroglycerin]] and rigs it to speed straight into the Gila monster, terminating the lizard in a fiery explosion and heroically saving the town.\n\n==Cast==\n{{col div}}\n* Don Sullivan as Chase Winstead\n* Lisa Simone as Lisa\n* [[Fred Graham (actor)|Fred Graham]] as Sheriff Jeff\n* [[Shug Fisher]] as Old Man Harris\n* Bob Thompson as Mr. Wheeler\n* Janice Stone as Missy Winstead\n* Ken Knox as Horatio Alger \"Steamroller\" Smith\n* Gay McLendon as Mom Winstead\n* Don Flournoy as Gordy\n* Cecil Hunt as Mr. Compton\n* Stormy Meadows as Agatha Humphries\n* Howard Ware as Ed Humphries\n* Pat Reeves as Rick\n* Jan McLendon as Jennie\n* Jerry Cortwright as Bob\n* Beverly Thurman as Gay\n* Clarke Browne as Chuck\n* Grady Vaughn as Pat Wheeler\n* Desmond Doogh as Hitchhiker\n* Ann Sonka as Whila\n* Yolanda Salas as Liz Humphries\n* Patricia Simmons as Sherry (uncredited)\n* Angus G.

The song initially generated controversy after numerous South Africans expressed disappointment in [[FIFA]]'s decision to select Shakira to sing the song, arguing that a native artist should have been assigned the role.\n\nIt garnered generally favourable reviews from critics, receiving praise for its production. \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" peaked at number one on [[record charts]] of numerous countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. In the United States, the song peaked at number 38 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and was later [[Record certification|certified]] [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for selling over one million units in the country.

It was released on 7 May 2010 by [[Epic Records]] as the official song of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was held in South Africa. Written, composed, and produced by Shakira and [[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]], \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" is a [[Pop music|pop]] song whose lyrics encourage one to aim for their goals like a soldier on a battlefield. The song was adapted from the [[Cameroonian people|Cameroonian]] band [[Golden Sounds]]'s 1986 song \"[[Zamina mina (Zangalewa)|Zangal\u00e9wa]]\". The song initially generated controversy after numerous South Africans expressed disappointment in [[FIFA]]'s decision to select Shakira to sing the song, arguing that a native artist should have been assigned the role.\n\nIt garnered generally favourable reviews from critics, receiving praise for its production. \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" peaked at number one on [[record charts]] of numerous countries including Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Italy and Switzerland. In the United States, the song peaked at number 38 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart and was later [[Record certification|certified]] [[RIAA certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) for selling over one million units in the country. The single similarly attained multi-platinum certifications in other countries, including a nine-times platinum certification in Sweden and a six-times platinum certification in Spain. \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" has sold 15 million downloads worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling singles|best-selling singles]] of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2019/06/235646/shakira-waka-waka-this-time-for-africa-world-cup-song-history-meaning|title=Shakira Shakira Has The Biggest World Cup Song Of Them All. Here's How She Did It.|publisher=[[Refinery29]]|author=Courtney E. Smith|accessdate=20 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe [[music video]] for \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" was directed by [[Marcus Raboy]] and shows Shakira and a group of dancers and children dancing to the song together. It features cameos by various footballers like [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Lionel Messi]]. It became popular on [[YouTube]], receiving 2.4 billion views as of April 2020 and becoming the [[List of most-viewed YouTube videos|28th most-watched video of all time]] on the site. Shakira performed the song at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup opening ceremony]] on 10 June as well as at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|closing ceremony]] on 11 July. It was also included on the set list of her [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour]] (2010\u201311) and [[El Dorado World Tour]] (2018).\n\n== Background and release ==\n{{Quote box\n |quote  = \"They met up with Shakira's producer <nowiki>[</nowiki>[[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]]<nowiki>]</nowiki> and he played us the \u2018\"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" song &ndash; which we loved &ndash; and asked us to mess around with it and come up with some parts.

The inclusion of [[Freshlyground]], a [[South African people|South African]] Afro-[[Fusion (music)|fusion]] band, on the track came to take place after Hill met with their producer in New York. The band were finishing their studio album ''Radio Africa'' when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song. The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later to listen to it. Giving little reaction after hearing it, Hill expressed interest in recording \"everything I'd heard here\" and told the band that they would hear from him later.<ref name=developmentfreshlygroundreformer>{{cite web|last=Madeloni|first=Dave|title=Freshly Ground rides \u2018Waka Waka\u2019 wave|url=http://www.reformer.com/ovation/ci_18334737?source=email|work=[[Brattleboro Reformer]]|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|accessdate=20 February 2014|date=23 June 2011}}</ref><ref name=freshlygroundinterviewcapemag>{{cite web|last=Scharges|first=John|title=Freshlyground talks about Shakira, soccer and success|url=http://www.capetownmagazine.com/freshlyground|publisher=Cape Town Magazine|accessdate=20 February 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 26 April, the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) announced that \"Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)\" would serve as the [[FIFA World Cup official songs|official song]] of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], which was to begin in South Africa later in June, and would also appear on ''[[Listen Up!

{"title_page": "Pirate television", "text_new": "{{redirect|Pirate TV|the MTV series|Pirate TV (TV series)|the 2012 film|Pirate TV (film)|the act of illegally decrypting a television signal that would usually require payment|Pirate decryption}}\n\n{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}\nA '''pirate television''' station is a [[broadcast television]] station that operates without a [[broadcast license]].  Like its counterpart [[pirate radio]], the term pirate TV lacks a specific universal interpretation. It implies a form of [[broadcasting]] that is unwelcome by the licensing authorities within the territory where its [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are received, especially when the country of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is the same as the country of reception. When the area of transmission is not a country, or when it is a country and the transmissions are not illegal, those same broadcast signals may be deemed illegal in the country of reception. Therefore, \"pirate TV\" can mean many things to many people. Pirate [[television station]]s may also be known as \"bootleg TV\", or confused with licensed [[low-power broadcasting]] (LPTV) or [[amateur television]] (ATV) services.\n\n==History==\nPirate Television stations are not as abundant in the United States or UK as pirate radio stations are. Only since 2004 has the technology for pirate television stations become easier to obtain and construct, due to advances in technologies and the availability of equipment.\n\nThe first pirate TV station in the US was Lanesville TV, launched in 1972, the broadcast station of video pioneers, the [[Videofreex]].<ref>http://www.skipblumberg.com/website/Bio_files/VideoPioneerSBJFVInt.pdf</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, a weekend broadcast on Channel 7 in [[Syracuse, New York]] called \"Lucky 7\" captured headlines across the nation. \"[[Lucky 7 (pirate TV station)|Lucky 7]]\" broadcast episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[pornographic movie]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''. The source of the transmission was not identified, but it was speculated in an article in the ''New York Times'' that the signal may have been transmitted from the area of [[Syracuse University]], as the signal was strongest in that area.<ref>{{cite news |title=F.C.C Hunts an Illicit TV Station That Pirated Some Notable Shows |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 19, 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/fcc-hunts-an-illicit-tv-station-that-pirated-some-notable-shows.html |url-access=limited }}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for pirate TV broadcasting, most of which have been made very difficult, or obsolete, by better security measures and the move to [[digital television]].\n\n===Relay hijack (analogue)===\nMany analogue relay transmitters would \"listen\" to a more powerful main transmitter and relay the signal verbatim. If the main transmitter ceases broadcasting (for example, if a channel closes down overnight) then a pirate signal on the same frequency as the main transmitter could cause the relay to \"wake up\" and relay unauthorized programming instead. Typically this would be done by outputting a very weak RF signal within the immediate vicinity of the relay: for example, a video cassette recorder (such as a 12v system designed for use in trucks) sending its signal to a home-made antenna pointed at the relay. As the pirate signal is relatively weak, the source can be difficult to locate if it is well hidden.\n\nA significant benefit of this attack is that the potential viewers do not have to re-tune their televisions to view the content. The content simply appears on an existing channel, after close-down.\n\nThis attack is generally now prevented by the channels broadcasting 24 hours per day (e.g. showing [[test card]]s instead of closing down), by using satellite feeds instead of repeating terrestrial signals, by electronic security to lock the relay to the authorised source, or by the switch to digital television.\n\nUnsecured analogue satellite transponders have also been reported to have been hijacked in a similar manner.\n\n===Source hijack (analogue or digital)===\nIn this scenario, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] is performed upon the source material, such that authorized official transmissions are fed with unauthorized programming from the central studio or play-out facility. For example, a link feed (e.g. outside broadcast) is hijacked by a stronger pirate signal, or pre-recorded media (such as videotapes or hard drives) are swapped over for unauthorised content. This attack would generally have to be performed by an [[insider]] or by gaining access to studio facilities by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]].\n\n===Unauthorized transmitter (analogue)===\nAs with most [[pirate radio]] stations, reasonably powerful VHF/UHF transmitters can be built relatively easily by any sufficiently experienced electronics hobbyist, or imported from a less strict country. The primary challenge to this technique is finding a suitable yet inconspicuous vantage point for the transmission antenna, and the risk of getting caught. If the pirate signal is strong enough to be received directly, it will also be strong enough to be tracked down.\n\n===Unauthorized multiplex (digital)===\nThe advent of [[digital television]] makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast as part of a [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that carries several channels in one signal, and it is almost impossible to insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.\n\nIn Spain, in major provincial capital cities, usually operates one or more than one pirate TV digital multiplex. Some multiplexes started to operate after digital switch-over migrating pirate channels from analogue pirate television to DVB-T digital multiplexes.\n\nSince shortly after digital switch-over and still today in secondary cities, some channels broadcast by means of a DVB-T transmitter with four analog input sources (in this case, four tuned satellite receivers connected by composite video cable) and then to amplifier, and digital signal is feed to antenna or tower. This method is the one used by most pirate TV channels. However, over the years and due to economic returns, some have begun broadcasting almost professionally. New equipment that they have been installing since three years ago allows remultiplexing of DVB-S programs into DVB-T multiplexes and most parameters can be configured at will.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1367929|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, its number has been increasing in Madrid and in Valencia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondigital.cat/forum/viewtopic.php?p=87213|title=TDT PA\u00cdS VALENCI\u00c0 - P\u00e0gina 83 - M\u00f3nDigital.CAT|website=www.mondigital.cat|language=es}}</ref> for example, and, as of March 2016, there are more than ten DVB-T pirate multiplex in Madrid metropolitan area<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1364359|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> transmitting without authorization with programming ranging from [[divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_videncia.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> or [[fundamentalist Christian]] to [[community television]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_locales.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> (which isn't regulated in Spain as of 2016).\n\nIn other countries, there are reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually suspected to have been false reports, mistaking [[signal overspill|overspill]] from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than analogue pirate TV since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the [[electronic program guide]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n=== Known stations ===\n* '''ABD TV''' - Pirate Children's TV station broadcasting on UHF 32 in Chatswood Sydney Australia in 1996.

Like its counterpart [[pirate radio]], the term pirate TV lacks a specific universal interpretation. It implies a form of [[broadcasting]] that is unwelcome by the licensing authorities within the territory where its [[signal (electronics)|signals]] are received, especially when the country of [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] is the same as the country of reception. When the area of transmission is not a country, or when it is a country and the transmissions are not illegal, those same broadcast signals may be deemed illegal in the country of reception. Therefore, \"pirate TV\" can mean many things to many people. Pirate [[television station]]s may also be known as \"bootleg TV\", or confused with licensed [[low-power broadcasting]] (LPTV) or [[amateur television]] (ATV) services.\n\n==History==\nPirate Television stations are not as abundant in the United States or UK as pirate radio stations are. Only since 2004 has the technology for pirate television stations become easier to obtain and construct, due to advances in technologies and the availability of equipment.\n\nThe first pirate TV station in the US was Lanesville TV, launched in 1972, the broadcast station of video pioneers, the [[Videofreex]].<ref>http://www.skipblumberg.com/website/Bio_files/VideoPioneerSBJFVInt.pdf</ref>\n\nIn April 1978, a weekend broadcast on Channel 7 in [[Syracuse, New York]] called \"Lucky 7\" captured headlines across the nation. \"[[Lucky 7 (pirate TV station)|Lucky 7]]\" broadcast episodes of ''[[Star Trek]]'' and the [[pornographic movie]] ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]''. The source of the transmission was not identified, but it was speculated in an article in the ''New York Times'' that the signal may have been transmitted from the area of [[Syracuse University]], as the signal was strongest in that area.<ref>{{cite news |title=F.C.C Hunts an Illicit TV Station That Pirated Some Notable Shows |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 19, 1978 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1978/04/19/archives/fcc-hunts-an-illicit-tv-station-that-pirated-some-notable-shows.html |url-access=limited }}</ref>\n\n==Techniques==\nThere are several techniques for pirate TV broadcasting, most of which have been made very difficult, or obsolete, by better security measures and the move to [[digital television]].\n\n===Relay hijack (analogue)===\nMany analogue relay transmitters would \"listen\" to a more powerful main transmitter and relay the signal verbatim. If the main transmitter ceases broadcasting (for example, if a channel closes down overnight) then a pirate signal on the same frequency as the main transmitter could cause the relay to \"wake up\" and relay unauthorized programming instead. Typically this would be done by outputting a very weak RF signal within the immediate vicinity of the relay: for example, a video cassette recorder (such as a 12v system designed for use in trucks) sending its signal to a home-made antenna pointed at the relay. As the pirate signal is relatively weak, the source can be difficult to locate if it is well hidden.\n\nA significant benefit of this attack is that the potential viewers do not have to re-tune their televisions to view the content. The content simply appears on an existing channel, after close-down.\n\nThis attack is generally now prevented by the channels broadcasting 24 hours per day (e.g. showing [[test card]]s instead of closing down), by using satellite feeds instead of repeating terrestrial signals, by electronic security to lock the relay to the authorised source, or by the switch to digital television.\n\nUnsecured analogue satellite transponders have also been reported to have been hijacked in a similar manner.\n\n===Source hijack (analogue or digital)===\nIn this scenario, a [[man-in-the-middle attack]] is performed upon the source material, such that authorized official transmissions are fed with unauthorized programming from the central studio or play-out facility. For example, a link feed (e.g. outside broadcast) is hijacked by a stronger pirate signal, or pre-recorded media (such as videotapes or hard drives) are swapped over for unauthorised content. This attack would generally have to be performed by an [[insider]] or by gaining access to studio facilities by [[social engineering (security)|social engineering]].\n\n===Unauthorized transmitter (analogue)===\nAs with most [[pirate radio]] stations, reasonably powerful VHF/UHF transmitters can be built relatively easily by any sufficiently experienced electronics hobbyist, or imported from a less strict country. The primary challenge to this technique is finding a suitable yet inconspicuous vantage point for the transmission antenna, and the risk of getting caught. If the pirate signal is strong enough to be received directly, it will also be strong enough to be tracked down.\n\n===Unauthorized multiplex (digital)===\nThe advent of [[digital television]] makes pirate television broadcasting more difficult. Channels are broadcast as part of a [[Multiplex (TV)|multiplex]] that carries several channels in one signal, and it is almost impossible to insert an unauthorized channel into an authorized multiplex, or to re-activate an off-air channel. In order to broadcast an unauthorized digital TV channel, not only must the perpetrator build or obtain a VHF/UHF transmitter, he must also build or obtain, and configure, the equipment and software to digitally encode the signal and then create a stand-alone multiplex to carry it.\n\nIn Spain, in major provincial capital cities, usually operates one or more than one pirate TV digital multiplex. Some multiplexes started to operate after digital switch-over migrating pirate channels from analogue pirate television to DVB-T digital multiplexes.\n\nSince shortly after digital switch-over and still today in secondary cities, some channels broadcast by means of a DVB-T transmitter with four analog input sources (in this case, four tuned satellite receivers connected by composite video cable) and then to amplifier, and digital signal is feed to antenna or tower. This method is the one used by most pirate TV channels. However, over the years and due to economic returns, some have begun broadcasting almost professionally. New equipment that they have been installing since three years ago allows remultiplexing of DVB-S programs into DVB-T multiplexes and most parameters can be configured at will.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1367929|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref>\n\nSince 2010, its number has been increasing in Madrid and in Valencia,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondigital.cat/forum/viewtopic.php?p=87213|title=TDT PA\u00cdS VALENCI\u00c0 - P\u00e0gina 83 - M\u00f3nDigital.CAT|website=www.mondigital.cat|language=es}}</ref> for example, and, as of March 2016, there are more than ten DVB-T pirate multiplex in Madrid metropolitan area<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/comunidad/viewtopic.php?p=1364359|title=mundoplus.tv \u2022 Ver Tema - Canales piratas en la TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> transmitting without authorization with programming ranging from [[divinatory, esoteric and occult tarot]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_videncia.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> or [[fundamentalist Christian]] to [[community television]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mundoplus.tv/zonatdt/tdt_espana_ilegal_locales.php|title=mundoplus.tv :: Zona TDT|website=www.mundoplus.tv|language=es}}</ref> (which isn't regulated in Spain as of 2016).\n\nIn other countries, there are reports of pirate TV digital multiplexes, but they are very rare and usually suspected to have been false reports, mistaking [[signal overspill|overspill]] from authorized multiplexes in neighboring regions or nearby foreign countries. Viewing numbers may be much smaller than analogue pirate TV since re-tuning a digital television may be an entirely automated process which may ignore unauthorized multiplexes, or place such channels in an obscure section of the [[electronic program guide]].\n\n==Stations==\n\n=== Known stations ===\n* '''ABD TV''' - Pirate Children's TV station broadcasting on UHF 32 in Chatswood Sydney Australia in 1996.
