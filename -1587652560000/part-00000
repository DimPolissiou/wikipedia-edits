San Antonio College]], where he also served as a coach for the Forensics team during many of their national championship seasons.\n\n==Early life==\nSeagle was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi, MS.]] Seagle's father, Jack, was in the [[United States Air Force]], and as a result, the family moved many times. The family twice lived in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], near the [[United States Air Force Academy]] where Jack was stationed. Seagle recalls watching the moon landing on television in their apartment by what is today [[Chapel Hills Mall]]. Seagle's first encounter with [[Spider-Man]] was when his mother, Jennie, brought Seagle's brother, David, to the airforce [[Base Exchange]], where she purchased ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #66, which featured the villain [[Mysterio]] for David and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #89 featuring [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] for Steven. Years later, after Seagle had begun collecting comics himself, and his best friend, Eric Koppisch, recommended that he read an issue of ''Spider-Man'' himself, Seagle read an issue featuring a team-up with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. Seagle migrated to reading [[Uncanny X-Men|Uncanny X-men]] starting with issue #114 and this began Seagle's interest in comics. Seagle would later become the writer of Uncanny X-men and Nova would later be the co-star on the TV series Seagle would produce, ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.<ref name=ColoradoSprings>Terrones, Terry (March 27, 2012).

San Antonio College]], where he also served as a coach for the Forensics team during many of their national championship seasons.\n\n==Early life==\nSeagle was born in [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi, MS.]] Seagle's father, Jack, was in the [[United States Air Force]], and as a result, the family moved many times. The family twice lived in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], near the [[United States Air Force Academy]] where Jack was stationed. Seagle recalls watching the moon landing on television in their apartment by what is today [[Chapel Hills Mall]]. Seagle's first encounter with [[Spider-Man]] was when his mother, Jennie, brought Seagle's brother, David, to the airforce [[Base Exchange]], where she purchased ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #66, which featured the villain [[Mysterio]] for David and [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] #89 featuring [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] for Steven. Years later, after Seagle had begun collecting comics himself, and his best friend, Eric Koppisch, recommended that he read an issue of ''Spider-Man'' himself, Seagle read an issue featuring a team-up with [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Nova]]. Seagle migrated to reading [[Uncanny X-Men|Uncanny X-men]] starting with issue #114 and this began Seagle's interest in comics. Seagle would later become the writer of Uncanny X-men and Nova would later be the co-star on the TV series Seagle would produce, ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''.<ref name=ColoradoSprings>Terrones, Terry (March 27, 2012).

Current seats and party affiliations on the [[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority]] will be different for certain members.<ref name=\"elevated seniority2\">Delegates are non-voting members and Representatives are voting members of the United States House of Representatives.</ref>\n\nSeniority depends on the date on which members were sworn into office. Since many members are sworn in on the same day, subsequent ranking is based on previous congressional service of the individual and then by alphabetical order by the last name of the congressman.\n\nCommittee chairmanship in the House is often associated with seniority. However, party leadership is typically not associated with seniority.\n\nNote: The \"*\" indicates that the [[legislator|representative]]/[[Delegate (United States Congress)|delegate]] may have served one or more non-consecutive terms while in the House of Representatives of the [[United States Congress]].\n\n==U.S. House Seniority List==\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+U.S. House Seniority'''\n|- valign=bottom\n!Rank!!Representative!!Party!!District!!Seniority date!!No.# of term(s)!!Notes\n|-\n| 1 || [[William D.

The competition could become so fierce, that burning buildings would sometimes be ignored as the fire companies fought each other.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 654, 724, 823.</ref> Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew. However, fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, thus Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward. The Seventh Ward put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Morgan Morgans]], but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 823.</ref> Tweed then became associated with the [[Tammany Hall#Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves|\"Forty Thieves\"]], the group of aldermen and assistant aldermen who, up to that point, were known as some of the most corrupt politicians in the city's history.<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nTweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished.<ref name=gotham837>Burrows & Wallace, p. 837.</ref> In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up.

His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[John T.

The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.<ref name=gotham927>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 927\u2013928.</ref><ref name=History.com/>\n\nThe new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]] and Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Richard \"Slippery Dick\" Connolly]], both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Peter B.

In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], \"their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.\"<ref>Paine, p. 143.</ref> Crucially, the new city charter allowed the Board of Audit to issue bonds for debt in order to finance opportunistic capital expenditures the city otherwise could not afford.

Ingersoll and Andrew Garvey, city contractors involved with much of the city construction.]]\n\nTweed and his friends also garnered huge profits from the development of the Upper East Side, especially [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] and [[Harlem]]. They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area\u2014for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]]\u2014thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits. The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve. The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90&nbsp;million.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 929\u2013931.</ref>\n\nDuring the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development. In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpet bag]].  Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 934\u2013935.</ref>\n\nTweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]]. By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Scandal==\nTweed's downfall began in 1871. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref>Allen, pp. 118\u2013125.</ref> The [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]] in the Summer did not help the ring's popularity. The riot was prompted after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism. The parade was banned because of a riot the previous year in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders. Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]]. The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1003\u20131008.</ref>\n\nAlthough Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of its people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\"/>\n\n[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. \"As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?\"]]\n\nTweed had for months been under attack from ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''&nbsp;\u2013 regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, \"Stop them damned pictures.

They were able to force an examination of the city's books, but the blue-ribbon commission of six businessmen appointed by Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]], a Tammany man, which included [[John Jacob Astor III]], banker [[Moses Taylor]] and others who benefited from Tammany's actions, found that the books had been \"faithfully kept\", letting the air out of the effort to dethrone Tweed.<ref name=g1008>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1008\u20131011.</ref>\n\nThe response to the Orange riot changed everything, and only days afterwards the ''Times''/Nast campaign began to garner popular support.<ref name=g1008 /> More important, the ''Times'' started to receive inside information from County Sheriff James O'Brien, whose support for Tweed had fluctuated during Tammany's reign. O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\">Ellis, pp. 347\u2013348.</ref> Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\" /> which was reportedly offered $5&nbsp;million to not publish the evidence.<ref>Paine, p. 170.</ref> The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined \"Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed\".<ref name=g1008 /> In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nThe expos\u00e9 provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts. European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management \u2013 only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities. New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nThus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the \"wisest and best citizens\" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as \"the [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]]\"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge\u2014Tweed's old friend George Barnard\u2014enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse\u2014$50,000\u2014but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nShortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haswell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.<ref name=g1008 />\n\n==Imprisonment, escape, and death==\n[[File:Thomas Nast, Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make cph.3a00899.jpg|thumb|\"Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make\": Editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] predicting Tweed could not be kept behind bars (''Harper's Weekly'', January 6, 1872)<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0106.html |title=On This Day: January 6, 1872 |website=The New York Times |access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nTweed was released on $1&nbsp;million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box. Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas. Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader.  Once again, he was released on bail\u2014$8&nbsp;million this time\u2014but Tweed's supporters, such as [[Jay Gould]], felt the repercussions of his fall from power.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nTweed's first trial, in January 1873, ended when the jury was unable to agree on a verdict. Tweed's defense counsel included [[David Dudley Field II]] and [[Elihu Root]].<ref>Allen pp. 138\u2013139.</ref> His retrial in November resulted in convictions on 204 of 220 counts, a fine of $12,750<ref name=encnyc /> (the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|12750|1873|r=-4}}}} today) and a prison sentence of 12 years; a higher court, however, reduced Tweed's sentence to one year.<ref name=\"uoooovz\">[http://www.lowermanhattan.info/news/landmark_tweed_courthouse_has_65546.aspx Lower Manhattan : News | Landmark Tweed Courthouse Has a Checkered History]</ref> After his release from prison, a year spent in [[the Tombs]], New York State filed a [[civil suit]] against Tweed, attempting to recover $6&nbsp;million in embezzled funds.<ref name=uoooovz /> Unable to put up the $3&nbsp;million bail, Tweed was locked up in the [[Ludlow Street Jail]], although he was allowed home visits.

Ackerman]]:<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.\n\nAlthough he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party,<ref name=History.com/> Tweed was never the sole \"boss\" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the [[Progressive Era]] in terms of more efficient city management.  Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the [[King James Bible]] in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the [[New York Public Library]], even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<ref>Mandelbaum, Seymour J. ''Boss Tweed's New York'' (1965).</ref><ref>Muccigrosso, Robert ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 1538\u201342.</ref>\n\nTweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined.<ref>Ackerman, p. 66.</ref> Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.\n\nDuring Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure \u2013 all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Leo Hershkowitz]] in ''Tweed's New York: Another Look'', there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in ''Harper's Weekly'' and the editors of ''The New York Times'', which both had ties to the  Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the [[Whiskey Ring]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hershkowitz|first=Leo|title=Tweed's New York: Another Look|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\nTweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: \"Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.\"<ref name=encnyc /> One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become \"the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss\".<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[Image:Boss tweed.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An 1869 cigar box label featuring Tweed]]\n\n==Middle name==\nTweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain \"M.\", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as \"Marcy\". His actual middle name was \"Magear\", his mother's maiden name; Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed Jr. The confusion derives from a Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from [[William L. Marcy]], the former governor of New York.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nevius|first=Michelle|title=Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City|year=2009|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-8997-6|pages=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8K5OCC4CMwC&pg=PA120 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1945, Tweed was portrayed by [[Noah Beery Sr.]] in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Up in Central Park'', a [[musical comedy]] with music by [[Sigmund Romberg]].<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=1669 ''Up In Central Park'' (1945)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> The role was played by [[Malcolm Lee Beggs]] for a revival in 1947.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=473592 ''Up In Central Park'' (1947)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> In the [[Up in Central Park|1948 film version]], Tweed is played by [[Vincent Price]].<ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&Movie=25791 ''Up in Central Park''] at [[AFI Catalog]].</ref>\n\nOn the 1963\u20131964 [[CBS]] TV series ''[[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|The Great Adventure]]'', which presented one-hour dramatizations of the lives of historical figures, [[Edward Andrews]] portrayed Tweed in the episode \"The Man Who Stole New York City\", about the campaign by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to bring down Tweed.

Tweed was a member of Palestine Lodge No. 204, New York City, Grand Lodge of Masons New York State.</ref> and joined a volunteer fire company, Engine No. 12.<ref name=encnyc /> In 1848, at the invitation of state assemblyman John J. Reilly, he and some friends organized the Americus Fire Company No. 6, also known as the \"Big Six\", as a [[volunteer fireman|volunteer fire company]], which took as its symbol a snarling red [[Bengal tiger]] from a French lithograph<ref name=\"allen\"/>, a symbol which remained associated with Tweed and [[Tammany Hall]] for many years.<ref name= encnyc /> At the time, volunteer fire companies competed vigorously with each other; some were connected with street gangs and had strong ethnic ties to various immigrant communities.  The competition could become so fierce, that burning buildings would sometimes be ignored as the fire companies fought each other.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 654, 724, 823.</ref> Tweed became known for his ax-wielding violence, and was soon elected the Big Six foreman. Pressure from Alfred Carlson, the chief engineer, got him thrown out of the crew. However, fire companies were also recruiting grounds for political parties at the time, thus Tweed's exploits came to the attention of the Democratic politicians who ran the Seventh Ward. The Seventh Ward put him up for Alderman in 1850, when Tweed was 26.  He lost that election to the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] candidate [[Morgan Morgans]], but ran again the next year and won, garnering his first political position.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, p. 823.</ref> Tweed then became associated with the [[Tammany Hall#Political Gangs and the Forty Thieves|\"Forty Thieves\"]], the group of aldermen and assistant aldermen who, up to that point, were known as some of the most corrupt politicians in the city's history.<ref name=\"allen\"/>\n\nTweed was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1852, but his two-year term was undistinguished.<ref name=gotham837>Burrows & Wallace, p. 837.</ref> In an attempt by Republican reformers in [[Albany, New York|Albany]], the state capital, to control the Democratic-dominated New York City government, the power of the New York County Board of Supervisors was beefed up. The board had 12 members, six appointed by the mayor and six elected, and in 1858 Tweed was appointed to the board, which became his first vehicle for large-scale [[Graft (politics)|graft]]; Tweed and other supervisors forced vendors to pay a 15% overcharge to their \"ring\" in order to do business with the city.<ref name=gotham837 /> By 1853, Tweed was running the seventh ward for Tammany.<ref name=encnyc /> The board also had six Democrats and six Republicans, but Tweed often just bought off one Republican to sway the board. One such Republican board member was Peter P. Voorhis, a coal dealer by profession who absented himself from a board meeting in exchange for $2,500 so that the board could appoint city inspectors.

He invested his now considerable illegal income in real estate, so that by the late 1860s he ranked among the biggest landowners in New York City.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nTweed was a member of the [[New York State Senate]] (4th D.) from 1868 to 1873, sitting in the [[91st New York State Legislature|91st]], [[92nd New York State Legislature|92nd]], [[93rd New York State Legislature|93rd]] and [[94th New York State Legislature]]s, but not taking his seat in the [[95th New York State Legislature|95th]] and [[96th New York State Legislature]]s. While serving in the State Senate, he split his time between Albany, New York and New York City. While in Albany, he stayed in a suite of seven rooms in Delevan House. Accompanying him in his rooms were his favorite canaries. Guests are presumed to have included members of the [[Black Horse Cavalry]], thirty state legislators whose votes were up for sale.<ref>Allen, p. 100.</ref> In the Senate he helped financiers [[Jay Gould]] and [[Big Jim Fisk]] to take control of the [[Erie Railroad]] from [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]] by arranging for legislation that legitimized fake Erie stock certificates that Gould and Fisk had issued. In return, Tweed received a large block of stock and was made a director of the company.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Corruption==\nAfter the election of 1869, Tweed took control of the New York City government.  His prot\u00e9g\u00e9, [[John T. Hoffman]], the former mayor of the city, won election as governor, and Tweed garnered the support of good government reformers like [[Peter Cooper]] and the [[Union League Club]], by proposing a new city charter which returned power to City Hall at the expense of the Republican-inspired state commissions. The new charter passed, thanks in part to $600,000 in bribes Tweed paid to Republicans, and was signed into law by Hoffman in 1870.  Mandated new elections allowed Tammany to take over the city's Common Council when they won all fifteen aldermanic contests.<ref name=gotham927>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 927\u2013928.</ref><ref name=History.com/>\n\nThe new charter put control of the city's finances in the hands of a Board of Audit, which consisted of Tweed, who was Commissioner of Public Works, Mayor [[A. Oakey Hall]] and Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Richard \"Slippery Dick\" Connolly]], both Tammany men. Hall also appointed other Tweed associates to high offices&nbsp;\u2013 such as [[Peter B. Sweeny]], who took over the Department of Public Parks<ref name=gotham927 />&nbsp;\u2013 providing what became known as the Tweed Ring with even firmer control of the New York City government<ref>Paine, p. 140.</ref> and enabling them to defraud the taxpayers of many more millions of dollars. In the words of [[Albert Bigelow Paine]], \"their methods were curiously simple and primitive. There were no skilful manipulations of figures, making detection difficult ... Connolly, as Controller, had charge of the books, and declined to show them. With his fellows, he also 'controlled' the courts and most of the bar.\"<ref>Paine, p. 143.</ref> Crucially, the new city charter allowed the Board of Audit to issue bonds for debt in order to finance opportunistic capital expenditures the city otherwise could not afford. This ability to float debt was enabled by Tweed's guidance and passage of the Adjusted Claims Act in 1868.<ref>Allen, pp. 111\u2013112.</ref> Contractors working for the city&nbsp;\u2013 \"Ring favorites, most of them&nbsp;\u2013 were told to multiply the amount of each bill by five, or ten, or a hundred, after which, with Mayor Hall's 'O.

Ingersoll and Andrew Garvey, city contractors involved with much of the city construction.]]\n\nTweed and his friends also garnered huge profits from the development of the Upper East Side, especially [[Yorkville, Manhattan|Yorkville]] and [[Harlem]]. They would buy up undeveloped property, then use the resources of the city to improve the area\u2014for instance by installing pipes to bring in water from the [[Croton Aqueduct]]\u2014thus increasing the value of the land, after which they sold and took their profits. The focus on the east side also slowed down the development of the west side, the [[topography]] of which made it more expensive to improve. The ring also took their usual percentage of padded contracts, as well as raking off money from property taxes. Despite the corruption of Tweed and Tammany Hall, they did accomplish the development of upper Manhattan, though at the cost of tripling the city's bond debt to almost $90&nbsp;million.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 929\u2013931.</ref>\n\nDuring the Tweed era, the proposal to build a suspension bridge between New York and [[Brooklyn]], then an independent city, was floated by Brooklyn-boosters, who saw the ferry connections as a bottleneck to Brooklyn's further development. In order to ensure that the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] project would go forward, State Senator [[Henry Cruse Murphy]] approached Tweed to find out whether New York's aldermen would approve the proposal. Tweed's response was that $60,000 for the aldermen would close the deal, and contractor [[William C. Kingsley]] put up the cash, which was delivered in a [[carpet bag]].  Tweed and two others from Tammany also received over half the private stock of the Bridge Company, the charter of which specified that only private stockholders had voting rights, so that even though the cities of Brooklyn and Manhattan put up most of the money, they essentially had no control over the project.<ref>Burrows & Wallace, pp. 934\u2013935.</ref>\n\nTweed bought a mansion on [[Fifth Avenue]] and [[43rd Street (Manhattan)|43rd Street]], and stabled his horses, carriages and sleighs on [[40th Street (Manhattan)|40th Street]]. By 1871, he was a member of the board of directors of not only the Erie Railroad and the Brooklyn Bridge Company, but also the Third Avenue Railway Company and the Harlem Gas Light Company.  He was president of the Guardian Savings Banks and he and his confederates set up the Tenth National Bank to better control their fortunes.<ref name=encnyc />\n\n==Scandal==\nTweed's downfall began in 1871. James Watson, who was a county auditor in Comptroller [[Richard B. Connolly|Dick Connolly]]'s office and who also held and recorded the ring's books, died a week after his head was smashed by a horse in a sleigh accident on January 21, 1871. Although Tweed guarded Watson's estate in the week prior to Watson's death, and although another ring member attempted to destroy Watson's records, a replacement auditor, Matthew O'Rourke, associated with former sheriff [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] provided city accounts to O'Brien.<ref>Allen, pp. 118\u2013125.</ref> The [[Orange riots|Orange riot of 1871]] in the Summer did not help the ring's popularity. The riot was prompted after Tammany Hall banned a parade of Irish Protestants celebrating a historical victory against Catholicism. The parade was banned because of a riot the previous year in which eight people died when a crowd of Irish Catholic laborers attacked the paraders. Under strong pressure from the newspapers and the Protestant elite of the city, Tammany reversed course, and the march was allowed to proceed, with protection from [[NYPD|city policemen]] and [[New York State National Guard|state militia]]. The result was an even larger riot in which over 60 people were killed and more than 150 injured.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\">Burrows & Wallace, pp. 1003\u20131008.</ref>\n\nAlthough Tammany's electoral power base was largely centered in the Irish immigrant population, it also needed the city's elite to acquiesce in its rule, and this was conditional on the machine's ability to control the actions of its people, but the July riot showed that this capability was not nearly as strong as had been supposed.<ref name=\"bw1003-1008\"/>\n\n[[File:Boss Tweed, Nast.jpg|thumb|right|237px|Nast shows Tweed's source of power: control of the ballot box. \"As long as I count the Votes, what are you going to do about it?\"]]\n\nTweed had for months been under attack from ''The New York Times'' and [[Thomas Nast]], the cartoonist from ''[[Harper's Weekly]]''&nbsp;\u2013 regarding Nast's cartoons, Tweed reportedly said, \"Stop them damned pictures.

O'Brien had tried to [[blackmail]] Tammany by threatening to expose the ring's [[embezzlement]] to the press, and when this failed he provided the evidence he had collected to the ''Times''.<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\">Ellis, pp. 347\u2013348.</ref> Shortly afterward, county auditor Matthew J. O'Rourke supplied additional details to the ''Times'',<ref name=\"Ellis347-8\" /> which was reportedly offered $5&nbsp;million to not publish the evidence.<ref>Paine, p. 170.</ref> The ''Times'' also obtained the accounts of the recently deceased James Watson, who was the Tweed Ring's bookkeeper, and these were published daily, culminating in a special four-page supplement on July 29 headlined \"Gigantic Frauds of the Ring Exposed\".<ref name=g1008 /> In August, Tweed began to transfer ownership in his real-estate empire and other investments to his family members.<ref name=encnyc />\n\nThe expos\u00e9 provoked an international crisis of confidence in New York City's finances, and, in particular, in its ability to repay its debts. European investors were heavily positioned in the city's bonds and were already nervous about its management \u2013 only the reputations of the underwriters were preventing a run on the city's securities. New York's financial and business community knew that if the city's credit was to collapse, it could potentially bring down every bank in the city with it.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nThus, the city's elite met at [[Cooper Union]] in September to discuss political reform: but for the first time, the conversation included not only the usual reformers, but also [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] bigwigs such as [[Samuel J. Tilden]], who had been thrust aside by Tammany. The consensus was that the \"wisest and best citizens\" should take over the governance of the city and attempt to restore investor confidence. The result was the formation of the Executive Committee of Citizens and Taxpayers for Financial Reform of the City (also known as \"the [[Committee of Seventy (New York City)|Committee of Seventy]]\"), which attacked Tammany by cutting off the city's funding. Property owners refused to pay their municipal taxes, and a judge\u2014Tweed's old friend George Barnard\u2014enjoined the city Comptroller from issuing bonds or spending money. Unpaid workers turned against Tweed, marching to City Hall demanding to be paid.  Tweed doled out some funds from his own purse\u2014$50,000\u2014but it was not sufficient to end the crisis, and Tammany began to lose its essential base.<ref name=g1008 />\n\nShortly thereafter, the Comptroller resigned, appointing [[Andrew Haswell Green]], an associate of Tilden's, as his replacement. Green loosened the purse strings again, allowing city departments not under Tammany control to borrow money to operate. Green and Tilden had the city's records closely examined, and discovered money that went directly from city contractors into Tweed's pocket. The following day, they had Tweed arrested.<ref name=g1008 />\n\n==Imprisonment, escape, and death==\n[[File:Thomas Nast, Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make cph.3a00899.jpg|thumb|\"Stone Walls Do Not a Prison Make\": Editorial cartoon by [[Thomas Nast]] predicting Tweed could not be kept behind bars (''Harper's Weekly'', January 6, 1872)<ref>\n{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/harp/0106.html |title=On This Day: January 6, 1872 |website=The New York Times |access-date=May 14, 2016}}</ref>]]\n\nTweed was released on $1&nbsp;million bail, and Tammany set to work to recover its position through the ballot box. Tweed was re-elected to the state senate in November 1871, due to his personal popularity and largesse in his district, but in general Tammany did not do well, and the members of the Tweed Ring began to flee the jurisdiction, many going overseas. Tweed was re-arrested, forced to resign his city positions, and was replaced as Tammany's leader.

Ackerman]]:<blockquote>It's hard not to admire the skill behind Tweed's system ... The Tweed ring at its height was an engineering marvel, strong and solid, strategically deployed to control key power points: the courts, the legislature, the treasury and the ballot box. Its frauds had a grandeur of scale and an elegance of structure: money-laundering, profit sharing and organization.<ref>''Boss Tweed: The Rise and Fall of the Corrupt Pol Who Conceived the Soul of Modern New York'' New York: [[Carroll & Graf]], 2005; quoted in [[Pete Hamill|Hammill, Pete]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/27/books/review/027HAMILL.html?_r=0 \"'Boss Tweed': The Fellowship of the Ring\"] ''[[The New York Times]]'' (March 27, 2005).</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn depictions of Tweed and the Tammany Hall organization, historians have emphasized the thievery and conspiratorial nature of Boss Tweed, along with lining his own pockets and those of his friends and allies. The theme is that the sins of corruption so violated American standards of political rectitude that they far overshadow Tweed's positive contributions to New York City.\n\nAlthough he held numerous important public offices and was one of a handful of senior leaders of Tammany Hall, as well as the state legislature and the state Democratic Party,<ref name=History.com/> Tweed was never the sole \"boss\" of New York City. He shared control of the city with numerous less famous people, such as the villains depicted in the Nast's famous circle of guilt cartoon shown above. Seymour J. Mandelbaum has argued that, apart from the corruption he engaged in, Tweed was a modernizer who prefigured certain elements of the [[Progressive Era]] in terms of more efficient city management.  Much of the money he siphoned off from the city treasury went to needy constituents who appreciated the free food at Christmas time and remembered it at the next election, and to precinct workers who provided the muscle of his machine. As a legislator he worked to expand and strengthen welfare programs, especially those by private charities, schools, and hospitals. With a base in the Irish Catholic community, he opposed efforts of Protestants to require the reading of the [[King James Bible]] in public schools, which was done deliberately to keep out Catholics. He facilitated the founding of the [[New York Public Library]], even though one of its founders, Samuel Tilden, was Tweed's sworn enemy in the Democratic Party.<ref>Mandelbaum, Seymour J. ''Boss Tweed's New York'' (1965).</ref><ref>Muccigrosso, Robert ed., ''Research Guide to American Historical Biography'' (1988) 1538\u201342.</ref>\n\nTweed recognized that the support of his constituency was necessary for him to remain in power, and as a consequence he used the machinery of the city's government to provide numerous social services, including building more orphanages, almshouses and public baths.<ref name=encnyc /> Tweed also fought for the [[New York State Legislature]] to donate to private charities of all religious denominations, and subsidize [[Catholic schools]] and hospitals. From 1869 to 1871, under Tweed's influence, the state of New York spent more on charities than for the entire time period from 1852 to 1868 combined.<ref>Ackerman, p. 66.</ref> Tweed also pushed through funding for a teachers college and prohibition of [[corporal punishment]] in schools, as well as salary increases for school teachers.\n\nDuring Tweed's regime, the main business thoroughfare Broadway was widened between [[34th Street (Manhattan)|34th Street]] and [[59th Street (Manhattan)|59th Street]], land was secured for the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Upper East Side]] and [[Upper West Side]] were developed and provided the necessary infrastructure \u2013 all to the benefit of the purses of the Tweed Ring, but also, ultimately, to the benefit of the people of the city.\n\nAccording to [[Leo Hershkowitz]] in ''Tweed's New York: Another Look'', there is no evidence of any personal financial gain on Tweed's part, despite the implications of Thomas Nast in ''Harper's Weekly'' and the editors of ''The New York Times'', which both had ties to the  Republican party. In part, the campaign against Tweed diverted public attention from Republican scandals such as the [[Whiskey Ring]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Hershkowitz|first=Leo|title=Tweed's New York: Another Look|date=1977|publisher=Doubleday|location=Garden City, NY}}</ref>\n\nTweed himself wanted no particular recognition of his achievements, such as they were. When it was proposed, in March 1871, when he was at the height of his power, that a statue be erected in his honor, he declared: \"Statues are not erected to living men ... I claim to be a live man, and hope (Divine Providence permitting) to survive in all my vigor, politically and physically, some years to come.\"<ref name=encnyc /> One of Tweed's unwanted legacies is that he has become \"the archetype of the bloated, rapacious, corrupt city boss\".<ref name=encnyc />\n\n[[Image:Boss tweed.jpg|thumb|right|225px|An 1869 cigar box label featuring Tweed]]\n\n==Middle name==\nTweed never signed his name with anything other than a plain \"M.\", and his middle name is often mistakenly listed as \"Marcy\". His actual middle name was \"Magear\", his mother's maiden name; Tweed's son's name was William Magear Tweed Jr. The confusion derives from a Nast cartoon with a picture of Tweed, supplemented with a quote from [[William L. Marcy]], the former governor of New York.<ref>{{cite book|last=Nevius|first=Michelle|title=Inside the Apple: A Streetwise History of New York City|year=2009|publisher=Free Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4165-8997-6|pages=120|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O8K5OCC4CMwC&pg=PA120 }}</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\nIn 1945, Tweed was portrayed by [[Noah Beery Sr.]] in the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production of ''Up in Central Park'', a [[musical comedy]] with music by [[Sigmund Romberg]].<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=1669 ''Up In Central Park'' (1945)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> The role was played by [[Malcolm Lee Beggs]] for a revival in 1947.<ref>[http://ibdb.com/production.php?id=473592 ''Up In Central Park'' (1947)] on [[Internet Broadway Database]].</ref> In the [[Up in Central Park|1948 film version]], Tweed is played by [[Vincent Price]].<ref>[http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/AbbrView.aspx?s=&Movie=25791 ''Up in Central Park''] at [[AFI Catalog]].</ref>\n\nOn the 1963\u20131964 [[CBS]] TV series ''[[The Great Adventure (U.S. TV series)|The Great Adventure]]'', which presented one-hour dramatizations of the lives of historical figures, [[Edward Andrews]] portrayed Tweed in the episode \"The Man Who Stole New York City\", about the campaign by ''[[The New York Times]]'' to bring down Tweed.

Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Surname ==\n{{see also|List of Pakistani family names}}\nUnlike the practice in Western countries, and other countries with predominant European influence, there is no one way of writing a full name in Pakistan. The most popular convention is to append the most called given name of the father to the person's given names. Often, if the person has more than one given name, his full name consists only of his given names. Another convention is to prefix the person's given name with a title, which is usually associated with his tribal ancestry. Due to western influence, appending rather than prefixing titles to given names has become more common. One notable exception is the title ''[[Khan (title)|Khan]]'', common in people of [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] origin, which has always been appended rather than prefixed to given names. There are several titles used in Pakistan and other Muslim countries. ''[[Syed]]'', ''[[Shaikh]]'', ''[[Khawaja]]'', ''[[Pasha]]'', ''[[Mirza]]'', ''[[Chachar]]'' etc. are common. Less commonly, the tribal name itself is appended to the person's given names. For females, tribal names or titles rarely figure in the person's full name (although this has become more common due to Western influence). Instead her full name would be composed of her given names only, or if given only one name, her given name appended with her father's most called name. After marriage, the full name would be her most called name appended with her husband's most called name. In official documents, a person's identity is established by listing both the person's full name (however they may write it), and their father's. For married women, the husband's name might be used instead of the father's. Official forms always contain fields for both names, and they are used together as '''''A''' son/daughter/wife of '''B''''' on ID cards, passports, diplomas, in court, etc. The problem with these naming conventions is that it is difficult to trace back family roots. Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have  a different ''surname'' or ''family name'' from his children.\n\n===Rahis===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Abro]]\n*[[Akhoond]]\n*[[Arbab]]\n*[[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]\n*[[Babu (title)|Babu]]\n* [[Baig]]\n*[[Begum]]\n*[[Chaudhary]]\n*[[Dewan]]\n*[[Effendi]]\n*[[Emir]]\n*[[Faujdar]]\n*[[Ghalotar (Jutt)]]\n*[[ Ghengat ]] \n*[[Gardezi]]\n*[[Jam (title of nobility)|Jam]]\n*[[Jarral]]\n*[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\n*[[Khan Bahadur (title)|Khan Bahadur]]\n*[[Khan Sahib]]\n*[[Khatun]]\n*[[Khattak]]\n*[[Mahr]]\n*[[Sharif]]\n*[[Makhdoom]]\n*[[Malik]]\n*[[Maqsood]]\n*[[Mir (title)|Mir]]\n*[[Mirza]]\n*[[Mullah]]\n*[[Niazi]]\n*[[Nawab]]\n*[[Padishah]]\n*[[Qureshi]]\n*[[Qanungoh Shaikh]] \n*[[Rais]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Rana (title)|Rana]]\n*[[Rawal]]\n*[[Saeen]]\n*[[Sahib]]\n*[[Saravan (title)|Saravan]]\n*[[Sardar]]\n*[[Shah]]\n*[[Shaikh]]                                               \n*[[Soomro]]\n*[[Subahdar]]\n*[[Sultan]]\n*[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]\n*[[Syed]]\n*[[Tumandar]]\n*[[Ustad]]\n*[[Vizier]]\n*[[rahoo]]\n*[[Vali (governor)|Vali]]\n}}\u2022 Chaudhry or Choudhury \n\n\u2022 Multani \n<br />\n\n===Prefixes===\n* [[Hajji|Haji]], one who had made the [[Hajj|Muslim pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].\n* [[Emir|Mir]], generally indicates [[sayid|seyed]] and/or royal descent.\n* [[ Ghengat]] , used for people one of clan of rajputana rulling area presently in Sindh, bahawalpur and Rajasthan india\n* [[Saeen]], used for people who speak Sindhi\n*[[Syed]], used for people belonging to the family of Muhummad\n\n===Suffixes===\n*'''-i''', a common suffix used for surnames.\n*'''-zai''', \"descendant of\" used commonly in Pashtun surnames.\n*'''-nia''', \"His/Her highness (Title)\".\n*'''-bakhsh''', \"granted by\".\n*'''-dad''' ''(Middle Persian: D\u0101ta)'', \"given by\".\n\n==Names by ethnicity==\n===Baloch names===\n{{main|:Category:Baloch names}}\n\n===Gilgiti names===\n{{Main|:Category:Gilgiti names}}\n\n===Kashmiri names===\n{{main|:Category:Kashmiri names}}\n\n===Pashtun names===\n{{main|Pashtun names}}\n\n===Punjabi names===\n{{main|:Category:Punjabi names}}\n\n===Saraiki names===\n\n{{main|:Category:Saraiki names}}\n\n===Sindhi names===\n{{main|Sindhi names}}\n\n===Urdu names===\n{{main|:Category:Urdu names}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Pakistani family names]]\n* [[:Category:Titles in Pakistan|Honorifics in Pakistan]]\n* [[Arabic name]]\n* [[Turkish name]]\n* [[Persian name]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Names in world cultures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pakistani Name}}\n[[Category:Pakistani names|*]]\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=November 2018}}\n{{Culture of Pakistan}}\n\nA '''Pakistani name''' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|'''\u067e\u0627\u06a9\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0646\u0627\u0645'''}}}}) consists of a [[given name]], sometimes a [[middle name]], and a [[surname]]. Pakistani names vary depending upon [[Demographics of Pakistan|ethnicity]] and spoken [[Languages of Pakistan|language]].\n\n== Given names ==\nSince the [[Islam in Pakistan#Arrival of Islam in modern Pakistan|Muslim conquest of the Indus Valley]], the majority of Pakistani given names are derived from [[Persian name|Persian]], [[Arabic name|Arabic]] and [[Turkish name|Turkish]] names. Children may be given one, two or rarely three names at birth. If the person has more than one given name, one of them is chosen as the person's ''most called name'', by which he is called or referred to informally. Generally for males, [[Muhammad]], the name of the last prophet of Islam, is chosen to be the person's first given name, if he has more than one. Because of the prevalence of this practice, this name is usually not the person's most called name, as it does not serve as a unique identifier. [[Ali]] is the 2nd most common given name for males in Pakistan. Female names tend to be more mixed and are usually given two names. \n\n===Common male given names===\n{{main|:Category:Pakistani masculine given names}}\n* {{hlist| [[Abbas (name)|Abbas]] | [[Abdul]]

Many Muslims have settled in Western world and this naming convention creates some problems as a father will have  a different ''surname'' or ''family name'' from his children.\n\n===Rahis===\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[Abro]]\n*[[Akhoond]]\n*[[Arbab]]\n*[[Baba (honorific)|Baba]]\n*[[Babu (title)|Babu]]\n* [[Baig]]\n*[[Begum]]\n*[[Chaudhary]]\n*[[Dewan]]\n*[[Effendi]]\n*[[Emir]]\n*[[Faujdar]]\n*[[Ghalotar (Jutt)]]\n*[[ Ghengat ]] \n*[[Gardezi]]\n*[[Jam (title of nobility)|Jam]]\n*[[Jarral]]\n*[[Khan (title)|Khan]]\n*[[Khan Bahadur (title)|Khan Bahadur]]\n*[[Khan Sahib]]\n*[[Khatun]]\n*[[Khattak]]\n*[[Mahr]]\n*[[Sharif]]\n*[[Makhdoom]]\n*[[Malik]]\n*[[Maqsood]]\n*[[Mir (title)|Mir]]\n*[[Mirza]]\n*[[Mullah]]\n*[[Niazi]]\n*[[Nawab]]\n*[[Padishah]]\n*[[Qureshi]]\n*[[Qanungoh Shaikh]] \n*[[Rais]]\n*[[Raja]]\n*[[Rana (title)|Rana]]\n*[[Rawal]]\n*[[Saeen]]\n*[[Sahib]]\n*[[Saravan (title)|Saravan]]\n*[[Sardar]]\n*[[Shah]]\n*[[Shaikh]]                                               \n*[[Soomro]]\n*[[Subahdar]]\n*[[Sultan]]\n*[[Sultana (title)|Sultana]]\n*[[Syed]]\n*[[Tumandar]]\n*[[Ustad]]\n*[[Vizier]]\n*[[rahoo]]\n*[[Vali (governor)|Vali]]\n}}\u2022 Chaudhry or Choudhury \n\n\u2022 Multani \n<br />\n\n===Prefixes===\n* [[Hajji|Haji]], one who had made the [[Hajj|Muslim pilgrimage]] to [[Mecca]].\n* [[Emir|Mir]], generally indicates [[sayid|seyed]] and/or royal descent.\n* [[ Ghengat]] , used for people one of clan of rajputana rulling area presently in Sindh, bahawalpur and Rajasthan india\n* [[Saeen]], used for people who speak Sindhi\n*[[Syed]], used for people belonging to the family of Muhummad\n\n===Suffixes===\n*'''-i''', a common suffix used for surnames.\n*'''-zai''', \"descendant of\" used commonly in Pashtun surnames.\n*'''-nia''', \"His/Her highness (Title)\".\n*'''-bakhsh''', \"granted by\".\n*'''-dad''' ''(Middle Persian: D\u0101ta)'', \"given by\".\n\n==Names by ethnicity==\n===Baloch names===\n{{main|:Category:Baloch names}}\n\n===Gilgiti names===\n{{Main|:Category:Gilgiti names}}\n\n===Kashmiri names===\n{{main|:Category:Kashmiri names}}\n\n===Pashtun names===\n{{main|Pashtun names}}\n\n===Punjabi names===\n{{main|:Category:Punjabi names}}\n\n===Saraiki names===\n\n{{main|:Category:Saraiki names}}\n\n===Sindhi names===\n{{main|Sindhi names}}\n\n===Urdu names===\n{{main|:Category:Urdu names}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Pakistani family names]]\n* [[:Category:Titles in Pakistan|Honorifics in Pakistan]]\n* [[Arabic name]]\n* [[Turkish name]]\n* [[Persian name]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Names in world cultures}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pakistani Name}}\n[[Category:Pakistani names|*]]\n[[Category:Names by culture]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toTalib(link changed toTalib (name)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pakistani_name"}

The best studied SNAREs are those that mediate docking of [[synaptic vesicle]]s with the presynaptic membrane in [[neuron]]s. These SNAREs are the targets of the bacterial neurotoxins responsible for [[botulism]] and [[tetanus]].\n\n== Types ==\n\nSNAREs can be divided into two categories: ''vesicle'' or ''v-SNAREs'', which are incorporated into the membranes of transport vesicles during budding, and ''target'' or ''t-SNAREs'', which are associated with nerve terminal membranes. Evidence suggests that t-SNAREs form stable subcomplexes which serve as guides for v-SNARE, incorporated into the membrane of a protein-coated vesicle, binding to complete the formation of the SNARE complex.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Malsam J, S\u00f6llner TH | title = Organization of SNAREs within the Golgi stack. | journal = Cold Spring Harbor Perspectives in Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 10 | pages = a005249 | date = 1 October 2011 | pmid = 21768609 | doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a005249 | pmc=3179334}}</ref>    Several SNARE proteins are located on both vesicles and target membranes,  therefore, a more recent classification scheme takes into account structural features of SNAREs, dividing them into R-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs.  Often, R-SNAREs act as v-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs act as t-SNAREs.  R-SNAREs are proteins that contribute an arginine (R) residue in the formation of the [[zero ionic layer]] in the assembled core SNARE complex. One particular R-SNARE is synaptobrevin, which is located in the synaptic vesicles. Q-SNAREs are proteins that contribute a glutamine (Q) residue in the formation of the zero ionic layer in the assembled core SNARE complex. Q-SNAREs include syntaxin and SNAP-25.  Q-SNAREs are further classified as Qa, Qb, or Qc depending on their location in the four-helix bundle.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nSNAREs are small, abundant, sometimes tail-anchored proteins which are often post-translationally inserted into membranes via a C-terminal [[transmembrane domain]].  Seven of the 38 known SNAREs, including [[SNAP-25]], do not have a transmembrane domain and are instead attached to the membrane via lipid modifications such as [[palmitoylation]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hong W, Lev S | title = Tethering the assembly of SNARE complexes. | journal = Trends in Cell Biology | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 35\u201343 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24119662 | doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2013.09.006}}</ref> Tail-anchored proteins can be inserted into the [[plasma membrane]], [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[mitochondria]], and [[peroxisome]]s among other membranes, though any particular SNARE is targeted to a unique membrane. The targeting of SNAREs is accomplished by altering either the composition of the C-terminal flanking amino acid residues or the length of the transmembrane domain. Replacement of the transmembrane domain with lipid anchors leads to an intermediate stage of membrane fusion where only the two contacting leaflets fuse and not the two distal leaflets of the two membrane bilayer.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Martens S, McMahon HT | title = Mechanisms of membrane fusion: disparate players and common principles | journal = Nature Reviews Molecular Cell Biology | volume = 9 | issue = 7 | pages = 543\u2013556 | date = 21 May 2008 | pmid = 18496517 | doi = 10.1038/nrm2417 }}</ref>\n\nAlthough SNAREs vary considerably in structure and size, they all share a segment in their cytosolic domain called a SNARE [[Sequence motif|motif]] that consists of 60-70 amino acids and contains [[heptad repeat]]s that have the ability to form coiled-coil structures.  V- and t-SNAREs are capable of reversible assembly into tight, four-helix bundles called \"trans\"-SNARE complexes.  In synaptic vesicles, the readily-formed [[metastability in molecules|metastable]] \"trans\" complexes are composed of three SNAREs: [[syntaxin 1]] and [[SNAP-25]] resident in cell membrane and  [[synaptobrevin]] (also referred to as vesicle-incorporated membrane protein or VIMP) anchored in the vesicle membrane.\n\nIn [[neuron]]al exocytosis, [[syntaxin]] and [[synaptobrevin]] are anchored in respective membranes by their C-terminal domains, whereas [[SNAP-25]] is tethered to the plasma membrane via several cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains. The core ''trans''-SNARE complex is a four-<math>\\alpha</math>-helix bundle, where one <math>\\alpha</math>-helix is contributed by [[syntaxin 1]], one <math>\\alpha</math>-helix by synaptobrevin and two <math>\\alpha</math>-helices are contributed by [[SNAP-25]].\n\nThe [[plasma membrane]]-resident SNAREs have been shown to be present in distinct microdomains or clusters, the integrity of which is essential for the exocytotic competence of the cell.\n\n== Membrane fusion ==\n\n[[File:Zerolayer.png|frame|right|Layering of the core SNARE complex. In the center is the zero hydrophilic ionic layer, flanked by hydrophobic leucine-zipper layers.]]\n\nDuring membrane fusion, v-SNARE and t-SNARE proteins on separate membranes combine to form a trans-SNARE complex, also known as a \"SNAREpin\". Depending on the stage of fusion of the membranes, these complexes may be referred to differently.\n\nDuring fusion of ''trans''-SNARE complexes, the membranes merge and SNARE proteins involved in complex formation after fusion are then referred to as a \"''cis''\"-SNARE complex, because they now reside in a single (or ''cis'') resultant membrane. After fusion, the ''cis''-SNARE complex is bound and disassembled by an adaptor protein, [[NAPA (gene)|alpha-SNAP]].  Then, the hexameric [[ATPase]] (of the [[AAA proteins|AAA]] type) called [[N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein|NSF]] catalyzes the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent unfolding of the SNARE proteins and releases them into the cytosol for recycling.\n\nSNAREs are thought to be the core required components of the fusion machinery and can function independently of additional cytosolic accessory proteins.  This was demonstrated by engineering \"flipped\" SNAREs, where the SNARE domains face the extracellular space rather than the cytosol. When cells containing v-SNAREs contact cells containing t-SNAREs, ''trans''-SNARE complexes form and cell-cell fusion ensues.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hu C, Ahmed M, Melia TJ, S\u00f6llner TH, Mayer T, Rothman JE | title = Fusion of Cells by Flipped SNAREs | journal = Science | volume = 300 | issue = 5626 | pages = 1745\u20131749 | date = 13 June 2003 | pmid = 12805548 | doi = 10.1126/science.1084909 | url = https://semanticscholar.org/paper/0634617939c28a06d1b44d572a31bbc95df29687 }}</ref>\n\n== Components ==\n\nThe core SNARE complex is a 4-<math>\\alpha</math>-helix bundle.<ref name=\"sutton1998\">\n{{cite journal | vauthors = Sutton RB, Fasshauer D, Jahn R, Brunger AT | title = Crystal structure of a SNARE complex involved in synaptic exocytosis at 2.4 \u00c5 resolution | journal = Nature | volume = 395 | issue = 6700 | pages = 347\u2013353 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9759724 | doi = 10.1038/26412 | url = http://atb.slac.stanford.edu/public/papers.php?sendfile=66 }}\n</ref> Synaptobrevin and syntaxin contribute one <math>\\alpha</math>-helix each, while SNAP-25 participates with two <math>\\alpha</math>-helices (abbreviated as Sn1 and Sn2).

The process of bringing together two membranes requires input energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic forces between the membranes.  The mechanism that regulates the movement of membrane associated proteins away from the membrane contact zone prior to fusion is unknown, but the local increase in membrane curvature is thought to contribute in the process.  SNAREs generate energy through protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions which act as a driving force for membrane fusion.\n\nOne model hypothesizes that the force required to bring two [[Cell membranes|membranes]] together during [[Vesicle fusion|fusion]] comes from the [[conformational change]] in ''trans''-SNARE complexes to form ''cis''-SNARE complexes.  The current hypothesis that describes this process is referred to as SNARE \"zippering.\"<ref name=\"Chen_2001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YA, Scheller RH | title = SNARE-mediated membrane fusion | journal = Nat.

However, such a description fails to take into account the molecular dynamics of membrane lipids. Recent molecular simulations show that the close proximity of the membranes allows the lipids to splay, where a population of lipids insert their hydrophobic tails into the neighboring membrane - effectively keeping a \"foot\" in each membrane. The resolution of the splayed lipid state proceeds spontaneously to form the stalk structure. In this molecular view, the splayed-lipid intermediate state is the rate determining barrier rather than the formation of the stalk, which now becomes the free energy minimum. The energetic barrier for establishment of the splayed-lipid conformation is directly proportional to the intermembrane distance. The SNARE complexes and their pressing of the two membranes together, therefore, could provide the free energy required to overcome the barrier.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Risselada HJ, Grubm\u00fcller H | title = How SNARE molecules mediate membrane fusion: recent insights from molecular simulations. | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 187\u201396 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22365575 | doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2012.01.007| hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-000F-9AF7-9 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Disassembly ===\n\nThe energy input that is required for SNARE-mediated fusion to take place comes from SNARE-complex disassembly.

It is believed that the energy that drives [[Vesicle fusion|fusion]] is derived from the transition to a lower energy ''cis''-SNARE complex.  The ATP hydrolysis-coupled dissociation of SNARE complexes is an energy investment that can be compared to \"cocking the gun\" so that, once [[vesicle fusion]] is triggered, the process takes place [[Spontaneous process|spontaneously]] and at optimum velocity.

These SNAREs are the targets of the bacterial neurotoxins responsible for [[botulism]] and [[tetanus]].\n\n== Types ==\n\nSNAREs can be divided into two categories: ''vesicle'' or ''v-SNAREs'', which are incorporated into the membranes of transport vesicles during budding, and ''target'' or ''t-SNAREs'', which are associated with nerve terminal membranes.

Often, R-SNAREs act as v-SNAREs and Q-SNAREs act as t-SNAREs.  R-SNAREs are proteins that contribute an arginine (R) residue in the formation of the [[zero ionic layer]] in the assembled core SNARE complex. One particular R-SNARE is synaptobrevin, which is located in the synaptic vesicles. Q-SNAREs are proteins that contribute a glutamine (Q) residue in the formation of the zero ionic layer in the assembled core SNARE complex. Q-SNAREs include syntaxin and SNAP-25.  Q-SNAREs are further classified as Qa, Qb, or Qc depending on their location in the four-helix bundle.\n\n== Structure ==\n\nSNAREs are small, abundant, sometimes tail-anchored proteins which are often post-translationally inserted into membranes via a C-terminal [[transmembrane domain]].

V- and t-SNAREs are capable of reversible assembly into tight, four-helix bundles called \"trans\"-SNARE complexes.  In synaptic vesicles, the readily-formed [[metastability in molecules|metastable]] \"trans\" complexes are composed of three SNAREs: [[syntaxin 1]] and [[SNAP-25]] resident in cell membrane and  [[synaptobrevin]] (also referred to as vesicle-incorporated membrane protein or VIMP) anchored in the vesicle membrane.\n\nIn [[neuron]]al exocytosis, [[syntaxin]] and [[synaptobrevin]] are anchored in respective membranes by their C-terminal domains, whereas [[SNAP-25]] is tethered to the plasma membrane via several cysteine-linked palmitoyl chains.

Depending on the stage of fusion of the membranes, these complexes may be referred to differently.\n\nDuring fusion of ''trans''-SNARE complexes, the membranes merge and SNARE proteins involved in complex formation after fusion are then referred to as a \"''cis''\"-SNARE complex, because they now reside in a single (or ''cis'') resultant membrane. After fusion, the ''cis''-SNARE complex is bound and disassembled by an adaptor protein, alphaSNAP.  Then, the hexameric [[ATPase]] (of the [[AAA proteins|AAA]] type) called [[N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion protein|NSF]] catalyzes the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]]-dependent unfolding of the SNARE proteins and releases them into the cytosol for recycling.\n\nSNAREs are thought to be the core required components of the fusion machinery and can function independently of additional cytosolic accessory proteins.

One hypothesis suggests that, during SNARE-complex assembly, the Munc18 clasp releases closed syntaxin, remains associated with the [[N-terminal|N-terminal peptide]] of syntaxin (allowing association of the syntaxin SNARE domain with other SNARE proteins), and then reattaches to the newly formed four-helix SNARE complex.<ref name=\"S\u00fcdhof_2009\">{{cite journal | vauthors = S\u00fcdhof TC, Rothman JE | title = Membrane fusion: grappling with SNARE and SM proteins | journal = Science | volume = 323 | issue = 5913 | pages = 474\u20137 |date=January 2009  | pmid = 19164740 | pmc = 3736821 | doi = 10.1126/science.1161748 }}</ref>   This possible mechanism of dissociation and subsequent re-association with the SNARE domains could be calcium-dependent.<ref name=\"Jahn_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jahn R, Fasshauer D | title = Molecular machines governing exocytosis of synaptic vesicles | journal = Nature | volume = 490 | issue = 7419 | pages = 201\u20137 | year = 2012 | pmid = 23060190 | doi = 10.1038/nature11320 | pmc=4461657}}</ref> This supports the idea that Munc18 plays a key regulatory role in [[vesicle fusion]]; under normal conditions the SNARE complex will be prevented from forming by Munc18, but when triggered the Munc18 will actually assist in SNARE-complex assembly and thereby act as a fusion [[catalyst]].<ref name=\"S\u00fcdhof_2009\"/>\n\n=== Zippering and fusion pore opening===\n\n[[File:Opening of a Fusion Pore during Exocytosis.png|thumb|right | This figure provides a simple overview of the interaction of SNARE proteins with vesicles during exocytosis.

The process of bringing together two membranes requires input energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic forces between the membranes.  The mechanism that regulates the movement of membrane associated proteins away from the membrane contact zone prior to fusion is unknown, but the local increase in membrane curvature is thought to contribute in the process.  SNAREs generate energy through protein-lipid and protein-protein interactions which act as a driving force for membrane fusion.\n\nOne model hypothesizes that the force required to bring two [[Cell membranes|membranes]] together during [[Vesicle fusion|fusion]] comes from the [[conformational change]] in ''trans''-SNARE complexes to form ''cis''-SNARE complexes.  The current hypothesis that describes this process is referred to as SNARE \"zippering.\"<ref name=\"Chen_2001\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Chen YA, Scheller RH | title = SNARE-mediated membrane fusion | journal = Nat.

As the SNARE domains continue coiling in a [[spontaneous process]], they form a much tighter, more stable four-helix bundle.  During this \"zippering\" of the SNARE complex, a fraction of the released energy from binding is thought to be stored as molecular bending stress in the individual SNARE motifs.

However, such a description fails to take into account the molecular dynamics of membrane lipids. Recent molecular simulations show that the close proximity of the membranes allows the lipids to splay, where a population of lipids insert their hydrophobic tails into the neighboring membrane - effectively keeping a \"foot\" in each membrane. The resolution of the splayed lipid state proceeds spontaneously to form the stalk structure. In this molecular view, the splayed-lipid intermediate state is the rate determining barrier rather than the formation of the stalk, which now becomes the free energy minimum. The energetic barrier for establishment of the splayed-lipid conformation is directly proportional to the intermembrane distance. The SNARE complexes and their pressing of the two membranes together, therefore, could provide the free energy required to overcome the barrier.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Risselada HJ, Grubm\u00fcller H | title = How SNARE molecules mediate membrane fusion: recent insights from molecular simulations. | journal = Current Opinion in Structural Biology | volume = 22 | issue = 2 | pages = 187\u201396 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 22365575 | doi=10.1016/j.sbi.2012.01.007| hdl = 11858/00-001M-0000-000F-9AF7-9 | hdl-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Disassembly ===\n\nThe energy input that is required for SNARE-mediated fusion to take place comes from SNARE-complex disassembly.

It is believed that the energy that drives [[Vesicle fusion|fusion]] is derived from the transition to a lower energy ''cis''-SNARE complex.  The ATP hydrolysis-coupled dissociation of SNARE complexes is an energy investment that can be compared to \"cocking the gun\" so that, once [[vesicle fusion]] is triggered, the process takes place [[Spontaneous process|spontaneously]] and at optimum velocity.

During [[neurosecretion]]/[[exocytosis]], SNAREs play a crucial role in vesicle docking, priming, fusion, and synchronization of neurotransmitter release into the [[synaptic cleft]].\n\nThe first step in synaptic vesicle fusion is tethering, where the vesicles are translocated from the [[Synaptic vesicle|reserve pool]] into physical contact with the membrane. At the membrane, [[Munc-18]] is initially bound to [[syntaxin 1A]] in a closed structure. It is postulated that the dissociation of Munc-18 from the complex frees syntaxin 1A to bind with the v-SNARE proteins.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Shi L, K\u00fcmmel D, Coleman J, Melia TJ, Giraudo CG | title = Dual roles of Munc18-1 rely on distinct binding modes of the central cavity with Stx1A and SNARE complex. | journal = Molecular Biology of the Cell | volume = 22 | issue = 21 | pages = 4150\u201360 | date = November 2011 | pmid = 21900493 | doi=10.1091/mbc.e11-02-0150 | pmc=3204075}}</ref> The next step in release is the docking of vesicles, where the v- and t-SNARE proteins transiently associate in a calcium-independent manner. The vesicles are then primed, wherein the SNARE [[protein motif|motifs]] form a stable interaction between the vesicle and membrane. [[Complexin]]s stabilize the primed SNARE-complex rendering the vesicles ready for rapid exocytosis.\n\nThe span of presynaptic membrane containing the primed vesicles and dense collection of SNARE proteins is referred to as the [[active zone]]. [[Voltage-gated calcium channels]] are highly concentrated around active zones and open in response to membrane [[depolarization]] at the synapse. The influx of calcium is sensed by [[synaptotagmin 1]], which in turn dislodges complexin protein and allows the vesicle to fuse with the presynaptic membrane to release neurotransmitter. It has also been shown that the voltage-gated calcium channels directly interact with the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1A and SNAP-25, as well as with synaptotagmin 1. The interactions are able to inhibit calcium channel activity as well as tightly aggregate the molecules around the release site.<ref name = \"Ramakrishnan_2012\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Ramakrishnan NA, Drescher MJ, Drescher DG | title = The SNARE complex in neuronal and sensory cells. | journal = Molecular and Cellular Neurosciences | volume = 50 | issue = 1 | pages = 58\u201369 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22498053 | doi = 10.1016/j.mcn.2012.03.009 | pmc=3570063}}</ref>\n\nThere have been many clinical cases that link SNARE genes with neural disorders.

During [[autophagy]], portions of the [[cytoplasm]] are engulfed by a cup-shaped double-membrane structure called a phagophore and eventually become the contents of the fully assembled autophagosome.  Autophagosome biogenesis requires the initiation and growth of phagophores, a process that was once thought to occur through de novo addition of lipids.  However, recent evidence suggests that the lipids that contribute to the growing phagophores originate from numerous sources of membrane, including [[endoplasmic reticulum]], [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], [[plasma membrane]], and [[mitochondria]].<ref name=\"Moreau_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moreau K, Ravikumar B, Renna M, Puri C, Rubinsztein DC | title = Autophagosome Precursor Maturation Requires Homotypic Fusion | journal = Cell | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 303\u2013317 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21784250 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.023 | pmc=3171170}}</ref>  SNAREs play important roles in mediating vesicle fusion during phagophore initiation and expansion as well as autophagosome-lysosome fusion in the later stages of autophagy.\n\nThough the mechanism of phagophore initiation in mammals is unknown, SNAREs have been implicated in phagophore formation through homotypic fusion of small, [[clathrin]]-coated, single-membrane vesicles containing Atg16L, the v-SNARE [[SYBL1|VAMP7]], and its partner t-SNAREs: [[STX7|Syntaxin-7]], [[STX8|Syntaxin-8]], and [[VTI1B]].<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ravikumar B, Moreau K, Jahreiss L, Puri C, Rubinsztein DC | title = Plasma membrane contributes to the formation of pre-autophagosomal structures | journal = Nature Cell Biology | volume = 12 | issue = 8 | pages = 747\u2013757 | date = 18 July 2010 | pmid = 20639872 | doi = 10.1038/ncb2078 | pmc=2923063}}</ref>  In yeast, the t-SNAREs Sec9p and Sso2p are required for exocytosis and promote tubulovesicular budding of Atg9 positive vesicles, which are also required for autophagosome biogenesis.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Abeliovich |first1=Hagai |title=Cytoplasm to vacuole trafficking of aminopeptidase I requires a t-SNARE/Sec1 complex composed of Tlg2 and Vps45 |journal=EMBO Journal |date=1999 |volume=18 |issue=21 |pages=6005\u20136016 |pmid=10545112 |doi=10.1093/emboj/18.21.6005 |pmc=1171666}}</ref><ref name=\"Nair_2011\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Nair U, Jotwani A, Geng J, Gammoh N, Richerson D, Yen WL, Griffith J, Nag S, Wang K, Moss T, Baba M, McNew JA, Jiang X, Reggiori F, Melia TJ, Klionsky DJ | title = SNARE Proteins Are Required for Macroautophagy | journal = Cell | volume = 146 | issue = 2 | pages = 290\u2013302 | date = July 2011 | pmid = 21784249 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2011.06.022 | pmc=3143362}}</ref>  Knocking out either of these SNAREs leads to accumulation of small Atg9 containing vesicles that do not fuse, therefore preventing the formation of the pre-autophagosomal structure.<ref name=\"Nair_2011\"/>\n\nIn addition to phagophore assembly, SNAREs are also important in mediating autophagosome-lysosome fusion.
