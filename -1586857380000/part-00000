A main element of this was the implementation of a land reform programs designed to change the ownership structure of agricultural land. The first step in land reform started in the early 1950s.

Before the land reform, 70% of the arable land was owned by a small elite of large landowners or religious foundations. There was no official land register yet rather the land ownership was documented by means of title deeds whereby the document did not represent a specific measured area of land but a village and the land belonging to the village. Before the land reform 50% of Iranian agricultural land was in the hands of large landowners, 20% belonged to charitable or religious foundations, 10% was owned by the state or owned by the crown and only 20% belonged to free farmers. Before the land reform began 18,000 villages had been recorded of which the land would be divided among the farmers living in the village<ref>{{Cite book |last=Diba-Pahlavi |first=Farah |title=An enduring love |publisher=Bergisch-Gladbach |year=2004 |pages=135}}</ref>.\n\n[[File:WhiteRevolution.jpg|thumb|right|The Shah distributed land titles as part of the White Revolution]]\n\n===First Attempts===\nShah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi had spoken of the need for land reform for many years but the clergy resistance had repeatedly led him to postpone the reform. At the end of the reign of Prime Minister [[Manouchehr Eghbal]] the then Minister of Agriculture, Jamshid Amusegar, submitted a bill on land reform to the parliament. It was, however, diluted by the representatives of the big landowners in Parliament. Despite this the measure was adopted on the 6 June 1960 and was the first attempt at land reform. It though did not lead to a fundamental redistribution of land ownership in Iran. On 11 November 11 1961 the Shah commissioned Prime Minister [[Ali Amini]] to develop proposals for the implementation of the planned land reform program. On 14 November 14 1961 Amini declared that the Shah had given him special powers to implement the reform program. [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] MPs massively criticized Amini so Amini ultimately arrested the leaders of the reform critics. In January 1962 he assigned his Minister of Agriculture Hassan Arsanjanito to revise the 1960 Land Reform Act. From now on the large landowners were only allowed to own one village. They had to sell the rest of their land to the state which in turn was to sell it to the landless farmers at a significantly lower price. The state also granted farmers cheap loans when they formed agricultural cooperatives<ref>{{Cite book |title=The U.S.-Soviet confrontation in Iran, 1945\u20131962 |last=Kristen  |first=Blake |publisher=University Press of America |year=2009 |pages=155}}</ref>..\n\n===White Revolution===\nMohammad Reza Schah wanted to promote Iranian economic and social reform in a coordinated reform project which become the [[White Revolution]]. After Amini's resignation, the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Asadollah Alam]] was commissioned to legislate the reforms. In January 1963 the Minister of Agriculture, Arsanjani, drafted an amendment to the Land Reform Law which was intended to put an end to the Iranian feudal system which still existed during the Qajar period.

It became clear that the White Revolution program, and especially land reform, against the resistance of the large landowners and the clergy could only be implemented if it were supported by the vast majority of the Iranian population. For this reason the Shah planned a referendum in which Iranian citizens should vote on whether they would approve or reject the reform plans.

It first aired on television on May 27, 2008. The episode name is a [[Latin]] term (it translates as \"[[Sine qua non|without which [there is] nothing]]\") referring to something essential that cannot be done without. The survivor count shown in the title sequence is 39,674.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode continues from the previous episode \"[[Guess What's Coming to Dinner?]]\" with the injured [[Cylon (reimagining)|Cylon]] [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Natalie]] being taken to the sickbay. Despite Doctor Cottle's best efforts, Natalie's wounds prove to be fatal. Natalie dies while projecting a forest for comfort. As a gesture of kindness, Doctor Cottle holds her hand as she dies as well. President [[Laura Roslin]] visits the Basestar accompanied by half of the pilots. After the hybrid is plugged in, the [[Cylon Basestar|Basestar]] immediately jumps away to unknown coordinates. The Quorum must find a replacement for Roslin, who is assumed kidnapped. The Quorum can elect a temporary president, so [[Lee Adama]] solicits the help of a reluctant [[Romo Lampkin]] in choosing the best candidate.\n\nAdmiral Adama questions Lt. [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon]] in his quarters regarding why she shot Natalie. Athena confesses to Adama about the visions she had of Natalie and [[Gaius Baltar]] taking away her half-human, half-Cylon child, [[Hera Agathon|Hera]]. She is sent to the brig.\n\nAdmiral Adama must now both protect the fleet and find the rebel Basestar with Roslin and his troops on board. He orders Colonel [[Saul Tigh]] to interrogate [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)#Caprica Six|Caprica-Six]] in the brig to try to get information from her about the Cylon hub. Tigh's interrogation/liaison is interrupted when a badly damaged missing [[Colonial Raptor|Raptor]] jumps into contact range. The raptor's flight data recorder shows where its jump had originated. A raptor scouting mission to those coordinates finds the remains of a battle with a destroyed Cylon Basestar, Viper and what is assumed to be the hub. Adama does not believe the destroyed Basestar was the rebels' ship with Roslin on board, and he orders four Raptors to remain there in case it returns.\n\nAdmiral Adama meets with Colonel Tigh in his cabin and confronts him with the information that he knows about Tigh's \"meetings\" with Caprica-Six in the brig with the cameras turned off. Adama reveals to Tigh that Caprica-Six is pregnant. Tigh, in shock, does not deny that he is the father; Adama accuses him of betrayal.  Tigh in turn accuses Adama of risking the whole fleet by searching for Roslin. Angers explode and a short but brutal fight ensues between the two men, but the old friends soon stop and accept their unusual emotional predicaments. Adama remarks after the squabble, in which the model ship is broken, \"Do you know how many times I have had to repair this thing?\"\n  \nAll the names on the list of potential presidential candidates have been eliminated, but Lampkin realizes that there is only one person who could possibly replace Roslin, even if that person's name was not on the list. After finding Lee, Romo congratulates him on his successful candidacy, but Lee explains he was never a candidate. Lampkin does not listen and pulls a gun on him. Lampkin is distraught because he lost his wife during the attack on the colonies and does not believe humanity deserves to have a president who gives such hope as Lee would.  Lee Adama convinces Lampkin that there is hope and that he will make a difference.  Lee is sworn in as acting President.\n\nAdmiral Adama will no longer risk his remaining pilots or the fleet in looking for Roslin, and hands over command of the Galactica to Tigh. The Admiral takes a Raptor and remains behind.
