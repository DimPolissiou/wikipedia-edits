Due to his father's profession he moved several times within Nigeria and later moved to England. D'banj was expected to follow his father's military career and was enrolled to the [[Nigerian Military School]] at age eleven. However, D'banj resisted the system and disenrolled from the school after three years. While at the Military school he was a member of the elite drum corp of the Nigerian Army. From the Nigerian Military School he proceeded to another military owned institution Nigerian Navy Secondary School, Ibara, Abeokuta where he was a church worker. There he completed his secondary school education.<ref name=moh>He also stayed in India for a while with his father.[http://www.dbanjrecords.com/about-dbanj/ Biography of D'banj]. dbanjrecords.com. Retrieved on 7 July 2012.</ref>\n\n===Musical beginning===\nD'banj was introduced to the harmonica by his late older brother, Femi Oyebanjo, who died in a plane crash at age seventeen.<ref name=\"moh\" /> With D'banj's love for music being greater than his parents' military aspirations, he struggled for his parents' approval; this can be best heard through an album track, ''All Da Way'' from his debut album.<ref name=\"mtveurope\" />\n\nFollowing the death of his 17-year-old brother, D'banj arranged all his possessions on his bed after they were brought home and just picked up his harmonica. I'd play it to remember him.\" Later, at university, he realised the potential of his new skills with the instrument. \"I'd go to the female hostel after lectures, and even if there was no electricity I could play there.\" He remembers learning Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" after Titanic came out \u2013 \"and that got me a lot of girls!\"\n\nD'banj then proceeded to study study mechanical engineering at the [[Lagos State University]] to, but due to the constant strikes and several irregularities in the school he decided to withdraw.\nPlans to continue his studies as a mechanical engineer in London were derailed when he arrived in the UK in 2001, and met [[Don Jazzy]] who was trying to make it as a songwriter and producer. D'Banj started hanging around the studio, making ends meet while working as a security guard. \"It was OK, because I did nights,\" he says, \"so I could listen to music on my headphones.\"\n\nDon Jazzy told D'Banj he thought he was a star in the making, and sensing that the music scene in Nigeria was \"blossoming\", the pair returned to Lagos in 2004. That same year came the single \"Tongolo\"; the video was paid for by D'Banj's mother. It became an instant hit,and gained wide acclaim across the country. His first endorsement was with an energy drink called Power Fist.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/23/d-banj-interview-nigerian-music-star I'm with D'Banj | Music].

Due to his father's profession he moved several times within Nigeria and later moved to England. D'banj was expected to follow his father's military career and was enrolled to the [[Nigerian Military School]] at age eleven. However, D'banj resisted the system and disenrolled from the school after three years. While at the Military school he was a member of the elite drum corp of the Nigerian Army. From the Nigerian Military School he proceeded to another military owned institution Nigerian Navy Secondary School, Ibara, Abeokuta where he was a church worker. There he completed his secondary school education.<ref name=moh>He also stayed in India for a while with his father.[http://www.dbanjrecords.com/about-dbanj/ Biography of D'banj]. dbanjrecords.com. Retrieved on 7 July 2012.</ref>\n\n===Musical beginning===\nD'banj was introduced to the harmonica by his late older brother, Femi Oyebanjo, who died in a plane crash at age seventeen.<ref name=\"moh\" /> With D'banj's love for music being greater than his parents' military aspirations, he struggled for his parents' approval; this can be best heard through an album track, ''All Da Way'' from his debut album.<ref name=\"mtveurope\" />\n\nFollowing the death of his 17-year-old brother, D'banj arranged all his possessions on his bed after they were brought home and just picked up his harmonica. I'd play it to remember him.\" Later, at university, he realised the potential of his new skills with the instrument. \"I'd go to the female hostel after lectures, and even if there was no electricity I could play there.\" He remembers learning Celine Dion's \"My Heart Will Go On\" after Titanic came out \u2013 \"and that got me a lot of girls!\"\n\nD'banj then proceeded to study study mechanical engineering at the [[Lagos State University]] to, but due to the constant strikes and several irregularities in the school he decided to withdraw.\nPlans to continue his studies as a mechanical engineer in London were derailed when he arrived in the UK in 2001, and met [[Don Jazzy]] who was trying to make it as a songwriter and producer. D'Banj started hanging around the studio, making ends meet while working as a security guard. \"It was OK, because I did nights,\" he says, \"so I could listen to music on my headphones.\"\n\nDon Jazzy told D'Banj he thought he was a star in the making, and sensing that the music scene in Nigeria was \"blossoming\", the pair returned to Lagos in 2004. That same year came the single \"Tongolo\"; the video was paid for by D'Banj's mother. It became an instant hit,and gained wide acclaim across the country. His first endorsement was with an energy drink called Power Fist.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/23/d-banj-interview-nigerian-music-star I'm with D'Banj | Music].

D'banj's debut success led to collaborations with other artists, including [[Darey|Dare Art Alade]] and Ikechukwu.

The site was occupied by a sizable agricultural population by the 1st century. The bulk of Coba's major construction seems to have been made in the middle and late Classic period, about 500 to 900 AD, with most of the dated hieroglyphic inscriptions from the 7th century (see [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]]).  However, Coba remained an important site in the Post-Classic era and new temples were built and old ones kept in repair until at least the 14th century, possibly as late as the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|arrival of the Spanish]].\n\nThe Mayan site of Coba was set up with multiple residential\nareas that consisted of around 15 houses in clusters. All clusters were connected by sacbeobs, or elevated walkways.\n\nSix major linear features were found at the Coba site. The first feature that was often found at Coba was the platforms that were connecting the clusters to the sacbeobs. These were found at almost every single cluster of houses. Single or doubled faced features that were found around the majority of the household clusters. These were often linked to the platforms that led to the sacbeobs. A lot of features found tended to connect to something or lead to something but the other end was left open-ended. Coba has many features that are platforms or on platforms. The last major linear feature that was constantly found was sacbeob-like paths that were someway associated with natural resources of the area\n\n== Sacbeob ==\nSacbeob (Mayan plural of sacbe), or sacbes, were very common at the Coba site. They are raised pathways, usually stone paths at this site, that connected the clusters of residential areas to the main center of the site and the water sources.These paths were the connecting points to most things at the Coba site. They were the major feature discovered and preserved. Sacbeobs were the main reason why maps of Coba could be created. The sacbeobs were one of the ways they figured out how to excavate the site and transect the area. The sacbes were used to help determine the size of Coba.\n\n==History==\nArchaeological evidence indicates that Cob\u00e1 was first settled between 50 BC and 100 AD. At that time, there was a town with buildings of wood and palm fronts and flat platforms. The only archaeological evidence of the time are fragments of pottery. After 100 AD, the area around Coba evidenced strong population growth, and with it an increase in its social and political status among Maya city states which would ultimately  make Coba one of the biggest and most powerful city states in the northern Yucat\u00e1n area. Between 201 and 601 AD, Coba must have dominated a vast area, including the north of the state of Quintana Roo and areas in the east of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. This power resided in its control of large swaths of farmland, control over trading routes, and \u2014 critically for a Mayan city \u2014 control over ample water resources. Among the trading routes, Coba probably controlled ports like [[Xelha|Xel H\u00e1]].\n\nCoba must have maintained close contacts with the large city states of [[Guatemala]] and the south of [[Campeche City|Campeche]] like [[Tikal]], [[Dzibanche]], or [[Calakmul]]. To maintain its influence, Coba must have established military alliances and arranged marriages among their elites. It is quite noteworthy that Coba shows traces of [[Teotihuacan]] architecture, like a platform in the Paintings group that was explored in 1999, which would attest of the existence of contacts with the central Mexican cultures and its powerful city of the early Classic epoch. [[Stele|Stelae]] uncovered at Coba are believed to depict that Coba had many [[Queen regnant|female rulers]].\n\nAfter 600 AD, the emergence of powerful city states of the [[Puuc]] culture and the emergence of [[Chichen Itza|Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] altered the political spectrum in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and began eroding the dominance of Coba. Beginning around 900 or 1000 AD, Coba must have begun a lengthy power struggle with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, with the latter dominating at the end as it gained control of key cities such as [[Yaxun\u00e1]]. After 1000 AD, Coba lost much of its political weight among city states, although it maintained some symbolic and religious importance. This allowed it to maintain or recover some status, which is evidenced by the new buildings dating to the time 1200-1500 AD, now built in the typical Eastern coastal style. However, power centers and trading routes had moved to the coast, forcing cities like Coba into a secondary status, although somewhat more successful than its more ephemeral enemy Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Coba was abandoned at the time the Spanish conquered the peninsula around 1550.\n\n==Highlights: Exploration and Artifacts==\n[[Image:Pyramide du Grupo Coba dite l'\u00e9glise (8452064401).jpg|right|thumb|Front view of the pyramid structure known as \"La Iglesia\" in the Group B, or Cob\u00e1 Group, complex. Stela 11 is in the foreground at the base of the pyramid's steps, under the thatched roofing.]]\nThe first mention of Coba in print is due to [[John Lloyd Stephens]] where he mentioned hearing reports of the site in 1842 from the cura (priest or vicar in Spanish) of Chemax, but it was so distant from any known modern road or village that he decided the difficulty in trying to get there was too daunting and returned to his principal target of exploring Tulum instead.<ref>Stephens (1843)</ref> For much of the rest of the 19th century the area could not be visited by outsiders due to the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]], the notable exception was Juan Pe\u00f3n Contreras (also used the nom de plume Contreras Elizalde) who was then director of the Museum of Yucat\u00e1n. He made the arduous journey in September 1882, and is now remembered for the four naive pen-and-ink sketches that he made at the ruins (prints made from them exist in the Peabody Museum and in the collection of Ra\u00fal Pav\u00f3n Abreu in Campeche). [[Teoberto Maler]] paid Coba a short visit in 1893 and took at least one photograph, but did not publish at the time and the site remained unknown to the archeological community.<ref>''Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions. 8,1; Coba.'' 1997. Corpus of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions, / Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University ; Vol. 8, P. 1. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Pr..</ref>\n\nAmateur explorer (and successful writer of popular books wherein he described his adventures and discoveries among Maya ruins) Dr. [[Thomas Gann]] was brought to the site by some local Maya hunters in February 1926. Gann published the first first-hand description of the ruins later the same year.<ref>Gann (1926)</ref>  Dr. Gann gave a short description to the archeologists of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] (CIW) project at [[Chichen Itza]], he spoke of the large mounds he had sighted, but not visited for lack of time, lying to  the northeast of the main group. It was to examine these that Alfred Kidder and  went for a two-day inspection of the site in March. Two months later Thompson was again at Coba, forming with Jean Charlot the third CIW expedition. On this trip their guide, Carmen Chai, showed them the \"Macanxoc Group\", a discovery that led to the departure of a fourth expedition, since [[Sylvanus Morley]] wanted Thompson to show him the new stelae.<ref>Morley (1926) pp. 259-286</ref> Eric Thompson made a number of return visits to the site through 1932, the same year he published a detailed description.<ref>Thompson, Pollock, Charlot, Kislak Collection (1932)</ref>\n\nIn 1932 H. B. Roberts opened a number of trenches in Group B to collect [[sherds]]<ref>Brainerd (1958) p 10</ref>\n\nIn 1948 two graduate students in archaeology, William and [[Michael D. Coe|Michael Coe]], visited Coba, intent on seeking the terminus of Sacbe 15. They were unaware that E. Wyllys Andrews IV already reported it ten years prior. In an editor's note following their report<ref>Coe and Coe (1949)</ref> Thompson blames himself as editor for failing to detect the repetition of prior work in their contribution, while excusing the young authors for ignorance of a paper published in a foreign journal. But the Coes reported the previously unknown Sacbes 18 and 19 and mapped the large mound at the terminus of Sacbe 17, which they named Pech Mul (they were unlucky again in failing to complete their circuit of its platform, or they might have discovered the sacbe leading out of it, no. 21).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/cmhi/site.php?site=Coba|title=Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions|website=Peabody.harvard.edu|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe site remained little visited due to its remoteness until the first modern road was opened up to Coba in the early 1970s. As a major resort was planned for [[Canc\u00fan]], it was realized that clearing and restoring some of the large site could make it an important tourist attraction. The Mexican [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology & History (INAH)]] began some archeological excavations in 1972 directed by Carlos Navarrete, and consolidated a couple of buildings. Expectations of new discoveries were borne out when El Cono (Structure D-6) and Grupo Las Pinturas came to light, among other features. In the same year, much of Grupo Coba was cleared on the instructions of Ra\u00fal Pav\u00f3n Abreu; not even its tall [[Brosimum alicastrum|ram\u00f3n trees]] were spared.\n\nIn 1975 a branch road from the asphalted highway being built from Tulum to Nuevo X-Can reached Coba (the road engineers heeded objections by archaeologists and abandoned their original plan of incorporating Sacbe 3 in the roadbed). A project camp was built in 1973, and in 1974 the Project Coba proper, under the auspices of the Regional Center of the Southeast of INAH was able to begin its operations.  During the three-year existence of the project, portions of the site were cleared and structures excavated and consolidated, (the Castillo and the Pinturas Group by Peniche; the Iglesia by Benavides and Jaime Gardu\u00f1o; El Cono by Benavides and Fernando Robles); the sacbes were investigated by Folan and by Benavides, who added 26 to the list of 19 previously known; the ceramics from test pits and trenches were studied by Robles;<ref>Robles Castellanos (1980)</ref> and Jaime Gardu\u00f1o<ref>Gardu\u00f1o Argueta (1979)</ref> surveyed two [[transects]] of the site, one of 10&nbsp;km north-south and another of 5&nbsp;km east-west.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s another road to Coba was opened up and paved, and a regular bus service begun.  Coba became a tourist destination shortly thereafter, with many visitors flocking to the site on day trips from Canc\u00fan and the [[Riviera Maya]].  Only a small portion of the site has been cleared from the jungle and restored by archaeologists.\n\n{{As of|2005}} the resident population of Coba pueblo was 1,167.<ref>2005 census</ref> It grew to 1,278 by the 2010 census.\n\n== Economy ==\nIn the past, the people of Coba had traded extensively with other Mayan communities, particularly the ones further south along the [[Caribbean]] coast in what is now [[Belize]] and [[Honduras]].  It utilized the ports of [[Xcaret]], [[Xel-H\u00e1]], Tankah, [[Muyil]], and [[Tulum]] as well as the many sacbeob that sprout from this cultural center.  Typical items of trade of the Mayans of this area were:  salt, fish, squash, yams, corn, honey, beans, turkey, vegetables, chocolate drinks and raw materials such as limestone, marble, and jade.<ref>Coe and Kislak (1966)</ref>  There was specialization in different areas on the site which were because of who was living and working where and what their trade was. Almost all of the commerce was controlled by wealthy merchants.  These merchants used cacao beans for currency, and the beans had a fixed market price.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mayan System of Transportation|url = http://mayaincaaztec.com/masyoftr.html|website = mayaincaaztec.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190809172955/http://mayaincaaztec.com/masyoftr.html|archive-date = 2019-08-09|url-status = dead}}</ref>   Today's economy is based on the rising popularity of tourism to the archaeological site.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cob\u00e1 archaeological site is home to the tallest pyramid in the Yucatan|url = http://gomexico.about.com/od/ancientsites/a/coba-ruins.htm|website = About.com Travel|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:La pyramide Nohoch Mul (8453085740).jpg|thumb|Nohoch Mul Pyramid, Cob\u00e1.]]\n[[File:Coba.ogg|thumb|250px|Cob\u00e1 video]] \nThe archaeological site of Coba received 702,749 visitors in 2017.<ref name=visitors>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estad\u00edstica de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021202/http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |archive-date=8 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of Coba's main attractions is the Ancient Pyramid which, unlike [[Chichen Itza]]'s [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Kukulkan Pyramid]], is still open for the public to climb its 130 steps up to the top of the site.\n\nThere are also three hotels, one campsite and seven restaurants scattered throughout the site and there is a small pueblo near the ruins, with some restaurants and small shops selling local crafts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The 5 Best Coba Restaurants - TripAdvisor|url = http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g499447-Coba_Yucatan_Peninsula.html|website = www.tripadvisor.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Best Coba Hotels - TripAdvisor|url = http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g499447-Coba_Yucatan_Peninsula-Hotels.html|website = www.tripadvisor.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOutlined are the important artifacts and structures that can be viewed and experienced within the ruins of Coba:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cob\u00e1 Ruins \u2013 Tulum|url = https://www.locogringo.com/mexico/ways-to-play/mayan-ruins-archaeological-sites/coba-ruins/|website = LocoGringo|date = 2013-06-11|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n* Nohoch Mul Pyramid - A 42 meters tall (137 feet) pyramid that boasts a remarkable view of the Yucat\u00e1n and non-public areas of Coba including both             lagoons;  Macanxoc Lagoon to the east and Cob\u00e1 Lagoon to the southwest.\n* Coba Group -This is a series of structures close to the entrance that include the Iglesia (the Church) and one of two ball courts located in this site.\n* Conjunto de Pinturas -The focus of this area is the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel where visitors can see from afar actual paintings on the top temple.\n* Macanxoc Group - Past the Conjunto de Pinturas is the Macanxoc Group that is found following one of the Sacbes.

These roads range in width from 10 to 30 feet and were built by the Maya for commerce. The longest is 62&nbsp;km/100&nbsp;km and fifty others have been discovered. Such construction is believed to be more difficult than that invested into stone buildings and temples. Although Mayans were aware that the wheel existed, historians have documented that they had not yet implemented it. Most transportation along sacbes was done in the cool temperatures of night. The white limestone provided a natural guide when illuminated by moonlight.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n== Climate ==\nConsidered a tropical savanna climate typically with a pronounced dry season.

The site is the nexus of the largest network of stone causeways of the ancient Mayan world, and it contains many engraved and sculpted [[stelae]] that document ceremonial life and important events of the Late Classic Period (AD 600\u2013900) of [[Mesoamerica]]n civilization.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|title = Coba {{!}} ancient city, Mexico|url = http://www.britannica.com/place/Coba|website = Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>  The adjacent modern village bearing the same name, reported a population of 1,278 inhabitants in the 2010 Mexican federal census.<ref>[http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 2010 census tables: INEGI] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502025339/http://mapserver.inegi.org.mx/mgn2k/?s=geo&c=1223 |date=May 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\n==Site Layout and Description==\n[[Image:Cobamap.png|left|thumb|Map of the Cob\u00e1 archeological site.]]\n\nThe ruins of Coba lie 44&nbsp;km (approx. 27&nbsp;mi) northwest of [[Tulum, Quintana Roo|Tulum]], in the State of [[Quintana Roo]], Mexico. The geographical coordinates of Coba Group (main entrance for tourist area of the archaeological site) are North 19\u00b0 29.6\u2019 and West 87\u00b0 43.7\u2019. The archaeological zone is reached by a two-kilometer branch from the asphalt road connecting Tulum with Nuevo Xc\u00e1n (a community of [[L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, Quintana Roo|L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas]], another municipality of Quintana Roo) on the [[Valladolid, Yucat\u00e1n|Valladolid]] to Canc\u00fan highway.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url = https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/cmhi/site.php?site=Coba|title = Coba|date = |accessdate =3 December 2017 |website =Peabody.harvard.edu |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>\n\nCoba is located around two lagoons, [[Coba Lake|Lake Coba]] and [[Lake Macanxoc]].  A series of elevated stone and plaster roads radiate from the central site to various smaller sites near and far. These are known by the Maya term ''[[sacbe]]'' (plural ''sacbeob'') or white road. Some of these causeways go east, and the longest runs over {{Convert|100|km|mi}} westwards to the site of [[Yaxuna]]. The site contains a group of large [[Mesoamerican pyramid|temple pyramids]] known as the ''Nohoch Mul'', the tallest of which, Ixmoja, is some {{Convert|42|m|ft}} in height.<ref>Folan et. al. 1983</ref>  Ixmoja is among the tallest pyramids on the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula, exceeded by [[Calakmul]] at {{Convert|45|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Calakmul - The Ultimate Guide to the Mayan Ruins - The Ultimate Guide|url=http://mayanruins.info/mexico/calakmul-mexico/|website=Mayanruins.info|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nCoba was estimated to have had some 50,000 inhabitants (and possibly significantly more) at its peak of civilization, and the built up area extends over some 80&nbsp;km\u00b2. The site was occupied by a sizable agricultural population by the 1st century. The bulk of Coba's major construction seems to have been made in the middle and late Classic period, about 500 to 900 AD, with most of the dated hieroglyphic inscriptions from the 7th century (see [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar]]).  However, Coba remained an important site in the Post-Classic era and new temples were built and old ones kept in repair until at least the 14th century, possibly as late as the [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n|arrival of the Spanish]].\n\nThe Mayan site of Coba was set up with multiple residential\nareas that consisted of around 15 houses in clusters. All clusters were connected by sacbeobs, or elevated walkways.\n\nSix major linear features were found at the Coba site. The first feature that was often found at Coba was the platforms that were connecting the clusters to the sacbeobs. These were found at almost every single cluster of houses. Single or doubled faced features that were found around the majority of the household clusters. These were often linked to the platforms that led to the sacbeobs. A lot of features found tended to connect to something or lead to something but the other end was left open-ended. Coba has many features that are platforms or on platforms. The last major linear feature that was constantly found was sacbeob-like paths that were someway associated with natural resources of the area\n\n== Sacbeob ==\nSacbeob (Mayan plural of sacbe), or sacbes, were very common at the Coba site. They are raised pathways, usually stone paths at this site, that connected the clusters of residential areas to the main center of the site and the water sources.These paths were the connecting points to most things at the Coba site. They were the major feature discovered and preserved. Sacbeobs were the main reason why maps of Coba could be created. The sacbeobs were one of the ways they figured out how to excavate the site and transect the area. The sacbes were used to help determine the size of Coba.\n\n==History==\nArchaeological evidence indicates that Cob\u00e1 was first settled between 50 BC and 100 AD. At that time, there was a town with buildings of wood and palm fronts and flat platforms. The only archaeological evidence of the time are fragments of pottery. After 100 AD, the area around Coba evidenced strong population growth, and with it an increase in its social and political status among Maya city states which would ultimately  make Coba one of the biggest and most powerful city states in the northern Yucat\u00e1n area. Between 201 and 601 AD, Coba must have dominated a vast area, including the north of the state of Quintana Roo and areas in the east of the state of Yucat\u00e1n. This power resided in its control of large swaths of farmland, control over trading routes, and \u2014 critically for a Mayan city \u2014 control over ample water resources. Among the trading routes, Coba probably controlled ports like [[Xelha|Xel H\u00e1]].\n\nCoba must have maintained close contacts with the large city states of [[Guatemala]] and the south of [[Campeche City|Campeche]] like [[Tikal]], [[Dzibanche]], or [[Calakmul]]. To maintain its influence, Coba must have established military alliances and arranged marriages among their elites. It is quite noteworthy that Coba shows traces of [[Teotihuacan]] architecture, like a platform in the Paintings group that was explored in 1999, which would attest of the existence of contacts with the central Mexican cultures and its powerful city of the early Classic epoch. [[Stele|Stelae]] uncovered at Coba are believed to depict that Coba had many [[Queen regnant|female rulers]].\n\nAfter 600 AD, the emergence of powerful city states of the [[Puuc]] culture and the emergence of [[Chichen Itza|Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1]] altered the political spectrum in the Yucat\u00e1n peninsula and began eroding the dominance of Coba. Beginning around 900 or 1000 AD, Coba must have begun a lengthy power struggle with Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1, with the latter dominating at the end as it gained control of key cities such as [[Yaxun\u00e1]]. After 1000 AD, Coba lost much of its political weight among city states, although it maintained some symbolic and religious importance. This allowed it to maintain or recover some status, which is evidenced by the new buildings dating to the time 1200-1500 AD, now built in the typical Eastern coastal style. However, power centers and trading routes had moved to the coast, forcing cities like Coba into a secondary status, although somewhat more successful than its more ephemeral enemy Chich\u00e9n Itz\u00e1. Coba was abandoned at the time the Spanish conquered the peninsula around 1550.\n\n==Highlights: Exploration and Artifacts==\n[[Image:Pyramide du Grupo Coba dite l'\u00e9glise (8452064401).jpg|right|thumb|Front view of the pyramid structure known as \"La Iglesia\" in the Group B, or Cob\u00e1 Group, complex. Stela 11 is in the foreground at the base of the pyramid's steps, under the thatched roofing.]]\nThe first mention of Coba in print is due to [[John Lloyd Stephens]] where he mentioned hearing reports of the site in 1842 from the cura (priest or vicar in Spanish) of Chemax, but it was so distant from any known modern road or village that he decided the difficulty in trying to get there was too daunting and returned to his principal target of exploring Tulum instead.<ref>Stephens (1843)</ref> For much of the rest of the 19th century the area could not be visited by outsiders due to the [[Caste War of Yucat\u00e1n]], the notable exception was Juan Pe\u00f3n Contreras (also used the nom de plume Contreras Elizalde) who was then director of the Museum of Yucat\u00e1n. He made the arduous journey in September 1882, and is now remembered for the four naive pen-and-ink sketches that he made at the ruins (prints made from them exist in the Peabody Museum and in the collection of Ra\u00fal Pav\u00f3n Abreu in Campeche). [[Teoberto Maler]] paid Coba a short visit in 1893 and took at least one photograph, but did not publish at the time and the site remained unknown to the archeological community.<ref>''Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions. 8,1; Coba.'' 1997. Corpus of Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions, / Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University ; Vol. 8, P. 1. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univ. Pr..</ref>\n\nAmateur explorer (and successful writer of popular books wherein he described his adventures and discoveries among Maya ruins) Dr. [[Thomas Gann]] was brought to the site by some local Maya hunters in February 1926. Gann published the first first-hand description of the ruins later the same year.<ref>Gann (1926)</ref>  Dr. Gann gave a short description to the archeologists of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]] (CIW) project at [[Chichen Itza]], he spoke of the large mounds he had sighted, but not visited for lack of time, lying to  the northeast of the main group. It was to examine these that Alfred Kidder and  went for a two-day inspection of the site in March. Two months later Thompson was again at Coba, forming with Jean Charlot the third CIW expedition. On this trip their guide, Carmen Chai, showed them the \"Macanxoc Group\", a discovery that led to the departure of a fourth expedition, since [[Sylvanus Morley]] wanted Thompson to show him the new stelae.<ref>Morley (1926) pp. 259-286</ref> Eric Thompson made a number of return visits to the site through 1932, the same year he published a detailed description.<ref>Thompson, Pollock, Charlot, Kislak Collection (1932)</ref>\n\nIn 1932 H. B. Roberts opened a number of trenches in Group B to collect [[sherds]]<ref>Brainerd (1958) p 10</ref>\n\nIn 1948 two graduate students in archaeology, William and [[Michael D. Coe|Michael Coe]], visited Coba, intent on seeking the terminus of Sacbe 15. They were unaware that E. Wyllys Andrews IV already reported it ten years prior. In an editor's note following their report<ref>Coe and Coe (1949)</ref> Thompson blames himself as editor for failing to detect the repetition of prior work in their contribution, while excusing the young authors for ignorance of a paper published in a foreign journal. But the Coes reported the previously unknown Sacbes 18 and 19 and mapped the large mound at the terminus of Sacbe 17, which they named Pech Mul (they were unlucky again in failing to complete their circuit of its platform, or they might have discovered the sacbe leading out of it, no. 21).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.peabody.harvard.edu/cmhi/site.php?site=Coba|title=Corpus of Maya Hieroglyphic Inscriptions|website=Peabody.harvard.edu|accessdate=3 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe site remained little visited due to its remoteness until the first modern road was opened up to Coba in the early 1970s. As a major resort was planned for [[Canc\u00fan]], it was realized that clearing and restoring some of the large site could make it an important tourist attraction. The Mexican [[Instituto Nacional de Antropolog\u00eda e Historia|National Institute of Anthropology & History (INAH)]] began some archeological excavations in 1972 directed by Carlos Navarrete, and consolidated a couple of buildings. Expectations of new discoveries were borne out when El Cono (Structure D-6) and Grupo Las Pinturas came to light, among other features. In the same year, much of Grupo Coba was cleared on the instructions of Ra\u00fal Pav\u00f3n Abreu; not even its tall [[Brosimum alicastrum|ram\u00f3n trees]] were spared.\n\nIn 1975 a branch road from the asphalted highway being built from Tulum to Nuevo X-Can reached Coba (the road engineers heeded objections by archaeologists and abandoned their original plan of incorporating Sacbe 3 in the roadbed). A project camp was built in 1973, and in 1974 the Project Coba proper, under the auspices of the Regional Center of the Southeast of INAH was able to begin its operations.  During the three-year existence of the project, portions of the site were cleared and structures excavated and consolidated, (the Castillo and the Pinturas Group by Peniche; the Iglesia by Benavides and Jaime Gardu\u00f1o; El Cono by Benavides and Fernando Robles); the sacbes were investigated by Folan and by Benavides, who added 26 to the list of 19 previously known; the ceramics from test pits and trenches were studied by Robles;<ref>Robles Castellanos (1980)</ref> and Jaime Gardu\u00f1o<ref>Gardu\u00f1o Argueta (1979)</ref> surveyed two [[transects]] of the site, one of 10&nbsp;km north-south and another of 5&nbsp;km east-west.\n\nAt the start of the 1980s another road to Coba was opened up and paved, and a regular bus service begun.  Coba became a tourist destination shortly thereafter, with many visitors flocking to the site on day trips from Canc\u00fan and the [[Riviera Maya]].  Only a small portion of the site has been cleared from the jungle and restored by archaeologists.\n\n{{As of|2005}} the resident population of Coba pueblo was 1,167.<ref>2005 census</ref> It grew to 1,278 by the 2010 census.\n\n== Economy ==\nIn the past, the people of Coba had traded extensively with other Mayan communities, particularly the ones further south along the [[Caribbean]] coast in what is now [[Belize]] and [[Honduras]].  It utilized the ports of [[Xcaret]], [[Xel-H\u00e1]], Tankah, [[Muyil]], and [[Tulum]] as well as the many sacbeob that sprout from this cultural center.  Typical items of trade of the Mayans of this area were:  salt, fish, squash, yams, corn, honey, beans, turkey, vegetables, chocolate drinks and raw materials such as limestone, marble, and jade.<ref>Coe and Kislak (1966)</ref>  There was specialization in different areas on the site which were because of who was living and working where and what their trade was. Almost all of the commerce was controlled by wealthy merchants.  These merchants used cacao beans for currency, and the beans had a fixed market price.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Mayan System of Transportation|url = http://mayaincaaztec.com/masyoftr.html|website = mayaincaaztec.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190809172955/http://mayaincaaztec.com/masyoftr.html|archive-date = 2019-08-09|url-status = dead}}</ref>   Today's economy is based on the rising popularity of tourism to the archaeological site.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Cob\u00e1 archaeological site is home to the tallest pyramid in the Yucatan|url = http://gomexico.about.com/od/ancientsites/a/coba-ruins.htm|website = About.com Travel|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\n==Tourism==\n[[File:La pyramide Nohoch Mul (8453085740).jpg|thumb|Nohoch Mul Pyramid, Cob\u00e1.]]\n[[File:Coba.ogg|thumb|250px|Cob\u00e1 video]] \nThe archaeological site of Coba received 702,749 visitors in 2017.<ref name=visitors>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |title=Estad\u00edstica de Visitantes |language=es |publisher=[[INAH]] |accessdate=25 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120708021202/http://www.estadisticas.inah.gob.mx/ |archive-date=8 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One of Coba's main attractions is the Ancient Pyramid which, unlike [[Chichen Itza]]'s [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Kukulkan Pyramid]], is still open for the public to climb its 130 steps up to the top of the site.\n\nThere are also three hotels, one campsite and seven restaurants scattered throughout the site and there is a small pueblo near the ruins, with some restaurants and small shops selling local crafts.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The 5 Best Coba Restaurants - TripAdvisor|url = http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g499447-Coba_Yucatan_Peninsula.html|website = www.tripadvisor.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = The Best Coba Hotels - TripAdvisor|url = http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g499447-Coba_Yucatan_Peninsula-Hotels.html|website = www.tripadvisor.com|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n\nOutlined are the important artifacts and structures that can be viewed and experienced within the ruins of Coba:<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|title = Cob\u00e1 Ruins \u2013 Tulum|url = https://www.locogringo.com/mexico/ways-to-play/mayan-ruins-archaeological-sites/coba-ruins/|website = LocoGringo|date = 2013-06-11|accessdate = 2015-10-23}}</ref>\n* Nohoch Mul Pyramid - A 42 meters tall (137 feet) pyramid that boasts a remarkable view of the Yucat\u00e1n and non-public areas of Coba including both             lagoons;  Macanxoc Lagoon to the east and Cob\u00e1 Lagoon to the southwest.\n* Coba Group -This is a series of structures close to the entrance that include the Iglesia (the Church) and one of two ball courts located in this site.\n* Conjunto de Pinturas -The focus of this area is the Pyramid of the Painted Lintel where visitors can see from afar actual paintings on the top temple.\n* Macanxoc Group - Past the Conjunto de Pinturas is the Macanxoc Group that is found following one of the Sacbes.

Such construction is believed to be more difficult than that invested into stone buildings and temples. Although Mayans were aware that the wheel existed, historians have documented that they had not yet implemented it. Most transportation along sacbes was done in the cool temperatures of night.

The school's team currently competes in the [[Pac-12 Conference men's basketball|Pac-12 Conference]].\n\nThe Arizona State Sun Devils have appeared in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] 16 times, including 3 Elite Eights (1961, 1963, 1975). They have won 8 conference championships (four WAC, and 4 Border Conference) and finished in the final AP rankings seven times. The highest national ranking the Sun Devils have achieved is AP No. 3 under [[Bobby Hurley]] during the 2017\u201318 season and No. 3 under [[Ned Wulk]] during the 1980\u201381 season when the starting lineup included future NBA stars [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]], [[Fat Lever]], and [[Alton Lister]].\n\nArizona State is currently led by head coach Bobby Hurley (five seasons), who replaced [[Herb Sendek]]. Sendek was credited for bringing a \"basketball atmosphere\" and level of excitement to Arizona State that had been absent for years. In his first four seasons at Arizona State, Sendek led the Sun Devils to three consecutive 20 win seasons, the 2009 Pac-10 conference tournament finals, and the second round of the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2009 NCAA Tournament]] and [[2014 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2014 NCAA Tournament]]. Hurley, in turn, has taken the Sun Devils to the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]] and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2019 NCAA Tournaments]].\n\nThe Sun Devils earned a 3-seed and first-round bye in the [[Pac-12 Conference Men's Basketball Tournament]] and were scheduled to play Washington State when the tournament was canceled due to the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]].<ref>https://pac-12.com/mens-basketball/mens-basketball-tournament</ref>  The [[2020 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]] was also subsequently canceled due to the pandemic.  While the NCAA did not release seedings for the canceled tournament, the Sun Devils were projected by ESPN's Joe Lunardi in his end-of-season \"Braketology\" to be a 9-seed.<ref>http://www.espn.com/mens-college-basketball/bracketology</ref>  This would have been the first time since 1964 that the Sun Devils had made the tournament in three-straight years.\n\nThirty-six ASU Sun Devils have been selected in the [[NBA Draft]], including six-time NBA All-Star [[James Harden]], [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]], [[Isaac Austin]], [[Lafayette Lever]], [[Alton Lister]], [[Lionel Hollins]], Sam Williams, [[Jeff Pendergraph]], [[Stevin Smith|Stevin \"Hedake\" Smith]], [[Mario Bennett]], [[Tommy Smith (basketball)|Tommy Smith]], [[Ike Diogu]], [[Eddie House]], [[Freddie Lewis]], and [[Joe Caldwell]].<ref name=\"Devils drafted\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=207852501|title=ASU players drafted into the NBA}}</ref>\n\n==Yearly records==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header = [[James Harden]]\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = NBA superstar James Harden played two seasons for the Sun Devils before entering the league.\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n\n | image1 = 20090117 James Harden on defense.jpg\n | width1 = 120\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = James Harden (30852408515).jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =\n}}\n{{CBB yearly record start | type = team | conference = | postseason= }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry\n| championship = \n| season       = 1911\u201312\n| name         = [[C.W.

represents [[Arizona State University]] in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Arizona]], United States. The school's team currently competes in the [[Pac-12 Conference men's basketball|Pac-12 Conference]].\n\nThe Arizona State Sun Devils have appeared in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] 16 times, including 3 Elite Eights (1961, 1963, 1975). They have won 8 conference championships (four WAC, and 4 Border Conference) and finished in the final AP rankings seven times. The highest national ranking the Sun Devils have achieved is AP No. 3 under [[Bobby Hurley]] during the 2017\u201318 season and No. 3 under [[Ned Wulk]] during the 1980\u201381 season when the starting lineup included future NBA stars [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]], [[Fat Lever]], and [[Alton Lister]].\n\nArizona State is currently led by fourth-year head coach Bobby Hurley, who replaced [[Herb Sendek]]. Sendek was credited for bringing a \"basketball atmosphere\" and level of excitement to Arizona State that had been absent for years. In his first four seasons at Arizona State, Sendek led the Sun Devils to three consecutive 20 win seasons, the 2009 Pac-10 conference tournament finals, and the second round of the [[2009 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2009 NCAA Tournament]] and [[2014 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2014 NCAA Tournament]]. Hurley, in turn, has taken the Sun Devils to the [[2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2018]] and [[2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|2019 NCAA Tournaments]].\n\nThirty-six ASU Sun Devils have been selected in the [[NBA Draft]], including six-time NBA All-Star [[James Harden]], [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]], [[Isaac Austin]], [[Lafayette Lever]], [[Alton Lister]], [[Lionel Hollins]], Sam Williams, [[Jeff Pendergraph]], [[Stevin Smith|Stevin \"Hedake\" Smith]], [[Mario Bennett]], [[Tommy Smith (basketball)|Tommy Smith]], [[Ike Diogu]], [[Eddie House]], [[Freddie Lewis]], and [[Joe Caldwell]].<ref name=\"Devils drafted\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thesundevils.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&DB_OEM_ID=30300&ATCLID=207852501|title=ASU players drafted into the NBA}}</ref>\n\n==Yearly records==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = horizontal\n | header = [[James Harden]]\n | header_align = left/right/center\n | header_background =\n | footer = NBA superstar James Harden played two seasons for the Sun Devils before entering the league.\n | footer_align = left/right/center\n | footer_background =\n | width =\n\n | image1 = 20090117 James Harden on defense.jpg\n | width1 = 120\n | alt1 =\n | caption1 =\n\n | image2 = James Harden (30852408515).jpg\n | width2 = 120\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 =\n}}\n{{CBB yearly record start | type = team | conference = | postseason= }}\n{{CBB yearly record entry\n| championship = \n| season       = 1911\u201312\n| name         = [[C.W.

Taft represented [[Ohio]] in the [[United States Senate]], briefly served as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], and was a leader of the [[conservative coalition]] of Republicans and conservative Democrats who prevented expansion of the [[New Deal]]. Often referred to as \"Mr. Republican\", he cosponsored the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act|Taft\u2013Hartley Act of 1947]], which banned [[closed shop]]s and other labor practices.\n\nThe elder son of [[William Howard Taft]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|27th]] [[President of the United States]], Robert Taft was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He pursued a legal career in Cincinnati after graduating from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1913. Along with his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft II]], he co-founded the law partnership of [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Taft served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] from 1921 to 1931 and in the [[Ohio Senate]] from 1931 to 1933. Though he lost re-election in 1932, he remained a powerful force in state and local politics.\n\nAfter winning election to the Senate in [[1938 United States Senate elections|1938]] over incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Robert J. Bulkley]], Taft repeatedly sought the Republican presidential nomination, often battling for control of the party with the moderate faction of Republicans led by [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. He also emerged as a prominent [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] and opposed U.S. involvement into [[World War II]] prior to the 1941 [[Japan]]ese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Taft's non-interventionist stances damaged his 1940 candidacy, and the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] nominated [[Wendell Willkie]]. Taft sought the presidency again in 1948, but he lost to Dewey at the [[1948 Republican National Convention]]. He opposed the creation of [[NATO]] and criticized President [[Harry Truman]]'s handling of the [[Korean War]].\n\nTaft again sought the presidential nomination a third time in 1952, and was widely viewed as the front-runner. However, Dewey and other moderates convinced General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to enter the race, and Eisenhower narrowly prevailed at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] and went on to win the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]]. Taft was elected Senate Majority Leader in 1953 but died of pancreatic cancer later that year. A 1957 Senate committee named Taft as one of America's five greatest senators, along with [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Famous_Five.htm |title=The \"Famous Five\" |accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Family and education==\nTaft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, a product of one of America's most prominent political families. He was a grandson of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Alphonso Taft]], and the elder son of President and Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Helen Herron Taft|Helen Louise \"Nellie\" Herron]]. His younger brother [[Charles Phelps Taft II]] served as the [[Mayor]] of [[Cincinnati]] and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Ohio Governor in 1952. As a boy he spent four years in the [[Philippines]], where his father was [[Governor-General of the Philippines|governor]]. He was first in his class at the [[Taft School]] (run by his uncle), at [[Yale College]] (1910), and at [[Harvard Law School]] (1913). He was a member of [[Psi Upsilon]], his father's fraternity<ref>General Catalogue of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity, 12th edition, May 1917, p. 194.</ref> and [[Skull and Bones]],<ref name=\"nyt280509\">{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 28, 1909 |title=Taft's son elected to Skull and Bones}}</ref> and edited the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. In 1913, Taft scored the highest in the state on the Ohio bar exam. He then practiced for four years with the firm of Maxwell and Ramsey (now Graydon Head & Ritchey LLP) in [[Cincinnati]], his family's ancestral city. After a two-year stint in Washington working for the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], he returned to Cincinnati and opened his own law office. In 1924 he and his brother, Charles, helped form the law partnership [[Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister]] with which he continued to be associated until his death and continues to carry his name today.\n[[File:President Taft and his family (1912).png|thumb|President Taft and his family (1912)]]\nOn October 17, 1914, he married Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889\u20131958),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I108060&tree=mrptree|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615064215/http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I108060&tree=mrptree|url-status=dead |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |title=Myrootsplace |work=myrootsplace.com}}</ref> daughter of [[Lloyd Wheaton Bowers]] and Louisa Bennett Wilson. Taft himself appeared taciturn and coldly intellectual, characteristics that were offset by his gregarious wife, who served the same role his mother had for his father, as a confidante and powerful asset to her husband's political career. In May 1950, Martha suffered a severe [[stroke]] that left her an invalid, leaving her confined to a wheelchair, unable to take care of herself, and reliant upon her husband, children, and nurses for support.<ref>(Patterson, p. 450)</ref> A biographer called his wife's stroke \"the deepest personal blow of [Taft's] life ... there was no denying that he suffered.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 451)</ref> Following her stroke, Taft faithfully assisted his wife, called her every night when he was away on business, read stories to her at night when he was at home, \"pushed her about in her wheelchair, lifted her in and out of cars ... tenderly did his best to make her feel comfortable and happy, and helped feed and take care of her at public functions\" - facts which, his admirers noted, belied his public image as a cold and uncaring person.<ref>(p. 451)</ref> They had four sons: [[William Howard Taft III]] (1915\u20131991), who became ambassador to Ireland; [[Robert Taft Jr.|Robert Alphonso Taft Jr.]] (1917\u20131993), who was also elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923\u20131985),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I114041&tree=mrptree |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615064215/http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I114041&tree=mrptree |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |title=Myrootsplace |work=myrootsplace.com}}</ref> who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/23/us/lloyd-b-taft.html |title=Lloyd B.

Called Sky Farm, it would serve as Taft's primary residence for the rest of his life. The Tafts gradually made extensive renovations that turned the small farmhouse into a sixteen-room mansion. On the farm Taft enjoyed growing [[strawberries]], [[asparagus]], and [[potatoes]] for profit. During the summer, Taft often vacationed with his wife and children at the Taft family's summer home at [[La Malbaie|Murray Bay]], in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>(Patterson, pp. 112\u201316)</ref> Although he was nominally a member of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church, his biographer James Patterson noted that Taft's \"religious inclinations were weak\" and that he was a \"Sunday morning golfer, not a church-going Episcopalian.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 399)</ref> When reporters asked his wife Martha what church he attended, she jokingly replied, \"I'd have to say the [[Burning Tree Club|Burning Tree]]\", an exclusive country club and golf course in suburban Washington.<ref>(Patterson, p. 332)</ref>\n\n==Early public career==\n{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}\nWhen the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, Taft attempted to join the army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight. Instead, he joined the legal staff of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] where he met [[Herbert Hoover]], who became his idol. In 1918 and 1919, he was in [[Paris]] as legal adviser for the [[American Relief Administration]], Hoover's agency to distribute food to wartorn Europe. He came to distrust governmental bureaucracy as inefficient and detrimental to the rights of the individual, a principle he promoted throughout his career. He urged membership in the [[League of Nations]]<ref>Taft, ''Foreign Policy for Americans'' p. 37.</ref> but generally distrusted European politicians. He endorsed the idea of a powerful world court to enforce international law, but no such idealized court ever existed during his lifetime. He returned to Cincinnati in late 1919, promoted Hoover for president in 1920, and opened a law firm with his brother, Charles Taft. In 1920 he was elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]], where he served as Republican floor leader and was Speaker of the House from January 1926 to January 1927. In 1930, he was elected to the [[Ohio Senate]], but was defeated for re-election in 1932; it would be the only general election defeat of his career. He was an outspoken opponent of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and he did not support [[prohibition]]. In 1925 he voted against a bill, sponsored by Ohio state representatives who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, to outlaw dancing on Sundays, and he led the fight against a Klan-sponsored bill requiring all Ohio public school teachers to read at least ten verses of the Bible each day in class.<ref name=\"Pattersonpp\">(Patterson, pp. 100\u201301)</ref> In his speech opposing the bill, Taft stated that religion should be taught in churches, not public schools, and while the Bible was great literature, \"in it religion overshadows all else.\" The bill passed the legislature over the opposition of Taft and his allies, but it was later vetoed by Ohio's governor.<ref name=\"Pattersonpp\"/>\n\nTaft's period of service in the Ohio state legislature was most notable for his efforts to reform and modernize the state's antiquated tax laws.<ref>(Patterson, p. 103)</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, Taft was a powerful figure in local and state political and legal circles, and he was known as a loyal Republican who never threatened to bolt the party. He confessed in 1922 that \"while I have no difficulty talking, I don't know how to do any of the eloquence business which makes for enthusiasm or applause.\"<ref>Taft ''Papers'' 1:271</ref> A lackluster speaker who did not mix well or glad-hand supporters,  Taft was still a tireless worker with a broad range of policy and political interests. His total grasp of the complex details of every issue impressed reporters and politicians. (Democrats joked, \"Taft has the best mind in Washington, until he makes it up.\")\n\nTaft's loyalty to the conservative politicians who controlled Ohio's Republican Party had a price, as it often caused conflict with his younger brother, Charles, who as a local politician in Cincinnati had gained a reputation as a party [[wikt:maverick|maverick]] and liberal. However, despite their occasional policy disagreements, Charles loyally supported all three of his brother's presidential bids.\n\n==US Senator==\n[[File:RobertATaft.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Taft during his Senate tenure, from the [[Historian of the United States Senate|US Senate Historical Office]] collection]]\nTaft was elected to the first of his three terms as US Senator in [[1938 United States Senate elections|1938]]. He first defeated Ohio Supreme Court justice [[Arthur H.

The Republican gains in the 1938 elections, combined with the creation of the Conservative Coalition, had stopped the expansion of the New Deal. However, Taft saw his mission as not only stopping the growth of the New Deal but also eliminating many of its government programs.\n\nDuring his first term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he believed was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and of the need to let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation's economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the [[Great Depression]].

A staunch [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]], Taft believed that America should avoid any involvement in European or Asian wars and concentrate instead on solving its domestic problems. He believed that a strong military, combined with the natural geographic protection of the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans, would be adequate to protect America even if Germany overran all of Europe. Between the outbreak of war in September 1939, and the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Taft opposed nearly all attempts to aid countries fighting Germany. That brought him strong criticism from many liberal Republicans, such as [[Wendell Willkie]], who felt that America could best protect itself by supporting the British and their allies. Although Taft fully supported the American war effort after Pearl Harbor, he continued to harbor a deep suspicion of American involvement in postwar military alliances, including the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. Taft was the representative to speak in opposition to [[Japanese-American internment]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Foner|title=The Story of American Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhHcaweX2tIC&pg=PA241|year=1999|publisher=W.W.

It bans \"unfair\" union practices, outlaws [[closed shops]], and authorizes the President to seek federal court injunctions to impose an 80-day cooling-off period if a strike threatened the national interest. Taft displayed all of his parliamentary skills in getting the bill through Congress. When President [[Harry Truman]] vetoed it, Taft then convinced both houses of Congress to override the veto.\n\nBy early 1949, [[Elbert Thomas]] sponsored legislation sent to Congress by the Truman administration that would repeal the Taft\u2013Hartley Act.

Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945'', (University Press of Kentucky, 1983) pp. 28, 39\u201340</ref>\n\n===1940 and 1944===\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Taftcampaigns.jpg|left|thumb|Taft campaigning as the conservative candidate]] -->\nTaft first sought the Republican presidential nomination in [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1940|1940]] but lost to [[Wendell Willkie]]. Taft was regarded as a strong contender, but his outspoken support of a non-interventionist foreign policy, and his opposition to the [[New Deal]] in domestic policy led many liberal Republicans to reject his candidacy. At the 1940 Republican Convention, Willkie, once a Democrat, and a corporate executive who had never run for political office, came from behind to beat Taft and several other candidates for the nomination. That year, Taft first clashed with [[Thomas E. Dewey]], then a New York [[District Attorney]], who had become nationally famous for successfully prosecuting several prominent organized-crime figures, especially New York mob boss [[\"Lucky\" Luciano]]. Taft felt that Dewey was not conservative or consistent enough in his principles for the Republican Party: \"Tom Dewey has no real courage to stand up against the crowd that wants to smear any Republican who takes a forthright position against the New Deal ... there is only one way to beat the New Deal, and that is head on. You can't outdeal them.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 269)</ref> In other letters, Taft described Dewey as \"very arrogant and bossy\" and worried that \"advisers will talk Dewey into too much internationalism ... he comes from New York and sees the group opinions there as a lot more important than they are.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 271)</ref>\n\nIn the 1944 presidential campaign Taft was not a candidate. He supported Governor [[John W. Bricker]] of Ohio, a fellow conservative, for the nomination. However, Bricker was defeated by Dewey, who had become the Governor of New York in 1943. Dewey named Bricker as his running mate; the ticket would go on to lose to Roosevelt in the general election.\n\n===1948 and 1952===\nIn [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1948|1948]], Taft made a second try for the nomination but again was defeated by his archrival, Dewey, who led the GOP's moderate/liberal wing. In the [[1948 United States presidential election]], Dewey was defeated by the Democratic presidential candidate, [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\nIn August 1951, during a news conference, President Truman said Taft was his choice for the Republican nomination in the following year's presidential election, Taft responding by saying that he would let others comment on the remark.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=A7-hzOuI2KQC&dat=19510810&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Ike's Candidacy Rests On European Situation|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=August 10, 1951}}</ref> In January 1952, Taft stated those seeking the drafting of General Dwight Eisenhower had made the argument he could not win the general election and that he did not understand this perspective as the same argument was being made of Eisenhower's candidacy by his manager David S.

It was his third and final try for the nomination; it also proved to be his strongest effort. At the Republican State Convention in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], he declared:\n\n<blockquote>I believe a Republican could carry a number of southern states if he conducts the right kind of campaign. ... Whether we win or lose in the South, we cannot afford to ignore public opinion in the southern states, because it influences national public opinion, and that opinion finally decides the election. ... It is said that southern Democrats will not vote for a Republican candidate. They have frequently done so. They did so in Little Rock last November [1951] when they elected [[Pratt Remmel]] mayor. I refuse to admit that if the issues are clearly presented, the southern voters will not vote on the basis of principle. ...<ref>[[Osro Cobb]], ''Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance'', Carol Griffee, ed. ([[Little Rock, Arkansas]]: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), p. 106</ref></blockquote>\n\nTaft had the solid backing of the party's conservative wing. Former US Representative [[Howard Buffett]] of [[Nebraska]] (father of billionaire [[Warren Buffett]]) served as one of his campaign managers.<ref>[[E.J. Dionne|Dionne, E.J.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pQMAsT7HlEsC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=%22E.J.+Dionne%22+%22Murray+Rothbard%22&source=bl&ots=Z_wxxTdy3h&sig=FbkKdViAPcEfBAUuJXDIRBjXjRQ&hl=en&ei=LQROTci7Fc_UgAfFtaUU&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=2&ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q&f=false Why Americans Hate Politics], p. 265.</ref> With Dewey no longer an active candidate, many political [[Pundit (expert)|pundits]] regarded Taft as the frontrunner. However, the race changed when Dewey and other moderates were able to convince [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the most popular general of [[World War II]], to run for the nomination. Eisenhower ran because of his fear that Taft's non-interventionist views in foreign policy,  especially his opposition to [[NATO]], might benefit the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].<ref>(Ambrose, p. 498)</ref>\n\nThe fight between Taft and Eisenhower for the nomination was one of the closest and most bitter in American political history. When the Republican Convention opened in Chicago in July 1952, Taft and Eisenhower were neck-and-neck in delegate votes. On the convention's first day, Eisenhower's managers complained that Taft's forces had unfairly denied Eisenhower supporters delegate slots in several Southern states, including Texas, where the state chairman, [[Orville Bullington]], was committed to Taft. The Eisenhower partisans proposed to remove pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called their proposal \"Fair Play.\" Although Taft angrily denied having stolen any delegate votes, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and the Texans voted 33\u20135 for Eisenhower as a result. In addition, several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, agreed to support Eisenhower.\n\nThe addition of the uncommitted state delegations, combined with Taft's loss of many Southern delegates by the Fair Play proposal, decided the nomination in Eisenhower's favor. Despite his bitterness at his narrow defeat and his belief that he had been unfairly ambushed by the Eisenhower forces (including Dewey), Taft issued a brief statement after the convention conveying his congratulations and support to Eisenhower. Thereafter, however, he brooded in silence at his summer home in [[Quebec]], complaining, \"Every Republican candidate for President since 1936 has been nominated by the [[Chase (bank)|Chase National Bank]].\"<ref>[[John Nichols (journalist)|Nichols, John]] (December 21, 2011) [http://www.thenation.com/blog/165290/why-do-gop-bosses-fear-ron-paul Why Do GOP Bosses Fear Ron Paul?], ''[[The Nation]]''</ref> As the weeks passed, Eisenhower's aides worried that Taft and his supporters would sit on their hands during the campaign and that as a result Eisenhower might lose the election. In September 1952, Taft finally agreed to meet with Eisenhower, at [[Morningside Heights]] in New York City. There, to gain Taft's support, Eisenhower promised that he would take no reprisals against Taft partisans, would cut federal spending, and would fight \"creeping socialism in every domestic field.\" In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.\n\nEisenhower firmly believed in [[NATO]] and was committed to the US support of anticommunism in the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Senate Majority Leader==\n[[File:RobertATaft83rdCongress.png|thumb|left|190px|Taft during the 83rd Congress, 1953]]\nFollowing Eisenhower's election and the Republican takeover of Congress, Taft served as [[Senate Majority Leader]] in 1953, and he strongly supported Eisenhower's domestic proposals. He worked hard to assist the inexperienced new officials of the administration. He even tried, with little success, to curb the excesses of [[red-baiting]] US Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. By April, Eisenhower and Taft were friends and golfing companions, and Taft was praising his former adversary. Defeat in 1952, it seemed, had softened Taft. No longer burdened by presidential ambitions, he had become less partisan, less abrasive, and more conciliatory; he was now widely regarded as the most powerful man in Congress.\n\nOn May 26, 1953, Taft delivered his final speech, in which he presciently warned of the dangers of America's emerging [[Cold War]] foreign policy, specifically against US military involvement in [[Southeast Asia]], which would later become the [[Vietnam War]]:\n\n{{quote|I have never felt that we should send American soldiers to the Continent of [[Asia]], which, of course, included [[China]] proper and [[Indo-China]], simply because we are so outnumbered in fighting a land war on the Continent of Asia that it would bring about complete exhaustion even if we were able to win. ... So today, as since 1947 in Europe and 1950 in Asia, we are really trying to arm the world against [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]], or at least furnish all the assistance which can be of use to them in opposing [[Communism]].\n\nIs this policy of uniting the free world against Communism in time of peace going to be a practical long-term policy? I have always been a skeptic on the subject of the military practicability of NATO. ... I have always felt that we should not attempt to fight Russia on the ground on the Continent of Europe any more than we should attempt to fight China on the Continent of Asia.<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Taft represented [[Ohio]] in the [[United States Senate]], briefly served as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Leader]], and was a leader of the [[conservative coalition]] of Republicans and conservative Democrats who prevented expansion of the [[New Deal]]. Often referred to as \"Mr. Republican\", he cosponsored the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act|Taft\u2013Hartley Act of 1947]], which banned [[closed shop]]s and other labor practices.\n\nThe elder son of [[William Howard Taft]], the [[List of Presidents of the United States|27th]] [[President of the United States]], Robert Taft was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]]. He pursued a legal career in Cincinnati after graduating from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1913. Along with his brother [[Charles Phelps Taft II]], he co-founded the law partnership of [[Taft Stettinius & Hollister]]. Taft served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] from 1921 to 1931 and in the [[Ohio Senate]] from 1931 to 1933. Though he lost re-election in 1932, he remained a powerful force in state and local politics.\n\nAfter winning election to the Senate in [[1938 United States Senate elections|1938]] over incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Robert J. Bulkley]], Taft repeatedly sought the Republican presidential nomination, often battling for control of the party with the moderate faction of Republicans led by [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. He also emerged as a prominent [[Non-interventionism|non-interventionist]] and opposed U.S. involvement into [[World War II]] prior to the 1941 [[Japan]]ese [[Attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Taft's non-interventionist stances damaged his 1940 candidacy, and the [[1940 Republican National Convention]] nominated [[Wendell Willkie]]. Taft sought the presidency again in 1948, but he lost to Dewey at the [[1948 Republican National Convention]]. He opposed the creation of [[NATO]] and criticized President [[Harry Truman]]'s handling of the [[Korean War]].\n\nTaft again sought the presidential nomination a third time in 1952, and was widely viewed as the front-runner. However, Dewey and other moderates convinced General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] to enter the race, and Eisenhower narrowly prevailed at the [[1952 Republican National Convention]] and went on to win the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]]. Taft was elected Senate Majority Leader in 1953 but died of pancreatic cancer later that year. A 1957 Senate committee named Taft as one of America's five greatest senators, along with [[Henry Clay]], [[Daniel Webster]], [[John C. Calhoun]], and [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Famous_Five.htm |title=The \"Famous Five\" |accessdate=August 17, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Family and education==\nTaft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, a product of one of America's most prominent political families. He was a grandson of [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Alphonso Taft]], and the elder son of President and Chief Justice [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Helen Herron Taft|Helen Louise \"Nellie\" Herron]]. His younger brother [[Charles Phelps Taft II]] served as the [[Mayor]] of [[Cincinnati]] and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Ohio Governor in 1952. As a boy he spent four years in the [[Philippines]], where his father was [[Governor-General of the Philippines|governor]]. He was first in his class at the [[Taft School]] (run by his uncle), at [[Yale College]] (1910), and at [[Harvard Law School]] (1913). He was a member of [[Psi Upsilon]], his father's fraternity<ref>General Catalogue of the Psi Upsilon Fraternity, 12th edition, May 1917, p. 194.</ref> and [[Skull and Bones]],<ref name=\"nyt280509\">{{cite news |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 28, 1909 |title=Taft's son elected to Skull and Bones}}</ref> and edited the ''[[Harvard Law Review]]''. In 1913, Taft scored the highest in the state on the Ohio bar exam. He then practiced for four years with the firm of Maxwell and Ramsey (now Graydon Head & Ritchey LLP) in [[Cincinnati]], his family's ancestral city. After a two-year stint in Washington working for the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]], he returned to Cincinnati and opened his own law office. In 1924 he and his brother, Charles, helped form the law partnership [[Taft, Stettinius, and Hollister]] with which he continued to be associated until his death and continues to carry his name today.\n[[File:President Taft and his family (1912).png|thumb|President Taft and his family (1912)]]\nOn October 17, 1914, he married Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889\u20131958),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I108060&tree=mrptree|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615064215/http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I108060&tree=mrptree|url-status=dead |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |title=Myrootsplace |work=myrootsplace.com}}</ref> daughter of [[Lloyd Wheaton Bowers]] and Louisa Bennett Wilson. Taft himself appeared taciturn and coldly intellectual, characteristics that were offset by his gregarious wife, who served the same role his mother had for his father, as a confidante and powerful asset to her husband's political career. In May 1950, Martha suffered a severe [[stroke]] that left her an invalid, leaving her confined to a wheelchair, unable to take care of herself, and reliant upon her husband, children, and nurses for support.<ref>(Patterson, p. 450)</ref> A biographer called his wife's stroke \"the deepest personal blow of [Taft's] life ... there was no denying that he suffered.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 451)</ref> Following her stroke, Taft faithfully assisted his wife, called her every night when he was away on business, read stories to her at night when he was at home, \"pushed her about in her wheelchair, lifted her in and out of cars ... tenderly did his best to make her feel comfortable and happy, and helped feed and take care of her at public functions\" - facts which, his admirers noted, belied his public image as a cold and uncaring person.<ref>(p. 451)</ref> They had four sons: [[William Howard Taft III]] (1915\u20131991), who became ambassador to Ireland; [[Robert Taft Jr.|Robert Alphonso Taft Jr.]] (1917\u20131993), who was also elected to the U.S. Senate; Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923\u20131985),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I114041&tree=mrptree |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130615064215/http://myrootsplace.com/getperson.php?personID=I114041&tree=mrptree |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 15, 2013 |title=Myrootsplace |work=myrootsplace.com}}</ref> who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/10/23/us/lloyd-b-taft.html |title=Lloyd B.

Called Sky Farm, it would serve as Taft's primary residence for the rest of his life. The Tafts gradually made extensive renovations that turned the small farmhouse into a sixteen-room mansion. On the farm Taft enjoyed growing [[strawberries]], [[asparagus]], and [[potatoes]] for profit. During the summer, Taft often vacationed with his wife and children at the Taft family's summer home at [[La Malbaie|Murray Bay]], in [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].<ref>(Patterson, pp. 112\u201316)</ref> Although he was nominally a member of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church, his biographer James Patterson noted that Taft's \"religious inclinations were weak\" and that he was a \"Sunday morning golfer, not a church-going Episcopalian.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 399)</ref> When reporters asked his wife Martha what church he attended, she jokingly replied, \"I'd have to say the [[Burning Tree Club|Burning Tree]]\", an exclusive country club and golf course in suburban Washington.<ref>(Patterson, p. 332)</ref>\n\n==Early public career==\n{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}\nWhen the United States entered [[World War I]] in April 1917, Taft attempted to join the army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight. Instead, he joined the legal staff of the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] where he met [[Herbert Hoover]], who became his idol. In 1918 and 1919, he was in [[Paris]] as legal adviser for the [[American Relief Administration]], Hoover's agency to distribute food to wartorn Europe. He came to distrust governmental bureaucracy as inefficient and detrimental to the rights of the individual, a principle he promoted throughout his career. He urged membership in the [[League of Nations]]<ref>Taft, ''Foreign Policy for Americans'' p. 37.</ref> but generally distrusted European politicians. He endorsed the idea of a powerful world court to enforce international law, but no such idealized court ever existed during his lifetime. He returned to Cincinnati in late 1919, promoted Hoover for president in 1920, and opened a law firm with his brother, Charles Taft. In 1920 he was elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]], where he served as Republican floor leader and was Speaker of the House from January 1926 to January 1927. In 1930, he was elected to the [[Ohio Senate]], but was defeated for re-election in 1932; it would be the only general election defeat of his career. He was an outspoken opponent of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], and he did not support [[prohibition]]. In 1925 he voted against a bill, sponsored by Ohio state representatives who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, to outlaw dancing on Sundays, and he led the fight against a Klan-sponsored bill requiring all Ohio public school teachers to read at least ten verses of the Bible each day in class.<ref name=\"Pattersonpp\">(Patterson, pp. 100\u201301)</ref> In his speech opposing the bill, Taft stated that religion should be taught in churches, not public schools, and while the Bible was great literature, \"in it religion overshadows all else.\" The bill passed the legislature over the opposition of Taft and his allies, but it was later vetoed by Ohio's governor.<ref name=\"Pattersonpp\"/>\n\nTaft's period of service in the Ohio state legislature was most notable for his efforts to reform and modernize the state's antiquated tax laws.<ref>(Patterson, p. 103)</ref>\n\nThroughout the 1920s and 1930s, Taft was a powerful figure in local and state political and legal circles, and he was known as a loyal Republican who never threatened to bolt the party. He confessed in 1922 that \"while I have no difficulty talking, I don't know how to do any of the eloquence business which makes for enthusiasm or applause.\"<ref>Taft ''Papers'' 1:271</ref> A lackluster speaker who did not mix well or glad-hand supporters,  Taft was still a tireless worker with a broad range of policy and political interests. His total grasp of the complex details of every issue impressed reporters and politicians. (Democrats joked, \"Taft has the best mind in Washington, until he makes it up.\")\n\nTaft's loyalty to the conservative politicians who controlled Ohio's Republican Party had a price, as it often caused conflict with his younger brother, Charles, who as a local politician in Cincinnati had gained a reputation as a party [[wikt:maverick|maverick]] and liberal. However, despite their occasional policy disagreements, Charles loyally supported all three of his brother's presidential bids.\n\n==US Senator==\n[[File:RobertATaft.jpg|thumb|right|190px|Taft during his Senate tenure, from the [[Historian of the United States Senate|US Senate Historical Office]] collection]]\nTaft was elected to the first of his three terms as US Senator in [[1938 United States Senate elections|1938]].

The Republican gains in the 1938 elections, combined with the creation of the Conservative Coalition, had stopped the expansion of the New Deal. However, Taft saw his mission as not only stopping the growth of the New Deal but also eliminating many of its government programs.\n\nDuring his first term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he believed was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and of the need to let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation's economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the [[Great Depression]]. He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked deficit spending, high farm subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow conservative ideology; for instance, after investigating the lack of adequate housing in the nation, he supported [[public housing]] programs.<ref>{{cite book|title=How We Got Here: The '70s|last=Frum|first=David|authorlink=David Frum|year=2000|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-465-04195-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/7 7]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/7}}</ref> He also supported federal aid to the states to fund public schools.<ref>{{cite book|first=Clarence E.|last=Wunderlin|title=Robert A.

A staunch [[non-interventionism|non-interventionist]], Taft believed that America should avoid any involvement in European or Asian wars and concentrate instead on solving its domestic problems. He believed that a strong military, combined with the natural geographic protection of the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] Oceans, would be adequate to protect America even if Germany overran all of Europe. Between the outbreak of war in September 1939, and the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in December 1941, Taft opposed nearly all attempts to aid countries fighting Germany. That brought him strong criticism from many liberal Republicans, such as [[Wendell Willkie]], who felt that America could best protect itself by supporting the British and their allies. Although Taft fully supported the American war effort after Pearl Harbor, he continued to harbor a deep suspicion of American involvement in postwar military alliances, including the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]]. Taft was the representative to speak in opposition to [[Japanese-American internment]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Eric|last=Foner|title=The Story of American Freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YhHcaweX2tIC&pg=PA241|year=1999|publisher=W.W.

It bans \"unfair\" union practices, outlaws [[closed shops]], and authorizes the President to seek federal court injunctions to impose an 80-day cooling-off period if a strike threatened the national interest. Taft displayed all of his parliamentary skills in getting the bill through Congress.

In a post-election survey of voters, Lubell found that the overly aggressive, labor-backed anti-Taft campaign angered some Democrats.

Taft was regarded as a strong contender, but his outspoken support of a non-interventionist foreign policy, and his opposition to the [[New Deal]] in domestic policy led many liberal Republicans to reject his candidacy. At the 1940 Republican Convention, Willkie, once a Democrat, and a corporate executive who had never run for political office, came from behind to beat Taft and several other candidates for the nomination. That year, Taft first clashed with [[Thomas E. Dewey]], then a New York [[District Attorney]], who had become nationally famous for successfully prosecuting several prominent organized-crime figures, especially New York mob boss [[\"Lucky\" Luciano]]. Taft felt that Dewey was not conservative or consistent enough in his principles for the Republican Party: \"Tom Dewey has no real courage to stand up against the crowd that wants to smear any Republican who takes a forthright position against the New Deal ... there is only one way to beat the New Deal, and that is head on. You can't outdeal them.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 269)</ref> In other letters, Taft described Dewey as \"very arrogant and bossy\" and worried that \"advisers will talk Dewey into too much internationalism ... he comes from New York and sees the group opinions there as a lot more important than they are.\"<ref>(Patterson, p. 271)</ref>\n\nIn the 1944 presidential campaign Taft was not a candidate. He supported Governor [[John W. Bricker]] of Ohio, a fellow conservative, for the nomination. However, Bricker was defeated by Dewey, who had become the Governor of New York in 1943. Dewey named Bricker as his running mate; the ticket would go on to lose to Roosevelt in the general election.\n\n===1948 and 1952===\nIn [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1948|1948]], Taft made a second try for the nomination but again was defeated by his archrival, Dewey, who led the GOP's moderate/liberal wing. In the [[1948 United States presidential election]], Dewey was defeated by the Democratic presidential candidate, [[Harry S. Truman]].\n\nIn August 1951, during a news conference, President Truman said Taft was his choice for the Republican nomination in the following year's presidential election, Taft responding by saying that he would let others comment on the remark.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=A7-hzOuI2KQC&dat=19510810&printsec=frontpage&hl=en|title=Ike's Candidacy Rests On European Situation|publisher=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=August 10, 1951}}</ref> In January 1952, Taft stated those seeking the drafting of General Dwight Eisenhower had made the argument he could not win the general election and that he did not understand this perspective as the same argument was being made of Eisenhower's candidacy by his manager David S.

It was his third and final try for the nomination; it also proved to be his strongest effort. At the Republican State Convention in [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]], he declared:\n\n<blockquote>I believe a Republican could carry a number of southern states if he conducts the right kind of campaign. ... Whether we win or lose in the South, we cannot afford to ignore public opinion in the southern states, because it influences national public opinion, and that opinion finally decides the election. ... It is said that southern Democrats will not vote for a Republican candidate. They have frequently done so. They did so in Little Rock last November [1951] when they elected [[Pratt Remmel]] mayor.

However, the race changed when Dewey and other moderates were able to convince [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], the most popular general of [[World War II]], to run for the nomination. Eisenhower ran because of his fear that Taft's non-interventionist views in foreign policy,  especially his opposition to [[NATO]], might benefit the [[Soviet Union]] in the [[Cold War]].<ref>(Ambrose, p. 498)</ref>\n\nThe fight between Taft and Eisenhower for the nomination was one of the closest and most bitter in American political history. When the Republican Convention opened in Chicago in July 1952, Taft and Eisenhower were neck-and-neck in delegate votes. On the convention's first day, Eisenhower's managers complained that Taft's forces had unfairly denied Eisenhower supporters delegate slots in several Southern states, including Texas, where the state chairman, [[Orville Bullington]], was committed to Taft. The Eisenhower partisans proposed to remove pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called their proposal \"Fair Play.\" Although Taft angrily denied having stolen any delegate votes, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and the Texans voted 33\u20135 for Eisenhower as a result. In addition, several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, agreed to support Eisenhower.\n\nThe addition of the uncommitted state delegations, combined with Taft's loss of many Southern delegates by the Fair Play proposal, decided the nomination in Eisenhower's favor. Despite his bitterness at his narrow defeat and his belief that he had been unfairly ambushed by the Eisenhower forces (including Dewey), Taft issued a brief statement after the convention conveying his congratulations and support to Eisenhower. Thereafter, however, he brooded in silence at his summer home in [[Quebec]], complaining, \"Every Republican candidate for President since 1936 has been nominated by the [[Chase (bank)|Chase National Bank]].\"<ref>[[John Nichols (journalist)|Nichols, John]] (December 21, 2011) [http://www.thenation.com/blog/165290/why-do-gop-bosses-fear-ron-paul Why Do GOP Bosses Fear Ron Paul?], ''[[The Nation]]''</ref> As the weeks passed, Eisenhower's aides worried that Taft and his supporters would sit on their hands during the campaign and that as a result Eisenhower might lose the election. In September 1952, Taft finally agreed to meet with Eisenhower, at [[Morningside Heights]] in New York City. There, to gain Taft's support, Eisenhower promised that he would take no reprisals against Taft partisans, would cut federal spending, and would fight \"creeping socialism in every domestic field.\" In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.\n\nEisenhower firmly believed in [[NATO]] and was committed to the US support of anticommunism in the [[Cold War]].\n\n==Senate Majority Leader==\n[[File:RobertATaft83rdCongress.png|thumb|left|190px|Taft during the 83rd Congress, circa 1954]]\nFollowing Eisenhower's election and the Republican takeover of Congress, Taft served as [[Senate Majority Leader]] in 1953, and he strongly supported Eisenhower's domestic proposals. He worked hard to assist the inexperienced new officials of the administration. He even tried, with little success, to curb the excesses of [[red-baiting]] US Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]. By April, Eisenhower and Taft were friends and golfing companions, and Taft was praising his former adversary. Defeat in 1952, it seemed, had softened Taft. No longer burdened by presidential ambitions, he had become less partisan, less abrasive, and more conciliatory; he was now widely regarded as the most powerful man in Congress.\n\nOn May 26, 1953, Taft delivered his final speech, in which he presciently warned of the dangers of America's emerging [[Cold War]] foreign policy, specifically against US military involvement in [[Southeast Asia]], which would later become the [[Vietnam War]]:\n\n{{quote|I have never felt that we should send American soldiers to the Continent of [[Asia]], which, of course, included [[China]] proper and [[Indo-China]], simply because we are so outnumbered in fighting a land war on the Continent of Asia that it would bring about complete exhaustion even if we were able to win. ... So today, as since 1947 in Europe and 1950 in Asia, we are really trying to arm the world against [[Soviet Union|Communist Russia]], or at least furnish all the assistance which can be of use to them in opposing [[Communism]].\n\nIs this policy of uniting the free world against Communism in time of peace going to be a practical long-term policy? I have always been a skeptic on the subject of the military practicability of NATO. ... I have always felt that we should not attempt to fight Russia on the ground on the Continent of Europe any more than we should attempt to fight China on the Continent of Asia.<ref>[[Murray Rothbard|Rothbard, Murray]].

Some of his doctors advocated exploratory surgery to keep the malignancy from spreading, while other physicians thought the tumors had spread too far, were inoperable, and recommended x-ray therapy to keep him comfortable.<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 606\">(Patterson, p. 606)</ref> After his death, an autopsy determined that Taft had been stricken with [[pancreatic cancer]], which had quickly reached [[metastasis]] and spread throughout his body.<ref name=Wead>{{cite book|title=All the Presidents' Children: Triumph and Tragedy in the Lives of America's First Families |last=Wead |first=Doug|authorlink=Doug Wead|year=2004|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-7434-4633-4|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DiM40pyc8xwC}}</ref>\n\nOn June 10, 1953, Taft held a press conference in which he transferred his duties as Senate Majority Leader to Senator [[William F. Knowland]] of California. He did not resign his Senate seat and told reporters that he expected to recover and return to work.<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 606\"/> However, his condition rapidly worsened, and Taft returned to New York Hospital for surgery on July 4 during a Senate recess. The surgery \"did not take long, for the doctors discovered cancer everywhere ... there was no longer any doubt\" that his condition was terminal.<ref>(Patterson, p. 611)</ref> He died at New York Hospital on July 31, following a final brain hemorrhage just hours after his wife's final visit.<ref name=Wead/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1953/10/03/page/7/article/tafts-cancer-originated-in-pancreas-doctor-says|title=Taft's Cancer Originated in Pancreas, Doctor says|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=October 3, 1953|page=7}}</ref> His body [[lying in state#United States|lay in state]] at the [[United States Capitol rotunda]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title= Lying in State or in Honor |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=September 1, 2018}}</ref> where thousands of mourners offered their respects at his coffin.<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 612\">(Patterson, p. 612)</ref> On August 3, 1953, a memorial service was held in the rotunda; in addition to his family the service was attended by Eisenhower, Vice President [[Nixon]], the cabinet, members of the Supreme Court, and Taft's congressional colleagues. Following the service his body was flown to [[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]], where he was buried in a private ceremony at Indian Hill Episcopal Church Cemetery.<ref name=\"Patterson, p. 612\"/>\n\nIn 1957, a committee led by Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] selected Taft as one of five great senators whose portraits would adorn the President's Room off the Senate floor. Kennedy would feature him in ''[[Profiles in Courage]]'', and Taft continues to be regarded by historians as one of the most powerful senators of the 20th century.<ref>(Patterson, p. 617)</ref>\n\n===Memorial===\n{{Main|Robert A.

When finished, this area will include a new library, commercial, institutional and office space as well as an underground parking lot. The private enterprise partner for the project is Ottawa-based Windmill Development Group; there was also discussion about an additional partnership with [[Conestoga College]] and the [[YMCA]]. Actual construction was not expected to start until 2023.

After the merger was completed in January 2019, the City received a 4.63 per cent stake in Alectra and a one-time dividend of $18.5 million; afterwards, annual dividends would be received. The city has one permanent seat on the company's Board.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guelph Hydro, Alectra merger approved|url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4808710/guelph-hydro-alectra-utilities-merger/|date=2 January 2019|work=Global News|access-date=22 February 2019|language=en-CA|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223020906/https://globalnews.ca/news/4808710/guelph-hydro-alectra-utilities-merger/|archive-date=February 23, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Topography and water courses===\nDowntown Guelph is situated above the confluence of the [[Speed River]] and the [[Eramosa River]], which have numerous tributaries. The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the [[Grand River (Ontario)]]. There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several [[drumlin]]s and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThis region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] '''Dfb''' zone, with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was {{convert|38.3|C|1}} on 6 August 1918 and 13 July 1936.<ref name=\"August 1918\"/><ref name=\"July 1936\"/> The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-37.2|C|1}} on 25 January 1884.<ref name=\"January 1884\"/>\n\n{{Weather box\n| location     =

The Speed River enters from the north and the Eramosa River from the east; the two rivers meet below downtown and continue southwest, where they merge with the [[Grand River (Ontario)]]. There are also many creeks and smaller rivers creating large tracts of densely forested ravines, and providing ideal sites for parks and recreational trails. The city is built on several [[drumlin]]s and buried waterways, the most notable being an underground creek flowing below the Albion Hotel, once the source of water used to brew beer.\n\n===Climate===\n\nThis region of Ontario has cold winters and warm, humid summers, falling into the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] '''Dfb''' zone, with moderately high rainfall and snowfall. It is generally a couple of degrees cooler than lower elevation regions on the [[Great Lakes|Great Lake]]s shorelines, especially so in winter, the exception being on some spring afternoons when the lack of an onshore breeze boosts temperatures well above those found lakeside.\n\nThe highest temperature ever recorded in Guelph was {{convert|38.3|C|1}} on 6 August 1918 and 13 July 1936.<ref

He is also roommates with Mac and often takes the lead in many of the gang's schemes.\n\n==Overview==\nDennis is the twin brother of Dee and co-owner of Paddy's Pub. He has been friends with Mac and Charlie since childhood. The most psychopathic member of the group, Dennis is narcissistic, hypersexual, selfish, and abrasive. He is a graduate of the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and has shown to have extensive knowledge of [[psychology]]. Dennis has shown to be predatory towards women, as shown in a self-described system where he exploits women's trust and abuses them emotionally in order to have sex with them known as the D.E.N.N.I.S system.

He was raised by his mother Barbara and father Frank. In the Season 2 finale, \"Dennis and Dee Get a New Dad\", Dennis and Dee find out from their mother that they are the children of Bruce Mathis, a wealthy, kind-hearted philanthropist whom Barbara had an affair with. Dennis was beloved by his mother, who left him with her mansion after her death (on the condition that Frank would not be allowed to enter the property). He considered himself to be popular in high school, although it was later revealed that he was never that popular and that his prom date slept with Mac. Dennis graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with a minor in psychology and was a member of the Delta Omega Lambada fraternity. \n===Personality===\nDennis is easily the most psychopathic member of the gang, having displayed signs of [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] and [[Borderline personality disorder]].{{cn|date=April 2020}} The latter of which he was diagnosed and prescribed medicine with in the Season 10 episode \"Psycho Pete Returns\".

The car was blown up with a [[bazooka]] after Dennis leaves for North Dakota at the Season 12 finale. He would purchase a near-identical Range Rover in the Season 13 episode \"The Gang Gets New Wheels\".\n\n===Sexuality===\nDennis has shown to be predatory towards women. He lost his virginity at age 14 when he had sex with his school librarian Ms. Klinsky. He keeps a camcorder in his bedroom, which he uses to record every woman he had sex with and keeps and rates each tape. He has a self-designed \"D.E.N.N.I.S System\", where he gaslights and emotionally abuses women in order to have sex with them before abandoning them. It has been implied that Dennis is a serial rapist, as he has claimed that the words 'no', 'stop' and 'don't' never stops him from going ahead with his advances and that a woman in the middle of the ocean won't turn down sex because of \n'the implication'. He revealed in the Season 13 episode \"Time's Up for The Gang\" that he has received text messages giving consent from every woman he had sex with, although he implies that he may have sent them himself. It was revealed in the Season 8 finale \"Reynolds v. Reynolds: The cereal defense\" that Dennis has numerous bench warrants of sexual misconduct against him in court.\n\n===Relationship with the Gang===\nDennis has known Mac and Charlie since childhood and is roommates with Mac. They shared an apartment together until it was burned down in the Season 9 finale \"The Gang Squashes Their Beefs\". They then moved into Dee's apartment and had to share a bed with an old man as a part of a bet with Frank (\"Mac and Dennis Move to the Suburbs\"). Their old apartment was rebuilt in Season 12, and both Mac and Dennis moved back by Season 13. Dennis often partners up with Mac for numerous schemes, including the aliases \"Honey and Vinegar\" as well as selling merchandise for Paddy's Pub together. They also heavily rely on each other in their personal lives, one instance being Dennis having Mac skin an apple before eating it (\"Mac and Dennis Break Up\"). Despite their friendship, Dennis is often annoyed at Mac, mostly for his apparent attraction to him. \n\nDennis views Dee as inferior to him and is controlling for her. Often joining the remainder of the gang in mocking and despising Dee. Despite their sibling rivalry, Dennis and Dee often teams up together, especially in the game of Chardee MacDennis, where Dennis and Dee perform exceptionally against Mac, Charlie, and Frank. There are also instances where Dennis looks out for Dee, such as when he showed care for her when she gives birth and when he became concerned that she will fail miserably when her stand-up career began to apparently take off. \n\nLike his sister, Dennis despises Frank as a father. And at the start of the series was reluctant to let Frank join 'The Gang'. After it was revealed that Frank is not their biological father, both Dennis and Dee stopped treating him like a father merely as a member of the gang. Their relationship remained relatively hostile in the earlier seasons of the series, with Frank at one point selling Dennis out to prostitution in order to pay off $25,000 owned to the mafia (\"The Gang Gets Whacked\"). Over time, however, Dennis begins to partner with Frank more often, including helping him cook up Paddy's books through several money laundering outlets (\"Sweet Dee Gets Audited\") and teaming up together to buy out a ski resort (\"The Gang Hits the Slopes\"). \n\n===Family===\nIn the Season 6 premiere \"Mac Fights Gay Marriage\", Dennis marries Maureen Ponderosa, his high school sweetheart. After falling out with her, Dennis attempts to divorce Maureen, but she hires The Lawyer to negotiate with Jack Kelly, Dennis's lawyer. They reached a settlement where Maureen agrees divorces Dennis on the grounds that he pays for her alimony and $90,000 debt, much to Dennis's displeasure. In Season 8, Dennis attempts to have Maureen sign off their alimony agreement as she prepares to marry Liam McPoyle, but Dennis has sex with her upon seeing her breast implants. The wedding would later be called off when chaos breaks out after Maureen's brother Bill spiked the wedding milk bowl. Over time, Maureen begins to transform herself into a cat through plastic surgery as well as cat-like behavior, naming herself 'Bistet'. She dies in season 12 after attempting to climb the roof of a building and falling off. \n\nIn the Season 12 finale \"Dennis' Double Life\", Dennis finds out that he has fathered a child in North Dakota after a layover there (\"The Gang Beats Boggs\"). He attempts to fake his own death to avoid caring for the child, but later decides to move to North Dakota to raise him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-glenn-howerton-dennis-fxx-return-date-1202418979/ |title=Paddy's At Capacity For Dennis?

It has been implied that Dennis is a serial rapist, as he has claimed that the words 'no', 'stop' and 'don't' never stops him from going ahead with his advances and that a woman in the middle of the ocean won't turn down sex because of \n'the implication'. He revealed in the Season 13 episode \"Time's Up for The Gang\" that he has received text messages giving consent from every woman he had sex with, although he implies that he may have sent them himself. It was revealed in the Season 8 finale \"Reynolds v. Reynolds: The cereal defense\" that Dennis has numerous bench warrants of sexual misconduct against him in court.\n\n===Relationship with the Gang===\nDennis has known Mac and Charlie since childhood and is roommates with Mac. They shared an apartment together until it was burned down in the Season 9 finale \"The Gang Squashes Their Beefs\". They then moved into Dee's apartment and had to share a bed with an old man as a part of a bet with Frank (\"Mac and Dennis Move to the Suburbs\"). Their old apartment was rebuilt in Season 12, and both Mac and Dennis moved back by Season 13. Dennis often partners up with Mac for numerous schemes, including the aliases \"Honey and Vinegar\" as well as selling merchandise for Paddy's Pub together. They also heavily rely on each other in their personal lives, one instance being Dennis having Mac skin an apple before eating it (\"Mac and Dennis Break Up\"). Despite their friendship, Dennis is often annoyed at Mac, mostly for his apparent attraction to him. \n\nDennis views Dee as inferior to him and is controlling for her. Often joining the remainder of the gang in mocking and despising Dee. Despite their sibling rivalry, Dennis and Dee often teams up together, especially in the game of Chardee MacDennis, where Dennis and Dee perform exceptionally against Mac, Charlie, and Frank. There are also instances where Dennis looks out for Dee, such as when he showed care for her when she gives birth and when he became concerned that she will fail miserably when her stand-up career began to apparently take off. \n\nLike his sister, Dennis despises Frank as a father. And at the start of the series was reluctant to let Frank join 'The Gang'. After it was revealed that Frank is not their biological father, both Dennis and Dee stopped treating him like a father merely as a member of the gang. Their relationship remained relatively hostile in the earlier seasons of the series, with Frank at one point selling Dennis out to prostitution in order to pay off $25,000 owned to the mafia (\"The Gang Gets Whacked\"). Over time, however, Dennis begins to partner with Frank more often, including helping him cook up Paddy's books through several money laundering outlets (\"Sweet Dee Gets Audited\") and teaming up together to buy out a ski resort (\"The Gang Hits the Slopes\"). \n\n===Family===\nIn the Season 6 premiere \"Mac Fights Gay Marriage\", Dennis marries Maureen Ponderosa, his high school sweetheart. After falling out with her, Dennis attempts to divorce Maureen, but she hires The Lawyer to negotiate with Jack Kelly, Dennis's lawyer. They reached a settlement where Maureen agrees divorces Dennis on the grounds that he pays for her alimony and $90,000 debt, much to Dennis's displeasure. In Season 8, Dennis attempts to have Maureen sign off their alimony agreement as she prepares to marry Liam McPoyle, but Dennis has sex with her upon seeing her breast implants. The wedding would later be called off when chaos breaks out after Maureen's brother Bill spiked the wedding milk bowl. Over time, Maureen begins to transform herself into a cat through plastic surgery as well as cat-like behavior, naming herself 'Bistet'. She dies in season 12 after attempting to climb the roof of a building and falling off. \n\nIn the Season 12 finale \"Dennis' Double Life\", Dennis finds out that he has fathered a child in North Dakota after a layover there (\"The Gang Beats Boggs\"). He attempts to fake his own death to avoid caring for the child, but later decides to move to North Dakota to raise him.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://deadline.com/2018/06/its-always-sunny-in-philadelphia-glenn-howerton-dennis-fxx-return-date-1202418979/ |title=Paddy's At Capacity For Dennis?
