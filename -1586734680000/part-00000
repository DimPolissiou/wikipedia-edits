It is an Indian-American co-production, jointly produced by Pratap Reddy from Prspctvs Productions and Sunmin Park from Maxmedia.\n\n''Thithi'' premiered at the 68th [[Locarno International Film Festival]] on 8 August 2015, where it won the [[Golden Leopard]] in the \"Filmmakers of the Present\" category as well as the First Feature award. Consequently, it was screened at various film festivals around the world and won numerous awards including the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Kannada]] at the [[63rd National Film Awards]]. It was released in [[Karnataka]] on 6 May 2016 and in the rest of India on 3 June 2016 to generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n''Thithi'' is a dramatic comedy about how three generations of sons react to the death of the oldest in their clan, a man named Century Gowda: a locally renowned, highly cantankerous 101-year-old man. Set in a remote village in [[Karnataka]], the three storylines intertwine before converging at Century Gowda\u2019s \u2018''thithi''\u2019 \u2014  the final funeral celebration, 11 days after a death.\n\nCentury Gowda\u2019s eldest son, Gaddappa (literally translating to \"Beard Man\"), is himself a little old man who spends his time nonchalantly wandering the village fields, puffing cheap cigarettes and swigging brandy. Gaddappa\u2019s far more materialistic son, Thammanna, plots to illegally sell Century Gowda\u2019s five-acre property, even though the land officially belongs to his father. At the same time, Thammanna\u2019s confident pubescent son, Abhi, shrugs his responsibilities to relentlessly pursue a shepherd girl, Kavery (Pooja S.M.)\n\n== Cast ==\n* Channegowda as Gaddappa\n* Thammegowda as Thammanna\n* Abhishek H.N as Abhi\n* Pooja S.M. as Kaveri\n* Singrigowda as Century Gowda\n\n==Development And Production==\nThe seed that gave rise to Thithi was planted during a visit that Reddy made to Nodekoppalu village in the Mandya district of Karnataka, the home town of the film's co-writer Eregowda. Reddy found the village, seen through the eyes of an insider, to contain within itself a highly cinematic world. Reddy then did a year-long stint at [[Prague Film School]]. Upon returning, re-visited the area frequently, conducting a three-month exploratory process to better acquaint himself with the world. During this process, Eregowda and Reddy met and decided to revolve the film around three protagonists, Channegowda (Gaddappa), Thammegowda S. (Thammanna), and Abhishek H.N. (Abhi), even before the idea for the story of the film had taken shape. Keeping the true life personalities of these three leads in mind, Reddy and Eregowda then began developing a screenplay that revolved around the death and thithi of a 101-year old cantankerous centenarian, Century Gowda. After Reddy and Eregowda finished the script, they had an ambitious 160 page screenplay with over a hundred characters. They then moved into pre-production work which included an eight-month long casting process to find actors to fill out smaller roles and putting together a crew for the film. At this stage, DoP Doron Tempert, Reddy's batchmate from Prague Film School, joined the development process and started building the story-telling style and approach with Reddy.\n\nProduction started in [[Nodekoppalu]] in January 2014. The film was shot in multiple schedules split over a period of five months, the longevity of the shoot owing to the logistical challenges of working with non-actors. When the film was in the rough cut stage, the film made it into [[National Film Development Corporation of India|NFDC]]'s Film Bazaar where it was adjudged as the Best Work In Progress fiction feature and awarded a free [[Digital intermediate|Digital Intermediate]] at Prasad Labs, Mumbai. The film, still a work-in-progress, premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in August, and then went on to have its Indian Premiere at the [[Mumbai Film Festival]]. The film was finally completed in December 2015.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[The Times of India]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Thithi Movie Review, Trailer, & Show timings at Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movie-reviews/Thithi/movie-review/52163508.cms|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=The Times of India|publisher=Sunayana Suresh|date=7  May 2016}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Deccan Chronicle]]\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Thithi movie review: Entertainment with 'real' fun|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/080516/thithi-movie-review-entertainment-with-real-fun.html|accessdate=15 October 2016|publisher=SHASHIPRASAD SM|date=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n| rev3 = [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title='Thithi': Ground-breaking, rule-bending masterpiece|url=http://www.ianslive.in/index.php?param=review/8/1/Thithi_Ground_breaking_rule_bending_masterpiece-328|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=IANS Live|publisher=Subhash K.

It was released in [[Karnataka]] on 6 May 2016 and in the rest of India on 3 June 2016 to generally positive reviews.\n\n==Plot==\n''Thithi'' is a dramatic comedy about how three generations of sons react to the death of the oldest in their clan, a man named Century Gowda: a locally renowned, highly cantankerous 101-year-old man. Set in a remote village in [[Karnataka]], the three storylines intertwine before converging at Century Gowda\u2019s \u2018''thithi''\u2019 \u2014  the final funeral celebration, 11 days after a death.\n\nCentury Gowda\u2019s eldest son, Gaddappa (literally translating to \"Beard Man\"), is himself a little old man who spends his time nonchalantly wandering the village fields, puffing cheap cigarettes and swigging brandy. Gaddappa\u2019s far more materialistic son, Thammanna, plots to illegally sell Century Gowda\u2019s five-acre property, even though the land officially belongs to his father. At the same time, Thammanna\u2019s confident pubescent son, Abhi, shrugs his responsibilities to relentlessly pursue a shepherd girl, Kavery (Pooja S.M.)\n\n== Cast ==\n* Channegowda as Gaddappa\n* Thammegowda as Thammanna\n* Abhishek H.N as Abhi\n* Pooja S.M. as Kaveri\n* Singrigowda as Century Gowda\n\n==Development And Production==\nThe seed that gave rise to Thithi was planted during a visit that Reddy made to Nodekoppalu village in the Mandya district of Karnataka, the home town of the film's co-writer Eregowda. Reddy found the village, seen through the eyes of an insider, to contain within itself a highly cinematic world. Reddy then did a year-long stint at [[Prague Film School]]. Upon returning, re-visited the area frequently, conducting a three-month exploratory process to better acquaint himself with the world. During this process, Eregowda and Reddy met and decided to revolve the film around three protagonists, Channegowda (Gaddappa), Thammegowda S. (Thammanna), and Abhishek H.N. (Abhi), even before the idea for the story of the film had taken shape. Keeping the true life personalities of these three leads in mind, Reddy and Eregowda then began developing a screenplay that revolved around the death and thithi of a 101-year old cantankerous centenarian, Century Gowda. After Reddy and Eregowda finished the script, they had an ambitious 160 page screenplay with over a hundred characters. They then moved into pre-production work which included an eight-month long casting process to find actors to fill out smaller roles and putting together a crew for the film. At this stage, DoP Doron Tempert, Reddy's batchmate from Prague Film School, joined the development process and started building the story-telling style and approach with Reddy.\n\nProduction started in [[Nodekoppalu]] in January 2014. The film was shot in multiple schedules split over a period of five months, the longevity of the shoot owing to the logistical challenges of working with non-actors. When the film was in the rough cut stage, the film made it into [[National Film Development Corporation of India|NFDC]]'s Film Bazaar where it was adjudged as the Best Work In Progress fiction feature and awarded a free [[Digital intermediate|Digital Intermediate]] at Prasad Labs, Mumbai. The film, still a work-in-progress, premiered at the Locarno Film Festival in August, and then went on to have its Indian Premiere at the [[Mumbai Film Festival]]. The film was finally completed in December 2015.\n\n==Reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = [[The Times of India]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Thithi Movie Review, Trailer, & Show timings at Times of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/kannada/movie-reviews/Thithi/movie-review/52163508.cms|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=The Times of India|publisher=Sunayana Suresh|date=7  May 2016}}</ref>\n| rev2 = [[Deccan Chronicle]]\n| rev2Score = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title=Thithi movie review: Entertainment with 'real' fun|url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/entertainment/movie-reviews/080516/thithi-movie-review-entertainment-with-real-fun.html|accessdate=15 October 2016|publisher=SHASHIPRASAD SM|date=8 May 2016}}</ref>\n| rev3 = [[Indo-Asian News Service|IANS]]\n| rev3Score = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite news|title='Thithi': Ground-breaking, rule-bending masterpiece|url=http://www.ianslive.in/index.php?param=review/8/1/Thithi_Ground_breaking_rule_bending_masterpiece-328|accessdate=15 October 2016|work=IANS Live|publisher=Subhash K.
