In the segments, Slater would enter the ring and issue challenges to \"the so-called legends\" or \"any former WWE champion\", which resulted in him losing a series of [[squash match]]es, with the first two losses to [[Big Van Vader|Vader]] and [[Sid Eudy|Sycho Sid]]. He was further humiliated in a comedic segment by [[Roddy Piper]], [[Wendi Richter]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]]. He defeated [[Doink the Clown]] on the July 2, 2012 edition of ''Raw'', but following the match, [[Diamond Dallas Page]] came to the ring and performed the [[Cutter (professional wrestling)|Diamond Cutter]] on Slater.

Later at [[Survivor Series (2014)|Survivor Series]], Slater remained and Titus O'Neil lost to Adam Rose and The Bunny.

Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging {{cvt|7|\u2013|12|ft|m|frac=2}} in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a [[Beluga sturgeon|beluga]] female captured in the [[Volga estuary]] in 1827, weighing {{cvt|1,571|kg|lb}} and {{cvt|7.2|m|ft}} long. Most sturgeons are [[anadromous]] [[benthos|bottom-feeders]], which migrate upstream to spawn, but spend most of their lives feeding in [[river deltas]] and [[estuaries]]. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively, while others primarily inhabit marine environments near [[coastal]] areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.\n\nSeveral species of sturgeon are harvested for their [[roe]], which is processed into the [[luxury good|luxury food]] [[caviar]]. This has led to serious [[overexploitation]], which combined with other conservation threats, has brought most of the species to [[critically endangered]] status, at the edge of [[extinction]].\n\n==Physical characteristics==\n[[File:NIE 1905 Sturgeon - Skull.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25<!--fmt for very low img-->|Sturgeon skull \u2013 a, Rostrum; b, nasal capsule; c eye-socket; d, foramina for spinal nerves; e, notochord; g, quadrate bone; h, hyomandibular bone; i, mandible; j. basibranchials; k, ribs; l, hyoid bone; I, II, III, IV, V, branchial arches]]\n\nSturgeons retain several primitive characters among the [[bony fishes]].

Their average lifespan is 50 to 60 years, and their first [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] does not occur until they are around 15 to 20 years old. Sturgeons are broadcast spawners, and do not spawn every year because they require specific conditions. Those requirements may or may not be met every year due to varying environmental conditions, such as the proper [[photoperiod]] in spring, clear water with shallow rock or gravel [[Substrate (marine biology)|substrate]], where the eggs can adhere, and proper water temperature and flow for [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] of the eggs.

Their average lifespan is 50 to 60 years, and their first [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]] does not occur until they are around 15 to 20 years old. Sturgeons are broadcast spawners, and do not spawn every year because they require specific conditions.

After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart before the magazine disqualified it from being included on the chart on grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of [[country music]]. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both the original version of the song and the remix featuring Cyrus eventually peaked at number one on the flagship ''Billboard'' chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], for a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks]]. Internationally, one or more versions of \"Old Town Road\" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and charted within the top 10 in various other markets. \n\nThe song was awarded [[Recording Industry Association of America#\"Digital\" single certification|diamond certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], in October 2019, for moving ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/lil-nas-x-takes-the-old-town-road-to-diamond-status-be-1839292040|title=Lil Nas X Takes the 'Old Town Road' to Diamond Status, Becomes Fastest Song Ever to Do So|last=|first=|date=|website=The Root|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> The remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and won for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lil Nas X (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Lil Nas X (pictured) bought the beat for \"Old Town Road\" anonymously on an online store from producer YoungKio for $30.<ref name=\"BI\"/>]]\n[[Country rap]], and its subgenre, country trap, emerged onto the mainstream following American rapper [[Young Thug]]'s experimental mixtape ''[[Beautiful Thugger Girls]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"ThugSlime\"/> Lil Nas X has cited Young Thug as a pioneer of country trap.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> In May 2018, [[Lil Tracy]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]] reignited the trend with their country rap single \"Like a Farmer (Remix)\".<ref name=\"ThugSlime\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8503019/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-five-things-to-know|title=5 Things to Know About 'Old Town Road' Rapper Lil Nas X|work=Billboard|author=Michael Saponara|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/27/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-country-chart-removal|title=Billboard erases Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' from country music chart|website=[[The Fader]]|author=Salvatore Maicki|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019|quote=Lil Nas X's hit is one of the latest entries in a storied canon of country rap, a trend reignited last year by Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert's \"Like a Farmer.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue a music career, but was discouraged by his parents.

2018. After gaining popularity, the single was re-released by [[Columbia Records]] in March 2019. Lil Nas X also recorded a remix with American country singer [[Billy Ray Cyrus]], which was released on April 5, 2019. Both the original and remix were included on Lil Nas X's debut EP, ''[[7 (Lil Nas X EP)|7]]'' (2019).\n\nThe song has been widely labeled as \"[[country rap]]\", a genre that had not often reached the mainstream prior to its release. Dutch record producer [[YoungKio]] produced the instrumental and made it available for purchase online in 2018. It features a [[Sampling (music)|sample]] of a [[banjo]] from \"[[Ghosts I\u2013IV|34 Ghosts IV]]\" by American industrial rock band [[Nine Inch Nails]]. The sample was placed behind [[Trap music|trap]]-style [[Roland TR-808]] drums and bass. Lil Nas X purchased the instrumental for US$30 and recorded \"Old Town Road\" in one day. At the time, he had been living with his sister after dropping out of college; his real world struggles served as an influence on some of the lyrics.\n\nThe song initially gained popularity on social video sharing app [[TikTok]] and eventually entered the [[Billboard charts|''Billboard'' charts]] in March 2019. The song reached number 19 on the [[Billboard (magazine)|''Billboard'']] [[Hot Country Songs]] chart before the magazine disqualified it from being included on the chart on grounds that it did not fit the genre, sparking a debate on the definition of [[country music]]. Though it was not re-entered onto the overall country charts, both the original version of the song and the remix featuring Cyrus eventually peaked at number one on the flagship ''Billboard'' chart, the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]], for a [[List of Billboard Hot 100 chart achievements and milestones#Most weeks at number one on the Billboard Hot 100|record-breaking nineteen consecutive weeks]]. Internationally, one or more versions of \"Old Town Road\" have topped the national singles charts in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom; and charted within the top 10 in various other markets. \n\nThe song was awarded [[Recording Industry Association of America#\"Digital\" single certification|diamond certification]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], in October 2019, for moving ten million total units in the United States, the fastest song to be awarded diamond certification.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thegrapevine.theroot.com/lil-nas-x-takes-the-old-town-road-to-diamond-status-be-1839292040|title=Lil Nas X Takes the 'Old Town Road' to Diamond Status, Becomes Fastest Song Ever to Do So|last=|first=|date=|website=The Root|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=October 24, 2019}}</ref> The remix featuring Billy Ray Cyrus was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]] and won for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] and [[Grammy Award for Best Music Video|Best Music Video]] at the [[62nd Annual Grammy Awards]].\n\n==Background and recording==\n[[File:Lil Nas X (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|180px|Lil Nas X (pictured) bought the beat for \"Old Town Road\" anonymously on an online store from producer YoungKio for $30.<ref name=\"BI\"/>]]\n[[Country rap]], and its subgenre, country trap, emerged onto the mainstream following American rapper [[Young Thug]]'s experimental mixtape ''[[Beautiful Thugger Girls]]'' (2017).<ref name=\"ThugSlime\"/> Lil Nas X has cited Young Thug as a pioneer of country trap.<ref name=\"TIME\"/> In May 2018, [[Lil Tracy]] and [[Lil Uzi Vert]] reignited the trend with their country rap single \"Like a Farmer (Remix)\".<ref name=\"ThugSlime\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/8503019/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-five-things-to-know|title=5 Things to Know About 'Old Town Road' Rapper Lil Nas X|work=Billboard|author=Michael Saponara|date=March 22, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefader.com/2019/03/27/lil-nas-x-old-town-road-billboard-country-chart-removal|title=Billboard erases Lil Nas X's 'Old Town Road' from country music chart|website=[[The Fader]]|author=Salvatore Maicki|date=March 27, 2019|accessdate=March 29, 2019|quote=Lil Nas X's hit is one of the latest entries in a storied canon of country rap, a trend reignited last year by Lil Tracy and Lil Uzi Vert's \"Like a Farmer.\"}}</ref>\n\nIn 2018, Lil Nas X dropped out of college to pursue a music career, but was discouraged by his parents.
