After a successful course of study at the [[Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour|Coll\u00e8ge Rollin]], he went to [[University of Munich|Munich]] in autumn 1839, where he attended the lectures of [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], and took his degree in philosophy in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of his famous work ''Essai sur la m\u00e9taphysique d'Aristote'' (\"Essay on the Metaphysics of Aristotle\"), to which in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not only criticizes and comments on the theories of [[Aristotle]] and the [[Peripatetic school|Peripatetic]]s, but also develops from them a modern philosophical system.\n\nIn 1838 he received his doctorate, his thesis entitled \"De l'habitude\" (\"On Habit\"), which was to become a classic text (a metaphysical 'poem' on nature in general apprehended through an intuitive analysis of acquired habit as a particular manifestation of its essential being, much admired by Bergson and Heidegger), and became professor of philosophy at [[Rennes]]. From 1840 he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in 1860 became inspector-general in the department of higher education. He was also a member of the [[Acad\u00e9mie des Sciences Morales et Politiques|Academy of Moral and Political Sciences]], and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the [[Louvre]] (from 1870). He died in [[Paris]].\n\nIn philosophy, he was one of the school of [[Victor Cousin]], with whom he was at issue in many important points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis of all knowledge. Acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later years of the 19th century.\n\n==Bibliography==\n\nRavaisson's chief philosophical works are: \"''Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton''\" (in the ''[[Revue des Deux Mondes]]'', November, 1840); ''Rapport sur le stoicisme'' (1851); ''La Philosophie en France au dix-neuvi\u00e8me si\u00e8cle'' (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); ''Morale et m\u00e9taphysique'' (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson was also an archaeologist, and contributed articles on ancient sculpture to the ''Revue Arch\u00e9ologique'' and the ''M\u00e9moires de l'Acad\u00e9mie des Inscriptions''.

One of which was the Natchez in Southern Mississippi. In the 1720s trouble developed between the French and the Natchez Indians that would be called the Natchez War or [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Revolt]]. 230 colonists were killed and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.\n\nThe conflict between the two parties was a direct result of Lieutenant d\u2019Etcheparre (more commonly known as [[Natchez revolt|Sieur de Ch\u00e9part]]), the commandant at the settlement near the Natchez, decided in 1729 that the Natchez Indians should surrender both their cultivated crop lands and their town of White Apple to the French. The Natchez pretended to surrender and actually worked for the French in the hunting game, but as soon as they were weaponized, they struck back and killed several men, resulting in the colonists fleeing downriver to New Orleans. The fleeing colonist sought protection from what they feared might be a colony-wide Indian uprising. The Natchez, however, did not press on after their surprise attack, leaving them vulnerable enough for King Louis XV's appointed governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] to reclaim the settlement.\n\nRelations with Louisiana's Indians, a problem inherited from Bienville, remained a concern for the next governor, [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]<nowiki/>. In the early 1740s traders from the British colonies of the Atlantic coast crossed into the Appalachian Mountains. The Native nations in between the French colonials and British colonials would now operate dependent on which of the two colonies would most benefit them. Several of these tribes and especially the [[Chickasaw|Chicksaw]] and [[Choctaw]] would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Louisiana : a history|last=Cummins, Light Townsend|isbn=978-1118619292|oclc=861648007|year= 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe economic problems under Vaudreuil would not allow the French to outcompete the British and resulted in many of Louisiana's Native American revolts. In 1747 and 1748 the Chicksaw would raid along the east bank of the Mississippi all the way south to Baton Rouge. These actions supported by the British colonials would force residents of French Louisiana to take refuge in New Orleans.\n\n=== Slavery in French Louisiana ===\nInability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the early French colony. Colonists turned to African slavery to make their investments in Louisiana profitable. In the late 1710s the international slave trade imported enslaved Africans. This led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span.\n\nBy 1724, the large number of blacks in Louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony. These laws required that slaves be baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, slaves be married in the Church, and gave slaves no legal rights. The slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the [[Code Noir]], which would bleed into the antebellum period of the American South as well. Louisiana slave culture had its own distinct Afro-Creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the New World. Afro-Creole was present in religious beliefs and the Louisiana Creole dialect. The religion most associated with this period for was called [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].\n\n=== Religion and architecture from across the world ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the city of New Orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today. By the end of French colonization in Louisiana, New Orleans was recognized commercially in the Atlantic world. Its inhabitants traded across the French commercial system. New Orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the North American continent.\n\nIn one instance the French government established a chapter house of sisters in New Orleans. The [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline sisters]] after being sponsored by the [[Company of the Indies]], founded a convent in the city in 1727. At the end of the colonial era, the Ursuline Academy maintained a house of seventy boarding and one hundred day students. Today numerous schools in New Orleans can trace their lineage from this academy.\n[[File:Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer - Louisiane - Adrien de Pauger - 1724 - 001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer \u2013 Louisiane \u2013 Adrien de Pauger \u2013 1724 \u2013 001]]\nAnother notable example is the streetplan and architecture still distinguishing New Orleans today. French Louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings. Pierre Le Blond de Tour and [[Adrien de Pauger]], for example, planned many early fortifications, along with the street plan for the city of New Orleans. After them in the 1740s, Ignace Fran\u00e7ois Broutin, as engineer-in-chief of Louisiana, reworked the architecture of New Orleans with an extensive public works program.\n\nFrench policy-makers in Paris attempted to set political and economic norms for New Orleans. It acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects, but also stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well.\n\n=== Post-Treaty of Paris ===\nAfter the French relinquished West Louisiana to the Spanish, New Orleans merchants attempted to ignore Spanish rule and even re-institute French control on the colony. The citizens of New Orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of Spanish rule. Anti-Spanish passions in New Orleans reached their highest level after two years of Spanish administration in Louisiana. On October 27, 1768, a mob of local residents, spiked the guns guarding New Orleans and took control of the city from the Spanish. The rebellion organized a group to sail for Paris, where it met with officials of the French government. This group brought with them a long memorial to summarize the abuses the colony had endured from the Spanish. King Louis XV and his ministers reaffirmed Spain's sovereignty over Louisiana.\n\n===United States territory===\n[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Thereafter, the city grew rapidly with influxes of Americans, [[French people|French]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]]. Later immigrants were [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]]. Major [[commodity crops]] of [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]] were cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on nearby large [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]].\n\nThousands of [[refugee]]s from the 1804 [[Haitian Revolution]], both [[White people|whites]] and [[free people of color]] (''affranchis'' or ''gens de couleur libres''), arrived in New Orleans; a number brought their slaves with them, many of whom were native Africans or of full-blood descent. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[Free negro|free black]] people, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the [[Territory of Orleans]], Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes.{{sfn|Gitlin |2009|p= 54}}\n\nNearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration brought 2,731 whites, 3,102 free people of color (of [[mixed-race]] European and African descent), and 3,226 slaves of primarily African descent, doubling the city's population. The city became 63 percent black, a greater proportion than [[Charleston, South Carolina]]'s 53 percent.<ref name=\"AAM\">[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=5&topic=3 \"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries\"], ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience'', New York Public Library, accessed May 7, 2008</ref>\n\n===Battle of New Orleans===\n{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of New Orleans (1815)|Battle of New Orleans]] (1815)]]\n[[File:Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans.jpg|alt=Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans : from an actual survey made in 1815|thumb|Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans : from a survey made in 1815<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coololdphotos.com/rare-1815-plan-of-the-city-and-suburbs-of-new-orleans/|title=Rare 1815 Plan of the City and Suburbs of New Orleans|last=Tom|date=2015-03-18|website=Cool Old Photos|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>]]\nDuring the final campaign of the [[War of 1812]], the British sent a force of 11,000 in an attempt to capture New Orleans. Despite great challenges, General [[Andrew Jackson]], with support from the [[U.S. Navy]], successfully cobbled together a force of [[militia]] from Louisiana and [[Mississippi Territory|Mississippi]], including [[free people of color|free men of color]], [[U.S. Army]] regulars, a large contingent of [[Tennessee]] state militia, [[Kentucky]] riflemen, [[Choctaw]] fighters, and local [[privateer]]s (the latter led by the pirate [[Jean Lafitte]]), to decisively defeat the [[British army|British troops]], led by [[Edward Pakenham|Sir Edward Pakenham]], in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815.\n\nThe armies had not learned of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which had been signed on December 24, 1814 (however, the treaty did not call for cessation of hostilities until after both governments had ratified it.

The port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships. Despite its role in the [[slave trade]], New Orleans at the time also had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons of color in the nation, who were often educated, middle-class property owners.<ref name=\"pbsjazz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/places/places_new_orleans.htm|title=New Orleans: The Birthplace of Jazz|website=PBS \u2013 JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns|format=primarily excerpted from Jazz: A History of America's Music|accessdate=May 17, 2006}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Les Gens De Couleur Libres |url=http://www.creolehistory.com/ |accessdate=May 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522221017/http://www.creolehistory.com/ |archivedate=May 22, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Slavery and immigration===\nDwarfing the other cities in the antebellum South, New Orleans had America's largest slave market. The market expanded after the United States ended the international [[Atlantic slave trade|trade]] in 1808. Two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the [[Deep South]] arrived via [[forced migration]] in the domestic [[slave trade]]. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the [[Upper South]] has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy. The [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. The trade spawned an ancillary economy\u2014transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5% of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the [[Plantation era|antebellum period]], with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2, 6</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Paul Lachance,\n\n{{quote|the addition of white immigrants [from Saint-Domingue] to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830.

They maintained instruction in French in two of the city's four school districts (all served white students).{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} In 1860, the city had 13,000 free people of color (''gens de couleur libres''), the class of free, mostly [[Multiracial Americans|mixed-race]] people that expanded in number during French and Spanish rule.

In 1862, following the occupation by the Navy after the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], led by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], a respected state lawyer of the Massachusetts militia, Northern forces occupied the city. Later New Orleans residents nicknamed him \"Beast\" Butler, because of a military order he issued. After his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by Southern women, his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such \"ladies\" as those \"plying their avocation in the streets\", implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes. Accounts of this spread widely. He also came to be called \"Spoons\" Butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nButler abolished French language instruction in city schools. Statewide measures in 1864 and, after the war, 1868 further strengthened the English-only policy imposed by federal representatives. With the predominance of English speakers, that language had already become dominant in business and government.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} By the end of the 19th century, French usage had faded.

The [[Union Army]] eventually extended its control north along the [[Mississippi River]] and along the coastal areas. As a result, most of the southern portion of Louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 \"[[Emancipation Proclamation]]\" issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of Black troops in the War. Led by Brigadier General [[Daniel Ullman]] (1810\u20131892), of the 78th Regiment of New York State Volunteers Militia, they were known as the \"[[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]].\" While that name had been used by a militia before the war, that group was composed of [[free people of color]]. The new group was made up mostly of former slaves. They were supplemented in the last two years of the War by newly organized [[United States Colored Troops]], who played an increasingly important part in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm|title=Usticesi in the United States Civil War|publisher=The Ustica Connection|date=March 22, 2003|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nViolence throughout the South, especially the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]] followed by the [[New Orleans Riot]] in the same year, led Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and [[Texas]] were put under the authority of the \"[[Fifth Military District]]\" of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Its Constitution of 1868 granted [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and established universal [[State school|public education]]. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], who was of [[mixed race]], succeeded [[Henry C. Warmouth|Henry Clay Warmouth]] for a brief period as Republican governor of [[Louisiana]], becoming the first governor of African descent of an [[U.S. state|American state]] (the next African American to serve as governor of an American state was [[Douglas Wilder]], elected in Virginia in 1989). New Orleans operated a racially integrated [[New Orleans Public Schools|public school system]] during this period.\n\nWartime damage to [[levees]] and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade. The federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure. The nationwide financial recession and [[Panic of 1873]] adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery.\n\nFrom 1868, elections in Louisiana were marked by violence, as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gatherings. The disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years. The \"[[White League]]\", an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was organized in 1874 and operated in the open, violently suppressing the black vote and running off Republican officeholders. In 1874, in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], 5,000 members of the White League fought with city police to take over the state offices for the Democratic candidate for governor, holding them for three days. By 1876, such tactics resulted in the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the so-called [[Redeemers]], regaining political control of the state legislature. The federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].\n\n===Jim Crow era===\nWhite Democrats passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, establishing [[racial segregation]] in public facilities. In 1889, the legislature passed a [[constitutional amendment]] incorporating a \"[[grandfather clause]]\" that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] freedmen as well as the propertied people of color manumitted before the war. Unable to vote, African Americans could not serve on juries or in local office, and were closed out of formal politics for generations. The South was ruled by a white Democratic Party. Public schools were [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and remained so until 1960.\n\nNew Orleans' large community of well-educated, often French-speaking [[free persons of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who had been free prior to the Civil War, fought against Jim Crow. They organized the ''Comit\u00e9 des Citoyens'' (Citizens Committee) to work for civil rights. As part of their legal campaign, they recruited one of their own, [[Homer Plessy]], to test whether Louisiana's newly enacted Separate Car Act was constitutional. Plessy boarded a commuter train departing New Orleans for [[Covington, Louisiana]], sat in the car reserved for whites only, and was arrested. The case resulting from this incident, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1896. The court ruled that \"[[separate but equal]]\" accommodations were constitutional, effectively upholding Jim Crow measures. In practice, African-American public schools and facilities were underfunded across the South. The Supreme Court ruling contributed to this period as the [[Nadir of American race relations|nadir of race relations]] in the United States. The rate of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of black men was high across the South, as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose Jim Crow. Nativist prejudices also surfaced. [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italian]] sentiment in 1891 contributed to the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynchings of 11 Italians]], some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief. Some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained. It was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Library of Congress}}|title=Immigration / Italian|website=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Gambino2000\">{{cite book|last=Gambino|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=jA9-dmAsoMwC}}|year=2000|publisher=Guernica Editions|isbn=978-1-55071-103-5|ref=harv}}</ref> In July 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after Robert Charles, a young African American, killed a policeman and temporarily escaped. The mob killed him and an estimated 20 other blacks; seven whites died in the days-long conflict, until a [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] suppressed it.\n\nThroughout New Orleans' history, until the early 20th Century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation, the city suffered repeated [[epidemic]]s of [[yellow fever]] and other tropical and [[Infection|infectious diseases]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:EsplanadeBurgundy1900.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]] at Burgundy Street, looking lakewards north towards [[Lake Ponchartrain]] (1900)]]\n[[File:RationingBoardNOLAVachonC.jpg|right|thumb|1943 waiting line at wartime Rationing Board office in New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans' economic and population zenith in relation to other American cities occurred in the antebellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city in 1860 (after [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]]) and was significantly larger than all other southern cities.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\">Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175.</ref> From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> Thousands of the most ambitious [[Person of color|people of color]] left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] around [[World War II]] and after, many for [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest American cities (New Orleans' population still continued to increase throughout the period, but at a slower rate than before the Civil War).\n\nBy the mid-20th Century, New Orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the [[Southern United States|South]]. By 1950, [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] exceeded New Orleans in size, and in 1960 [[Miami]] eclipsed New Orleans, even as the latter's population reached its historic peak.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> As with other older American cities, highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside. The 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the United States in 1803. The [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] continued expanding in population, albeit more slowly than other major Sun Belt cities. While the [[Port of New Orleans|port]] remained one of the nation's largest, automation and [[containerization]] cost many jobs. The city's former role as banker to the South was supplanted by larger peer cities. New Orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing, but the city's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after World War II. Despite some economic development successes under the administrations of [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|DeLesseps \"Chep\" Morrison]] (1946\u20131961) and [[Victor H. Schiro|Victor \"Vic\" Schiro]] (1961\u20131970), metropolitan New Orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities.\n\n====Civil Rights Movement====\nDuring the later years of Morrison's administration, and for the entirety of Schiro's, the city was a center of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] was founded in New Orleans, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). When six-year-old [[Ruby Bridges]] integrated [[William Frantz Elementary School]] in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement's success in gaining federal passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] renewed constitutional rights, including voting for blacks. Together, these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in New Orleans' 20th century history.<ref>Germany, Kent B., ''New Orleans After the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship and the Search for the Great Society'', Athens, 2007, pp. 3\u20135</ref> Though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s, a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city's White and African-American communities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glassman, James K., \"New Orleans: I have Seen the Future, and It's Houston\", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1978</ref> As the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city, its population's income level dropped, and it became proportionately more African American. From 1980, the African-American majority elected primarily officials from its own community. They struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the African-American community.\n\nNew Orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of [[Sidney Barthelemy]] (1986\u20131994) and [[Marc Morial]] (1994\u20132002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the city's prosperity in the later decades of the century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.\n\n====Drainage and flood control====\n{{See also|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\n[[File:LPD18USSNewOrleansPassingNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A view of the [[New Orleans Central Business District]] as seen from the [[Mississippi River]]. {{USS|New Orleans|LPD-18}} in foreground (2007)]]\n\nIn the 20th century, New Orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city's expansion. The most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor [[A.

In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually became aware of the city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from [[Hurricane Betsy]] killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood|flood of May 8, 1995]], demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity. By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing [[Coastal erosion|erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans]], especially that related to the [[Mississippi River \u2013 Gulf Outlet Canal]], had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic [[storm surge]]s.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Hurricane Katrina====\n[[File:Katrina 2nd landfall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] at its New Orleans landfall]]\n{{See also|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\nNew Orleans was catastrophically affected by what Raymond B.

''Mardi Gras'' (French for \"Fat Tuesday\"), the final and grandest day of traditional Catholic festivities, is the last Tuesday before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], which commences on [[Ash Wednesday]].\n\nThe largest of the city's many music festivals is the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. Commonly referred to simply as \"Jazz Fest\", it is one of the nation's largest music festivals. The festival features a variety of music, including both native Louisiana and international artists. Along with Jazz Fest, New Orleans' [[Voodoo Experience]] (\"Voodoo Fest\") and the [[Essence Music Festival]] also feature local and international artists.\n\nOther major festivals include [[Southern Decadence]], the French Quarter Festival, and the [[Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival]]. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, ''[[Streetcar Named Desire]],'' there.\n\nIn 2002, Louisiana began offering tax incentives for film and television production.

The first opera in New Orleans was performed there in 1796. In the nineteenth century, the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for [[French opera]], the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and later the [[French Opera House]]. Today, opera is performed by the [[New Orleans Opera]]. The [[Marigny Opera House]] is home to the Marigny Opera Ballet and also hosts opera, jazz, and classical music performances. [[File:Frank Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Ocean]] is a musician from New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans has long been a significant center for music, showcasing its intertwined European, African and Latin American cultures. The city's unique musical heritage was born in its colonial and early American days from a unique blending of European musical instruments with African rhythms. As the only North American city to have allowed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to gather in public and play their native music (largely in [[Congo Square]], now located within [[Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)|Louis Armstrong Park]]), New Orleans gave birth in the early 20th century to an epochal indigenous music: [[jazz]]. Soon, African-American [[brass band]]s formed, beginning a century-long tradition. The Louis Armstrong Park area, near the French Quarter in [[Trem\u00e9]], contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]. The city's music was later also significantly influenced by [[Acadiana]], home of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] music, and by [[blues|Delta blues]].\n\nNew Orleans' unique musical culture is on display in its traditional funerals. A spin on military funerals, New Orleans' traditional funerals feature sad music (mostly [[dirge]]s and [[hymn]]s) in processions on the way to the cemetery and happier music (hot jazz) on the way back. Until the 1990s, most locals preferred to call these \"funerals with music.\" Visitors to the city have long dubbed them \"[[jazz funeral]]s.\"\n\nMuch later in its musical development, New Orleans was home to a distinctive brand of [[rhythm and blues]] that contributed greatly to the growth of [[rock and roll]]. An example of the New Orleans' sound in the 1960s is the #1 US hit \"[[Chapel of Love]]\" by [[the Dixie Cups]], a song which knocked [[the Beatles]] out of the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. New Orleans became a hotbed for [[funk]] music in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late 1980s, it had developed its own localized variant of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], called [[bounce music]]. While not commercially successful outside of the [[Deep South]], bounce music was immensely popular in poorer neighborhoods throughout the 1990s.\n\nA cousin of bounce, [[southern hip hop|New Orleans hip hop]] achieved commercial success locally and internationally, producing [[Lil Wayne]], [[Master P]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[No Limit Records]]. Additionally, the popularity of [[cowpunk]], a fast form of [[southern rock]], originated with the help of several local bands, such as [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Better Than Ezra]], [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Dash Rip Rock]]. Throughout the 1990s, many [[sludge metal]] bands started.

Like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|deletion of the pre-consonantal \"r\"]]. This dialect is quite similar to New York City area accents such as \"[[New York City English|Brooklynese]]\", to people unfamiliar with either.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>  No consensus describes how it came to be, but it likely resulted from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century. As a result, many of the ethnic groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, such as the [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italians]] (especially [[Sicilian American|Sicilians]]), [[German American|Germans]] and a [[Jewish American|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|title=Newcomers' Incentive Extension|publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans|accessdate=March 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524200300/http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|archivedate=May 24, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the strongest varieties of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as the [[Yat dialect]], from the greeting \"Where y'at?\" This distinctive accent is dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.\n\nLess visibly, various ethnic groups throughout the area have retained distinct language traditions. Although rare, languages still spoken include [[Cajun French|Cajun]], the [[Louisiana Creole French|Kreyol Lwiziyen]] spoken by the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and an archaic Louisiana-Canarian Spanish dialect spoken by the [[Isle\u00f1o]] people and older members of the population.\n\n=== Voodoo ===\nReliable documentation of Voodoo does not exist because of the definitive claim that it is secretive. Voodoo existed in New Orleans-in some of its facets it probably still exists in the modern-day. The likelihood that the slave-developed religion possessed many white followers alongside its black participants is high. Voodoo as described by the distinguished novelist [[George Washington Cable]] is \"the name of an imaginary being of vast supernatural powers residing in the form of a harmless snake\". Followers to these powers are known as the voodoos.\n\n=== History and Origins ===\n[[File:Voodoo.jpg|thumb|Voodoo]]\nMultiple origins come from around the world and converge in pre-antebellum and antebellum New Orleans. ''Vodu'' as used by the Ewes of West Africa means fear of the gods. ''Vodun'' in Dahomy, West Africa, is a name for all deities. In French ''Vaudis'' referred to a witch. Throughout its history in New Orleans, Voodoo and Southern Negro shared folklore, superstitions, language and customs, and had their counterparts in West Africa.\n\nScholars have the noted the use of Roman Catholic saints and liturgies in voodoo worship including black cats, serpents and the color red. These European and African motifs signify evil, the devil, blood, sin, sacrifice, harlotry. After existing in New Orleans for decades, in 1800 when Haitian and West Indian blacks were forced to Louisiana the hexes and secret revenges were incorporated into the system of slavery.\n\nWhite southerners thought Voodoo to be primarily African in origin, and they fitted the practice of it into their beliefs that black men were primitive and inferior. In reality the Voodoo religion/culture is a mixture of African, Caribbean, and European influences.\n\nFor further information [[Saint John's Eve|St. John's Eve]] has had an important relationship to Voodoo in its openness during celebrations.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sports in New Orleans}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Club\n!Sport\n!League\n!Venue (capacity)\n!Founded\n!Titles\n!Record Attendance\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Saints]]\n| [[American football]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Football League|NFL]]\n| [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] (73,208)\n| align=center | 1967\n| align=center | 1\n| align=center | 73,373\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Pelicans]]\n| [[Basketball]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]\n| [[Smoothie King Center]] (16,867)\n| align=center | 2002\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 18,444\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Jesters]]\n| [[Soccer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]]\n| [[Pan American Stadium (New Orleans)|Pan American Stadium]] (5,000)\n| align=center | 2003\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 5,000\n|}\n\n[[File:Fleur de lys (or).svg|right|upright=0.45|thumb|The [[fleur-de-lis]] is often a symbol of New Orleans and its sports teams.]]\n\nNew Orleans' professional sports teams include the 2009 [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion [[New Orleans Saints]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]) and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/index.ssf/2010/09/the_new_orleans_voodoo_and_the.html|title=The New Orleans VooDoo and the Arena Football League are returning}}</ref> It is also home to the [[Big Easy Rollergirls]], an all-female [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association|flat track roller derby]] team, and the [[New Orleans Blaze]], a [[National Women's Football Association|women's football]] team.<ref name=\"BlazeFootball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001171600/http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 1, 2008|title=History of the New Orleans Blaze|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans Blaze|date=April 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"BERG\">{{cite web|last=Vargas|first=Ramon|url=http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963|title=Big Easy Rollergirls deliver bruising derby action|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans CityBusiness|date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622064720/http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963 |archivedate=June 22, 2007}}</ref> New Orleans is also home to two [[NCAA Division I]] athletic programs, the [[Tulane Green Wave]] of the [[American Athletic Conference]] and the [[UNO Privateers]] of the [[Southland Conference]].\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] is the home of the Saints, the Sugar Bowl, and other prominent events.

The same priority was demonstrated in RTA's spending, increasing the proportion of its budget devoted to streetcars to more than three times compared to its pre-Katrina budget.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jaffe, Eric|title=A Troubling Review of Public Transit in New Orleans Since Katrina|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2018|publisher=City Lab|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/08/a-scathing-review-of-public-transit-in-new-orleans-since-katrina/401423/}}</ref> Through the end of 2017, counting both streetcar and bus trips, only 51% of service had been restored to pre-Katrina levels.<ref name=ridenola>{{cite news|title=The State of Transit 2017: Creating our Transit Future|publisher=Ride New Orleans}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority began operation on the extension of the Rampart{{endash}}St. Claude streetcar line. Another change to transit service that year was the re-routing of the 15 Freret and 28 Martin Luther King bus routes to Canal Street. These increased the number of jobs accessible by a thirty-minute walk or transit ride: from 83,722 in 2016 to 89,216 in 2017. This resulted in a regional increase in such job access by more than a full percentage point.<ref name=ridenola/>\n\n====Streetcars====\n[[File:Canal St NOLA CBD Sept 2009 St Charles Astor Redcar.JPG|alt=|thumb|A New Orleans [[Streetcars in New Orleans|streetcar]] traveling down Canal Street]]\n[[File:New Orlean Streetcars.svg|thumb|Streetcar network]]\n\n{{Main|Streetcars in New Orleans}}\nNew Orleans has four active [[Tram|streetcar lines]]:\n* The '''[[St. Charles Streetcar Line]]''' is the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/11/st-charles-avenues-streetcar/|title=St. Charles Avenue\u2019s Streetcar {{!}} Inside Adams: Science, Technology & Business|last=Terrell|first=Ellen|date=2018-11-28|website=blogs.loc.gov|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The line first operated as local rail service in 1835 between Carrollton and downtown New Orleans.

The French Quarter Rail Expansion extended the line from the Loyola Avenue/Canal Street intersection along Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue to Elysian Fields Avenue. It no longer runs along Canal Street to the river, or on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market.\n\nThe city's streetcars were featured in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. The streetcar line to Desire Street became a bus line in 1948.\n\n====Buses====\n[[Public transport]]ation is operated by the [[New Orleans Regional Transit Authority]] (\"RTA\").

I-10 travels east\u2013west through the city as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]]. In [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] it is known as the Eastern Expressway. I-610 provides a direct shortcut for traffic passing through New Orleans via I-10, allowing that traffic to bypass I-10's southward curve.\n\nIn addition to the interstates, [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. 90]] travels through the city, while [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. 61]] terminates downtown. In addition, [[U.S. Route 11|U.S. 11]] terminates in the eastern portion of the city.\n\nNew Orleans is home to many bridges; [[Crescent City Connection]] is perhaps the most notable. It serves as New Orleans' major bridge across the Mississippi, providing a connection between the city's downtown on the eastbank and its westbank suburbs. Other Mississippi crossings are the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], carrying U.S. 90 and the [[Luling Bridge|Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], carrying [[Interstate 310 (Louisiana)|Interstate 310]].\n\nThe [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Twin Span Bridge]], a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) [[causeway]] in eastern New Orleans, carries I-10 across Lake Pontchartrain. Also in eastern New Orleans, [[Interstate 510]]/[[Louisiana Highway 47|LA 47]] travels across the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]/[[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] via the [[Green Bridge (New Orleans)|Paris Road Bridge]], connecting [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and suburban [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]].\n\nThe tolled [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]], consisting of two parallel bridges are, at {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, the longest bridges in the world. Built in the 1950s (southbound span) and 1960s (northbound span), the bridges connect New Orleans with its suburbs on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain via [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\n===Taxi service===\nUnited Cab is the city's largest taxi service, with a fleet of over 300 cabs.<ref name=\"4WWL\">{{cite news |last1=Farris |first1=Meg |title=BREAKING LIVE VIDEO LIVE @ 11:30 AM: Update on Canal St mass shooting from NOPD  LOCAL Cab companies: City regulations will force us to close |url=https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/cab-companies-city-regulations-will-force-us-to-close/289-593532684 |accessdate=December 2, 2019 |work=4WWL TV |date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> It has operated 365 days a year since its establishment in 1938, with the exception of the month after [[Hurricane Katrina]], in which operations were temporarily shut down due to disruptions in radio service.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Robert |date=2016-03-10 |title=Danae Columbus: United Cab says business down 50 percent since arrival of Uber, and now Lyft |url=http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |newspaper=Uptown Messenger |accessdate=2016-04-21}}</ref>\n\nUnited Cab's fleet was once larger than 450 cabs, but has been reduced in recent years due to competition from services like [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]], according to owner Syed Kazmi.<ref name=\"4WWL\"/> In January 2016, New Orleans-based sweet shop Sucr\u00e9 approached United Cab with to deliver its [[king cake]]s locally on-demand.

The [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal]] is the central rail depot and is served by the ''[[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]]'', operating between New Orleans and New York City; the ''[[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]]'', operating between New Orleans and Chicago and the ''[[Sunset Limited]]'', operating between New Orleans and Los Angeles. Up until August 2005 (when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck), the ''Sunset Limited's'' route continued east to Orlando.\n\nWith the strategic benefits of both the port and its double-track Mississippi River crossings, the city attracted six of the seven [[Class I railroad]]s in North America: [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Canadian National Railway]]. The [[New Orleans Public Belt Railroad]] provides interchange services between the railroads.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nAccording to the 2016 [[American Community Survey]], 67.4% of working city of New Orleans residents commuted by driving alone, 9.7% carpooled, 7.3% used public transportation, and 4.9% walked.

One of which was the Natchez in Southern Mississippi. In the 1720s trouble developed between the French and the Natchez Indians that would be called the Natchez War or [[Natchez revolt|Natchez Revolt]]. 230 colonists were killed and the fort and homes were burned to the ground.\n\nThe conflict between the two parties was a direct result of Lieutenant d\u2019Etcheparre (more commonly known as [[Natchez revolt|Sieur de Ch\u00e9part]]), the commandant at the settlement near the Natchez, decided in 1729 that the Natchez Indians should surrender both their cultivated crop lands and their town of White Apple to the French. The Natchez pretended to surrender and actually worked for the French in the hunting game, but as soon as they were weaponized, they struck back and killed several men, resulting in the colonists fleeing downriver to New Orleans. The fleeing colonist sought protection from what they feared might be a colony-wide Indian uprising. The Natchez, however, did not press on after their surprise attack, leaving them vulnerable enough for King Louis XV's appointed governor [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne de Bienville]] to reclaim the settlement.\n\nRelations with Louisiana's Indians, a problem inherited from Bienville, remained a concern for the next governor, [[Pierre de Rigaud, marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnial|Marquis de Vaudreuil]]<nowiki/>. In the early 1740s traders from the British colonies of the Atlantic coast crossed into the Appalachian Mountains. The Native nations in between the French colonials and British colonials would now operate dependent on which of the two colonies would most benefit them. Several of these tribes and especially the [[Chickasaw|Chicksaw]] and [[Choctaw]] would trade goods and gifts for their loyalty.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Louisiana : a history|last=Cummins, Light Townsend|isbn=978-1118619292|oclc=861648007|year= 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe economic problems under Vaudreuil would not allow the French to outcompete the British and resulted in many of Louisiana's Native American revolts. In 1747 and 1748 the Chicksaw would raid along the east bank of the Mississippi all the way south to Baton Rouge. These actions supported by the British colonials would force residents of French Louisiana to take refuge in New Orleans.\n\n=== Slavery in French Louisiana ===\nInability to find labor was the most pressing issue in the early French colony. Colonists turned to African slavery to make their investments in Louisiana profitable. In the late 1710s the international slave trade imported enslaved Africans. This led to the biggest shipment in 1716 where several trading ships appeared with slaves as cargo to the local residents in a one-year span.\n\nBy 1724, the large number of blacks in Louisiana prompted the institutionalizing of laws governing slavery within the colony. These laws required that slaves be baptized in the Roman Catholic faith, slaves be married in the Church, and gave slaves no legal rights. The slave law formed in the 1720s is known as the [[Code Noir]], which would bleed into the antebellum period of the American South as well. Louisiana slave culture had its own distinct Afro-Creole society that called on past cultures and the situation for slaves in the New World. Afro-Creole was present in religious beliefs and the Louisiana Creole dialect. The religion most associated with this period for was called [[Louisiana Voodoo|Voodoo]].\n\n=== Religion and architecture from across the world ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2019}}\nIn the city of New Orleans an inspiring mixture of foreign influences created a melting pot of culture that is still celebrated today. By the end of French colonization in Louisiana, New Orleans was recognized commercially in the Atlantic world. Its inhabitants traded across the French commercial system. New Orleans was a hub for this trade both physically and culturally because it served as the exit point to the rest of the globe for the interior of the North American continent.\n\nIn one instance the French government established a chapter house of sisters in New Orleans. The [[History of the Ursulines in New Orleans|Ursuline sisters]] after being sponsored by the [[Company of the Indies]], founded a convent in the city in 1727. At the end of the colonial era, the Ursuline Academy maintained a house of seventy boarding and one hundred day students. Today numerous schools in New Orleans can trace their lineage from this academy.\n[[File:Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer - Louisiane - Adrien de Pauger - 1724 - 001.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|Archives nationales d\u2019outre-mer \u2013 Louisiane \u2013 Adrien de Pauger \u2013 1724 \u2013 001]]\nAnother notable example is the streetplan and architecture still distinguishing New Orleans today. French Louisiana had early architects in the province who were trained as military engineers and were now assigned to design government buildings. Pierre Le Blond de Tour and [[Adrien de Pauger]], for example, planned many early fortifications, along with the street plan for the city of New Orleans. After them in the 1740s, Ignace Fran\u00e7ois Broutin, as engineer-in-chief of Louisiana, reworked the architecture of New Orleans with an extensive public works program.\n\nFrench policy-makers in Paris attempted to set political and economic norms for New Orleans. It acted autonomously in much of its cultural and physical aspects, but also stayed in communication with the foreign trends as well.\n\n=== Post-Treaty of Paris ===\nAfter the French relinquished West Louisiana to the Spanish, New Orleans merchants attempted to ignore Spanish rule and even re-institute French control on the colony. The citizens of New Orleans held a series of public meetings during 1765 to keep the populace in opposition of the establishment of Spanish rule. Anti-Spanish passions in New Orleans reached their highest level after two years of Spanish administration in Louisiana. On October 27, 1768, a mob of local residents, spiked the guns guarding New Orleans and took control of the city from the Spanish. The rebellion organized a group to sail for Paris, where it met with officials of the French government. This group brought with them a long memorial to summarize the abuses the colony had endured from the Spanish. King Louis XV and his ministers reaffirmed Spain's sovereignty over Louisiana.\n\n===United States territory===\n[[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] sold [[Louisiana (New France)]] to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803. Thereafter, the city grew rapidly with influxes of Americans, [[French people|French]], [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and [[Demographics of Africa|Africans]]. Later immigrants were [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Germans]], [[Poles]] and [[Italians]]. Major [[commodity crops]] of [[sugar cane|sugar]] and [[cotton]] were cultivated with [[Slavery in the United States|slave]] labor on nearby large [[Plantations in the American South|plantations]].\n\nThousands of [[refugee]]s from the 1804 [[Haitian Revolution]], both [[White people|whites]] and [[free people of color]] (''affranchis'' or ''gens de couleur libres''), arrived in New Orleans; a number brought their slaves with them, many of whom were native Africans or of full-blood descent. While Governor [[William C.C. Claiborne|Claiborne]] and other officials wanted to keep out additional [[Free negro|free black]] people, the French Creoles wanted to increase the French-speaking population. As more refugees were allowed into the [[Territory of Orleans]], Haitian \u00e9migr\u00e9s who had first gone to [[Cuba]] also arrived.<ref name=\"AAM\"/> Many of the white [[Geographical distribution of French speakers|Francophones]] had been deported by officials in Cuba in retaliation for [[Bonapartist]] schemes.{{sfn|Gitlin |2009|p= 54}}\n\nNearly 90 percent of these immigrants settled in New Orleans. The 1809 migration brought 2,731 whites, 3,102 free people of color (of [[mixed-race]] European and African descent), and 3,226 slaves of primarily African descent, doubling the city's population. The city became 63 percent black, a greater proportion than [[Charleston, South Carolina]]'s 53 percent.<ref name=\"AAM\">[http://www.inmotionaame.org/migrations/topic.cfm?migration=5&topic=3 \"Haitian Immigration: 18th & 19th Centuries\"], ''In Motion: African American Migration Experience'', New York Public Library, accessed May 7, 2008</ref>\n\n===Battle of New Orleans===\n{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}\n[[File:Battle of New Orleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[Battle of New Orleans (1815)|Battle of New Orleans]] (1815)]]\n[[File:Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans.jpg|alt=Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans : from an actual survey made in 1815|thumb|Plan of the city and suburbs of New Orleans : from a survey made in 1815<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://coololdphotos.com/rare-1815-plan-of-the-city-and-suburbs-of-new-orleans/|title=Rare 1815 Plan of the City and Suburbs of New Orleans|last=Tom|date=2015-03-18|website=Cool Old Photos|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-23}}</ref>]]\nDuring the final campaign of the [[War of 1812]], the British sent a force of 11,000 in an attempt to capture New Orleans. Despite great challenges, General [[Andrew Jackson]], with support from the [[U.S. Navy]], successfully cobbled together a force of [[militia]] from Louisiana and [[Mississippi Territory|Mississippi]], including [[free people of color|free men of color]], [[U.S. Army]] regulars, a large contingent of [[Tennessee]] state militia, [[Kentucky]] riflemen, [[Choctaw]] fighters, and local [[privateer]]s (the latter led by the pirate [[Jean Lafitte]]), to decisively defeat the [[British army|British troops]], led by [[Edward Pakenham|Sir Edward Pakenham]], in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] on January 8, 1815.\n\nThe armies had not learned of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which had been signed on December 24, 1814 (however, the treaty did not call for cessation of hostilities until after both governments had ratified it.

The port handled commodities for export from the interior and imported goods from other countries, which were warehoused and transferred in New Orleans to smaller vessels and distributed along the Mississippi River watershed. The river was filled with steamboats, flatboats and sailing ships. Despite its role in the [[slave trade]], New Orleans at the time also had the largest and most prosperous community of free persons of color in the nation, who were often educated, middle-class property owners.<ref name=\"pbsjazz\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/jazz/places/places_new_orleans.htm|title=New Orleans: The Birthplace of Jazz|website=PBS \u2013 JAZZ A Film By Ken Burns|format=primarily excerpted from Jazz: A History of America's Music|accessdate=May 17, 2006}}\n</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Les Gens De Couleur Libres |url=http://www.creolehistory.com/ |accessdate=May 17, 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522221017/http://www.creolehistory.com/ |archivedate=May 22, 2006 }}</ref>\n\n===Slavery and immigration===\nDwarfing the other cities in the antebellum South, New Orleans had America's largest slave market. The market expanded after the United States ended the international [[Atlantic slave trade|trade]] in 1808. Two-thirds of the more than one million slaves brought to the [[Deep South]] arrived via [[forced migration]] in the domestic [[slave trade]]. The money generated by the sale of slaves in the [[Upper South]] has been estimated at 15 percent of the value of the staple crop economy. The [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] were collectively valued at half a billion dollars. The trade spawned an ancillary economy\u2014transportation, housing and clothing, fees, etc., estimated at 13.5% of the price per person, amounting to tens of billions of dollars (2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation) during the [[Plantation era|antebellum period]], with New Orleans as a prime beneficiary.<ref>Walter Johnson, ''Soul by Soul: Life Inside the Antebellum Slave Market'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999, pp. 2, 6</ref>\n\nAccording to historian Paul Lachance,\n\n{{quote|the addition of white immigrants [from Saint-Domingue] to the white creole population enabled French-speakers to remain a majority of the white population until almost 1830.

In 1862, following the occupation by the Navy after the [[Battle of Forts Jackson and St. Philip]], led by [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Gen. Benjamin F. Butler]], a respected state lawyer of the Massachusetts militia, Northern forces occupied the city. Later New Orleans residents nicknamed him \"Beast\" Butler, because of a military order he issued. After his troops had been assaulted and harassed in the streets by Southern women, his order warned that such future occurrences would result in his men treating such \"ladies\" as those \"plying their avocation in the streets\", implying that they would treat the women like prostitutes. Accounts of this spread widely. He also came to be called \"Spoons\" Butler because of the alleged looting that his troops did while occupying the city.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nButler abolished French language instruction in city schools. Statewide measures in 1864 and, after the war, 1868 further strengthened the English-only policy imposed by federal representatives. With the predominance of English speakers, that language had already become dominant in business and government.{{sfn|Gitlin|2009|p= 166}} By the end of the 19th century, French usage had faded.

The [[Union Army]] eventually extended its control north along the [[Mississippi River]] and along the coastal areas. As a result, most of the southern portion of Louisiana was originally exempted from the liberating provisions of the 1863 \"[[Emancipation Proclamation]]\" issued by President [[Abraham Lincoln]]. Large numbers of rural ex-slaves and some free people of color from the city volunteered for the first regiments of Black troops in the War. Led by Brigadier General [[Daniel Ullman]] (1810\u20131892), of the 78th Regiment of New York State Volunteers Militia, they were known as the \"[[United States Colored Troops|Corps d'Afrique]].\" While that name had been used by a militia before the war, that group was composed of [[free people of color]]. The new group was made up mostly of former slaves. They were supplemented in the last two years of the War by newly organized [[United States Colored Troops]], who played an increasingly important part in the war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ustica.org/san_bartolomeo/catalog/civilwar.htm|title=Usticesi in the United States Civil War|publisher=The Ustica Connection|date=March 22, 2003|accessdate=July 29, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Reconstruction===\nViolence throughout the South, especially the [[Memphis Riots of 1866]] followed by the [[New Orleans Riot]] in the same year, led Congress to pass the [[Reconstruction Act]] and the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], extending the protections of full citizenship to freedmen and free people of color. Louisiana and [[Texas]] were put under the authority of the \"[[Fifth Military District]]\" of the United States during Reconstruction. Louisiana was readmitted to the Union in 1868. Its Constitution of 1868 granted [[Universal manhood suffrage|universal male suffrage]] and established universal [[State school|public education]]. Both blacks and whites were elected to local and state offices. In 1872, lieutenant governor [[P.B.S. Pinchback]], who was of [[mixed race]], succeeded [[Henry C. Warmouth|Henry Clay Warmouth]] for a brief period as Republican governor of [[Louisiana]], becoming the first governor of African descent of an [[U.S. state|American state]] (the next African American to serve as governor of an American state was [[Douglas Wilder]], elected in Virginia in 1989). New Orleans operated a racially integrated [[New Orleans Public Schools|public school system]] during this period.\n\nWartime damage to [[levees]] and cities along the Mississippi River adversely affected southern crops and trade. The federal government contributed to restoring infrastructure. The nationwide financial recession and [[Panic of 1873]] adversely affected businesses and slowed economic recovery.\n\nFrom 1868, elections in Louisiana were marked by violence, as white insurgents tried to suppress black voting and disrupt [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] gatherings. The disputed 1872 gubernatorial election resulted in conflicts that ran for years. The \"[[White League]]\", an insurgent paramilitary group that supported the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], was organized in 1874 and operated in the open, violently suppressing the black vote and running off Republican officeholders. In 1874, in the [[Battle of Liberty Place]], 5,000 members of the White League fought with city police to take over the state offices for the Democratic candidate for governor, holding them for three days. By 1876, such tactics resulted in the white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], the so-called [[Redeemers]], regaining political control of the state legislature. The federal government gave up and withdrew its troops in 1877, ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]].\n\n===Jim Crow era===\nWhite Democrats passed [[Jim Crow]] laws, establishing [[racial segregation]] in public facilities. In 1889, the legislature passed a [[constitutional amendment]] incorporating a \"[[grandfather clause]]\" that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disfranchised]] freedmen as well as the propertied people of color manumitted before the war. Unable to vote, African Americans could not serve on juries or in local office, and were closed out of formal politics for generations. The South was ruled by a white Democratic Party. Public schools were [[Racial segregation|racially segregated]] and remained so until 1960.\n\nNew Orleans' large community of well-educated, often French-speaking [[free persons of color]] (''gens de couleur libres''), who had been free prior to the Civil War, fought against Jim Crow. They organized the ''Comit\u00e9 des Citoyens'' (Citizens Committee) to work for civil rights. As part of their legal campaign, they recruited one of their own, [[Homer Plessy]], to test whether Louisiana's newly enacted Separate Car Act was constitutional. Plessy boarded a commuter train departing New Orleans for [[Covington, Louisiana]], sat in the car reserved for whites only, and was arrested. The case resulting from this incident, ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', was heard by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in 1896. The court ruled that \"[[separate but equal]]\" accommodations were constitutional, effectively upholding Jim Crow measures. In practice, African-American public schools and facilities were underfunded across the South. The Supreme Court ruling contributed to this period as the [[Nadir of American race relations|nadir of race relations]] in the United States. The rate of [[Lynching in the United States|lynchings]] of black men was high across the South, as other states also disfranchised blacks and sought to impose Jim Crow. Nativist prejudices also surfaced. [[Anti-Italianism#Anti-Italianism in the United States|Anti-Italian]] sentiment in 1891 contributed to the [[March 14, 1891 lynchings|lynchings of 11 Italians]], some of whom had been acquitted of the murder of the police chief. Some were shot and killed in the jail where they were detained. It was the largest mass lynching in U.S. history.<ref>{{cite web|ref={{harvid|Library of Congress}}|title=Immigration / Italian|website=Library of Congress|url=https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/immigration/italian8.html}}</ref><ref name=\"Gambino2000\">{{cite book|last=Gambino|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Gambino |title=Vendetta: The True Story of the Largest Lynching in U.S. History|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=jA9-dmAsoMwC}}|year=2000|publisher=Guernica Editions|isbn=978-1-55071-103-5|ref=harv}}</ref> In July 1900 the city was swept by white mobs rioting after Robert Charles, a young African American, killed a policeman and temporarily escaped. The mob killed him and an estimated 20 other blacks; seven whites died in the days-long conflict, until a [[Militia (United States)|state militia]] suppressed it.\n\nThroughout New Orleans' history, until the early 20th Century when medical and scientific advances ameliorated the situation, the city suffered repeated [[epidemic]]s of [[yellow fever]] and other tropical and [[Infection|infectious diseases]].\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:EsplanadeBurgundy1900.jpg|right|thumb|[[Esplanade Avenue, New Orleans|Esplanade Avenue]] at Burgundy Street, looking lakewards north towards [[Lake Ponchartrain]] (1900)]]\n[[File:RationingBoardNOLAVachonC.jpg|right|thumb|1943 waiting line at wartime Rationing Board office in New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans' economic and population zenith in relation to other American cities occurred in the antebellum period. It was the nation's fifth-largest city in 1860 (after [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]] and [[Baltimore]]) and was significantly larger than all other southern cities.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\">Lewis, Peirce F., ''New Orleans: The Making of an Urban Landscape'', Santa Fe, 2003, p. 175.</ref> From the mid-19th century onward rapid economic growth shifted to other areas, while New Orleans' relative importance steadily declined. The growth of railways and highways decreased river traffic, diverting goods to other transportation corridors and markets.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> Thousands of the most ambitious [[Person of color|people of color]] left the state in the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] around [[World War II]] and after, many for [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] destinations. From the late 1800s, most censuses recorded New Orleans slipping down the ranks in the list of largest American cities (New Orleans' population still continued to increase throughout the period, but at a slower rate than before the Civil War).\n\nBy the mid-20th Century, New Orleanians recognized that their city was no longer the leading urban area in the [[Southern United States|South]]. By 1950, [[Houston]], [[Dallas]], and [[Atlanta]] exceeded New Orleans in size, and in 1960 [[Miami]] eclipsed New Orleans, even as the latter's population reached its historic peak.<ref name=\"Lewis-2003\u2013175\" /> As with other older American cities, highway construction and suburban development drew residents from the center city to newer housing outside. The 1970 census recorded the first absolute decline in population since the city became part of the United States in 1803. The [[New Orleans metropolitan area]] continued expanding in population, albeit more slowly than other major Sun Belt cities. While the [[Port of New Orleans|port]] remained one of the nation's largest, automation and [[containerization]] cost many jobs. The city's former role as banker to the South was supplanted by larger peer cities. New Orleans' economy had always been based more on trade and financial services than on manufacturing, but the city's relatively small manufacturing sector also shrank after World War II. Despite some economic development successes under the administrations of [[DeLesseps Story Morrison|DeLesseps \"Chep\" Morrison]] (1946\u20131961) and [[Victor H. Schiro|Victor \"Vic\" Schiro]] (1961\u20131970), metropolitan New Orleans' growth rate consistently lagged behind more vigorous cities.\n\n====Civil Rights Movement====\nDuring the later years of Morrison's administration, and for the entirety of Schiro's, the city was a center of the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. The [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] was founded in New Orleans, and lunch counter sit-ins were held in [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]] department stores. A prominent and violent series of confrontations occurred in 1960 when the city attempted school desegregation, following the Supreme Court ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954). When six-year-old [[Ruby Bridges]] integrated [[William Frantz Elementary School]] in the [[Ninth Ward of New Orleans|Ninth Ward]], she was the first child of color to attend a previously all-white school in the South.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement's success in gaining federal passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] renewed constitutional rights, including voting for blacks. Together, these resulted in the most far-reaching changes in New Orleans' 20th century history.<ref>Germany, Kent B., ''New Orleans After the Promises: Poverty, Citizenship and the Search for the Great Society'', Athens, 2007, pp. 3\u20135</ref> Though legal and civil equality were re-established by the end of the 1960s, a large gap in income levels and educational attainment persisted between the city's White and African-American communities.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Glassman, James K., \"New Orleans: I have Seen the Future, and It's Houston\", ''The Atlantic Monthly'', July 1978</ref> As the middle class and wealthier members of both races left the center city, its population's income level dropped, and it became proportionately more African American. From 1980, the African-American majority elected primarily officials from its own community. They struggled to narrow the gap by creating conditions conducive to the economic uplift of the African-American community.\n\nNew Orleans became increasingly dependent on tourism as an economic mainstay during the administrations of [[Sidney Barthelemy]] (1986\u20131994) and [[Marc Morial]] (1994\u20132002). Relatively low levels of educational attainment, high rates of household poverty, and rising crime threatened the city's prosperity in the later decades of the century.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The negative effects of these socioeconomic conditions aligned poorly with the changes in the late-20th century to the economy of the United States, which reflected a post-industrial, knowledge-based paradigm in which mental skills and education were more important to advancement than manual skills.\n\n====Drainage and flood control====\n{{See also|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\n[[File:LPD18USSNewOrleansPassingNewOrleans.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|A view of the [[New Orleans Central Business District]] as seen from the [[Mississippi River]]. {{USS|New Orleans|LPD-18}} in foreground (2007)]]\n\nIn the 20th century, New Orleans' government and business leaders believed they needed to drain and develop outlying areas to provide for the city's expansion. The most ambitious development during this period was a drainage plan devised by engineer and inventor [[A. Baldwin Wood]], designed to break the surrounding swamp's stranglehold on the city's geographic expansion. Until then, urban development in New Orleans was largely limited to higher ground along the natural river levees and [[bayou]]s.\n\nWood's pump system allowed the city to drain huge tracts of swamp and marshland and expand into low-lying areas. Over the 20th century, rapid [[subsidence]], both natural and human-induced, resulted in these newly populated areas subsiding to several feet below sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Kusky, Timothy M. |title=Why is New Orleans Sinking? |publisher=Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, Saint Louis University |date=December 29, 2005 |url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |accessdate=June 17, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623092455/http://www.eas.slu.edu/People/TMKusky/original%20files/Why%20is%20New%20Orleans%20Sinking.pdf |archivedate=June 23, 2006 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news\n  | first=Larry\n  | last=O'Hanlon\n  | url=http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html\n  | title=New Orleans Sits Atop Giant Landslide\n  | publisher=Discovery Channel\n  | date=March 31, 2006\n  | accessdate=June 17, 2006\n |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614211349/http://dsc.discovery.com/news/briefs/20060327/neworleans_pla.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = June 14, 2006}}</ref>\n\nNew Orleans was vulnerable to flooding even before the city's footprint departed from the natural high ground near the Mississippi River. In the late 20th century, however, scientists and New Orleans residents gradually became aware of the city's increased vulnerability. In 1965, flooding from [[Hurricane Betsy]] killed dozens of residents, although the majority of the city remained dry. The rain-induced [[May 8th 1995 Louisiana Flood|flood of May 8, 1995]], demonstrated the weakness of the pumping system. After that event, measures were undertaken to dramatically upgrade pumping capacity. By the 1980s and 1990s, scientists observed that extensive, rapid, and ongoing [[Coastal erosion|erosion of the marshlands and swamp surrounding New Orleans]], especially that related to the [[Mississippi River \u2013 Gulf Outlet Canal]], had the unintended result of leaving the city more vulnerable than before to hurricane-induced catastrophic [[storm surge]]s.\n\n===21st century===\n\n====Hurricane Katrina====\n[[File:Katrina 2nd landfall.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hurricane Katrina]] at its New Orleans landfall]]\n{{See also|Effects of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans|Drainage in New Orleans}}\n\nNew Orleans was catastrophically affected by what Raymond B.

''Mardi Gras'' (French for \"Fat Tuesday\"), the final and grandest day of traditional Catholic festivities, is the last Tuesday before the [[Christianity|Christian]] liturgical season of [[Lent]], which commences on [[Ash Wednesday]].\n\nThe largest of the city's many music festivals is the [[New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival]]. Commonly referred to simply as \"Jazz Fest\", it is one of the nation's largest music festivals. The festival features a variety of music, including both native Louisiana and international artists. Along with Jazz Fest, New Orleans' [[Voodoo Experience]] (\"Voodoo Fest\") and the [[Essence Music Festival]] also feature local and international artists.\n\nOther major festivals include [[Southern Decadence]], the French Quarter Festival, and the [[Tennessee Williams/New Orleans Literary Festival]]. The American playwright lived and wrote in New Orleans early in his career, and set his play, ''[[Streetcar Named Desire]],'' there.\n\nIn 2002, Louisiana began offering tax incentives for film and television production.

The first opera in New Orleans was performed there in 1796. In the nineteenth century, the city was the home of two of America's most important venues for [[French opera]], the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre d'Orl\u00e9ans]] and later the [[French Opera House]]. Today, opera is performed by the [[New Orleans Opera]]. The [[Marigny Opera House]] is home to the Marigny Opera Ballet and also hosts opera, jazz, and classical music performances. [[File:Frank Ocean.jpg|thumb|left|[[Frank Ocean]] is a musician from New Orleans]]\n\nNew Orleans has long been a significant center for music, showcasing its intertwined European, African and Latin American cultures. The city's unique musical heritage was born in its colonial and early American days from a unique blending of European musical instruments with African rhythms. As the only North American city to have allowed [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to gather in public and play their native music (largely in [[Congo Square]], now located within [[Louis Armstrong Park (New Orleans)|Louis Armstrong Park]]), New Orleans gave birth in the early 20th century to an epochal indigenous music: [[jazz]]. Soon, African-American [[brass band]]s formed, beginning a century-long tradition. The Louis Armstrong Park area, near the French Quarter in [[Trem\u00e9]], contains the [[New Orleans Jazz National Historical Park]]. The city's music was later also significantly influenced by [[Acadiana]], home of [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and [[Zydeco]] music, and by [[blues|Delta blues]].\n\nNew Orleans' unique musical culture is on display in its traditional funerals. A spin on military funerals, New Orleans' traditional funerals feature sad music (mostly [[dirge]]s and [[hymn]]s) in processions on the way to the cemetery and happier music (hot jazz) on the way back. Until the 1990s, most locals preferred to call these \"funerals with music.\" Visitors to the city have long dubbed them \"[[jazz funeral]]s.\"\n\nMuch later in its musical development, New Orleans was home to a distinctive brand of [[rhythm and blues]] that contributed greatly to the growth of [[rock and roll]]. An example of the New Orleans' sound in the 1960s is the #1 US hit \"[[Chapel of Love]]\" by [[the Dixie Cups]], a song which knocked [[the Beatles]] out of the top spot on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. New Orleans became a hotbed for [[funk]] music in the 1960s and 1970s, and by the late 1980s, it had developed its own localized variant of [[hip hop music|hip hop]], called [[bounce music]]. While not commercially successful outside of the [[Deep South]], bounce music was immensely popular in poorer neighborhoods throughout the 1990s.\n\nA cousin of bounce, [[southern hip hop|New Orleans hip hop]] achieved commercial success locally and internationally, producing [[Lil Wayne]], [[Master P]], [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[Cash Money Records]] and [[No Limit Records]]. Additionally, the popularity of [[cowpunk]], a fast form of [[southern rock]], originated with the help of several local bands, such as [[The Radiators (US)|The Radiators]], [[Better Than Ezra]], [[Cowboy Mouth]] and [[Dash Rip Rock]]. Throughout the 1990s, many [[sludge metal]] bands started.

Like earlier Southern Englishes, feature frequent [[Rhotic and non-rhotic accents|deletion of the pre-consonantal \"r\"]]. This dialect is quite similar to New York City area accents such as \"[[New York City English|Brooklynese]]\", to people unfamiliar with either.<ref>Liebling, A. J. (1970). ''The Earl of Louisiana''. Baton Rouge: LSU.</ref>  No consensus describes how it came to be, but it likely resulted from New Orleans' geographic isolation by water and the fact that the city was a major immigration port throughout the 19th century. As a result, many of the ethnic groups who reside in Brooklyn also reside in New Orleans, such as the [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Italian American|Italians]] (especially [[Sicilian American|Sicilians]]), [[German American|Germans]] and a [[Jewish American|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|title=Newcomers' Incentive Extension|publisher=Jewish Federation of Greater New Orleans|accessdate=March 22, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524200300/http://www.jewishnola.com/page.html?ArticleID=165388|archivedate=May 24, 2008|df=}}</ref>\n\nOne of the strongest varieties of the New Orleans accent is sometimes identified as the [[Yat dialect]], from the greeting \"Where y'at?\" This distinctive accent is dying out in the city, but remains strong in the surrounding parishes.\n\nLess visibly, various ethnic groups throughout the area have retained distinct language traditions. Although rare, languages still spoken include [[Cajun French|Cajun]], the [[Louisiana Creole French|Kreyol Lwiziyen]] spoken by the [[Louisiana Creole people|Creoles]] and an archaic Louisiana-Canarian Spanish dialect spoken by the [[Isle\u00f1o]] people and older members of the population.\n\n=== Voodoo ===\nReliable documentation of Voodoo does not exist because of the definitive claim that it is secretive. Voodoo existed in New Orleans-in some of its facets it probably still exists in the modern-day. The likelihood that the slave-developed religion possessed many white followers alongside its black participants is high. Voodoo as described by the distinguished novelist [[George Washington Cable]] is \"the name of an imaginary being of vast supernatural powers residing in the form of a harmless snake\". Followers to these powers are known as the voodoos.\n\n=== History and Origins ===\n[[File:Voodoo.jpg|thumb|Voodoo]]\nMultiple origins come from around the world and converge in pre-antebellum and antebellum New Orleans. ''Vodu'' as used by the Ewes of West Africa means fear of the gods. ''Vodun'' in Dahomy, West Africa, is a name for all deities. In French ''Vaudis'' referred to a witch. Throughout its history in New Orleans, Voodoo and Southern Negro shared folklore, superstitions, language and customs, and had their counterparts in West Africa.\n\nScholars have the noted the use of Roman Catholic saints and liturgies in voodoo worship including black cats, serpents and the color red. These European and African motifs signify evil, the devil, blood, sin, sacrifice, harlotry. After existing in New Orleans for decades, in 1800 when Haitian and West Indian blacks were forced to Louisiana the hexes and secret revenges were incorporated into the system of slavery.\n\nWhite southerners thought Voodoo to be primarily African in origin, and they fitted the practice of it into their beliefs that black men were primitive and inferior. In reality the Voodoo religion/culture is a mixture of African, Caribbean, and European influences.\n\nFor further information [[Saint John's Eve|St. John's Eve]] has had an important relationship to Voodoo in its openness during celebrations.\n\n==Sports==\n{{Main|Sports in New Orleans}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Club\n!Sport\n!League\n!Venue (capacity)\n!Founded\n!Titles\n!Record Attendance\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Saints]]\n| [[American football]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Football League|NFL]]\n| [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] (73,208)\n| align=center | 1967\n| align=center | 1\n| align=center | 73,373\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Pelicans]]\n| [[Basketball]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]\n| [[Smoothie King Center]] (16,867)\n| align=center | 2002\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 18,444\n|-\n| [[New Orleans Jesters]]\n| [[Soccer]]\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[National Premier Soccer League|NPSL]]\n| [[Pan American Stadium (New Orleans)|Pan American Stadium]] (5,000)\n| align=center | 2003\n| align=center | 0\n| align=center | 5,000\n|}\n\n[[File:Fleur de lys (or).svg|right|upright=0.45|thumb|The [[fleur-de-lis]] is often a symbol of New Orleans and its sports teams.]]\n\nNew Orleans' professional sports teams include the 2009 [[Super Bowl XLIV]] champion [[New Orleans Saints]] ([[National Football League|NFL]]) and the [[New Orleans Pelicans]] ([[National Basketball Association|NBA]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/voodoo/index.ssf/2010/09/the_new_orleans_voodoo_and_the.html|title=The New Orleans VooDoo and the Arena Football League are returning}}</ref> It is also home to the [[Big Easy Rollergirls]], an all-female [[Women's Flat Track Derby Association|flat track roller derby]] team, and the [[New Orleans Blaze]], a [[National Women's Football Association|women's football]] team.<ref name=\"BlazeFootball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001171600/http://www.neworleansblaze.com/PRpdfs/HistoryoftheNewOrleansBlaze.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 1, 2008|title=History of the New Orleans Blaze|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans Blaze|date=April 3, 2008 }}</ref><ref name=\"BERG\">{{cite web|last=Vargas|first=Ramon|url=http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963|title=Big Easy Rollergirls deliver bruising derby action|accessdate=September 27, 2008|publisher=New Orleans CityBusiness|date=May 4, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622064720/http://www.neworleanscitybusiness.com/viewStory.cfm?recID=18963 |archivedate=June 22, 2007}}</ref> New Orleans is also home to two [[NCAA Division I]] athletic programs, the [[Tulane Green Wave]] of the [[American Athletic Conference]] and the [[UNO Privateers]] of the [[Southland Conference]].\n\nThe [[Mercedes-Benz Superdome]] is the home of the Saints, the Sugar Bowl, and other prominent events.

The same priority was demonstrated in RTA's spending, increasing the proportion of its budget devoted to streetcars to more than three times compared to its pre-Katrina budget.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jaffe, Eric|title=A Troubling Review of Public Transit in New Orleans Since Katrina|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=May 19, 2018|publisher=City Lab|url=https://www.citylab.com/transportation/2015/08/a-scathing-review-of-public-transit-in-new-orleans-since-katrina/401423/}}</ref> Through the end of 2017, counting both streetcar and bus trips, only 51% of service had been restored to pre-Katrina levels.<ref name=ridenola>{{cite news|title=The State of Transit 2017: Creating our Transit Future|publisher=Ride New Orleans}}</ref>\n\nIn 2017, the New Orleans Regional Transit Authority began operation on the extension of the Rampart{{endash}}St. Claude streetcar line. Another change to transit service that year was the re-routing of the 15 Freret and 28 Martin Luther King bus routes to Canal Street. These increased the number of jobs accessible by a thirty-minute walk or transit ride: from 83,722 in 2016 to 89,216 in 2017. This resulted in a regional increase in such job access by more than a full percentage point.<ref name=ridenola/>\n\n====Streetcars====\n[[File:Canal St NOLA CBD Sept 2009 St Charles Astor Redcar.JPG|alt=|thumb|A New Orleans [[Streetcars in New Orleans|streetcar]] traveling down Canal Street]]\n[[File:New Orlean Streetcars.svg|thumb|Streetcar network]]\n\n{{Main|Streetcars in New Orleans}}\nNew Orleans has four active [[Tram|streetcar lines]]:\n* The '''[[St. Charles Streetcar Line]]''' is the oldest continuously operating streetcar line in America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.loc.gov/inside_adams/2018/11/st-charles-avenues-streetcar/|title=St. Charles Avenue\u2019s Streetcar {{!}} Inside Adams: Science, Technology & Business|last=Terrell|first=Ellen|date=2018-11-28|website=blogs.loc.gov|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref> The line first operated as local rail service in 1835 between Carrollton and downtown New Orleans.

The French Quarter Rail Expansion extended the line from the Loyola Avenue/Canal Street intersection along Rampart Street and St. Claude Avenue to Elysian Fields Avenue. It no longer runs along Canal Street to the river, or on weekends on the Riverfront line tracks to French Market.\n\nThe city's streetcars were featured in the [[Tennessee Williams]] play, ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. The streetcar line to Desire Street became a bus line in 1948.\n\n====Buses====\n[[Public transport]]ation is operated by the [[New Orleans Regional Transit Authority]] (\"RTA\").

I-10 travels east\u2013west through the city as the [[Pontchartrain Expressway]]. In [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] it is known as the Eastern Expressway. I-610 provides a direct shortcut for traffic passing through New Orleans via I-10, allowing that traffic to bypass I-10's southward curve.\n\nIn addition to the interstates, [[U.S. Route 90|U.S. 90]] travels through the city, while [[U.S. Route 61|U.S. 61]] terminates downtown. In addition, [[U.S. Route 11|U.S. 11]] terminates in the eastern portion of the city.\n\nNew Orleans is home to many bridges; [[Crescent City Connection]] is perhaps the most notable. It serves as New Orleans' major bridge across the Mississippi, providing a connection between the city's downtown on the eastbank and its westbank suburbs. Other Mississippi crossings are the [[Huey P. Long Bridge (Jefferson Parish)|Huey P. Long Bridge]], carrying U.S. 90 and the [[Luling Bridge|Hale Boggs Memorial Bridge]], carrying [[Interstate 310 (Louisiana)|Interstate 310]].\n\nThe [[I-10 Twin Span Bridge|Twin Span Bridge]], a five-mile (8&nbsp;km) [[causeway]] in eastern New Orleans, carries I-10 across Lake Pontchartrain. Also in eastern New Orleans, [[Interstate 510]]/[[Louisiana Highway 47|LA 47]] travels across the [[Intracoastal Waterway]]/[[Mississippi River-Gulf Outlet Canal]] via the [[Green Bridge (New Orleans)|Paris Road Bridge]], connecting [[Eastern New Orleans|New Orleans East]] and suburban [[Chalmette, Louisiana|Chalmette]].\n\nThe tolled [[Lake Pontchartrain Causeway]], consisting of two parallel bridges are, at {{convert|24|mi|km|0}} long, the longest bridges in the world. Built in the 1950s (southbound span) and 1960s (northbound span), the bridges connect New Orleans with its suburbs on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain via [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].\n\n===Taxi service===\nUnited Cab is the city's largest taxi service, with a fleet of over 300 cabs.<ref name=\"4WWL\">{{cite news |last1=Farris |first1=Meg |title=BREAKING LIVE VIDEO LIVE @ 11:30 AM: Update on Canal St mass shooting from NOPD  LOCAL Cab companies: City regulations will force us to close |url=https://www.wwltv.com/article/news/local/cab-companies-city-regulations-will-force-us-to-close/289-593532684 |accessdate=December 2, 2019 |work=4WWL TV |date=September 12, 2018}}</ref> It has operated 365 days a year since its establishment in 1938, with the exception of the month after [[Hurricane Katrina]], in which operations were temporarily shut down due to disruptions in radio service.<ref>{{cite news |last=Morris |first=Robert |date=2016-03-10 |title=Danae Columbus: United Cab says business down 50 percent since arrival of Uber, and now Lyft |url=http://uptownmessenger.com/2016/03/danae-columbus-united-cab-says-business-down-50-percent-since-arrival-of-uber-and-now-lyft/ |newspaper=Uptown Messenger |accessdate=2016-04-21}}</ref>\n\nUnited Cab's fleet was once larger than 450 cabs, but has been reduced in recent years due to competition from services like [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]], according to owner Syed Kazmi.<ref name=\"4WWL\"/> In January 2016, New Orleans-based sweet shop Sucr\u00e9 approached United Cab with to deliver its [[king cake]]s locally on-demand.

The [[New Orleans Union Passenger Terminal]] is the central rail depot and is served by the ''[[Crescent (Amtrak)|Crescent]]'', operating between New Orleans and New York City; the ''[[City of New Orleans (train)|City of New Orleans]]'', operating between New Orleans and Chicago and the ''[[Sunset Limited]]'', operating between New Orleans and Los Angeles. Up until August 2005 (when [[Hurricane Katrina]] struck), the ''Sunset Limited's'' route continued east to Orlando.\n\nWith the strategic benefits of both the port and its double-track Mississippi River crossings, the city attracted six of the seven [[Class I railroad]]s in North America: [[Union Pacific Railroad]], [[BNSF Railway]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], [[Kansas City Southern Railway]], [[CSX Transportation]] and [[Canadian National Railway]]. The [[New Orleans Public Belt Railroad]] provides interchange services between the railroads.\n\n===Modal characteristics===\nAccording to the 2016 [[American Community Survey]], 67.4% of working city of New Orleans residents commuted by driving alone, 9.7% carpooled, 7.3% used public transportation, and 4.9% walked.

It is in the central part of the county and surrounds the county seat of [[Lebanon, Ohio|Lebanon]].  Turtlecreek is the largest township in the county, originally containing sixty-three whole and seven fractional sections.  It had a population of 12,617 in [[United States Census, 2000|2000]], up from 10,383 in [[United States Census, 1990|1990]].  Of those, 12,114 lived in the unincorporated part of the township, 456 in [[Middletown, Ohio|Middletown]], and 47 in [[Monroe, Butler and Warren County, Ohio|Monroe]].\n\n==Geography==\nLocated in the central and western parts of the county, it borders the following townships:\n*[[Clearcreek Township, Warren County, Ohio|Clearcreek Township]] - north\n*[[Wayne Township, Warren County, Ohio|Wayne Township]] - northeast\n*[[Washington Township, Warren County, Ohio|Washington Township]] - east, across the [[Little Miami River]]\n*[[Salem Township, Warren County, Ohio|Salem Township]] - southeast\n*[[Union Township, Warren County, Ohio|Union Township]] - south\n*[[Deerfield Township, Warren County, Ohio|Deerfield Township]] - southwest\n*[[Lemon Township, Butler County, Ohio|Lemon Township, Butler County]] - west, north of Liberty Township\n*[[Liberty Township, Butler County, Ohio|Liberty Township, Butler County]] - west, south of Liberty Township\n*[[Franklin Township, Warren County, Ohio|Franklin Township]] - northwest\n\nThe city of Lebanon withdrew from the township in the 1960s and formed a [[paper township]].  Portions of the township have also been lost to annexations by the cities of [[Monroe, Ohio|Monroe]], [[Middletown, Ohio|Middletown]], and [[Mason, Ohio|Mason]].  Those areas within Monroe, however, remain in the township.\n\nMost of the township was in the [[Symmes Purchase]], but the two northernmost rows of sections were not, though they are surveyed in the same manner as the Purchase.\n\nThe township is named for the [[Turtle Creek (Ohio)|Turtle Creek]], a stream named for Indian chief [[Little Turtle]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.co.warren.oh.us/genealogy/genealogy/placenames.htm | title=Warren County, Ohio Place Names | publisher=Warren County Genealogical Society | accessdate=13 March 2018 | url-status=bot: unknown | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313042457/http://www.co.warren.oh.us/genealogy/genealogy/placenames.htm | archivedate=13 March 2018 }}</ref>  It is the only Turtlecreek Township statewide, although there is a [[Turtle Creek Township, Shelby County, Ohio|Turtle Creek Township in Shelby County]].\n\n==History==\nTurtlecreek Township was established by the Warren County Commissioners on August 15, 1804.<ref>{{cite book|title=The History of Warren County, Ohio: Containing a History of the County ; Its Townships, Towns|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tyJEAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA433|year=1882|publisher=W.H.

Vacancies in the fiscal officership or on the board of trustees are filled by the remaining trustees.\n\nThere are two large state prisons located in the western part of the township:  [[Lebanon Correctional Institution]] and [[Warren Correctional Institution]].\n\n==Public services==\nBoth [[Interstate 75]] and [[Interstate 71]] cross the township, as do [[U.S. Route 42]] and State Routes [[Ohio State Route 48|48]], 63, [[Ohio State Route 123|123]], [[Ohio State Route 350|350]], and 741.  The [[Lebanon-Warren County Airport]] is located in Turtlecreek Township on Greentree Road between Lebanon and [[Greentree Corners, Ohio|Greentree Corners]].\n\nMost of the township is in the [[Lebanon City School District]] but a portion of the north center is in the [[Springboro Community City School District]].  The portion within the city of Monroe was detached circa 2002 and placed in the new [[Monroe Local School District]].  A part in the northwest is in the [[Middletown City School District]], a part in the southwest is in the [[Mason City Schools (Ohio)|Mason City School District]], and a part in the southeast is in the [[Little Miami School District]].\n\nMost of Turtlecreek Township is served by the Lebanon (45036) and [[Oregonia, Ohio|Oregonia]] (45054) post offices, but parts are served by Middletown (45044), Monroe (45050), Mason (45040), and [[Franklin, Ohio|Franklin]] (45005).

Common examples include ''[[liquid-liquid extraction]]'', and ''[[solid phase extraction]]''. The distribution of a solute between two phases is an equilibrium condition described by partition theory. This is based on exactly how the analyte moves from the initial solvent into the extracting solvent. The term ''washing'' may also be used to refer to an extraction in which impurities are extracted from the solvent containing the desired compound.\n\n== Types of extraction ==\n\n* [[Liquid\u2013liquid extraction]]\n* [[Solid-phase extraction]]\n* [[Acid-base extraction]]\n* [[Supercritical fluid extraction]]\n* Ultrasound-assisted extraction\n* Heat reflux extraction\n* Mechanochemical-assisted extraction\n* Microwave-assisted extraction\n* Instant controlled pressure drop extraction (DIC, from the French, D\u00e9tente instantan\u00e9e contr\u00f4l\u00e9e)\n* [[Perstraction]]\n\n== Laboratory applications and examples ==\n\nLiquid-liquid extractions in the laboratory usually make use of a [[separatory funnel]], where two [[immiscible]] phases are combined to separate a [[Solution|solute]] from one phase into the other, according to the relative solubility in each of the phases. Typically, this will be to extract organic compounds out of an aqueous phase and into an organic phase, but may also include extracting water-soluble impurities from an organic phase into an aqueous phase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Organic_Chemistry/Book%3A_Organic_Chemistry_Lab_Techniques_(Nichols)/4%3A_Extraction|title=4: Extraction|date=2017-10-05|website=Chemistry LibreTexts|language=en|access-date=2019-11-10}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The organic chem lab survival manual : a student's guide to techniques|last=Zubrick|first=James W.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2014|isbn=9781118083390|edition=Ninth|location=Hoboken|pages=127\u2013144|oclc=798220947}}</ref> \n\nCommon extractants may be arranged in increasing order of polarity according to the [[Hildebrand solubility parameter]]:\n\n[[ethyl acetate]] < [[acetone]] < [[ethanol]] < [[methanol]] < acetone:water (7:3) < ethanol:water (8:2) < methanol:water (8:2) < [[water]] \n\nSolid-liquid extractions at laboratory scales can use [[Soxhlet extractor|Soxhlet extractors]]. A solid sample containing the desired compound along with impurities is placed in the thimble. An extracting solvent is chosen in which the impurities are insoluble and the desired compound has at least limited solubility.

Common examples include ''[[liquid-liquid extraction]]'', and ''[[solid phase extraction]]''. The distribution of a solute between two phases is an equilibrium condition described by partition theory.
