Show creator [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]], in an interview with ''[[HuffPost]]'', explained that for the series, \"It was never our top priority to be the voice of depression [...] [''Bojack Horseman'' is not] trying to capture this thing [depression] as much as it is trying to capture this character and what he is.\"<ref name=PICKANAME>Maxwell Strachan.

Verizon Communications: New York, July 23, 2016.</ref> Regardless, Maxwell Strachan of ''[[HuffPost]]'' considers this season, and the show as a whole, to be one of the very few shows that accurately depicts the mental illness, saying \"Outside of a handful of series, depictions of depression in [[Hollywood]] have historically felt one-dimensional, as if writers Googled 'depression' and decided it meant 'sad.' In BoJack, we finally have a fully formed character that deals with depression in all its forms, too. We see BoJack suffocating as he grapples with the idea that he will never reach his own definition of greatness, that it is too late to turn his life around, that his best days are behind him and his worst ones ahead. It's not pretty, but it can be soothing to see someone who relates, even if that someone is a drunk horse with a temper.\" Strachan further explains: \"For a brief moment, it feels as if BoJack has finally had a revelation that could last\u2015that he will stop his self-destructive ways, learn to prioritize the people he cares about and beat his depression forever. But soon enough, BoJack is back in the pit of despair, hating himself and hurting the people around him. It's a sad, familiar cycle. It's also what makes the show so good. 'BoJack Horseman' doesn't excuse bad behavior. But it certainly can help those who are struggling with the depression that can cause that bad behavior to feel less alone.\"<ref name=PICKANAME />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{BoJack Horseman}}\n\n[[Category:2016 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:BoJack Horseman seasons]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television season\n| season_number        = 3\n| bgcolour             = #644d36\n| image                = BoJack Horseman season 3 poster.jpg\n| image_upright        = \n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Season 3 promotional poster\n| starring             = {{Plainlist|\n* [[Will Arnett]]\n* [[Amy Sedaris]]\n* [[Alison Brie]]\n* [[Paul F.

Show creator [[Raphael Bob-Waksberg]], in an interview with ''[[HuffPost]]'', explained that for the series, \"It was never our top priority to be the voice of depression [...] [''Bojack Horseman'' is not] trying to capture this thing [depression] as much as it is trying to capture this character and what he is.\"<ref name=PICKANAME>Maxwell Strachan.

Verizon Communications: New York, July 23, 2016.</ref> Regardless, Maxwell Strachan of ''[[HuffPost]]'' considers this season, and the show as a whole, to be one of the very few shows that accurately depicts the mental illness, saying \"Outside of a handful of series, depictions of depression in [[Hollywood]] have historically felt one-dimensional, as if writers Googled 'depression' and decided it meant 'sad.' In BoJack, we finally have a fully formed character that deals with depression in all its forms, too. We see BoJack suffocating as he grapples with the idea that he will never reach his own definition of greatness, that it is too late to turn his life around, that his best days are behind him and his worst ones ahead. It's not pretty, but it can be soothing to see someone who relates, even if that someone is a drunk horse with a temper.\" Strachan further explains: \"For a brief moment, it feels as if BoJack has finally had a revelation that could last\u2015that he will stop his self-destructive ways, learn to prioritize the people he cares about and beat his depression forever. But soon enough, BoJack is back in the pit of despair, hating himself and hurting the people around him. It's a sad, familiar cycle. It's also what makes the show so good. 'BoJack Horseman' doesn't excuse bad behavior. But it certainly can help those who are struggling with the depression that can cause that bad behavior to feel less alone.\"<ref name=PICKANAME />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{BoJack Horseman}}\n\n[[Category:2016 American television seasons]]\n[[Category:BoJack Horseman seasons]]\n", "name_user": "D and D master 2016", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BoJack_Horseman_(season_3)"}
