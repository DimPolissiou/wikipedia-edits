It was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1907 by W. F. Oakes. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1463>{{cite NSW SHR|5051363|Colemans Bridge over Leycester Creek|hr=01463|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n===Colemans Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was built in 1907 by [[Sydney]] contractor W.

The bridge has a twin cylindrical cast iron central [[Pier (architecture)|pier]]. Timber trestles provide the remaining sub structure. The bridge deck provides a dual lane carriage way and a footpath both sides of the roadway. The minimum width of the carriage way is {{Convert|6.1|m}}.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nAn Armco traffic guard rail provides protection to vehicular traffic and a timber post and rail barrier forms the pedestrian walkway [[handrail]]. Curved steel braces fixed to the top chord of the timber truss help strengthen the outer timber pedestrian barriers.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nIt was reported to be in good physical condition as at 13 September 2005.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n== Heritage listing ==\nColemans Bridge is an early example of Dare timber truss bridges. In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Colemans Bridge has particular technical significance, having iron piers, the only two-lane Dare truss, footways, and long spans. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built. The Colemans Bridge is a representative example of Dare timber truss road bridges, and is assessed as being Nationally significant, primarily on the basis of its technical and historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nColemans Bridge over Leycester Creek was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000 having satisfied the following criteria.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''\n\nThrough the bridge's association with the expansion of the NSW road network, its ability to demonstrate historically important concepts such as the gradual acceptance of NSW people of American design ideas, and its association with Harvey Dare, it has historical significance.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''\n\nThe bridge exhibits the technical excellence of its design, as all of the structural detail is clearly visible.

It was designed by Harvey Dare and built in 1907 by W. F. Oakes. The property is owned by [[Roads and Maritime Services]], an [[government agency|agency]] of the [[Government of New South Wales]]. It was added to the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 20 June 2000.<ref name=nswshr-1463>{{cite NSW SHR|5051363|Colemans Bridge over Leycester Creek|hr=01463|accessdate=2 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n\n===Timber truss bridges===\n\nTimber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges were preferred by the [[NSW Public Works|Public Works Department]] from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]] in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nHarvey Dare, the designer of Dare truss and other bridges, was a leading engineer in the Public Works Department, and a prominent figure in early 20th century NSW.<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\nTimber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \"timber bridge state\".<ref name=nswshr-1463/>\n\n===Colemans Bridge===\n\nThe bridge was built in 1907 by [[Sydney]] contractor W.

In 1998 it was in good condition. As a timber truss road bridge, it has many associational links with important historical events, trends, and people, including the expansion of the road network and economic activity throughout NSW, and Harvey Dare, the designer of this type of truss. Dare trusses were fifth in the five stage design evolution of NSW timber truss road bridges. They were similar to Allan trusses, but contain improvements which make them stronger and easier to maintain. This engineering enhancement represents a significant evolution of the design of timber truss bridges, and gives Dare trusses some technical significance. Colemans Bridge has particular technical significance, having iron piers, the only two-lane Dare truss, footways, and long spans. In 1998 there were 27 surviving Dare trusses in NSW of the 40 built, and 82 timber truss road bridges survive from the over 400 built.

showing the exponential growth of COVID-19 tests in the U.S. since February 26, 2020.

On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the other two throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\n====Travel and entry restrictions====\n\n{{See|Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic}}\n[[File:200318-H-NI589-120 (49679050593).jpg|thumb|US Customs and Border Protection officer checks travel documents of a pilot arriving in Virginia from an international flight]]\n\nChinese health authorities confirmed that they identified a cluster of a novel infectious coronavirus on December 31, 2019, in the city of Wuhan, officially reporting their findings on January 7, 2020.

As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations?

COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations.

Indigenous people also include people indigenous based on their descent from populations that inhabited the country when non-indigenous religions and cultures arrived\u2014or at the establishment of present state boundaries\u2014who retain some or all of their own social, economic, cultural and political institutions, but who may have been displaced from their traditional domains or who may have resettled outside their ancestral domains.{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nThe status of the indigenous groups in the subjugated relationship can be characterized in most instances as an effectively marginalized or isolated in comparison to majority groups or the nation-state as a whole. Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

They form at present non-dominant sectors of society and are determined to preserve, develop, and transmit to future generations their ancestral territories, and their ethnic identity, as the basis of their continued existence as peoples, in accordance with their own cultural patterns, social institutions and legal systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iwgia.org/en/news-alerts/archive?view=article&id=340:a-working-definition-by-jose-martinez-cobo&catid=143|title=A working definition, by Jos\u00e9 Martinez Cobo|last=|first=|date=2011-04-09|website=IWGIA - International Work Group for Indigenous Affairs|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-11}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe primary impetus in considering indigenous identity comes from the post-colonial movements and considering the historical impacts on populations by the European imperialism. The first paragraph of the Introduction of a report published in 2009 by the Secretariat of the Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues published a report,<ref>[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf State of the World's Indigenous Peoples, p. 1] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215113446/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}</ref> states <blockquote>For centuries, since the time of their colonization, conquest or occupation, indigenous peoples have documented histories of resistance, interface or cooperation with states, thus demonstrating their conviction and determination to survive with their distinct sovereign identities. Indeed, indigenous peoples were often recognized as sovereign peoples by states, as witnessed by the hundreds of treaties concluded between indigenous peoples and the governments of the United States, Canada, New Zealand and others.<ref name=\":0\">[https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf State of the World's Indigenous Peoples, Secretariat of Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues, UN, 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100215113446/http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/SOWIP_web.pdf |date=15 February 2010 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn May 2016, the Fifteenth Session of the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] (UNPFII) affirmed that indigenous people (also termed aboriginal people, native people, or autochthonous people) are distinctive groups protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their linguistic and historical ties to a particular territory, prior to later settlement, development, and or occupation of a region.<ref name=\"Coates\">Coates 2004:12</ref> The session affirms that, since indigenous peoples are vulnerable to exploitation, [[Social exclusion|marginalization]], oppression, forced [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], and [[genocide]] by nation states formed from colonizing populations or by different, politically dominant ethnic groups, individuals and communities maintaining ways of life indigenous to their regions are entitled to special protection.\n\n==History==\n\n===Classical antiquity===\nGreek sources of the [[Classical Greece|Classical]] period acknowledge the prior existence of indigenous people(s), whom they referred to as \"[[Pelasgian]]s\". These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The numbers, condition and experience of indigenous groups may vary widely within a given region. A comprehensive survey is further complicated by sometimes contentious membership and identification.\n\n===Africa===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of Africa}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of Africa}}[[File:BushmenSan.jpg|thumb|Starting fire by hand, [[San people]] in Botswana.]]\nIn the post-colonial period, the concept of specific indigenous peoples within the African continent has gained wider acceptance, although not without controversy. The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists. Exceptions include Australia, New Zealand and Hawaii. According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.) ''At the Risk of Being Heard: Indigenous Rights, Identity and Postcolonial States'' University of Michigan Press (2003)[https://web.archive.org/web/20060821225323/http://www.press.umich.edu/titleDetailDesc.do;jsessionid=1ADB525E82D520F3CE8B1393F0EAA914?id=11605]</ref>  These issues include cultural and linguistic preservation, [[land rights]], ownership and exploitation of natural resources, political determination and autonomy, environmental degradation and incursion, poverty, health, and discrimination.\n\nThe interaction between indigenous and non-indigenous societies throughout history has been complex, ranging from outright conflict and subjugation to some degree of mutual benefit and cultural transfer. A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}.

Their ability to influence and participate in the external policies that may exercise [[jurisdiction]] over their traditional lands and practices is very frequently limited. This situation can persist even in the case where the indigenous population outnumbers that of the other inhabitants of the region or state; the defining notion here is one of separation from decision and regulatory processes that have some, at least titular, influence over aspects of their community and [[land rights]].{{cn|date=November 2019}}\n\nIn a ground-breaking 1997 decision involving the [[Ainu people#Litigation|Ainu people]] of Japan, the Japanese courts recognized their claim in law, stating that \"If one minority group lived in an area prior to being ruled over by a majority group and preserved its distinct ethnic culture even after being ruled over by the majority group, while another came to live in an area ruled over by a majority after consenting to the majority rule, it must be recognized that it is only natural that the distinct ethnic culture of the former group requires greater consideration.\"<ref>Judgment of the Sapporo District Court, Civil Division No. 3, 27 March 1997, in (1999) 38 ILM, p. 419</ref>\n\nIn Russia, definition of \"indigenous peoples\" is contested largely referring to a number of population (less than 50 000 people), and neglecting self-identification, origin from indigenous populations who inhabited the country or region upon invasion, colonization or establishment of state frontiers, distinctive social, economic and cultural institutions.<ref>IWGIA (2012).

These peoples inhabited lands surrounding the [[Aegean Sea]] before the subsequent migrations of the [[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] ancestors claimed by these authors. The disposition and precise identity of this former group is elusive, and sources such as [[Homer]], [[Hesiod]] and [[Herodotus]] give varying, partially mythological accounts. However, it is clear that cultures existed whose indigenous characteristics were distinguished by the subsequent Hellenic cultures (and distinct from non-Greek speaking \"foreigners\", termed \"[[barbarian]]s\" by the historical Greeks).\n\n[[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] society flourished between 250&nbsp;BCE and 480&nbsp;CE and commanded successive waves of conquests that gripped more than half of the globe. But because already existent populations within other parts of Europe at the time of [[classical antiquity]] had more in common culturally speaking with the Greco-Roman world, the intricacies involved in expansion across the European frontier were not so contentious relative to indigenous issues.<ref>Hall, Gillette, and Harry Anthony Patrinos. Indigenous Peoples, Poverty and Human Development in Latin America. New York: Palgrave MacMillan, n.d. Google Scholar. Web. 11 Mar. 2013</ref>\n\nHowever, when it came to expansion in other parts of the world, namely Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, then totally new cultural dynamics had entered into the equation, and this expansion became a forerunner of what was to take the Americas, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific by storm in more recent times. Thus, the idea that expansionist societies may encounter peoples who possess cultural customs and racial appearances strikingly different from those of the colonizing power was not new to the [[Renaissance]] or the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].\n\n[[File:AlonsoFernandezdeLugo2.JPG|thumb|right|[[Alonso Fern\u00e1ndez de Lugo]] presenting the captured [[Guanches|Guanche]] kings of [[Tenerife]] to [[Ferdinand and Isabella]].]]\n\n===European expansion and colonialism===\n{{See also|Columbian exchange}}\nThe rapid and extensive spread of the various European powers from the early 15th century onward had a profound impact upon many of the indigenous cultures with whom they came into contact. The [[Age of Discovery|exploratory]] and colonial ventures in the Americas, Africa, Asia and the Pacific often resulted in territorial and cultural conflict, and the intentional or unintentional displacement and devastation of the indigenous populations.\n\nEncounters between explorers and indigenous populations in the rest of the world often introduced new [[Infection|infectious diseases]], which sometimes caused local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. For example, [[smallpox]], [[measles]], malaria, yellow fever, and others were unknown in pre-Columbian America and Australia.\n\nThe [[Canary Islands]] had an indigenous population called the [[Guanches]] whose origin is still the subject of discussion among historians and linguists.<ref>[https://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html Old World Contacts/Colonists/Canary Islands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013124301/http://ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/oldwrld/colonists/canary.html |date=13 October 2007 }}.

The United Nations estimates that there are over 370 million indigenous people living in over 70 countries worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/5session_factsheet1.pdf|title=Who are indigenous peoples?|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> This would equate to just fewer than 6% of the total [[world population]].

Many indigenous populations have undergone a dramatic decline and even extinction, and remain threatened in many parts of the world. Some have also been assimilated by other populations or have undergone many other changes. In other cases, indigenous populations are undergoing a recovery or expansion in numbers.\n\nCertain indigenous societies survive even though they may no longer inhabit their \"traditional\" lands, owing to migration, relocation, forced resettlement or having been supplanted by other cultural groups.  In many other respects, the [[transformation of culture]] of indigenous groups is ongoing, and includes permanent loss of language, loss of lands, encroachment on traditional territories, and disruption in traditional ways of life due to contamination and pollution of waters and lands.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Environmental and economic benefits of having indigenous peoples tend land===\nA WRI report mentions that \u201ctenure-secure\u201d indigenous lands generates billions and sometimes trillions of dollars\u2019 worth of benefits in the form of carbon sequestration, reduced pollution, clean water and more.

The highly diverse and numerous ethnic groups that comprise most modern, independent African states contain within them various peoples whose situation, cultures and [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] or [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyles are generally marginalized and set apart from the dominant political and economic structures of the nation. Since the late 20th century these peoples have increasingly sought recognition of their rights as distinct indigenous peoples, in both national and international contexts.\n\nThough the vast majority of African peoples are indigenous in the sense that they originate from that continent, in practice, identity as an ''indigenous people'' per the modern definition is more restrictive, and certainly not every African ethnic group claims identification under these terms. Groups and communities who do claim this recognition are those who, by a variety of historical and environmental circumstances, have been placed outside of the dominant state systems, and whose traditional practices and land claims often come into conflict with the objectives and policies implemented by governments, companies and surrounding dominant societies.\n\n===Americas===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n{{See also|:Category:Indigenous peoples of the Americas}}\n[[File:Quechuawomanandchild.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quechuas|Quechua]] woman and child in the [[Sacred Valley]], Andes, Peru.]]\nIndigenous peoples of the American continent are broadly recognized as being those groups and their descendants who inhabited the region before the arrival of European colonizers and settlers (i.e., [[Pre-Columbian]]). Indigenous peoples who maintain, or seek to maintain, traditional ways of life are found from the high Arctic north to the southern extremities of [[Tierra del Fuego]].\n\nThe impact of [[European colonization of the Americas]] on the indigenous communities has been in general quite severe, with many authorities estimating ranges of significant [[Population history of American indigenous peoples|population decline]] primarily due to disease but also violence. The extent of this impact is the subject of much continuing debate. Several peoples shortly thereafter became extinct, or very nearly so.\n\nAll nations in North and South America have populations of indigenous peoples within their borders. In some countries (particularly in Latin American), indigenous peoples form a sizable component of the overall national population \u2014 in Bolivia they account for an estimated 56\u201370% of the total nation, and at least half of the population in Guatemala and the Andean and Amazonian nations of Peru. In English, indigenous peoples are collectively referred to by different names that vary by region and include such ethnonyms as [[Native Americans (Americas)|Native Americans]], [[Amerindians]], and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]]. In Spanish or Portuguese speaking countries one finds the use of terms such as ''pueblos [[wikt:ind\u00edgena|ind\u00edgenas]]'', ''amerindios'', ''povos nativos'', ''povos ind\u00edgenas'', and, in Peru, ''Comunidades Nativas'' (Native Communities), particularly among Amazonian societies like the [[Urarina]]<ref>Dean, Bartholomew 2009 ''Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia'', Gainesville: University Press of Florida {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3378-5}} [http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07]</ref> and [[Mats\u00e9s]].

These groups are often together spoken of as [[Indigenous Australians]].\n\nMany of the present-day Pacific Island nations in the Oceania region were originally populated by [[Polynesia]]n, [[Melanesia]]n and [[Micronesia]]n peoples over the course of thousands of years. European colonial expansion in the Pacific brought many of these under non-indigenous administration. During the 20th century several of these former colonies gained independence and nation-states were formed under local control. However, various peoples have put forward claims for indigenous recognition where their islands are still under external administration; examples include the [[Chamorros]] of [[Guam]] and the [[Northern Marianas]], and the [[Marshallese people|Marshallese]] of the [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nThe remains of at least 25 miniature humans, who lived between 1,000 and 3,000 years ago, were recently found on the islands of [[Palau]] in Micronesia.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2008/mar/12/fossils Pygmy human remains found on rock islands], Science | The Guardian</ref>\n\nIn most parts of Oceania, indigenous peoples outnumber the descendants of colonists.

According to the 2013 census, New Zealand [[M\u0101ori people|Maori]] make up 14.9% of the population of New Zealand, with less than half (46.5%) of all Maori residents identifying solely as Maori. The Maori are indigenous to Polynesia and settled New Zealand relatively recently, the migrations were thought to have occurred in the 13th century CE. In New Zealand pre-contact Maori peoples were not a single people, thus the more recent grouping into tribal (iwi) arrangements has become a more formal arrangement in more recent times. Many Maori national leaders signed a treaty with the British, the [[Treaty of Waitangi]], which formed the modern geo-political entity that is New Zealand.\n\nA majority of the [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) population is indigenous, with more than 700 different nationalities recognized out of a total population of 8 million.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15436981|title=Papua New Guinea country profile|date=2018|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-02-01|language=en-GB}}</ref> The country's Constitution and key statutes identify traditional or custom-based practices and land tenure, and explicitly set out to promote the viability of these traditional societies within the modern state.

Some challenges are specific to particular groups; however, other challenges are commonly experienced.<ref>Bartholomew Dean and Jerome Levi (eds.)

A particular aspect of [[Anthropology|anthropological study]] involves investigation into the ramifications of what is termed [[First contact (anthropology)|''first contact'']], the study of what occurs when two cultures first encounter one another. The situation can be further confused when there is a complicated or contested history of migration and population of a given region, which can give rise to disputes about primacy and ownership of the land and resources.\n\nWherever indigenous cultural identity is asserted, common societal issues and concerns arise from the indigenous status. These concerns are often not unique to indigenous groups. Despite the diversity of indigenous peoples, it may be noted that they share common problems and issues in dealing with the prevailing, or invading, society. They are generally concerned that the cultures of indigenous peoples are being lost and that indigenous peoples suffer both discrimination and pressure to assimilate into their surrounding societies. This is borne out by the fact that the lands and cultures of nearly all of the peoples listed at the end of this article are under threat. Notable exceptions are the [[Yakuts|Sakha]] and [[Komi peoples]] (two northern [[indigenous peoples of Russia]]), who now control their own autonomous republics within the Russian state, and the Canadian [[Inuit]], who form a majority of the territory of [[Nunavut]] (created in 1999). Despite the control of their territories, many Sakha people have lost their lands as a result of the [[Russian Homestead Act]], which allows any Russian citizen to own any land in the Far Eastern region of Russia. In Australia, a landmark case, ''Mabo'' v ''Queensland'' (No 2),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCATrans/1991/23.pdf|title=Mabo v Queensland|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref> saw the High Court of Australia reject the idea of {{Lang|la|terra nullius}}.

Some philosophers, such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588-1679), considered indigenous people to be merely \"savages\". Others (especially literary figures in the 18th century) popularised the concept of \"[[noble savage]]s\".
