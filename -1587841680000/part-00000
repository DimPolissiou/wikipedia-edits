Since mass is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, the mass flow rate (the time derivative of mass) is also a scalar quantity. The change in mass is the amount that flows ''after'' crossing the boundary for some time duration, not the initial amount of mass at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in mass flowing through the area would be zero for [[steady flow]].\n\n==Alternative equations==\n\nMass flow rate can also be calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho \\cdot \\dot V = \\rho \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere:\n*''<math>\\dot V</math>'' or '''Q''' = [[Volumetric flow rate|Volume flow rate]],\n*''&rho;'' = mass [[density]] of the fluid,\n*'''v''' = [[Flow velocity]] of the mass elements,\n*'''A''' = [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[vector area]]/surface,\n* '''j'''<sub>m</sub> = [[mass flux]].\n\nThe above equation is only true for a flat, plane area. In general, including cases where the area is curved, the equation becomes a [[surface integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\iint_A \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = \\iint_A \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nThe [[area]] required to calculate the mass flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. E.g. for substances passing through a [[Filter paper|filter]] or a [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopically]] - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered. The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>. The relation is <math>\\mathbf{A} = A \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>.\n\nThe reason for the dot product is as follows. The only mass flowing ''through'' the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the unit normal. This amount is:  \n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos\\theta </math>\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the unit normal <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math> and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor <math>\\cos\\theta </math>, as ''\u03b8'' increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is [[perpendicular]] to the unit normal, ''doesn't'' actually pass ''through'' the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when ''\u03b8'' = ''\u03c0''/2:\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0</math>\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced.

[[Bill Snyder]], and was dubbed as the Kansas State \"Family Reunion\".  Over 300 former Kansas State players were in attendance, and 50,750 fans (the largest crowd to witness a season opener in Manhattan) watched the Wildcats beat UMASS 21-17.  K-State quarterback [[Carson Coffman]] completed 14 out of 27 passes, totaling to 182 yards, including two passing touchdowns and a rushing score.  This was the second all-time meeting between the Wildcats and Minutemen, the Wildcats now own the series 2-0.\n{{-}}\n\n===Louisiana Lafayette===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=2\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=13\n|Home='''Louisiana Lafayette'''\n|H1=0\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=3\n}}\nThis was the first ever trip for the Wildcats to [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].  K-State was favored by 7 points going into the game.  Tyler Albrecht's first career field goal attempt was a memorable one as the junior nailed a 48-yarder with 32 seconds left to give Louisiana-Lafayette a 17-15 victory over Kansas State.\n\nThe Ragin' Cajuns, unbeaten through their first two games for the first time since 1990, trailed 15-14 before driving from their 33 to the Kansas State 30. Louisiana-Lafayette had only two first downs in the second half before quarterback Chris Masson completed four passes for 30 yards in the final drive.  Kansas State (1-1) rallied from a 14-2 deficit with two fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\nWildcat running back Daniel Thomas threw for one score and ran for one, throwing a 3-yard jump pass to Jeron Mastrud off a direct snap on the first play of the final quarter.\n\nSeven minutes later, Thomas capped an 86-yard drive with a 3-yard run, and Josh Cherry hit the extra point for the 15-14 lead with 8:08 left.  Thomas finished with 136 rushing yards, 92 in the second half.  The Wildcats took a 2-0 lead when Masson ran out of his own end zone after a bad snap with 2:43 left in the opening quarter.\n\nMasson, who finished 20-for-36 for 185 yards, came back to guide the Ragin' Cajuns on a 61-yard drive that was capped by Undrea Sails' 9-yard touchdown run with 9:37 left in the first half.  Louisiana-Lafayette drove 73 yards in the final 2:19 of the half to take a 14-2 halftime lead on Masson's 1-yard pass to Luke Aubrey.\n\nThe Ragin' Cajuns had three first-half turnovers, but the Wildcats couldn't take advantage despite having five first-half possessions in Ragin' Cajun territory. Kansas State was 0-for-8 on third-down conversions in the first half.<ref>http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3065&SPID=212&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=204793145 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914132855/http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3065&SPID=212&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=204793145 |date=2009-09-14 }} Louisiana Lafayette recap</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===UCLA===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1= 3\n|R2= 0\n|R3= 6\n|R4= 0\n|Home='''UCLA'''\n|H1= 7\n|H2= 6\n|H3= 0\n|H4= 10\n}}\n{{See also|2009 UCLA Bruins football team}}\nUCLA had a 2-0 record at game time, winning over San Diego State 33-14 at home and beating Tennessee 19-15 on the road.  UCLA was favored by 11\u00bd points going into the game in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].  It was the first ever game between the two schools. Senior quarterback [[Kevin Craft]] took over from injured [[Kevin Prince]] for the Bruins.\n\nCraft passed for 186 yards and a touchdown to lead the Bruins to a 23-9 victory over the Wildcats.  Freshman Johnathan Franklin rushed for a career-best 119 yards on 23 carries and Kai Forbath kicked three field goals in the victory.  Craft completed 13 of 24 passes with one interception including a game-clinching 51-yard scoring pass to Terrence Austin with 6:18 remaining.<ref>[http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2009-2010/ksucla.html Final Stats], ''UCLABruins.com'', September 19, 2009.

Ryan Doerr's PAT pass failed. UCLA's one fumble loss and eight penalties for 80 yards were the ugly part of the victory. The Wildcats had two fumbles and four penalties for 50 yards. Alterra Verner had two interceptions and returned them for 47 yards for the Bruins.\n{{-}}\n\n===Tennessee Tech===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Tennessee Tech\n|R1=7\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=14\n|H2=7\n|H3=21\n|H4=7\n}}\nSenior [[Brandon Banks]] became the 12th player in NCAA history, including the first Big 12 player, to return two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same game, as Kansas State rolled past Tennessee Tech, 49-7 [[Bill Snyder Family Stadium]].\n\nBanks, whose 303 all-purpose yards ranks fifth in school history, broke a 7-all tie with a 91-yard kick return with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter then jump-started the second half with a 92-yard return to give the Wildcats a 28-7 lead.  Banks also had three receptions for 90 yards, including an electrifying 64-yard reception to set up a 2-yard score by junior running back Daniel Thomas in the second quarter.  The last player to achieve the feat of two kickoff returns for touchdowns was UCLA's Brandon Breazell against Northwestern in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 30, 2005.\n\nBanks' banner day overshadowed another fine outing by Thomas, who recorded his third 100-yard rushing game of the season with a career-high 139 yards to go with two touchdowns.  Two other rushers - seniors Keithen Valentine (73 yards on 10 carries) and Grant Gregory (58 yards on nine carries) - tallied 50 or more yards to help the Wildcats post their highest rushing total since 2005.\n\nJunior quarterback [[Carson Coffman]] was also solid on the day, completing 8-of-9 passes for 131 yards.  He also capped K-State's second offensive scoring drive with a 5-yard score in the second quarter.\n\nBackup signal caller Grant Gregory saw his most significant action of the season, playing most of the third and fourth quarters.  Gregory was a perfect 2-of-2 passing for 21 yards to go with 58 yards rushing.  He scored his first career touchdown as a Wildcat on a one-yard run with 10:50 left in the fourth quarter that capped the scoring.\n\nThe Kansas State offense finished with a season-high 49 points, which was four more than it had totaled in its three previous games of the season.  The squad also collected season bests for total yards (448) and rushing yards (296).  The 296 yards rushing were the most since the Wildcats had 305 yards against North Texas on Sept. 24, 2005.\n\nThe defense was again stellar on the afternoon, holding the Golden Eagles to just 107 yards of total offense including negative 19 yards rushing to go with three sacks.  It was the fewest yards yielded an opponent since allowing 53 yards against Ball State on Sept. 16, 2000, while it was lowest rushing output by an foe since Baylor had minus 37 yards rushing on Oct. 26, 2002.    \n{{-}}\n\n===Iowa State===\n{{See also|2009 Iowa State Cyclones football team}}\n\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Kansas State'''\n|R1=7\n|R2=3\n|R3=0\n|R4=14\n|Home=Iowa State\n|H1=0\n|H2=10\n|H3=7\n|H4=6\n}}\nIowa State was favored by 2 points going into the game.  Kansas State sophomore defensive back Emmanuel Lamur blocked the tying extra-point with 32 seconds remaining to help Kansas State earn its first Big 12 win with a 24-23 victory over Iowa State at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nSenior quarterback [[Grant Gregory]] threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns in his first career start as a Wildcat, completing 16 of 23 passes for 206 yards to go with 29 yards rushing on 14 carries and one touchdown.  The go-ahead score came with 5:36 remaining in the game in which Gregory rolled out to avoid the rush before hitting senior wideout [[Brandon Banks]] on a 54-yard strike.\n\nJunior running back Daniel Thomas nearly collected his fourth 100-yard game of the season, posting 96 yards on 25 carries.  He also had five catches for 38 yards, including a 13-yard catch.  Banks, the reigning Big 12 Special Teams of the Week, totaled 164 of all-purpose yards, including four catches for 66 yards and a touchdown and three kickoffs for 67 yards.\n\nThe offenses were nearly identical with Iowa State (3-2, 0-1 Big 12) holding a narrow advantage on total yards, 371-360.  The Wildcats (3-2, 1-0 Big 12) had 206 yards passing to go with 154 yards on the ground.  Once again, K-State held the edge in time of possession (33:33 to 26:27) and converted eight of 16 third-down conversions.\n\nGregory got the scoring started with a 2-yard run to cap a 13-play, 89-yard drive on its opening possession that consumed seven minutes of the first quarter.  Thomas got the ball on the first five possession and totaled 30 yards on seven rushes.\n\nIowa State responded with a 32-yard field goal from Grant Mahoney with 9:39 left in the second quarter then took a 10-7 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass from Austen Arnaud to Derrick Catlett with 3:55 left in the quarter.\n\nHowever, the Wildcats tied the score at 10-all with a 39-yard field goal from Josh Cherry just five seconds before the half.  Gregory was stellar on the 10-play, 48-yard drive, completing four of seven passes for 39 yards.  He hit senior Attrail Snipes for a 24-yard touchdown on a key third down play to put the Wildcats in Iowa State territory.\n\nThe third quarter belonged to the Cyclones, who went ahead 17-10 on a 3-yard run by Arnaud that capped a 12-play, 80-yard drive.\n\nHowever, just minutes into the fourth quarter, sophomore David Garrett forced a fumble after a 12-yard catch by Derrick Catlett and Tysyn Hartman recovered on the Iowa State 36.  Seven plays later, on third and goal from the 16, Gregory connected on a 16-yard pass to wideout [[Lamark Brown]] tie the game up at 17 apiece.\n\nK-State then went ahead on the dramatic 54-yard catch by Banks with 5:36 remaining in the game.\n\nAfter the Wildcat defense forced a third-and-out, K-State tried to run out the clock with a six-play drive that cut the time to 1:49.  However, Arnaud converted a key 4-and-5 play with a 22-yard pass completion to Marqui Hamilton for a first down at the Kansas State 23.  He then connected on a 23-yard strike to Jake Williams over two defenders to cut the deficit to 24-23.  On the next play, Lamur blocked the Grant Mahoney's extra point to give the Wildcats the win.\n\nThe defense was led by the play of linebacker Alex Hrebec, who had a team-high eight tackles.  Defensive back Joshua Moore had 5\u00bd tackles and a break-up, while Jeffrey Fitzgerald totaled five tackles.  Linebacker John Houlik posted 4\u00bd tackles and one fumble recovery and defensive back Stephen Harrison had four stops and two pass break-ups.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Texas Tech===\n{{See also|2009 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team}}\n\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=7\n|R4=7\n|Home='''Texas Tech'''\n|H1=14\n|H2=24\n|H3=14\n|H4=14\n}}\nTexas Tech was favored by 16\u00bd points going into the game.  Tech quarterback Steven Sheffield threw for 490 yards and seven touchdown passes in his first career start to help Texas Tech beat Kansas State 66-14.\n\nThe Red Raiders backup quarterback was 33-for-41 and finished with TDs passes of 52, 6, 4, 72, 28, 12 and 25 yards to five receivers.  It was the second time this season that a Texas Tech (4-2, 1-1 Big 12) quarterback notched seven passing touchdowns. Taylor Potts, out with a concussion this week, threw seven in a 55-10 win over Rice.\n\nTexas Tech put the game out of reach by halftime. The Wildcats (3-3, 1-1 Big 12) got into Texas Tech territory only once in the first half and punted five times.  Sheffield, who had 370 yards by halftime, threw two TDs to Detron Lewis and Torres, and one each to Tramain Swindall, Jacoby Franks and Lyle Leong.  Sheffield's first-half yardage set a school record, besting the 367 yards thrown by B.J. Symons against Mississippi in 2003.\n\nThree Red Raiders receivers tallied 90 yards or more. Lewis caught eight passes for 100 yards, Franks had three passes for 99 yards and Swindall got 97 yards on five catches.\n\nSheffield threw to 11 receivers before leaving the game with about 10 minutes remaining in the game.  Texas Tech's running game kept Kansas State off-balance. Baron Batch rushed for 86 yards on nine carries and Harrison Jeffers got 55 yards on seven carries.\n\nThe Wildcats offense was anemic in the first half. They sustained only one drive in the first half, managing four first downs and hanging onto the ball for more than six minutes on their opening possession. [[Grant Gregory]] got sacked three times-twice by Brandon Sharpe and once by Ra'Jon Henley-before [[Carson Coffman]] replaced him late in the second quarter.\n\nKansas State's first score came from its defense. Sheffield threw an interception on his first pass of the second half when Wildcats end Jeffrey Fitzgerald stepped in front of a ball meant for Alex Torres and returned it 17 yards to make it 38-7.\n\nIt wasn't until quarterback Carson Coffman replaced Gregory that the Wildcats showed some life. He was 11-for-17 and finished with 131 passing yards.\n\nCoffman found some success in the third quarter but it didn't translate into a touchdown. After a 52-yard pass to Daniel Thomas and a 29-yarder to Jeron Mastrud, the Wildcats failed on a fourth-and-5 and gave the ball back to the Red Raiders.\n\nKansas State scored its second touchdown-and its only offensive one- midway through the fourth quarter when Keithen Valentine ran for an 8-yard touchdown to whittle the margin to 59-14.\n\nValentine rushed for a career-high 96 yards on eight carries\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Texas A&M===\n{{See also|2009 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Texas A&M\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=14\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=17\n|H2=21\n|H3=21\n|H4=3\n}}\nThe Kansas State Wildcats made a statement in their 62-14 blistering of Texas A&M. [[Bill Snyder]] and his team put together a complete performance dominating the Aggies in all three phases - offense, defense and special teams. It was the most points K-State has scored in a [[Big 12 Conference]] game since defeating Kansas 64-0 on November 2, 2002.\n\nAlready ahead 38-0 at the half, K-State (4-3, 2-1 Big 12) got the ball first in the second half and immediately put points on the board. Return specialist [[Brandon Banks]] returned his school-record third kickoff of the year for a touchdown to pull ahead 45-0. Then, K-State intercepted a pass and returned it inside the 10-yard line and scored on the first play to put A&M further back, 52-0.\n\nThe Wildcats gained 424 yards of total offense on the day and saw a career day from running back Daniel Thomas, as he rushed for 91 yards and scored four touchdowns - all of them coming in the first half. His four TDs were one short of tying a school record.\n\nTexas A&M (3-3, 0-2 Big 12) could not get anything going on offense as the Wildcats swarmed to the ball on defense and forced a season-high five turnovers on the night. The Aggies gained 301 total yards, and quarterback Jerrod Johnson threw his first three interceptions of the season.\n\nK-State's defense helped the Wildcats get on the board early in the game forcing a turnover on Texas A&M's second play from scrimmage. Jeffrey Fitzgerald stripped the ball out of Jamie McCoy's arms as the fumble was recovered by Troy Butler. The Wildcats would make quick work of the short field and score in four plays to cover the 29 yards to go ahead 7-0 on a Daniel Thomas touchdown run. It marked the third time this season the Wildcats have scored on their opening possession.\n\nThe Wildcat defense came up with another stop after allowing the Aggies to gain one first down on their second possession. A penalty on the punt return by Texas A&M and a pass interference call helped K-State push the ball downfield before a 23-yard field goal by Josh Cherry gave the Wildcats a 10-point advantage.\n\nK-State's defense continued to pour it on against the Aggies forcing a three-and-out following the field goal. After an incomplete pass, Fitzgerald tallied a tackle for loss on a rushing attempt by the Aggies. Then, Fitzgerald struck again with a sack to put A&M's punter in the shadow of his own goal post.\n\nA big return by Brandon Banks, paired with a face mask penalty at the end of the return, helped set up another quick strike by K-State's offense. Thomas scored his second touchdown of the day on a three-yard pitch-and-run to the right corner of the endzone on the third play of the drive, and the Wildcats went ahead 17-0 with 3:34 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nThomas scored his third touchdown of the day to pull further ahead, 24-0, on a nine-yard rush to the left midway through the second quarter. The 67-yard scoring drive was set up by a 45-yard completion to tight end Jeron Mastrud on the second play. The catch was Mastrud's 100th of his career to put him 10th all-time at K-State.\n\nJust as Texas A&M began to move the ball with its first significant drive of the evening, Tysyn Hartman picked off a pass across the middle in the redzone and the first surrendered by A&M quarterback Jerrod Johnson all season. Johnson had thrown 225 passes without being intercepted this season. The pick was Hartman's fourth of the year as well.\n\nThe Daniel Thomas show continued heading into the locker room at the half. With just over a minute left in the second quarter, Thomas scored on a 17-yard rush as the quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. The score gave him four touchdowns in the first half alone and gave K-State a 31-0 lead.\n\nA fumble recovery by Joseph Kassanavoid at the 16-yard line with 15 seconds remaining put K-State in a position to put more points on the board heading into the locker room at halftime. On the ensuing play [[Grant Gregory]] found Collin Klein alone in the endzone for a 16-yard touchdown pass and a 38-0 lead at halftime.\n\nThe Wildcats controlled the clock in the second half with its ground game, and the Aggies still could not stop it. Keithen Valentine scored his second touchdown of the game on a 20-yard scamper to the endzone that saw him change directions twice before cutting it across the middle for the score to pull ahead 59-0.\n\nA&M scored 14 unanswered points in the third quarter to cut the lead to 59-14, but it would not be enough as the Wildcats continued to milk the clock keeping the ball in bounds and gaining first downs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Colorado===\n{{See also|2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Colorado\n|R1=6\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=3\n|H2=17\n|H3=0\n|H4=0\n}}\nKansas State's defense came up big against Colorado to give the Wildcats a 20-6 homecoming victory and remain atop the Big 12 North standings. K-State limited the Buffaloes to 244 total yards on offense and just 60 on the ground.\n\nWhile the Wildcat defense was able to shut down the Buffalo offense, K-State's own offense controlled the tempo of the game with quick strikes in the first half to build a lead and long clock-eating drives in the second half to hold off the Buffaloes.\n\nAfter Colorado (2-5, 1-2 Big 12) scored on its opening drive, K-State (5-3, 3-1) stifled the Buffaloes the remainder of the game by not surrendering any points. This was the lowest point total allowed to a Big 12 opponent by the K-State defense since Oct. 8, 2005 against Kansas.\n\nWith Colorado threatening to score late in the game on fourth down from the two-yard line, Emmanuel Lamur came up with his second interception of the day to preserve the win. Both of Lamur's interceptions were 50-50 balls where he ripped the ball out of a receiver's hands as they both got to the play at the same time.\n\nRunning back Daniel Thomas carried much of the load for K-State with a career-high 145 yards rushing on 20 carries with one score. Defensively for K-State, Ulla Pomele led with seven tackles, including his first sack of the season. Jeffrey Fitzgerald continued his strong play from a week ago with 1.5 sacks and a number of quarterback pressures.\n\nA 35-yard rush by Thomas down the K-State sideline helped the Wildcats march down the field on their first drive of the game and put points on the board first with a 24-yard field goal by Josh Cherry to cap off the drive of 61 yards. Cherry has converted four straight field goal opportunities and remains perfect in Big 12 action.\n\nThe Buffaloes also scored on their first drive of the game to answer K-State's field goal with a touchdown by running back Rodney Stewart. Colorado would miss the extra point, however, to lead 6-3.\n\nThomas tallied his ninth touchdown run of the season early in the second quarter, as the Wildcats completed a 58-yard drive to reclaim the lead, 10-6.\n\nK-State saw the momentum shift to its side with the game's first turnover, when Colorado quarterback Tyler Hansen fumbled the snap on a first-and-20 situation from the Buffaloes' own 15-yard line. Pomele recovered the fumble for the Wildcats, and K-State kicked a 27-yard field goal after the Wildcats could not punch the ball into the endzone to lead, 13-6.\n\nAll the swing plays seemed to go K-State's way in the first half with a muffed punt by Colorado gave the Wildcats the ball at the Colorado 20-yard line with 3:35 remaining in the second quarter. After the Buffaloes forced a three-and-out on defense, Jason Espinoza muffed the punt and K-State long-snapper Corey Adams recovered the ball for K-State.\n\nThe Wildcats would take full advantage of the turnover this time around, as Gregory punched the ball in on a rush up the middle for five yards to go ahead 20-6 with just over a minute remaining in the half.\n\nAnother turnover in the closing seconds of the half gave K-State a shot at the endzone to finish the half. Lamur ripped a pass out of the hands of a Colorado receiver for an interception as they both went up for the ball at the same time. The pick gave K-State the ball at its own 46-yard line but could not score heading into the locker room.\n\nThe third quarter saw each team's defense shutdown the respective offenses with no points being scored. K-State gained just 49 yards in the third quarter while Colorado could only muster 25 with negative-three yards rushing thanks to a number of sacks and quarterback pressures by K-State.\n{{-}}\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{See also|2009 Oklahoma Sooners football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=0\n|R2=9\n|R3=14\n|R4=7\n|Home='''Oklahoma'''\n|H1=21\n|H2=7\n|H3=0\n|H4=14\n}}\nSenior [[Brandon Banks]] tied the K-State school record with 351 all-purpose yards, including 98 on his fifth career kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough as the Wildcats fell to No. 22 Oklahoma, 42-30 at Memorial Stadium.\n\nBanks totaled 195 yards on six kickoff returns to go with nine catches for 156 yards against the Sooners.  The 351 all-purpose yards tied [[Darren Sproles]]' school record, which he set against Louisiana\u2013Lafayette on Sept. 18, 2004.  Banks, who helped the Wildcats' close the gap with his return, increased his Big 12 and school records with his fifth career kickoff return and fourth this season.\n\nK-State (5-4, 3-2 Big 12) fell behind 21-0 to Oklahoma (5-3, 3-1 Big 12), but rallied to within five points on two occasions, including 35-30 after Banks' 98-yard return.  However, the Sooners put the game away with a 3-yard run by [[DeMarco Murray]] with 6:27 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Sooners stopped Kansas State on downs at the K-State 41 with 4:10 left and Quinton Carter intercepted a pass from [[Grant Gregory]] at the Oklahoma 2 with 42 seconds left.\n\nDespite the loss, the Wildcat offense totaled 30 points on the stingy Sooner defense, which previous opponent high was 21 points against Miami.  The squad tallied 364 yards of total offense, including 215 through the air, and posted 20 first downs.  K-State also remained atop the conference's North Division.\n\nSenior quarterback Grant Gregory was solid on the night, completing 19-of-30 passes for 174 yards to go with 46 yards on the ground on nine carries.  It marked season-high for Gregory in passing yards, completions and attempts.\n\nJunior running back Daniel Thomas, who is 98 yards from 1,000 yards this season, rushed for 88 yards on 16 carries.  He also completed one pass for 41 yards and had a 2-point conversion to Jeron Mastrud on the Wildcats' second touchdown.  Senior running back Keithen Valentine had just four carries, but two of those went for scores, including a 14-yard scamper on fourth-and-one in the third quarter.\n\nOklahoma was led by redshirt freshman quarterback [[Landry Jones]], who completed 26 of 37 passes for 294 yards and four touchdowns.  DeJuan Miller, who had 11 catches all season entering the game, led the Sooners with nine for 94 yards, while Ryan Broyles had eight for 91 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nRunning backs Chris Brown and DeMarco Murray combined for 145 yards rushing for the Sooners, including 83 from Brown on 15 carries.\n\nOklahoma has won 28 straight home games, the longest active streak in the Bowl Subdivision.  Oklahoma was favored by 28 points going into the game.\n{{-}}\n\n===Kansas===\nThis was the 107th meeting between Kansas and Kansas State.

The Wildcats played their home games in [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium]], in [[Manhattan, Kansas]] as they have done since 1968. It was the [[List of Kansas State Wildcats football seasons|114th season in school history]].\n\nThe non-conference schedule kicked off with a home game against the [[2009 UMass Minutemen football team|UMass Minutemen]], and culminated with the second trip in school history to [[Los Angeles, California]] to play [[2009 UCLA Bruins football team|UCLA]] in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].  (They played at [[USC Trojans football|USC]] in 2001).  The Big 12 Conference schedule began with a trip to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]] to play the [[2009 Iowa State Cyclones football team|Iowa State Cyclones]].  It was K-State's third trip to Arrowhead Stadium to play a regular season game.  They played the [[2009 Iowa Hawkeyes football team|Iowa Hawkeyes]] in the [[Eddie Robinson Classic]] in 2000 and the [[California Golden Bears football|California Golden Bears]] in the [[Black Coaches & Administrators#BCA Classic|BCA Classic]] in 2003.

[[Carson Coffman]] won the starting quarterback role during the pre-season but lost his job to [[Grant Gregory]] at the start of conference play.

[[Bill Snyder]], and was dubbed as the Kansas State \"Family Reunion\".  Over 300 former Kansas State players were in attendance, and 50,750 fans (the largest crowd to witness a season opener in Manhattan) watched the Wildcats beat UMASS 21-17.  K-State quarterback [[Carson Coffman]] completed 14 out of 27 passes, totaling to 182 yards, including two passing touchdowns and a rushing score.  This was the second all-time meeting between the Wildcats and Minutemen, the Wildcats now own the series 2-0.\n{{-}}\n\n===Louisiana Lafayette===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=2\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=13\n|Home='''Louisiana Lafayette'''\n|H1=0\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=3\n}}\nThis was the first ever trip for the Wildcats to [[Lafayette, Louisiana]].  K-State was favored by 7 points going into the game.  Tyler Albrecht's first career field goal attempt was a memorable one as the junior nailed a 48-yarder with 32 seconds left to give Louisiana-Lafayette a 17-15 victory over Kansas State.\n\nThe Ragin' Cajuns, unbeaten through their first two games for the first time since 1990, trailed 15-14 before driving from their 33 to the Kansas State 30. Louisiana-Lafayette had only two first downs in the second half before quarterback Chris Masson completed four passes for 30 yards in the final drive.  Kansas State (1-1) rallied from a 14-2 deficit with two fourth-quarter touchdowns.\n\nWildcat running back Daniel Thomas threw for one score and ran for one, throwing a 3-yard jump pass to Jeron Mastrud off a direct snap on the first play of the final quarter.\n\nSeven minutes later, Thomas capped an 86-yard drive with a 3-yard run, and Josh Cherry hit the extra point for the 15-14 lead with 8:08 left.  Thomas finished with 136 rushing yards, 92 in the second half.  The Wildcats took a 2-0 lead when Masson ran out of his own end zone after a bad snap with 2:43 left in the opening quarter.\n\nMasson, who finished 20-for-36 for 185 yards, came back to guide the Ragin' Cajuns on a 61-yard drive that was capped by Undrea Sails' 9-yard touchdown run with 9:37 left in the first half.  Louisiana-Lafayette drove 73 yards in the final 2:19 of the half to take a 14-2 halftime lead on Masson's 1-yard pass to Luke Aubrey.\n\nThe Ragin' Cajuns had three first-half turnovers, but the Wildcats couldn't take advantage despite having five first-half possessions in Ragin' Cajun territory. Kansas State was 0-for-8 on third-down conversions in the first half.<ref>http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3065&SPID=212&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=204793145 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914132855/http://www.kstatesports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?SPSID=3065&SPID=212&DB_OEM_ID=400&ATCLID=204793145 |date=2009-09-14 }} Louisiana Lafayette recap</ref>\n{{-}}\n\n===UCLA===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1= 3\n|R2= 0\n|R3= 6\n|R4= 0\n|Home='''UCLA'''\n|H1= 7\n|H2= 6\n|H3= 0\n|H4= 10\n}}\n{{See also|2009 UCLA Bruins football team}}\nUCLA had a 2-0 record at game time, winning over San Diego State 33-14 at home and beating Tennessee 19-15 on the road.  UCLA was favored by 11\u00bd points going into the game in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]].  It was the first ever game between the two schools. Senior quarterback [[Kevin Craft]] took over from injured [[Kevin Prince]] for the Bruins.\n\nCraft passed for 186 yards and a touchdown to lead the Bruins to a 23-9 victory over the Wildcats.  Freshman Johnathan Franklin rushed for a career-best 119 yards on 23 carries and Kai Forbath kicked three field goals in the victory.  Craft completed 13 of 24 passes with one interception including a game-clinching 51-yard scoring pass to Terrence Austin with 6:18 remaining.<ref>[http://www.uclabruins.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2009-2010/ksucla.html Final Stats], ''UCLABruins.com'', September 19, 2009.

Ryan Doerr's PAT pass failed. UCLA's one fumble loss and eight penalties for 80 yards were the ugly part of the victory. The Wildcats had two fumbles and four penalties for 50 yards. Alterra Verner had two interceptions and returned them for 47 yards for the Bruins.\n{{-}}\n\n===Tennessee Tech===\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Tennessee Tech\n|R1=7\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=14\n|H2=7\n|H3=21\n|H4=7\n}}\nSenior [[Brandon Banks]] became the 12th player in NCAA history, including the first Big 12 player, to return two kickoffs for touchdowns in the same game, as Kansas State rolled past Tennessee Tech, 49-7 [[Bill Snyder Family Stadium]].\n\nBanks, whose 303 all-purpose yards ranks fifth in school history, broke a 7-all tie with a 91-yard kick return with 2:28 remaining in the first quarter then jump-started the second half with a 92-yard return to give the Wildcats a 28-7 lead.  Banks also had three receptions for 90 yards, including an electrifying 64-yard reception to set up a 2-yard score by junior running back Daniel Thomas in the second quarter.  The last player to achieve the feat of two kickoff returns for touchdowns was UCLA's Brandon Breazell against Northwestern in the Sun Bowl on Dec. 30, 2005.\n\nBanks' banner day overshadowed another fine outing by Thomas, who recorded his third 100-yard rushing game of the season with a career-high 139 yards to go with two touchdowns.  Two other rushers - seniors Keithen Valentine (73 yards on 10 carries) and Grant Gregory (58 yards on nine carries) - tallied 50 or more yards to help the Wildcats post their highest rushing total since 2005.\n\nJunior quarterback [[Carson Coffman]] was also solid on the day, completing 8-of-9 passes for 131 yards.  He also capped K-State's second offensive scoring drive with a 5-yard score in the second quarter.\n\nBackup signal caller Grant Gregory saw his most significant action of the season, playing most of the third and fourth quarters.  Gregory was a perfect 2-of-2 passing for 21 yards to go with 58 yards rushing.  He scored his first career touchdown as a Wildcat on a one-yard run with 10:50 left in the fourth quarter that capped the scoring.\n\nThe Kansas State offense finished with a season-high 49 points, which was four more than it had totaled in its three previous games of the season.  The squad also collected season bests for total yards (448) and rushing yards (296).  The 296 yards rushing were the most since the Wildcats had 305 yards against North Texas on Sept. 24, 2005.\n\nThe defense was again stellar on the afternoon, holding the Golden Eagles to just 107 yards of total offense including negative 19 yards rushing to go with three sacks.  It was the fewest yards yielded an opponent since allowing 53 yards against Ball State on Sept. 16, 2000, while it was lowest rushing output by an foe since Baylor had minus 37 yards rushing on Oct. 26, 2002.    \n{{-}}\n\n===Iowa State===\n{{See also|2009 Iowa State Cyclones football team}}\n\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road='''Kansas State'''\n|R1=7\n|R2=3\n|R3=0\n|R4=14\n|Home=Iowa State\n|H1=0\n|H2=10\n|H3=7\n|H4=6\n}}\nIowa State was favored by 2 points going into the game.  Kansas State sophomore defensive back Emmanuel Lamur blocked the tying extra-point with 32 seconds remaining to help Kansas State earn its first Big 12 win with a 24-23 victory over Iowa State at Arrowhead Stadium.\n\nSenior quarterback [[Grant Gregory]] threw two fourth-quarter touchdowns in his first career start as a Wildcat, completing 16 of 23 passes for 206 yards to go with 29 yards rushing on 14 carries and one touchdown.  The go-ahead score came with 5:36 remaining in the game in which Gregory rolled out to avoid the rush before hitting senior wideout [[Brandon Banks]] on a 54-yard strike.\n\nJunior running back Daniel Thomas nearly collected his fourth 100-yard game of the season, posting 96 yards on 25 carries.  He also had five catches for 38 yards, including a 13-yard catch.  Banks, the reigning Big 12 Special Teams of the Week, totaled 164 of all-purpose yards, including four catches for 66 yards and a touchdown and three kickoffs for 67 yards.\n\nThe offenses were nearly identical with Iowa State (3-2, 0-1 Big 12) holding a narrow advantage on total yards, 371-360.  The Wildcats (3-2, 1-0 Big 12) had 206 yards passing to go with 154 yards on the ground.  Once again, K-State held the edge in time of possession (33:33 to 26:27) and converted eight of 16 third-down conversions.\n\nGregory got the scoring started with a 2-yard run to cap a 13-play, 89-yard drive on its opening possession that consumed seven minutes of the first quarter.  Thomas got the ball on the first five possession and totaled 30 yards on seven rushes.\n\nIowa State responded with a 32-yard field goal from Grant Mahoney with 9:39 left in the second quarter then took a 10-7 lead on a 22-yard touchdown pass from Austen Arnaud to Derrick Catlett with 3:55 left in the quarter.\n\nHowever, the Wildcats tied the score at 10-all with a 39-yard field goal from Josh Cherry just five seconds before the half.  Gregory was stellar on the 10-play, 48-yard drive, completing four of seven passes for 39 yards.  He hit senior Attrail Snipes for a 24-yard touchdown on a key third down play to put the Wildcats in Iowa State territory.\n\nThe third quarter belonged to the Cyclones, who went ahead 17-10 on a 3-yard run by Arnaud that capped a 12-play, 80-yard drive.\n\nHowever, just minutes into the fourth quarter, sophomore David Garrett forced a fumble after a 12-yard catch by Derrick Catlett and Tysyn Hartman recovered on the Iowa State 36.  Seven plays later, on third and goal from the 16, Gregory connected on a 16-yard pass to wideout [[Lamark Brown]] tie the game up at 17 apiece.\n\nK-State then went ahead on the dramatic 54-yard catch by Banks with 5:36 remaining in the game.\n\nAfter the Wildcat defense forced a third-and-out, K-State tried to run out the clock with a six-play drive that cut the time to 1:49.  However, Arnaud converted a key 4-and-5 play with a 22-yard pass completion to Marqui Hamilton for a first down at the Kansas State 23.  He then connected on a 23-yard strike to Jake Williams over two defenders to cut the deficit to 24-23.  On the next play, Lamur blocked the Grant Mahoney's extra point to give the Wildcats the win.\n\nThe defense was led by the play of linebacker Alex Hrebec, who had a team-high eight tackles.  Defensive back Joshua Moore had 5\u00bd tackles and a break-up, while Jeffrey Fitzgerald totaled five tackles.  Linebacker John Houlik posted 4\u00bd tackles and one fumble recovery and defensive back Stephen Harrison had four stops and two pass break-ups.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Texas Tech===\n{{See also|2009 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team}}\n\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=7\n|R4=7\n|Home='''Texas Tech'''\n|H1=14\n|H2=24\n|H3=14\n|H4=14\n}}\nTexas Tech was favored by 16\u00bd points going into the game.  Tech quarterback Steven Sheffield threw for 490 yards and seven touchdown passes in his first career start to help Texas Tech beat Kansas State 66-14.\n\nThe Red Raiders backup quarterback was 33-for-41 and finished with TDs passes of 52, 6, 4, 72, 28, 12 and 25 yards to five receivers.  It was the second time this season that a Texas Tech (4-2, 1-1 Big 12) quarterback notched seven passing touchdowns. Taylor Potts, out with a concussion this week, threw seven in a 55-10 win over Rice.\n\nTexas Tech put the game out of reach by halftime. The Wildcats (3-3, 1-1 Big 12) got into Texas Tech territory only once in the first half and punted five times.  Sheffield, who had 370 yards by halftime, threw two TDs to Detron Lewis and Torres, and one each to Tramain Swindall, Jacoby Franks and Lyle Leong.  Sheffield's first-half yardage set a school record, besting the 367 yards thrown by B.J. Symons against Mississippi in 2003.\n\nThree Red Raiders receivers tallied 90 yards or more. Lewis caught eight passes for 100 yards, Franks had three passes for 99 yards and Swindall got 97 yards on five catches.\n\nSheffield threw to 11 receivers before leaving the game with about 10 minutes remaining in the game.  Texas Tech's running game kept Kansas State off-balance. Baron Batch rushed for 86 yards on nine carries and Harrison Jeffers got 55 yards on seven carries.\n\nThe Wildcats offense was anemic in the first half. They sustained only one drive in the first half, managing four first downs and hanging onto the ball for more than six minutes on their opening possession. [[Grant Gregory]] got sacked three times-twice by Brandon Sharpe and once by Ra'Jon Henley-before [[Carson Coffman]] replaced him late in the second quarter.\n\nKansas State's first score came from its defense. Sheffield threw an interception on his first pass of the second half when Wildcats end Jeffrey Fitzgerald stepped in front of a ball meant for Alex Torres and returned it 17 yards to make it 38-7.\n\nIt wasn't until quarterback Carson Coffman replaced Gregory that the Wildcats showed some life. He was 11-for-17 and finished with 131 passing yards.\n\nCoffman found some success in the third quarter but it didn't translate into a touchdown. After a 52-yard pass to Daniel Thomas and a 29-yarder to Jeron Mastrud, the Wildcats failed on a fourth-and-5 and gave the ball back to the Red Raiders.\n\nKansas State scored its second touchdown-and its only offensive one- midway through the fourth quarter when Keithen Valentine ran for an 8-yard touchdown to whittle the margin to 59-14.\n\nValentine rushed for a career-high 96 yards on eight carries\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Texas A&M===\n{{See also|2009 Texas A&M Aggies football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Texas A&M\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=14\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=17\n|H2=21\n|H3=21\n|H4=3\n}}\nThe Kansas State Wildcats made a statement in their 62-14 blistering of Texas A&M. [[Bill Snyder]] and his team put together a complete performance dominating the Aggies in all three phases - offense, defense and special teams. It was the most points K-State has scored in a [[Big 12 Conference]] game since defeating Kansas 64-0 on November 2, 2002.\n\nAlready ahead 38-0 at the half, K-State (4-3, 2-1 Big 12) got the ball first in the second half and immediately put points on the board. Return specialist [[Brandon Banks]] returned his school-record third kickoff of the year for a touchdown to pull ahead 45-0. Then, K-State intercepted a pass and returned it inside the 10-yard line and scored on the first play to put A&M further back, 52-0.\n\nThe Wildcats gained 424 yards of total offense on the day and saw a career day from running back Daniel Thomas, as he rushed for 91 yards and scored four touchdowns - all of them coming in the first half. His four TDs were one short of tying a school record.\n\nTexas A&M (3-3, 0-2 Big 12) could not get anything going on offense as the Wildcats swarmed to the ball on defense and forced a season-high five turnovers on the night. The Aggies gained 301 total yards, and quarterback Jerrod Johnson threw his first three interceptions of the season.\n\nK-State's defense helped the Wildcats get on the board early in the game forcing a turnover on Texas A&M's second play from scrimmage. Jeffrey Fitzgerald stripped the ball out of Jamie McCoy's arms as the fumble was recovered by Troy Butler. The Wildcats would make quick work of the short field and score in four plays to cover the 29 yards to go ahead 7-0 on a Daniel Thomas touchdown run. It marked the third time this season the Wildcats have scored on their opening possession.\n\nThe Wildcat defense came up with another stop after allowing the Aggies to gain one first down on their second possession. A penalty on the punt return by Texas A&M and a pass interference call helped K-State push the ball downfield before a 23-yard field goal by Josh Cherry gave the Wildcats a 10-point advantage.\n\nK-State's defense continued to pour it on against the Aggies forcing a three-and-out following the field goal. After an incomplete pass, Fitzgerald tallied a tackle for loss on a rushing attempt by the Aggies. Then, Fitzgerald struck again with a sack to put A&M's punter in the shadow of his own goal post.\n\nA big return by Brandon Banks, paired with a face mask penalty at the end of the return, helped set up another quick strike by K-State's offense. Thomas scored his second touchdown of the day on a three-yard pitch-and-run to the right corner of the endzone on the third play of the drive, and the Wildcats went ahead 17-0 with 3:34 remaining in the first quarter.\n\nThomas scored his third touchdown of the day to pull further ahead, 24-0, on a nine-yard rush to the left midway through the second quarter. The 67-yard scoring drive was set up by a 45-yard completion to tight end Jeron Mastrud on the second play. The catch was Mastrud's 100th of his career to put him 10th all-time at K-State.\n\nJust as Texas A&M began to move the ball with its first significant drive of the evening, Tysyn Hartman picked off a pass across the middle in the redzone and the first surrendered by A&M quarterback Jerrod Johnson all season. Johnson had thrown 225 passes without being intercepted this season. The pick was Hartman's fourth of the year as well.\n\nThe Daniel Thomas show continued heading into the locker room at the half. With just over a minute left in the second quarter, Thomas scored on a 17-yard rush as the quarterback out of the Wildcat formation. The score gave him four touchdowns in the first half alone and gave K-State a 31-0 lead.\n\nA fumble recovery by Joseph Kassanavoid at the 16-yard line with 15 seconds remaining put K-State in a position to put more points on the board heading into the locker room at halftime. On the ensuing play [[Grant Gregory]] found Collin Klein alone in the endzone for a 16-yard touchdown pass and a 38-0 lead at halftime.\n\nThe Wildcats controlled the clock in the second half with its ground game, and the Aggies still could not stop it. Keithen Valentine scored his second touchdown of the game on a 20-yard scamper to the endzone that saw him change directions twice before cutting it across the middle for the score to pull ahead 59-0.\n\nA&M scored 14 unanswered points in the third quarter to cut the lead to 59-14, but it would not be enough as the Wildcats continued to milk the clock keeping the ball in bounds and gaining first downs.\n\n{{-}}\n\n===Colorado===\n{{See also|2009 Colorado Buffaloes football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Colorado\n|R1=6\n|R2=0\n|R3=0\n|R4=0\n|Home='''Kansas State'''\n|H1=3\n|H2=17\n|H3=0\n|H4=0\n}}\nKansas State's defense came up big against Colorado to give the Wildcats a 20-6 homecoming victory and remain atop the Big 12 North standings. K-State limited the Buffaloes to 244 total yards on offense and just 60 on the ground.\n\nWhile the Wildcat defense was able to shut down the Buffalo offense, K-State's own offense controlled the tempo of the game with quick strikes in the first half to build a lead and long clock-eating drives in the second half to hold off the Buffaloes.\n\nAfter Colorado (2-5, 1-2 Big 12) scored on its opening drive, K-State (5-3, 3-1) stifled the Buffaloes the remainder of the game by not surrendering any points. This was the lowest point total allowed to a Big 12 opponent by the K-State defense since Oct. 8, 2005 against Kansas.\n\nWith Colorado threatening to score late in the game on fourth down from the two-yard line, Emmanuel Lamur came up with his second interception of the day to preserve the win. Both of Lamur's interceptions were 50-50 balls where he ripped the ball out of a receiver's hands as they both got to the play at the same time.\n\nRunning back Daniel Thomas carried much of the load for K-State with a career-high 145 yards rushing on 20 carries with one score. Defensively for K-State, Ulla Pomele led with seven tackles, including his first sack of the season. Jeffrey Fitzgerald continued his strong play from a week ago with 1.5 sacks and a number of quarterback pressures.\n\nA 35-yard rush by Thomas down the K-State sideline helped the Wildcats march down the field on their first drive of the game and put points on the board first with a 24-yard field goal by Josh Cherry to cap off the drive of 61 yards. Cherry has converted four straight field goal opportunities and remains perfect in Big 12 action.\n\nThe Buffaloes also scored on their first drive of the game to answer K-State's field goal with a touchdown by running back Rodney Stewart. Colorado would miss the extra point, however, to lead 6-3.\n\nThomas tallied his ninth touchdown run of the season early in the second quarter, as the Wildcats completed a 58-yard drive to reclaim the lead, 10-6.\n\nK-State saw the momentum shift to its side with the game's first turnover, when Colorado quarterback Tyler Hansen fumbled the snap on a first-and-20 situation from the Buffaloes' own 15-yard line. Pomele recovered the fumble for the Wildcats, and K-State kicked a 27-yard field goal after the Wildcats could not punch the ball into the endzone to lead, 13-6.\n\nAll the swing plays seemed to go K-State's way in the first half with a muffed punt by Colorado gave the Wildcats the ball at the Colorado 20-yard line with 3:35 remaining in the second quarter. After the Buffaloes forced a three-and-out on defense, Jason Espinoza muffed the punt and K-State long-snapper Corey Adams recovered the ball for K-State.\n\nThe Wildcats would take full advantage of the turnover this time around, as Gregory punched the ball in on a rush up the middle for five yards to go ahead 20-6 with just over a minute remaining in the half.\n\nAnother turnover in the closing seconds of the half gave K-State a shot at the endzone to finish the half. Lamur ripped a pass out of the hands of a Colorado receiver for an interception as they both went up for the ball at the same time. The pick gave K-State the ball at its own 46-yard line but could not score heading into the locker room.\n\nThe third quarter saw each team's defense shutdown the respective offenses with no points being scored. K-State gained just 49 yards in the third quarter while Colorado could only muster 25 with negative-three yards rushing thanks to a number of sacks and quarterback pressures by K-State.\n{{-}}\n\n===Oklahoma===\n{{See also|2009 Oklahoma Sooners football team}}\n{{Linescore Amfootball|\n|Road=Kansas State\n|R1=0\n|R2=9\n|R3=14\n|R4=7\n|Home='''Oklahoma'''\n|H1=21\n|H2=7\n|H3=0\n|H4=14\n}}\nSenior [[Brandon Banks]] tied the K-State school record with 351 all-purpose yards, including 98 on his fifth career kickoff return for a touchdown in the fourth quarter, but it wasn't enough as the Wildcats fell to No. 22 Oklahoma, 42-30 at Memorial Stadium.\n\nBanks totaled 195 yards on six kickoff returns to go with nine catches for 156 yards against the Sooners.  The 351 all-purpose yards tied [[Darren Sproles]]' school record, which he set against Louisiana\u2013Lafayette on Sept. 18, 2004.  Banks, who helped the Wildcats' close the gap with his return, increased his Big 12 and school records with his fifth career kickoff return and fourth this season.\n\nK-State (5-4, 3-2 Big 12) fell behind 21-0 to Oklahoma (5-3, 3-1 Big 12), but rallied to within five points on two occasions, including 35-30 after Banks' 98-yard return.  However, the Sooners put the game away with a 3-yard run by [[DeMarco Murray]] with 6:27 remaining in the fourth quarter.\n\nThe Sooners stopped Kansas State on downs at the K-State 41 with 4:10 left and Quinton Carter intercepted a pass from [[Grant Gregory]] at the Oklahoma 2 with 42 seconds left.\n\nDespite the loss, the Wildcat offense totaled 30 points on the stingy Sooner defense, which previous opponent high was 21 points against Miami.  The squad tallied 364 yards of total offense, including 215 through the air, and posted 20 first downs.  K-State also remained atop the conference's North Division.\n\nSenior quarterback Grant Gregory was solid on the night, completing 19-of-30 passes for 174 yards to go with 46 yards on the ground on nine carries.  It marked season-high for Gregory in passing yards, completions and attempts.\n\nJunior running back Daniel Thomas, who is 98 yards from 1,000 yards this season, rushed for 88 yards on 16 carries.  He also completed one pass for 41 yards and had a 2-point conversion to Jeron Mastrud on the Wildcats' second touchdown.  Senior running back Keithen Valentine had just four carries, but two of those went for scores, including a 14-yard scamper on fourth-and-one in the third quarter.\n\nOklahoma was led by redshirt freshman quarterback [[Landry Jones]], who completed 26 of 37 passes for 294 yards and four touchdowns.  DeJuan Miller, who had 11 catches all season entering the game, led the Sooners with nine for 94 yards, while Ryan Broyles had eight for 91 yards and two touchdowns.\n\nRunning backs Chris Brown and DeMarco Murray combined for 145 yards rushing for the Sooners, including 83 from Brown on 15 carries.\n\nOklahoma has won 28 straight home games, the longest active streak in the Bowl Subdivision.  Oklahoma was favored by 28 points going into the game.\n{{-}}\n\n===Kansas===\nThis was the 107th meeting between Kansas and Kansas State.

Other misspellings outside the top 400 list can be  --\n  --       added to [[Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings]] -->\n\n== Common causes of misspellings ==\n\n=== Mispronunciation ===\n[[Mispronunciation]] is known to be one of the most common causes of misspelling.<ref name=\"HP\">{{cite book |title=How to Prepare for the Canadian GED High School Equivalency Exam |first1=Murray |last1=Rockowitz |first2=Dale |last2=Shuttleworth |first3=Murray |last3=Shukyn |first4=Samuel C. |last4=Brownstein |first5=Max |last5=Peters |year=2002 |ISBN=0-7641-1789-0 |page=177 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GUj7wAEACAAJ }}\n</ref>\nHence, [[phonetic]] misspelling is common, once a word is mispronounced. For example, the word ''realize'' may be misspelled as \"{{not a typo|relize}}\".\n\n=== Typing errors ===\nSome spelling errors are introduced because the typing of certain people is not perfect, such as\n* letters are doubled, or more frequently double letters tripled, such as \"{{not a typo|betwween}}\" and \"{{not a typo|betweeen}}\"\n* letters are singled, such as \"{{not a typo|betwen}}\"\n* keys are transposed, so \"because\" becomes \"{{not a typo|becuase}}\". ''(see [[Teh]])''\nSome of the errors listed may be due to mistyping rather than ignorance, for example \"solider\" for \"soldier\", although these forms of errors rarely ever happen in handwritten text.\n\n=== Homophones ===\nTwo (or more) differently spelled words with different meanings are [[homophone]]s if they are nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., \"right\", \"rite\", \"wright\", and \"write\"; \"read\" (most [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] of verb) and \"reed\"; \"read\" ([[past tense|past]], [[past participle]]) and \"red\". This list includes only a few homophones although incorrect use of homophones is a very common error; the following words from the list are all correct English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n* advice\n* affect\n* artic (colloquial UK usage for \"[[articulated lorry]]\")\n* aweful\n* breath\n* calender\n* capital\n* dose\n* its\n* lightening\n* loose\n* loosing\n* planing\n* principal\n* reign\n* rime\n* sight\n* soldier\n* stoping\n* they're\n* wether\n* you're\n{{div col end}}\n[[Spell checker]]s do not detect incorrect use of homophones.\n\n=== Personal names ===\nPersonal names and [[surname]]s may be pronounced like a standard English word, but with different spelling: \"balance\" and \"{{proper name|John Ballance}}\"; \"war\" and \"Evelyn Waugh\"; \"marshal\" and \"George Marshall\". Personal names do, of course, generally start with a capital letter.\n\n=== Foreign writers ===\nA misspelling in English might be made by someone used to a different spelling in another language; for example, \"address\" is translated \"{{lang|fr|adresse}}\" in French and German. Many Spanish words are similar or identical to English words, but with an \"n\" inserted, or replacing an \"m\", leading to errors: \"{{not a typo|inmigrant}}\" from \"{{lang|es|inmigrante}}\", \"{{not a typo|cementery}}\" from \"{{lang|es|cementerio}}\", \"{{not a typo|confortable}}\" instead of \"comfortable\".  The English word 'lose' reasonably looks like it should be pronounced as 'lose' to Germans, as in German the lone 's' often has the sound of an English 'z', and a lone 'o' in English very seldom has the 'oo' sound.\n\n=== Apostrophes ===\nThere can be confusion over a plural possessive form. If the singular is \"book's title\" and the plural \"books' titles\", the latter can appear as \"book's\", or even \"books's\". The plural can be written with an erroneous apostrophe (\"[[grocer's apostrophe]]\" in Britain): \"apple's and pear's\". [[Elision]] can lead to misspelling: \"doesn't\", where the apostrophe represents the elided \"o\", can be misspelled \"{{not a typo|does'nt}}\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cut Spelling]]\n* [[Haplography]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/spelling-and-word-lists/misspelled.html |title=100 Most Often Misspelled Words in English |website= LoveToKnow, Corp. |date= December 2008}}\n* {{cite web| title=Canadian, British and American Spelling |website=LukeMastin.com |date=December 2008 |url=http://www.lukemastin.com/testing/spelling/cgi-bin/database.cgi?action=home}}\n* {{cite web| title=Canadian, British and American Spelling: Some Commonly Misspelled Words |website=LukeMastin.com |date=December 2008 |url=http://www.lukemastin.com/testing/spelling/cgi-bin/database.cgi?action=mispelled}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.ktvz.com/news/national-world/most-commonly-misspelled-word-in-each-state/747332937|title=Most commonly misspelled word in each state|date=30 May 2018|website=KTVZ|access-date=12 June 2019}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Linguistic error]]\n[[Category:Nonstandard spelling]]\n[[Category:Orthography]]\n", "text_old": "{{selfref|{{see also|Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings|Wiktionary:Category:English misspellings}}}}\n\n'''Commonly misspelled English words'''<ref name=AskO/> ([[British English|UK]]: '''misspelt words''') are words that are often unintentionally [[misspelling|misspelled]] in general writing.\nA selected list of common words is presented below, under ''[[#Documented list of common misspellings|Documented list of common misspellings]]''.\n<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------\n  -- NOTE: This is a Wiki \"article\" about COMMONLY misspelled\n  -- words, not for ALL misspellings and not about Wikipedia.\n  -- It is NOT an essay giving advice or discussing Wikipedia.\n  -- Avoid adding off-topic sections to this article.\n  --\n  -- The essay is: [[Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings]]\n  --\n  -- See [[:Category:Wikipedia essays]] for pages about grammar\n  -- or spelling or other discussions about Wikipedia pages.\n  -->\nAlthough the word ''common'' is subjective depending on the situation, the focus is on general writing, rather than in a specific field.

Other misspellings outside the top 400 list can be  --\n  --       added to [[Wikipedia:Lists of common misspellings]] -->\n\n== Common causes of misspellings ==\n\n=== Mispronunciation ===\n[[Mispronunciation]] is known to be one of the most common causes of misspelling.<ref name=\"HP\">{{cite book |title=How to Prepare for the Canadian GED High School Equivalency Exam |first1=Murray |last1=Rockowitz |first2=Dale |last2=Shuttleworth |first3=Murray |last3=Shukyn |first4=Samuel C. |last4=Brownstein |first5=Max |last5=Peters |year=2002 |ISBN=0-7641-1789-0 |page=177 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GUj7wAEACAAJ }}\n</ref>\nHence, [[phonetic]] misspelling is common, once a word is mispronounced. For example, the word ''realize'' may be misspelled as \"{{not a typo|relize}}\".\n\n=== Typing errors ===\nSome spelling errors are introduced because the typing of certain people is not perfect, such as\n* letters are doubled, or more frequently double letters tripled, such as \"{{not a typo|betwween}}\" and \"{{not a typo|betweeen}}\"\n* letters are singled, such as \"{{not a typo|betwen}}\"\n* keys are transposed, so \"because\" becomes \"{{not a typo|becuase}}\". ''(see [[Teh]])''\nSome of the errors listed may be due to mistyping rather than ignorance, for example \"solider\" for \"soldier\", although these forms of errors rarely ever happen in handwritten text.\n\n=== Homophones ===\nTwo (or more) differently spelled words with different meanings are [[homophone]]s if they are nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., \"right\", \"rite\", \"wright\", and \"write\"; \"read\" (most [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] of verb) and \"reed\"; \"read\" ([[past tense|past]], [[past participle]]) and \"red\". This list includes only a few homophones although incorrect use of homophones is a very common error; the following words from the list are all correct English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}\n* advice\n* affect\n* artic (colloquial UK usage for \"[[articulated lorry]]\")\n* aweful\n* breath\n* calender\n* capital\n* dose\n* its\n* lightening\n* loose\n* loosing\n* planing\n* principal\n* reign\n* rime\n* sight\n* soldier\n* stoping\n* they're\n* wether\n* you're\n{{div col end}}\n[[Spell checker]]s do not detect incorrect use of homophones.\n\n=== Personal names ===\nPersonal names and [[surname]]s may be pronounced like a standard English word, but with different spelling: \"balance\" and \"{{proper name|John Ballance}}\"; \"war\" and \"Evelyn Waugh\"; \"marshal\" and \"George Marshall\". Personal names do, of course, generally start with a capital letter.\n\n=== Foreign writers ===\nA misspelling in English might be made by someone used to a different spelling in another language; for example, \"address\" is translated \"{{lang|fr|adresse}}\" in French and German. Many Spanish words are similar or identical to English words, but with an \"n\" inserted, or replacing an \"m\", leading to errors: \"{{not a typo|inmigrant}}\" from \"{{lang|es|inmigrante}}\", \"{{not a typo|cementery}}\" from \"{{lang|es|cementerio}}\", \"{{not a typo|confortable}}\" instead of \"comfortable\".  The English word 'lose' reasonably looks like it should be pronounced as 'lose' to Germans, as in German the lone 's' often has the sound of an English 'z', and a lone 'o' in English very seldom has the 'oo' sound.\n\n=== Apostrophes ===\nThere can be confusion over a plural possessive form. If the singular is \"book's title\" and the plural \"books' titles\", the latter can appear as \"book's\", or even \"books's\". The plural can be written with an erroneous apostrophe (\"[[grocer's apostrophe]]\" in Britain): \"apple's and pear's\". [[Elision]] can lead to misspelling: \"doesn't\", where the apostrophe represents the elided \"o\", can be misspelled \"{{not a typo|does'nt}}\".\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Cut Spelling]]\n* [[Haplography]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite web |url=http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/spelling-and-word-lists/misspelled.html |title=100 Most Often Misspelled Words in English |website= LoveToKnow, Corp. |date= December 2008}}\n* {{cite web| title=Canadian, British and American Spelling |website=LukeMastin.com |date=December 2008 |url=http://www.lukemastin.com/testing/spelling/cgi-bin/database.cgi?action=home}}\n* {{cite web| title=Canadian, British and American Spelling: Some Commonly Misspelled Words |website=LukeMastin.com |date=December 2008 |url=http://www.lukemastin.com/testing/spelling/cgi-bin/database.cgi?action=mispelled}}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.ktvz.com/news/national-world/most-commonly-misspelled-word-in-each-state/747332937|title=Most commonly misspelled word in each state|date=30 May 2018|website=KTVZ|access-date=12 June 2019}}\n{{refend}}\n\n[[Category:Linguistic error]]\n[[Category:Nonstandard spelling]]\n[[Category:Orthography]]\n", "name_user": "GoingBatty", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonly_misspelled_English_words"}

He introduced [[romanticism]] into [[Danish literature]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], then a suburb of [[Copenhagen]], on 14 November 1779. His father, a [[Schleswig]]er by birth, was at that time [[organist]] and later, keeper of the royal palace of [[Frederiksberg]]; a very brisk and cheerful man. The poet's mother, on the other hand,  partly German by extraction, suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]], which afterwards deepened into [[melancholia|melancholy]] madness.{{refn|group=note|name=first|{{EB1911|inline=1|last=Gosse |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Gosse |wstitle=\u00d6hlenschl\u00e4ger, Adam Gottlob|volume=20|pages=33\u201334}}}}\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger and his sister Sophie were allowed their own way throughout their childhood, and were taught only to read and write, until their twelfth year. At the age of nine, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger began to write fluent [[Poetry|verses]]. Three years later, while walking in [[Frederiksberg Gardens]], he attracted the notice of the poet [[Edvard Storm]], and as a result of their conversation he received  nomination to the college called Posterity's High School, an important institution of which Storm was the principal. Storm himself taught the class of [[Scandinavian mythology]], and thus Oehlenschl\u00e4ger received his introduction to the poetical inspiration of his ancestors. {{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger was [[confirmed]] in 1795, and was to have been apprenticed to a tradesman in Copenhagen. To his great delight there was a hitch in the preliminaries, and he returned to his father's house. Now in his eighteenth year, he suddenly took up study with great zeal, but soon  abandoned his books for the stage, where he was offered a small position. In 1797 he made his appearance on the boards in several successive parts, but soon discovered that he possessed no real histrionic talent. The brothers [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted|\u00d8rsted]], with whom he had formed an intimacy that proved quite profitable to him, persuaded him to quit the theatre, and in 1800 he entered the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He was disturbed in his studies by the death of his mother, by his inveterate occupation with poetry, and finally by the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|First Battle of Copenhagen]] in April 1801, which, however, inspired a dramatic sketch (''April the Second 1801''), is the first work of the kind by his pen that we possess.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\n[[Image:Adam Gottlob Oehlenschlager by Julius Schultz in S\u00f8ndermarken 1.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger in Frederiksberg Gardens (Copenhagen)]]\n\nIn the summer of 1802, when Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had an old [[Scandinavian romanser|Scandinavian romance]], as well as a volume of [[Lyric poetry|lyrics]] in the press, the young [[Nordic countries|Norse]] philosopher, [[Henrik Steffens]], returned to Copenhagen after a long visit to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] in Germany, full of new romantic ideas. His lectures at the university, in which [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]] were revealed to the Danish public for the first time, created a great sensation. Steffens and Oehlenschl\u00e4ger met one day at [[Dreier's Club]]. After a conversation of sixteen hours the latter went home, suppressed his two coming volumes, and wrote at a sitting his splendid poem ''Guldhornene'', in a manner totally new to Danish literature. The result of his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems, published in 1803, now chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called ''Sanct Hansaften-Spil''.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nThe next two years saw the production of several exquisite works, in particular the epic of ''Thors Reise til Jotunheim'', the charming poem in [[hexameter]]s called ''Langelandsreisen'', and the bewitching fantasy ''Aladdin'' (1805). At the age of twenty-six, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger was universally recognised, even by the opponents of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of [[Denmark]]. He now collected his ''Poetical Writings'' in two volumes. He found no difficulty in obtaining a grant for foreign travel from the government, and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens at [[University of Halle|Halle]] in August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical tragedies, ''Hakon Jarl'', which he sent off to Copenhagen, and then proceeded for the winter months to [[Berlin]], where he associated with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Fichte]], and the leading men of the day, and met Goethe for the first time.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nIn the spring of 1806 he went on to [[Weimar]], where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe. Autumn of that year was passed with [[Tieck]] in [[Dresden]], and he proceeded in December to [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous masterpieces, ''Baldur hin Gode'' (1808), ''Palnatoke'' (1809), and ''[[Axel og Valborg]]'' (1810).{{refn|group=note|name=first}} Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had also made his own translation of ''Aladdin'' into German, adding some new material which does not appear in the 1805 edition; this revised version was published in Amsterdam in 1808. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] later used the text of this translation for the last (choral) movement of his [[Piano Concerto (Busoni)|Piano Concerto Op. 39]]. Later editions of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's play do not contain this text.{{sfn|Beaumont|1985|p=62}}\n\nIn July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and winter in [[Switzerland]] as the guest of [[Madame de Sta\u00ebl]] at [[Coppet]], in the midst of her salon. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschl\u00e4ger went to Rome to visit [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], and in his house wrote the tragedy of ''Correggio.'' He hurriedly returned to Denmark in the spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of [[aesthetics]] at the University of Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in-law of [[Rahbek]], to whom he had been long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish predecessor [[Johannes Ewald]], the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary activity became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of ''Ali og Gulhyndi'', and in 1812 the last of his great tragedies, ''St\u00e6rkodder''.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nFrom 1814 to 1819 he, or rather his admirers, were engaged in a long and angry controversy with [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen|Baggesen]], who represented the old [[didactic]] school. This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's mind and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called ''Helge'', published in 1814. The tragedy of ''Hagbarth og Signe'', (1815), showed a distinct diminution of his powers. In 1817 he returned to Paris, and published ''Hroars Saga'' and the tragedy of ''Fostbr\u00f8drene''. In 1818 he was again in Copenhagen, and wrote the [[idyll]] of ''Den lille Hyrdedreng'' and the [[Edda]]ic cycle called ''Nordens Guder''. His next productions were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of ''Erik og Abel'' (1820) and ''V\u00e6ringerne i Miklagaard'' (1826), and the epic of ''Hrolf Krake'' (1829). His last volumes were ''Tordenskjold'' (1833), ''Dronning Margrethe'' (1833), ''Sokrates'' (1835), ''Olaf den Hellige'' (1836), ''Knud den Store'' (1838), ''Dina'' (1842), ''Erik Glipping'' (1843), and ''Kiartan og Gudrun'' (1847). On his seventieth birthday, 14 November 1849, a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king of Denmark in a grand ceremony. He died 20 January 1850 and was buried in the cemetery of Frederiksberg. Immediately after his death his ''Recollections'' were published in two volumes.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\n==Legacy==\n[[Image:Oehlenschlaeger and Tegner.jpg|right|thumb|Oehlenschl\u00e4ger being hailed with laurels as \"The Nordic Poet-king\" by his Swedish contemporary [[Esaias Tegn\u00e9r]] as a gesture of [[Denmark\u2013Sweden relations|reconciliation]] between the two peoples]]\n\nWith the exception of [[Ludvig Holberg]], no Danish writer before 1870 has exercised so wide an influence as Oehlenschl\u00e4ger.

He supplied his countrymen with romantic tragedies at the very moment when all eyes were turned to the stage, and when the old-fashioned pieces were felt to be inadequate.

He introduced [[romanticism]] into [[Danish literature]].\n\n==Biography==\nHe was born in [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]], then a suburb of [[Copenhagen]], on 14 November 1779. His father, a [[Schleswig]]er by birth, was at that time [[organist]] and later, keeper of the royal palace of [[Frederiksberg]]; a very brisk and cheerful man. The poet's mother, on the other hand,  partly German by extraction, suffered from [[depression (mood)|depression]], which afterwards deepened into [[melancholia|melancholy]] madness.{{refn|group=note|name=first|{{EB1911|inline=1|last=Gosse |first=Edmund |authorlink=Edmund Gosse |wstitle=\u00d6hlenschl\u00e4ger, Adam Gottlob|volume=20|pages=33\u201334}}}}\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger and his sister Sophie were allowed their own way throughout their childhood, and were taught only to read and write, until their twelfth year. At the age of nine, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger began to write fluent [[Poetry|verses]]. Three years later, while walking in [[Frederiksberg Gardens]], he attracted the notice of the poet [[Edvard Storm]], and as a result of their conversation he received  nomination to the college called Posterity's High School, an important institution of which Storm was the principal. Storm himself taught the class of [[Scandinavian mythology]], and thus Oehlenschl\u00e4ger received his introduction to the poetical inspiration of his ancestors. {{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nOehlenschl\u00e4ger was [[confirmed]] in 1795, and was to have been apprenticed to a tradesman in Copenhagen. To his great delight there was a hitch in the preliminaries, and he returned to his father's house. Now in his eighteenth year, he suddenly took up study with great zeal, but soon  abandoned his books for the stage, where he was offered a small position. In 1797 he made his appearance on the boards in several successive parts, but soon discovered that he possessed no real histrionic talent. The brothers [[Anders Sand\u00f8e \u00d8rsted|\u00d8rsted]], with whom he had formed an intimacy that proved quite profitable to him, persuaded him to quit the theatre, and in 1800 he entered the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He was disturbed in his studies by the death of his mother, by his inveterate occupation with poetry, and finally by the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1801)|First Battle of Copenhagen]] in April 1801, which, however, inspired a dramatic sketch (''April the Second 1801''), is the first work of the kind by by his pen that we possess.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\n[[Image:Adam Gottlob Oehlenschlager by Julius Schultz in S\u00f8ndermarken 1.jpg|right|thumb|Statue of Adam Gottlob Oehlenschl\u00e4ger in Frederiksberg Gardens (Copenhagen)]]\n\nIn the summer of 1802, when Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had an old [[Scandinavian romanser|Scandinavian romance]], as well as a volume of [[Lyric poetry|lyrics]] in the press, the young [[Nordic countries|Norse]] philosopher, [[Henrik Steffens]], returned to Copenhagen after a long visit to [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]] in Germany, full of new romantic ideas. His lectures at the university, in which [[Goethe]] and [[Schiller]] were revealed to the Danish public for the first time, created a great sensation. Steffens and Oehlenschl\u00e4ger met one day at [[Dreier's Club]]. After a conversation of sixteen hours the latter went home, suppressed his two coming volumes, and wrote at a sitting his splendid poem ''Guldhornene'', in a manner totally new to Danish literature. The result of his new enthusiasm speedily showed itself in a somewhat hasty volume of poems, published in 1803, now chiefly remembered as containing the lovely piece called ''Sanct Hansaften-Spil''.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nThe next two years saw the production of several exquisite works, in particular the epic of ''Thors Reise til Jotunheim'', the charming poem in [[hexameter]]s called ''Langelandsreisen'', and the bewitching fantasy ''Aladdin'' (1805). At the age of twenty-six, Oehlenschl\u00e4ger was universally recognised, even by the opponents of the romantic revival, as the leading poet of [[Denmark]]. He now collected his ''Poetical Writings'' in two volumes. He found no difficulty in obtaining a grant for foreign travel from the government, and he left his native country for the first time, joining Steffens at [[University of Halle|Halle]] in August 1805. Here he wrote the first of his great historical tragedies, ''Hakon Jarl'', which he sent off to Copenhagen, and then proceeded for the winter months to [[Berlin]], where he associated with [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldt]], [[Fichte]], and the leading men of the day, and met Goethe for the first time.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nIn the spring of 1806 he went on to [[Weimar]], where he spent several months in daily intercourse with Goethe. Autumn of that year was passed with [[Tieck]] in [[Dresden]], and he proceeded in December to [[Paris, France|Paris]]. Here he resided eighteen months and wrote his three famous masterpieces, ''Baldur hin Gode'' (1808), ''Palnatoke'' (1809), and ''[[Axel og Valborg]]'' (1810).{{refn|group=note|name=first}} Oehlenschl\u00e4ger had also made his own translation of ''Aladdin'' into German, adding some new material which does not appear in the 1805 edition; this revised version was published in Amsterdam in 1808. [[Ferruccio Busoni]] later used the text of this translation for the last (choral) movement of his [[Piano Concerto (Busoni)|Piano Concerto Op. 39]]. Later editions of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's play do not contain this text.{{sfn|Beaumont|1985|p=62}}\n\nIn July 1808 he left Paris and spent the autumn and winter in [[Switzerland]] as the guest of [[Madame de Sta\u00ebl]] at [[Coppet]], in the midst of her salon. In the spring of 1809 Oehlenschl\u00e4ger went to Rome to visit [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]], and in his house wrote the tragedy of ''Correggio.'' He hurriedly returned to Denmark in the spring of 1810, partly to take the chair of [[aesthetics]] at the University of Copenhagen, partly to marry the sister-in-law of [[Rahbek]], to whom he had been long betrothed. His first course of lectures dealt with his Danish predecessor [[Johannes Ewald]], the second with Schiller. From this time forward his literary activity became very great; in 1811 he published the Oriental tale of ''Ali og Gulhyndi'', and in 1812 the last of his great tragedies, ''St\u00e6rkodder''.{{refn|group=note|name=first}}\n\nFrom 1814 to 1819 he, or rather his admirers, were engaged in a long and angry controversy with [[Jens Immanuel Baggesen|Baggesen]], who represented the old [[didactic]] school. This contest seems to have disturbed the peace of Oehlenschl\u00e4ger's mind and to have undermined his genius. His talent may be said to have culminated in the glorious cycle of verse-romances called ''Helge'', published in 1814. The tragedy of ''Hagbarth og Signe'', (1815), showed a distinct diminution of his powers. In 1817 he returned to Paris, and published ''Hroars Saga'' and the tragedy of ''Fostbr\u00f8drene''. In 1818 he was again in Copenhagen, and wrote the [[idyll]] of ''Den lille Hyrdedreng'' and the [[Edda]]ic cycle called ''Nordens Guder''. His next productions were the [[Tragedy|tragedies]] of ''Erik og Abel'' (1820) and ''V\u00e6ringerne i Miklagaard'' (1826), and the epic of ''Hrolf Krake'' (1829). His last volumes were ''Tordenskjold'' (1833), ''Dronning Margrethe'' (1833), ''Sokrates'' (1835), ''Olaf den Hellige'' (1836), ''Knud den Store'' (1838), ''Dina'' (1842), ''Erik Glipping'' (1843), and ''Kiartan og Gudrun'' (1847). On his seventieth birthday, 14 November 1849, a public festival was arranged in his honour, and he was decorated by the king of Denmark in a grand ceremony.
