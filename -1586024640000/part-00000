Its offices are co-located with the [[UJIA|United Jewish Israel Appeal]] in Kentish Town.\n\nIn January 2019, the [[Jewish Leadership Council]] (JLC) reiterated its call for a \u201cunified communal structure\u201d with the Board of Deputies. A previous merger proposal was rejected in 2015 after Deputies felt that they would be relegated to second-rate status. In response to the later call, Marie van der Zyl said that \"the representative body that speaks for the community must have the legitimacy and accountability that comes from being broad based, democratic and elected.\" Deputies have in the past noted that, while Board honorary officers are accountable to deputies, who themselves are accountable to their constituencies, the JLC had no such governance structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-leadership-council-seeking-unified-communal-structure/|title=Jewish Leadership Council seeking \u2018unified communal structure\u2019|last=Millis|first=Joe|date=8 Jan 2019|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=Jewish News}}</ref> However, in March 2020, van de Zyl called in the ''The Jewish Chronicle'' for 'a more permanent unity' between the organisations.\n\n===Past presidents===\n[[File:Moses Montefiore 1881.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moses Montefiore]] and his family members dominated the presidency of the Board of Deputies during the 19th century.

A previous merger proposal was rejected in 2015 after Deputies felt that they would be relegated to second-rate status. In response to the later call, Marie van der Zyl said that \"the representative body that speaks for the community must have the legitimacy and accountability that comes from being broad based, democratic and elected.\" Deputies have in the past noted that, while Board honorary officers are accountable to deputies, who themselves are accountable to their constituencies, the JLC had no such governance structure.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://jewishnews.timesofisrael.com/jewish-leadership-council-seeking-unified-communal-structure/|title=Jewish Leadership Council seeking \u2018unified communal structure\u2019|last=Millis|first=Joe|date=8 Jan 2019|accessdate=3 September 2018|work=Jewish News}}</ref> However, in March 2020, van de Zyl called in the ''The Jewish Chronicle'' for 'a more permanent unity' between the organisations.\n\n===Past presidents===\n[[File:Moses Montefiore 1881.jpg|thumb|right|[[Moses Montefiore]] and his family members dominated the presidency of the Board of Deputies during the 19th century.

{"title_page": "Dollar cost averaging", "text_new": "'''Dollar cost averaging''' ('''DCA''') is an [[investment strategy]] that aims to reduce the impact of [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] on large purchases of financial assets such as [[equities]]. Dollar cost averaging is also called the '''[[constant dollar plan]]''' (in the [[United States|US]]), '''pound-cost averaging''' (in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), and, irrespective of currency, '''unit cost averaging''', '''incremental trading''', or the '''cost average effect'''.<ref>[[:de:Durchschnittskosteneffekt]], Retrieved 2009-01-12{{Circular reference|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g., $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g., $1,000 per week over 100 weeks), DCA seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market. Dollar cost averaging is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it is alleged to minimize [[downside risk]]. The technique is said to work in markets undergoing temporary declines because it exposes only part of the total sum to the decline. The technique is so called because of its potential for reducing the average cost of shares bought. As the number of shares that can be bought for a fixed amount of money varies inversely with their price, DCA effectively leads to more shares being purchased when their price is low and fewer when they are expensive. As a result, DCA possibly can lower the total average ''cost per share'' of the investment, giving the investor a lower overall cost for the shares purchased over time.<ref>''Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor Professional Designation Program'', College for Financial Planners, Volume 9, page 64</ref>\n\nHowever, there is also evidence against DCA. Finance journalist Dan Kadlec of ''Time'' summarized the relevant research in 2012, writing: \"The superior long-term returns of lump sum investing [over DCA] have been acknowledged for more than 30 years.\"<ref>Kadlac, Dan. [http://business.time.com/2012/11/15/is-dollar-cost-averaging-dumb/ Is Dollar Cost Averaging Dumb?] Time, Nov. 15, 2012, accessed 11 October 2016</ref> Similarly, decades of empirical research on DCA have found that it generally does not function as promoted and is usually a sub-optimal investment strategy.<ref name =\"Constantinides\"/><ref name=\"Greenhut\"/><ref>John Knight and Lewis Mandell, \u201cNobody Gains from Dollar Cost Averaging: Analytical, Numerical and Empirical Results,\u201d Financial Services Review, 2(1), pp. 51-61, 1992</ref> \n\n==Parameters==\nIn dollar cost averaging, the investor decides on two parameters: the fixed amount of money to invest each time and the time horizon over which all of the investments are made. With a shorter time horizon, the strategy behaves more like [[lump sum]] investing.

Dollar cost averaging is also called the '''[[constant dollar plan]]''' (in the [[United States|US]]), '''pound-cost averaging''' (in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]), and, irrespective of currency, '''unit cost averaging''', '''incremental trading''', or the '''cost average effect'''.<ref>[[:de:Durchschnittskosteneffekt]], Retrieved 2009-01-12{{Circular reference|date=August 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy dividing the total sum to be invested in the market (e.g., $100,000) into equal amounts put into the market at regular intervals (e.g., $1,000 per week over 100 weeks), DCA seeks to reduce the risk of incurring a substantial loss resulting from investing the entire lump sum just before a fall in the market. Dollar cost averaging is not always the most profitable way to invest a large sum, but it is alleged to minimize [[downside risk]]. The technique is said to work in markets undergoing temporary declines because it exposes only part of the total sum to the decline. The technique is so called because of its potential for reducing the average cost of shares bought. As the number of shares that can be bought for a fixed amount of money varies inversely with their price, DCA effectively leads to more shares being purchased when their price is low and fewer when they are expensive. As a result, DCA possibly can lower the total average ''cost per share'' of the investment, giving the investor a lower overall cost for the shares purchased over time.<ref>''Chartered Retirement Planning Counselor Professional Designation Program'', College for Financial Planners, Volume 9, page 64</ref>\n\nHowever, there is also evidence against DCA. Finance journalist Dan Kadlec of ''Time'' summarized the relevant research in 2012, writing: \"The superior long-term returns of lump sum investing [over DCA] have been acknowledged for more than 30 years.\"<ref>Kadlac, Dan.

It is the eighth-largest transit bus agency in the United States, carrying an average of 395,000 passengers each weekday on 215 routes. Metro employs 2,716 full-time and part-time operators and operates 1,540 [[bus|buses]].\n\nKing County Metro formally began operations on January 1, 1973, but can trace its roots to the '''Seattle Transit System''', founded in 1939, and Overlake Transit Service, a private operator founded in 1927 to serve the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]]. Metro is also contracted to operate and maintain [[Sound Transit]]'s [[Central Link]] light rail line and eight of the agency's [[Sound Transit Express]] bus routes along with the [[Seattle Streetcar]] lines owned by the City of Seattle. Metro's services include [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|electric trolleybuses]] in Seattle, [[RapidRide]] enhanced buses on six lines, commuter routes along the regional freeway system, [[dial-a-ride]] routes, [[paratransit]] services, and [[Night service (public transport)|overnight buses]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Seattle Street Railway, the first streetcar in Seattle, at Occidental Ave and Yesler Way with Mayor John Leary and city (CURTIS 2035).jpeg|thumb|[[Seattle Street Railway]]'s first streetcar at Occidental Avenue and Yesler Way with Mayor [[John Leary (politician)|John Leary]] and city officials in the fall of 1884]]\nA horse-drawn streetcar rail system debuted in Seattle in 1884 as the [[Seattle Street Railway]]. In 1918, the city of Seattle bought many parts of the Seattle Street Railway, on terms which left the transit operation in financial trouble. \n\nIn 1939, a new transportation agency, the Seattle Transit System, was formed, which refinanced the remaining debt and began replacing equipment with [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|\"trackless trolleys\"]] (as they were known) and motor buses.

The measure was approved by 56.62% of King County voters in the November 2007 general election. The service programs identified in the ordinance are as follows:\n\n# Implementation of RapidRide routes in five arterial corridors.\n# Increase service on high-ridership routes that provide frequent, two-way connections throughout the agency's service area.\n# Service for growing areas in outlying suburban/[exurban] areas.\n# Partnerships with cities and major employers to provide more service than could otherwise be provided through typical resources.\n# Additional improvements such as expanded ride-share and paratransit services in King County.\n\n=== Proposition 1 ===\nIn November 2014, Seattle voters passed Proposition 1 with 59% support. It uses $45 million in new annual funds from a 0.1% sales tax raise and a $60 annual car-tab fee to add King County Metro bus service within the City of Seattle.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lindblom|first1=Mike|title=Metro bus service to get boost with passage of Prop. 1|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/metro-bus-service-to-get-boost-with-passage-of-prop-1/|accessdate=May 17, 2015|work=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)==\nCollaborating with several local jurisdictions, Metro was an early adopter of [[Bus priority|Transit Signal Priority]] (TSP), a system that can extend [[traffic signal|green lights]] to allow buses to get through.

Buses will communicate with roadside equipment using [[802.11]] wireless technology on the 4.9 [[GHz]] public safety band. A [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] connects access points and roadside equipment together to Metro's Communication Center. The system will extend the legacy RFID-based TSP system. It will also be used in conjunction with GPS technology to provide frequent and accurate location updates for next bus arrival signs at RapidRide stations.\n\nThe extent of Metro's application of [[intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) for transit information available for customers has been limited to a few projects: \n* An early project called MyBus by the [[University of Washington]] (UW) utilized the tracking data to provide real-time bus information. This is now hosted by Metro under the name Tracker. An improved version of MyBus called [[OneBusAway]], developed by UW graduate students Brian Ferris and Kari Watkins, combines Tracker information with Google Maps. OneBusAway continued to be maintained by the University of Washington Department of Computer Science, until a new nonprofit organization was founded to house and administer it in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opentransitsoftwarefoundation.org/overview/history/ |title=Open Transit Software Foundation History |accessdate=November 14, 2019 |publisher=Open Transit Software Foundation}}</ref>\n* Transit Watch displays, like those found in [[Public transport timetables#Dynamic displays|airports and major train stations]], are installed at some transit centers and transfer points to show real-time bus arrival information.\n*A pilot project provided bus information displays along a city arterial.

It is the eighth-largest transit bus agency in the United States, carrying an average of 395,000 passengers each weekday on 215 routes. Metro employs 2,716 full-time and part-time operators and operates 1,540 [[bus|buses]].\n\nKing County Metro formally began operations on January 1, 1973, but can trace its roots to the '''Seattle Transit System''', founded in 1939, and Overlake Transit Service, a private operator founded in 1927 to serve the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]]. Metro is also contracted to operate and maintain [[Sound Transit]]'s [[Central Link]] light rail line and eight of the agency's [[Sound Transit Express]] bus routes along with the [[Seattle Streetcar]] lines owned by the City of Seattle. Metro's services include [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|electric trolleybuses]] in Seattle, [[RapidRide]] enhanced buses on six lines, commuter routes along the regional freeway system, [[dial-a-ride]] routes, [[paratransit]] services, and [[Night service (public transport)|overnight buses]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Seattle Street Railway, the first streetcar in Seattle, at Occidental Ave and Yesler Way with Mayor John Leary and city (CURTIS 2035).jpeg|thumb|[[Seattle Street Railway]]'s first streetcar at Occidental Avenue and Yesler Way with Mayor [[John Leary (politician)|John Leary]] and city officials in the fall of 1884]]\nA horse-drawn streetcar rail system debuted in Seattle in 1884 as the [[Seattle Street Railway]].

The measure was approved by 56.62% of King County voters in the November 2007 general election. The service programs identified in the ordinance are as follows:\n\n# Implementation of RapidRide routes in five arterial corridors.\n# Increase service on high-ridership routes that provide frequent, two-way connections throughout the agency's service area.\n# Service for growing areas in outlying suburban/[exurban] areas.\n# Partnerships with cities and major employers to provide more service than could otherwise be provided through typical resources.\n# Additional improvements such as expanded ride-share and paratransit services in King County.\n\n=== Proposition 1 ===\nIn November 2014, Seattle voters passed Proposition 1 with 59% support. It uses $45 million in new annual funds from a 0.1% sales tax raise and a $60 annual car-tab fee to add King County Metro bus service within the City of Seattle.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lindblom|first1=Mike|title=Metro bus service to get boost with passage of Prop. 1|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/metro-bus-service-to-get-boost-with-passage-of-prop-1/|accessdate=May 17, 2015|work=The Seattle Times|date=November 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Intelligent transportation systems (ITS)==\nCollaborating with several local jurisdictions, Metro was an early adopter of [[Bus priority|Transit Signal Priority]] (TSP), a system that can extend [[traffic signal|green lights]] to allow buses to get through. The system can boost average speeds as much as 8% and is in use on several of the city's busiest corridors, including Aurora Avenue North, Rainier Avenue S and Lake City Way NE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://metro.kingcounty.gov/up/archives/2001/tsp.html|title=Transit Signal Priority tests a success,more signal synchronization planned countywide|accessdate=February 14, 2009|date=February 15, 2001|publisher=King County Department of Transportation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100529185027/http://metro.kingcounty.gov/up/archives/2001/tsp.html|archive-date=May 29, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> The system uses RFID tags that are read as buses approach a TSP equipped intersection.

Buses will communicate with roadside equipment using [[802.11]] wireless technology on the 4.9 [[GHz]] public safety band. A [[Optical fiber|fiber optic]] [[Backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]] connects access points and roadside equipment together to Metro's Communication Center. The system will extend the legacy RFID-based TSP system. It will also be used in conjunction with GPS technology to provide frequent and accurate location updates for next bus arrival signs at RapidRide stations.\n\nThe extent of Metro's application of [[intelligent transportation systems]] (ITS) for transit information available for customers has been limited to a few projects: \n* An early project called MyBus by the [[University of Washington]] (UW) utilized the tracking data to provide real-time bus information. This is now hosted by Metro under the name Tracker. An improved version of MyBus called [[OneBusAway]], developed by UW graduate students Brian Ferris and Kari Watkins, combines Tracker information with Google Maps. OneBusAway continued to be maintained by the University of Washington Department of Computer Science, until a new nonprofit organization was founded to house and administer it in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://opentransitsoftwarefoundation.org/overview/history/ |title=Open Transit Software Foundation History |accessdate=November 14, 2019 |publisher=Open Transit Software Foundation}}</ref>\n* Transit Watch displays, like those found in [[Public transport timetables#Dynamic displays|airports and major train stations]], are installed at some transit centers and transfer points to show real-time bus arrival information.\n*A pilot project provided bus information displays along a city arterial.

However, the 1967 transportation act did not provide the regional authority with any means to levy taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Southeastern Michigan Transportation History Part II: The New Regional Transportation Authority Moves Forward|url=http://detroittransithistory.info/Suburban/SEMTAHistory2.html|work=Detroit Transit History|accessdate=11 November 2018}}</ref> By 1974, the Detroit Department of Street Railways (DSR) had been reorganized as a city department of Detroit, leaving SEMTA only coordination over the suburban services.<ref name=History/>  That same year, SEMTA acquired a [[commuter train]] service between downtown Detroit and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] from the [[Grand Trunk Western]] Railroad.  Due to declining ridership and a lack of funding, the commuter rail service was discontinued in October 1983.\n\nIn 1979, SEMTA approved a regional transit plan, which included improved bus service and new rail transit, but the plan was never implemented due to lack of funds.<ref name=History/>  The last commuter rail service was a former [[Penn Central]] route, named the ''[[Michigan Executive]],'' that ran from the [[Michigan Central Depot]] in Detroit to Jackson.  Its final operator was by [[Amtrak]], as funded by the State of Michigan.

Due to declining ridership and a lack of funding, the commuter rail service was discontinued in October 1983.\n\nIn 1979, SEMTA approved a regional transit plan, which included improved bus service and new rail transit, but the plan was never implemented due to lack of funds.<ref name=History/>  The last commuter rail service was a former [[Penn Central]] route, named the ''[[Michigan Executive]],'' that ran from the [[Michigan Central Depot]] in Detroit to Jackson.  Its final operator was by [[Amtrak]], as funded by the State of Michigan.  The already pared down Executive service ended in 1984.\n\nBeginning in 1983, SEMTA oversaw the construction of the [[Detroit People Mover]], which was conceived as part of a much larger which consisted of light rail lines and a downtown subway.
