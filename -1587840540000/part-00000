It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''. They were joined by [[Dana Gillespie]], Mark Pritchett, Geoffrey MacCormack (better known as [[Warren Peace]]) and George Underwood.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The songs they performed were all originals written by Bowie, apart from a cover of [[Chuck Berry]]'s \"[[Almost Grown (song)|Almost Grown]]\" and [[Ron Davies (songwriter)|Ron Davies]]' \"It Ain't Easy\",{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}} which was to be recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust'' a year later.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} The performance began with \"[[Queen Bitch]]\" and \"[[Bombers (David Bowie song)|Bombers]]\", which Peel says will both be on the upcoming album, although \"Bombers\" was to replaced by the cover \"Fill Your Heart\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=160}} They also played \"[[The Supermen]]\" from ''The Man Who Sold the World'', \"Looking for a Friend\" (which was sung by Pritchett), \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\" (which was sung by Underwood) and \"Andy Warhol\" (which was sung by Gillespie).{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=219}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}} Although Bowie's backing trio were referred to as \"members of a group called Ronno\", the session would become the first performance with the trio who would become known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] and who would record with him for the next three years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=1,093}}<ref name=\"Gallucci UCR\" /> \n\n{{quote box|quote=[''Hunky Dory''] is very much a duo record.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they know the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn\u2019t happen.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget. I would definitely dispute that one.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}}\n\n== Music and lyrics ==\n[[File:Rickwakemanmoog.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|alt=Rick Wakeman performing in 2012|The album features piano by keyboardist [[Rick Wakeman]] ''(pictured in 2012)'', whose playing greatly influenced the songs.]]\nAuthor [[Peter Doggett]] describes ''Hunky Dory'' as \"a collective of attractively accessible pop songs, through which Bowie tested out his feelings about the nature of stardom and power.\"{{sfn|Doggett|2012|p=11}} Musical biographer David Buckley said of the album: \"Its almost easy-listening status and conventional musical sensibility has detracted from the fact that, lyrically, this record lays down the blueprint for Bowie's future career.\"<ref name=buckstrange1>{{cite book |title=Strange Fascination \u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story |last=Buckley |first=David |year=2000 |origyear=1999 |publisher=Virgin Books |location=London |isbn=0-7535-0457-X |page=112}}</ref> Spitz describes it as a piano-driven record and because of this, it offers more of an inviting and warmer feel, especially when compared to ''Space Oddity'' and ''The Man Who Sold the World''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} The opening track, \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\", focused on the compulsive nature of artistic reinvention (\"Strange fascination, fascinating me/Changes are taking the pace I'm going through\") and distancing oneself from the rock mainstream (\"Look out, you rock 'n' rollers\"). However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

It was his first release through RCA, which would be his label for the next decade. Following the [[hard rock]] sound of ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'', ''Hunky Dory'' marked a move towards [[art rock]] and [[art pop]] styles. Co-produced by [[Ken Scott]] and Bowie himself, it was recorded in mid-1971 at [[Trident Studios]] in London and featured [[Rick Wakeman]] on piano and the musicians who would later be known as [[the Spiders from Mars]] \u2013 comprising [[Mick Ronson]], [[Trevor Bolder]] and [[Mick Woodmansey]]. The album cover, photographed by Brian Ward in monochrome and re-coloured by Terry Pastor, was influenced by a [[Marlene Dietrich]] photo book that Bowie took with him to the photoshoot.\n\nThe album was initially released to favourable critical and commercial reception but wasn't a major success until the commercial breakthrough of his following album ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]'' (1972). It was supported by the singles \"[[Changes (David Bowie song)|Changes]]\" in 1972 and \"[[Life on Mars (song)|Life on Mars?]]\" in 1973. Retrospectively, ''Hunky Dory'' has received critical acclaim and is regarded as one of Bowie's best works. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' chose it as part of their \"100 best albums of all time\" list in January 2010, with journalist [[Josh Tyrangiel]] praising Bowie's \"earthbound ambition to be a [[Bohemianism|boho]] poet with prodigal style\".<ref name=time /> The album has been reissued multiple times and remastered in 2015 as part of the ''[[Five Years (1969\u20131973)]]'' box set.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the completion of his third studio album ''[[The Man Who Sold the World (album)|The Man Who Sold the World]]'' in May 1970, Bowie became less active in both the studio and on stage. This was partly due to challenges that were confronting his new manager [[Tony Defries]], who Bowie hired after firing his old manager [[Kenneth Pitt]] and departing music publisher Essex Music.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} After hearing Bowie's new single \"[[Holy Holy]]\", Defries signed a contract with Chrysalis but thereafter limited his work with Bowie to focus on other projects, including attempting to sign American singer-songwriter [[Stevie Wonder]] following his contract ending with [[Motown Records]]. Because of this, Bowie, who was devoting himself to songwriting, turned to Chrysalis partner Bob Grace. Grace, according to biographer Nicholas Pegg, had \"courted\" Bowie on \"the strength of 'Holy Holy'\", and subsequently booked time at [[Radio Luxembourg]]'s studios in London for Bowie to record his demos.{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=195\u2013196}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} According to his then-wife [[Angie Bowie|Angela]], Bowie had spent time at Haddon composing songs on piano rather than acoustic guitar, which would \"infuse the flavour of the new album.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=603}} Biographer [[Marc Spitz]] notes that a piano could not fit in in Plaistow Grove bedroom, nor was it suitable for playing in clubs or bus tours with his previous groups. Haddon Hall, however, gave him more of a sense of comfort and permanence, something he had not felt before when composing.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=159}} Here he composed over three dozen songs, many of which would end up on ''Hunky Dory'' and its follow-up ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} Two of these were \"[[Moonage Daydream]]\" and \"[[Hang On to Yourself]]\", which he recorded with his short-lived band [[Arnold Corns]] in February 1971,{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=206\u2013207}} and subsequently re-recorded for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}\n\nIn August 1970, due to his disillusionment with Bowie's lack of enthusiasm during the sessions for ''The Man Who Sold the World'' and his dislike of Defries, bassist and producer [[Tony Visconti]] parted ways with Bowie; it was the last time he would see the artist for three to four years.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}}{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}} [[Mick Ronson]] and [[Mick Woodmansey|Woody Woodmansey]], who played guitar and drums, respectively for ''The Man Who Sold the World'', similarly parted ways with Bowie, primarily due to their disgruntlement with the artist on top of not being paid for their performances.{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=197}} Visconti would then produce music for glam rock artist [[Marc Bolan]] while Ronson and Woodmansey went to [[Haddon Hall]] in [[Bakewell]], [[Derbyshire]] and formed a short-lived group called Ronno with Benny Marshall of [[The Rats (British band)|the Rats]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=601}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=214}} \n\nThe first song Bowie wrote and demoed for ''Hunky Dory'' was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\" in January 1971. After recording a demo at Radio Luxembourg, Bowie gave the tape to Grace, who showed it to [[Peter Noone]] of [[Herman's Hermits]]. Noone decided to record \"Oh! You Pretty Things\" and released it as his debut single later that year.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=604}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=202\u2013203}} Noone's version reached number 12 on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in mid-June, with Noone telling ''[[NME]]'': \"My view is that David Bowie is the best writer in Britain at the moment...certainly the best since [[Lennon\u2013McCartney|Lennon and McCartney]].\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=220}}\n\n== Writing and recording ==\nAfter the minimal critical and commercial impact of his Arnold Corns project and leaving Mercury Records, Bowie regrouped in the studio in May 1971 to begin work on his next album.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|pp=216, 218}} Initially, he was joined by Arnold Corns guitarist Mark Pritchett, ''Space Oddity'' drummer [[Terry Cox]] and his former Turquoise colleague Tony Hill. However, he came to the conclusion that he couldn't do the project without Ronson.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} Ronson, who had not talked to Bowie in nine months and had become depressed, was enthusiastic when Bowie contacted him. Woodmansey returned with Ronson, who recruited a new bass player to replace Visconti. He initially suggested [[Rick Kemp]], who Bowie recorded with in the King Bees in the mid-1960s. However, upon meeting Bowie at Haddon Hall to audition, Bowie was dismissive of him and, according to Pegg, some reports say that Defries rejected Kemp on the grounds of his \"receding hairline;\" Kemp would instead join the English folk rock band [[Steeleye Span]].{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} So, Ronson suggested his acquaintance [[Trevor Bolder]], a former hairdresser and piano tuner who had previously seen Bowie live in 1970 and met Ronson at Haddon Hall.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} Upon Bolder's hiring, the trio grouped at Haddon to rehearse some of Bowie's new material, of which included album track \"[[Andy Warhol (song)|Andy Warhol]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}}\n\n[[File:Ken Scott - 2014-11-14 - Andy Mabbett.JPG|thumb|upright=0.65|alt=Ken Scott in 2014|''Hunky Dory'' was the first production collaboration between Bowie and [[Ken Scott]] ''(pictured in 2014)''.]]\nFollowing the birth of his son [[Duncan Jones|Duncan]], Bowie wrote the song \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" as a tribute to him. Also known as 'Zowie', Bowie would tell David Wigg in 1973: \"I got the name [Zowie] from a [[Batman]] comic.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=218}} On 3 June, Bowie and the Spiders, along with traveled to the BBC's Paris Studios in London to record for [[John Peel]]'s radio show ''In Concert''.

He recalled in 1995 that he met Bowie in late June 1971 at Haddon Hall, where Bowie played him demos of \"Changes\" and \"[[Life on Mars?]]\" in \"their raw brilliance\". He recalled: \"He [played] the finest selection of songs I have ever heard in one sitting in my entire life...I couldn't wait to get into the studio and record them.\"{{sfn|Cann|2010|p=223}} The piano Wakeman played on the album was an 1898 [[C. Bechstein|Bechstein]] that was the same one used for the Beatles' 1968 song \"[[Hey Jude]]\" and many of [[Elton John]] and [[Harry Nilsson]]'s early records, and would later be used by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] for \"[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]\".{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} According to Wakeman, the sessions initially had a rough start, due to the band not learning the songs. He recalled in the Radio 2 documentary ''Golden Years'' that Bowie had to halt the sessions, telling the musicians off and to come back when they know the music. Upon returning after a week, Wakeman said: \"the band were hot! They were so good, and the tracks just flowed through.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} However, this account has been disputed by other band members, including Bolder, who told Kevin Cann: \"[That's] rubbish. David would never have told the band off in the studio. Especially as Mick and Woody had already left him once, and everyone was now getting on. The band would not have survived that \u2013 it definitely didn\u2019t happen.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=608}} Similarly, Scott said: \"I definitely don't remember that, and it's not something I would forget.

However, the composer also took time to pay tribute to his influences with the tracks \"[[Song for Bob Dylan]]\", \"[[Andy Warhol (David Bowie song)|Andy Warhol]]\" and the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] inspired \"[[Queen Bitch]]\".\n\nFollowing the [[hard rock]] of Bowie's previous album ''The Man Who Sold the World'', ''Hunky Dory'' saw the partial return of the fey pop singer of ''Space Oddity'', with light fare such as \"[[Kooks (song)|Kooks]]\" and the cover \"Fill Your Heart\" sitting alongside heavier material like the [[occult]]-tinged \"[[Quicksand (David Bowie song)|Quicksand]]\" (whose lyric mentions the Golden Dawn (i.e. the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]]) and [[Aleister Crowley]]) and the semi-autobiographical \"[[The Bewlay Brothers]]\". Between the two extremes was \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\", whose pop tune hid lyrics, inspired by [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], predicting the imminent replacement of modern man by \"the [[\u00dcbermensch|Homo Superior]]\", and which has been cited as a direct precursor to \"[[Starman (song)|Starman]]\" from Bowie's next album, ''[[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars]]''.{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|p=44}}\n\n== Title and artwork ==\nAlthough Bowie generally left naming his albums until last minute, the title, 'Hunky Dory', was announced at the John Peel session.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=606}} It was suggested by Bob Grace of Chrysalis, who got the idea from an [[Esher]] pub landlord and formerly of the [[Royal Air Force]]. He told Peter and Leni Gillman, the authors of ''Alias David Bowie'', that the landlord had an unusual vocabulary that was \"peppered with upper-crust jargon\", using words such as 'prang' and 'whizzo', and phrases such as 'everything's hunky-dory'. Grace told Bowie and he loved it.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=606\u2013607}} Pegg notes that there was a song from 1957 by the American doo-wop band the Guytones also titled \"Hunky Dory\" that may have played a part as well.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=607}} Spitz notes that 'hunky-dory' is an English slang term that means everything is right in the world.{{sfn|Spitz|2009|p=156}} The album's sleeve would bear the credit \"Produced by Ken Scott (assisted by the actor)\". The \"actor\" was Bowie himself, whose \"pet conceit\", in the words of ''[[NME]]'' critics [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]], was \"to think of himself as an actor\".{{sfn|Carr|Murray|1981|pp=7\u201311}}\n\nThe cover artwork was taken by photographer Brian Ward at his [[Heddon Street]] studio,{{sfn|Pegg|2016|pp=610\u2013611}} who was introduced to Bowie by Grace. One idea was for Bowie to dress as an Egyptian Pharoah, partly inspired by the British media's infatuation with the [[British Museum]]'s new [[Tutankhamun]] exhibit.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Photos of Bowie posing as a sphinx and in a lotus position were taken \u2013 one of them was released as part of the 1990 ''Space Oddity'' reissue \u2013 but the idea was ultimately not chosen. Bowie later recalled: \"We didn't run with it, as they say. Probably a good idea.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=610}} Rather than something extravagant, Bowie opted for a more minimalist image reflecting the album's \"preoccupation with the silver screen.\" Bowie later said: \"I was into Oxford bags, and there are a pair, indeed, on the back of the album. [I was attempting] what I presumed was kind of an [[Evelyn Waugh]] Oxbridge look.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} The final image is a close-up of Bowie looking up into space as he pushes his hair back from his forehead. Originally shot in monochrome, the image was re-coloured by illustrator Terry Pastor, who recently set up the Main Artery design studio in [[Covent Garden]] with George Underwood; Pastor would later design the cover and sleeve for ''Ziggy Stardust''.{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Pegg writes: \"Bowie's decision to use a re-coloured photo suggests a hand-tinted lobby-card from the days of the silent cinema and, simultaneously, Warhol's famous ''[[Marilyn Diptych]]'' screen-prints.\"{{sfn|Pegg|2016|p=611}} Robert Dimery, in his book ''[[1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die]]'', also notes the influenced of Warhol's ''Dietrich'' prints and writes that Bowie took a photo book that contained multiple ''Dietrich'' prints with him to the photoshoot.<ref>{{cite book |title=1001 Albums You Must

The Swedish province of [[Uppland]] has been a stronghold for nyckelharpa music since the early 17th century, including musicians like [[Byss-Calle]] (Carl Ersson B\u00f6ssa, 1783\u20131847) from [[\u00c4lvkarleby]].<ref name=World/>\n\nChanges by [[August Bohlin]] (1877\u20131949) in 1929/1930 made the nyckelharpa a [[chromatic scale|chromatic]] instrument with a straight [[bow (music)|bow]], making it a more [[violin]]-like and no longer a [[drone (music)|bourdon]] instrument.<ref name=World/> Composer, player and maker of nyckelharpor [[Eric Sahlstr\u00f6m]] (1912\u20131986) used this new instrument and helped to re-popularize it in the mid-20th century.<ref name=World/> In spite of this, the nyckelharpa's popularity declined until the 1960s [[roots revival]].\n\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw a resurgence in the popularity of the nyckelharpa, with notable artists such as [[Marco Ambrosini]] (Italy and Germany), Sture Sahlstr\u00f6m, Hasse Gille, Peter Puma Hedlund and Nils Nordstr\u00f6m including the nyckelharpa in both [[early music]] and [[contemporary music]] offerings.  Continued refinement of the instrument also contributed to the increase in popularity, with instrument builders like [[Jean-Claude Condi]] and [[Annette Osann]] bringing innovation to the bow and body.\n\nIn 1990s, the nyckelharpa was recognised as one of the instruments available for study at the folk music department of the Royal College of Music in Stockholm ([[Kungliga Musikh\u00f6gskolan]]). It has also been a prominent part of several revival groups in the later part of the century, including the trio [[V\u00e4sen]], the more contemporary group [[Hedningarna]], the Finnish folk music group [[Hyperborea (Finnish folk music group)|Hyperborea]] and the Swedish folk music groups [[Dr\u00e5m]] and [[Nordman]]. Elizabeth Weis Nord is a notable Nyckelharpa teacher and performer who resides the US. It has also been used in non-Scandinavian musical contexts, for example by the Spanish player [[Ana Alcaide]].\n\n==Technique==\n[[File:Vaxholm 8556 (1158877619).jpg|thumb|Traditional method of playing]]\nThe nyckelharpa is usually played with a strap around the neck, stabilised by the right arm. [[Didier Fran\u00e7ois]], a violinist and nyckelharpist from Belgium, is noted for using an unusual playing posture, holding the nyckelharpa vertically{{clarify|date=April 2014}} in front of the chest. This allows a wider range of motion for both arms. It also affects the tone and sound of the instrument. Some players may use a violin bracket to keep the nyckelharpa away from the body so that it can swing freely, causing it to sound more \"open\" as its resonance is not dampened.\n\n==Variants==\nThere are four common variants of the nyckelharpa still played today, differing in the number and arrangement of keys, number and arrangement of strings, and general body shape. The predominant type is the three-row so-called \"chromatic nyckelharpa\", with the melody strings tuned A1 - C1 - G, a drone C (from the highest to the lowest string) that is only touched occasionally, and 12 resonance strings (one for each step of the chromatic scale).\n\nThe resonance strings, or [[sympathetic strings]], which were added to the instrument during the 2nd half of the 16th century, are not bowed directly but resonate with the other strings.\n\nTraditional variants of the nyckelharpa used to have one or more [[Drone (music)|drone string]]s. This is not the case for modern chromatic nyckelharpor with three rows of keys for three melody strings and one bass string. But there are today also types with four or even five rows of keys.\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nImage:Viola a chiavi Siena 1408.jpg|Angel with ''viola a chiavi'' ('keys'), Cappellina di [[Palazzo Pubblico]], [[Siena]], [[Italy]].

The State Government identified the Capital City area between Vijayawada and Guntur cities on the Southern bank of River Krishna upstream of Prakasam Barrage. The Amaravati Capital City has an area of 217.23 km<sup>2</sup> and is spread across 25 villages in 3 mandals (Thulluru, Mangalagiri and Tadepalli) of Guntur district. The 25 villages in the Capital City area have about 1 lakh population in about 27,000 households. The nearest cities are Vijayawada at a distance of 30 km and Guntur at a distance of 18 km. The nearest railway station is KC Canal railway station near Tadepalli and the nearest airport is Gannavaram which is at a distance of 22 km. The city is planned to spread over 217 km<sup>2</sup> area with a total cost of \u20b9 553.43 billions to the Capital Region Development Authority (CRDA) out of which state government contribution is only \u20b9 126 billion (equity \u20b9 66.29 billion and supporting grant \u20b9 59.71 billion) spread over a period of 8 years from April 2018 to March 2026 (\u20b9 5 billion in 2018\u201319, \u20b9 18 billion per year for later six years and \u20b9 13 billion in 2025\u201326).<ref name=\"amr\">{{cite web|url=https://www.eenadu.net/eenadu-exclusive/newsarticle/general/1500/120008374|title=Amaravati city a self financed project |language=Telugu|access-date=18 January 2020}}</ref> \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Andhra Pradesh Capital Region Development Authority (APCRDA)\n|'''City area details:'''\n|'''Land utilization'''\n|-\n|Roads, public utilities, parks, natural streams, water bodies\n|27,885 acres\n|-\n|Plots for residential area allotted to the Land contributors(Farmers)\n|11,826 acres\n|-\n|For the needs of other developments presently owned by the CRDA\n|14,037 acres\n|-\n|Total area under the jurisdiction of CRDA\n|53,748 acres\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Amaravati City Land Usage\n!Land use\n!Area (Sq.&nbsp;km)\n!'''%'''\n|-\n|Residential\n|60.77\n|27.9\n|-\n|Commercial\n|20.99\n|9.34\n|-\n|Public and Semi Public\n|11.49\n|5.29\n|-\n|Open spaces and Recreation\n|52.78\n|24.29\n|-\n|Industrial\n|12.26\n|5.64\n|-\n|Water Bodies\n|25.78\n|11.87\n|-\n|Traffic and Transportation\n|23.04\n|10.61\n|-\n|Cultural Heritage\n|0.15\n|0.07\n|-\n|Seed Capital\n|10.67\n|4.91\n|-\n|Total\n|217.23\n|100\n|}\nThe contribution from the government is to be repaid by the CRDA after the year 2037.

At the end of the previous season, Zadar had become champions of the [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav League]], and had the right to participate in the [[FIBA European Champions Cup]] (EuroLeague). Komazec made great performances, and led his team in the fourth place of the top 6 semifinal group stage. After six years in Zadar, where he became the absolute leader and scorer of his team, he made the big step in his career for the transcription of the [[Greek Basket League|Greek League]] (which was then the best in Europe) and [[Panathinaikos B.C.|Panathinaikos]], of the head coach [[\u017deljko Pavli\u010devi\u0107]] and the Greek superstar [[Nikos Galis]]. There he found an old acquaintance from years of Zadar, [[Stojko Vrankovi\u0107]], who had just returned from the [[NBA]]. \n\nIn a year that began with ambitions to win the championship, for Panathinaikos and him also, won only the [[Greek Basketball Cup|1993 Greek Cup]], in a final against [[Aris B.C.|Sato Aris]]. Komazec, although he did some excellent performances, did not respond satisfactorily to Panathinaikos, who was preparing to make the fling at European level, and in the summer he was [[loan (sports)|loaned]] to [[Pallacanestro Varese|Cagiva Varese]], where he played the next two seasons (1993\u201394 in [[Serie A2 Basket|A2]] & 1994\u201395 [[Lega Basket Serie A|A1]]), and made impressive performances. \n\nThe impression that he made by his performance in Varese, caused [[Virtus Pallacanestro Bologna|Buckler Beer Bologna]], which was the dominant team of the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian League]] the previous years, to buy his contract from Panathinaikos, and close a deal with him for the next two years, in an effort to replace the large void left in the team by [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107|Sa\u0161a Danilovi\u0107]] leaving for the [[NBA]]'s [[Miami Heat]]. The Croatian star didn't succeed one more time to respond to the high demands of competitive sport at the top level, and he only led Virtus to the meager wins of the [[Italian Basketball Supercup|Italian Supercup]] in 1996, and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1997. This failure brought him back again to Varese the next year (1997\u201398), where rediscovered his best self, and with a scoring recital, he led the Lombardy team to the playoffs semifinals in the Italian League, and on the course to a participation in the EuroLeague, for the first time 20 years. \n\nIn the summer of 1998, came the third and final chance for Komazec to make an important achievement in a great club of European basketball, as he agreed to play for [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] of [[head coach]] [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]]. Arijan began the season doing very well, and everything indicated that the experiment for the player and the club could end up in achieving something good at the end of the season, when the major club titles, both in Greece and in Europe were contested. But an injury put him off of the court for half a month, and he became substantially off in his playing form, throughout the remaining part of the season. His participation at the [[1999 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four]], in [[Munich]], was the only one in his short and essentially failed time at Olympiacos. \n\nIn the next season (1999\u201300), he returned to his roots, and he quite unexpectedly was joined in [[KK Zadar|Zadar]] by [[Dino Ra\u0111a]]. Together, the duo led the [[Dalmatia]]n club to the semifinals of the [[FIBA Saporta Cup]], where they lost to the Greek club [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]. They won the [[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Cup|Croatian Cup]] in the same season, which marked the last success of his career.\n\nHe was briefly a part of the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] [[NBA]] team, during the 2000\u201301 season, but he only spent one month with the team, and he did not play in any official NBA games with them.\n\n==National team career==\nKomazec was a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] (1990\u201392), and then the senior  [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatian national team]]. He was a part of the Croatian teams that won silver at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]], and bronze at [[EuroBasket]] [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis father is Milan Komazec, a former basketball player who won three [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav First League]] championships ([[1965 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1965]], [[1967 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1967]], and [[1967\u201368 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968]]) with Zadar. His uncle is [[Petar Popovi\u0107 (basketball, born 1959)|Petar Popovi\u0107]], a former basketball player. His first-cousin is [[Alan Gregov]], a former basketball player.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Zadarska sporstska dinastija |journal=KO\u0160 |date=February 1990 |issue=5 |url=https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0BIEP7nsWaTNzUwUVJwN2g4R1E/view |accessdate=2 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.aek.com/basketball/roster/arijan_komazec.htm Arijan Komazec]\n* [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/nba/players/3486/injuries.html Sports Illustrated]\n* [http://www.eurobasket.com/player.asp?Cntry=ITA&PlayerID=22332&AmNotSure=1 Eurobasket]\n* [http://www.euroleague.net/competition/players/showplayer?pcode=AQR&seasoncode=E2001 Euroleague.net Profile]\n\n{{Navboxes colour |title= Croatia squads |bg= red |fg= white |list1=\n{{Croatia Men Basketball Squad 1996 Summer Olympics}}\n{{Croatia Squad EuroBasket 1995}}\n{{Croatia Squad 1994 FIBA World Championship}}\n{{Croatia Squad EuroBasket 1993}}\n{{Footer 1992 Olympic Silver Medalists Basketball Men}}\n}}\n{{Navboxes colour |title= Yugoslavia squads |bg= #00008b |fg= white |list1=\n{{Yugoslavia Squad EuroBasket 1991}}\n{{Yugoslavia Squad 1990 FIBA World Championship}}\n}}\n{{Lega Basket Serie A scoring leader}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Komazec, Arijan}}\n[[Category:1970 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:AEK B.C. players]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1992 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Basketball players at the 1996 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Croatian expatriate basketball people in Greece]]\n[[Category:Croatian expatriate basketball people in Italy]]\n[[Category:Croatian men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:FIBA EuroBasket-winning players]]\n[[Category:FIBA World Championship-winning players]]\n[[Category:Greek Basket League players]]\n[[Category:KK Zadar players]]\n[[Category:Lega Basket Serie A players]]\n[[Category:Medalists at the 1992 Summer Olympics]]\n[[Category:Olympiacos B.C. players]]\n[[Category:Olympic basketball players of Croatia]]\n[[Category:Olympic medalists in basketball]]\n[[Category:Olympic silver medalists for Croatia]]\n[[Category:Pallacanestro Varese players]]\n[[Category:Panathinaikos B.C. players]]\n[[Category:S.S.

The Croatian star didn't succeed one more time to respond to the high demands of competitive sport at the top level, and he only led Virtus to the meager wins of the [[Italian Basketball Supercup|Italian Supercup]] in 1996, and the [[Italian Basketball Cup|Italian Cup]] in 1997. This failure brought him back again to Varese the next year (1997\u201398), where rediscovered his best self, and with a scoring recital, he led the Lombardy team to the playoffs semifinals in the Italian League, and on the course to a participation in the EuroLeague, for the first time 20 years. \n\nIn the summer of 1998, came the third and final chance for Komazec to make an important achievement in a great club of European basketball, as he agreed to play for [[Olympiacos B.C.|Olympiacos]] of [[head coach]] [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]]. Arijan began the season doing very well, and everything indicated that the experiment for the player and the club could end up in achieving something good at the end of the season, when the major club titles, both in Greece and in Europe were contested. But an injury put him off of the court for half a month, and he became substantially off in his playing form, throughout the remaining part of the season. His participation at the [[1999 FIBA EuroLeague Final Four]], in [[Munich]], was the only one in his short and essentially failed time at Olympiacos. \n\nIn the next season (1999\u201300), he returned to his roots, and he quite unexpectedly was joined in [[KK Zadar|Zadar]] by [[Dino Ra\u0111a]]. Together, the duo led the [[Dalmatia]]n club to the semifinals of the [[FIBA Saporta Cup]], where they lost to the Greek club [[AEK B.C.|AEK]]. They won the [[Kre\u0161imir \u0106osi\u0107 Cup|Croatian Cup]] in the same season, which marked the last success of his career.\n\nHe was briefly a part of the [[Memphis Grizzlies|Vancouver Grizzlies]] [[NBA]] team, during the 2000\u201301 season, but he only spent one month with the team, and he did not play in any official NBA games with them.\n\n==National team career==\nKomazec was a member of the senior [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavian national team]] (1990\u201392), and then the senior  [[Croatia national basketball team|Croatian national team]]. He was a part of the Croatian teams that won silver at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]], and bronze at [[EuroBasket]] [[EuroBasket 1993|1993]] and [[EuroBasket 1995|1995]].\n\n== Personal life ==\nHis father is Milan Komazec, a former basketball player who won three [[Yugoslav First Basketball League|Yugoslav First League]] championships ([[1965 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1965]], [[1967 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1967]], and [[1967\u201368 Yugoslav First Basketball League|1968]]) with Zadar. His uncle is [[Petar Popovi\u0107 (basketball, born 1959)|Petar Popovi\u0107]], a former basketball player.

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''. They are filled with a mixture including [[fish]] or [[tuna]] and onions.<ref>[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''[https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ Eating on the Islands] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200328214604/https://www.himalmag.com/eating-on-the-islands/ |date=28 March 2020 }}'', [[Himal Southasian]], Vol. 26 no. 2, pages 69-91 {{ISSN|1012-9804}}</ref>\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n\n====Burma====\n[[File:Burmese style samusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Burmese cuisine|Burmese]]-style ''samusa'' are flat and triangular, and usually smaller than their Indian counterparts.]]\n\nSamosas are called ''samusas'' in [[Burmese language|Burmese]], and are an extremely popular snack in [[Burma]].\n\n====Indonesia====\nThe types of samosas in Indonesia are called ''samosa''\u2014usually, samosas are served as snack with sambal.

The entire pastry is then deep-fried in vegetable oil or rarely [[ghee]] to a golden brown color. It is served hot and is often eaten with fresh green chutney, such as mint, [[coriander]], or [[tamarind]]. It can also be prepared as a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Samosas are often served in ''[[chaat]]'', along with the traditional accompaniments of either chick pea or white pea preparation, garnished with yogurt, tamarind and green chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''[[chaat masala]]''\n\nIn [[Delhi]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Bihar]], and [[Uttarakhand]], a bigger version of the samosa with a spicy filling of masala potatoes, peas, crushed green chillies, cheese, and even dried fruits, as well as other variations, is quite popular. This samosa is bigger compared to other Indian and foreign variants.\n\nIn [[Odisha]], [[West Bengal]], and [[Jharkhand]], ''shingadas'' (the East Indian version of samosas) are popular snacks. They are found almost everywhere. They are a bit smaller compared to those in other parts of India, and the filling mainly consists of boiled and diced potato, along with of other ingredients. They are wrapped in a thin sheet of dough (made of all purpose flour) and fried. Good shingaras are distinguished by flaky textures, almost as if they are made with a savoury pie crust.\n\nUsually, Samosas are deep-fried to a golden brown colour in vegetable oil. They are served hot and consumed with ketchup or chutney, such as mint, coriander, or tamarind, or are served in ''chaat'', along with the traditional accompaniments of yogurt, chutney, chopped onions, coriander, and ''chaat masala''. Usually, shingaras are eaten at tea time as a snack. They can also be prepared in a sweet form, rather than as a savoury one. Bengali shingaras tend to be triangular, filled with potato, peas, onions, diced almonds, or other vegetables, and are more heavily fried and crunchier than either shingara or their Indian samosa cousins. ''Fulkopir shingara'' (shingara filled with cauliflower mixture) is another very popular variation. In Bengal, there are non-vegetarian varieties of shingara called ''mangsher shingara'' (mutton shingara) and ''macher shingara'' (fish shingara). There are also sweeter versions, such as ''narkel er shingara'' (coconut shingara), as well as others filled with ''[[khoya]]'' and dipped in sugar syrup.\n\n[[File:Vegetable Samosa.jpg|thumb|Vegetable samosa]]\nIn [[Hyderabad, India]], a smaller version of the samosa with a thicker pastry crust and mince-meat filling, referred to as ''[[lukhmi]]'', is consumed, as is another variation with an onion filling.\n\nIn the states of [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Karnataka]], [[Kerala]], and [[Tamil Nadu]], samosas are slightly different, in that they are folded in a different way, much more like Portuguese ''chamu\u00e7as'', with a different style pastry. The filling also differs, typically featuring mashed potatoes with spices, fried onions, peas, carrots, cabbage, curry leaves, green chillies, etc. It is mostly eaten without chutney. Samosas in [[South India]] are made in different sizes, and fillings are greatly influenced by the local food habits. It can include many variety of fillings, such as meats and vegetables.\n\n====Bangladesh====\n[[File:Samosas, snack food at Wikipedia's 16th Birthday celebration in Chittagong (01).jpg|thumb|Bangladeshi samosas, snack food]]\n\nBoth flat-shaped (triangular) and full-shaped (tetrahedron/triangular pyramid) samosas are popular snacks in [[Bangladesh]]. A [[Bengali language|Bengali]] version of the full-shaped samosa is called a \u09b8\u09bf\u0999\u09be\u09a1\u09bc\u09be (''shingara'') and is normally smaller than the standard variety. The ''shingara'' is usually filled with pieced potatoes, vegetables, nuts etc. However, shingaras filled with beef liver are very popular in some parts of the country. The flat-shaped samosa is called a ''somosa'' or ''somucha'', and is usually filled with onions and minced meat.\n\n====Nepal====\nSamosas are called ''singadas'' in the eastern zone of [[Nepal]]; the rest of the country calls it samosa. As in India, it is a very popular snack in [[Nepalese cuisine]]. Vendors sell the dish in various markets and restaurants.\n\n====Pakistan====\nSamosas of various types are available all over [[Pakistan]]. In general, most samosa varieties sold in the southern [[Sindh]] province and in the eastern [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], especially the city of [[Lahore]], are spicier and mostly contain vegetable or potato-based fillings. However, the samosas sold in the west and north of the country mostly contain minced meat-based fillings and are comparatively less spicy. The meat samosa contains minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]], or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]) and are very popular as snack food in Pakistan.\n\nIn Pakistan, samosas of [[Karachi]] are famous for their spicy flavour, whereas samosas from [[Faisalabad]] are noted for being unusually large. Another distinct variety of samosa, available in Karachi, is called ''kaghazi samosa'' ({{lang-ur|{{nq|\u06a9\u0627\u063a\u0630\u06cc \u0633\u0645\u0648\u0633\u06c1}}}}; \"paper samosa\" in English) due to its thin and crispy covering, which resembles a [[wonton]] or [[spring roll]] wrapper. Another variant, popular in Punjab, consists of samosas with side dishes of mashed spiced chickpeas, onions, and coriander leaf salad, as well as various chutneys to top the samosas. The samosas are a fried or baked pastry with a savoury filling, such as spiced [[potato]]es, [[onion]]s, [[pea]]s, [[lentil]]s, and minced meat ([[Lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[beef]] or [[Chicken (food)|chicken]]). \nSweet samosas are also sold in the cities of Pakistan including Peshawar; these sweet samosas contain no filling and are dipped in thick sugar syrup.\n\nAnother Pakistani snack food, which is popular in Punjab, is known as \"samosa chaat\". This is a combination of a crumbled samosa, along with spiced chickpeas ([[Chaat|channa chaat]]), yogurt, and chutneys. Alternatively, the samosa can be eaten on its own with a side of chutney. \n\nIn Pakistan, samosa's are a staple iftaar food for many Pakistani families, during the month of [[Ramadan|Ramzan]].\n\n==== Maldives ====\nThe types and varieties of samosa made in [[Maldivian cuisine]] are known as ''bajiyaa''.

However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]]. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a [[double dribble]], the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer. In the overtime, the Soviets easily prevailed against the shocked Yugoslavs, who had to be content with the bronze.<ref name=\"vreme\" />\n\nThe next year, Divac participated in the team that took the gold at the [[1987 FIBA Under-19 World Cup|1987 FIBA Junior World Championship]] (which was later split into separate [[FIBA Under-19 World Championship|under-19]] and [[FIBA Under-21 World Championship|under-21]] events) in [[Bormio]], Italy.

Divac claims that he told the man that he should not be waving that flag, since this was a win for Yugoslavia. Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war. The taking of the flag made Divac a hero to Serbs, and a villain to Croatians. Divac has stated that he did not mean it as an act against Croatia and he would have taken away a Serbian flag if a Serb fan had done the same.<ref name=once>{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/once-brothers,46215/| title=Once Brothers |publisher=A.

afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.\n\n===KK Partizan president===\nIn late 2000, following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s,<ref name=\"si-may1999-Rick Reilly\">{{cite

}}</ref> Divac and former teammate [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107]] took over their former club [[KK Partizan]]. They did so on initiative by [[Ivica Da\u010di\u0107]], the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from r\u00e9gime change, Da\u010di\u0107 saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilovi\u0107 took the vice-president role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Da\u010di\u0107a |work=[[Blic]] |date=October 16, 2008 |author=\u017d. Jevti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nFreshly retired from playing, Danilovi\u0107 was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000\u201301 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]] to be the new head coach.\n\nThough the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilovi\u0107 appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.\n\n===LA Lakers scout===\nIn October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref> He left the position in 2006.\n\n===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===\nIn June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], Divac linked up with [[Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calder\u00f3n presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> When Calder\u00f3n closely won the club elections on July 2, 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calder\u00f3n's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.<ref name=\"elmundo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El incre\u00edble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como \"asesor\" y con el \"gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa\"|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': \"I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image.

He is an active restaurant investor in the [[Sacramento, California]] area. However, his attempts to make major investments in Serbia failed, for a variety of reasons.\n\nThe most notable affair was a highly publicized business venture\u2014takeover bid of profitable beverage producer [[Knjaz Milo\u0161]]. Divac's company \"Apurna\", in a joint venture with French dairy giant [[Danone]], ostensibly proposed the best bid, but the takeover was aborted by the Serbia's Securities Commission, because Danone/Apurna allegedly offered extra money to small shareholders.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=56547&n=wh49&c=%23emailcode |title=Knjaz Milos auction descends into chaos |publisher=CEE-foodindustry.com |date=December 3, 2004 |accessdate=September 25, 2007 |author=Chris Mercer}}</ref>\nIn the repeated bid, Divac and Danone eventually withdrew and the sale went to [[FPP Balkan Ltd.]], a privatization fund from the [[Cayman Islands]].

However, the Serbian Government intervened and halted what should have been a mere technical move.  While the attempted takeover was a \"backdoor\" one indeed, it was legal and similar cases had already occurred. The government ostensibly feared lack of control over the influential daily.

However, the excellent rookie's performance was spoiled by the event in the semi-finals against the [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]]. Forty-five seconds before the end, Yugoslavia had a comfortable lead of 9 points, but the Soviets scored two three-pointers within a few seconds and cut the difference to 3 points. Yugoslavia tried to hold the ball for the remaining time, opting to continue the play with throw-ins instead of free throws following fouls, but with only 14 seconds left, Divac committed a [[double dribble]], the Soviets were awarded the ball, and tied the score with another three-pointer.

Divac claims the man made a derogatory remark about the Yugoslav flag, at which point Divac took his flag from him. This happened during a very tense time where nationalistic pride was threatening to tear Yugoslavia apart and ignite a war.

afterwards, Divac focused on three fields: humanitarian work, sport management, and investment.\n\n===KK Partizan president===\nIn late 2000, following the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] whose policies Divac had been openly critical of throughout mid-to-late 1990s,<ref name=\"si-may1999-Rick Reilly\">{{cite

}}</ref> Divac and former teammate [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107]] took over their former club [[KK Partizan]]. They did so on initiative by [[Ivica Da\u010di\u0107]], the club's outgoing president and, more importantly, a suddenly marginalized politician who, due to his association with Milo\u0161evi\u0107, was forced to leave his post at the club. Seeing that various state-owned companies and community property were being taken over in a dubious manner during the power vacuum that resulted from r\u00e9gime change, Da\u010di\u0107 saw it prudent to bring the club's two former greats as a safeguard against the same happening to KK Partizan. Divac became the club's president while Danilovi\u0107 took the vice-president role.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/61059/Divac-savetuje-Dacica |title=Divac savetuje Da\u010di\u0107a |work=[[Blic]] |date=October 16, 2008 |author=\u017d. Jevti\u0107}}</ref>\n\nFreshly retired from playing, Danilovi\u0107 was actually running the club's day-to-day operations since Divac was still very actively involved with the [[Sacramento Kings]] at the time. The head coach they inherited, [[Darko Russo]], finished out the 2000\u201301 season before they decided in summer 2001 to bring back their mentor [[Du\u0161ko Vujo\u0161evi\u0107]] to be the new head coach.\n\nThough the duo never stated so outright, their additional motivation in getting involved with KK Partizan again was perceived to be gaining the upper hand on the club's eventual privatisation process once the new Law on Sports gets passed in the [[National Assembly of Serbia|Serbian parliament]]. Since the exact ownership structure of a publicly owned KK Partizan wasn't and still isn't really clear, potential investors decided to stay away, at least until the law appears. Divac and Danilovi\u0107 appeared pretty much out of nowhere in this regard but enjoyed plenty of fan and public support because most preferred to see their beloved club owned and operated by its former stars rather than a faceless corporation or a group of politicians, managers or businessmen close to the ruling coalition. However, after a few years the duo ran out of patience and pulled out of the venture in late 2004 because it became too much of a financial burden with no end-goal in sight. While he stopped performing any official functions at the club, Divac continued to be involved with it in a lesser capacity for a few years afterwards.\n\n===LA Lakers scout===\nIn October 2005, right after ending his playing career with the [[Los Angeles Lakers]], Divac got hired as the Lakers' European scout, reporting directly to the team's general manager [[Mitch Kupchak]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/nba/news/story?id=2196445|title=Divac to serve as scout, liaison in Europe|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|agency=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate=April 15, 2018}}</ref> He left the position in 2006.\n\n===Real Madrid Baloncesto club management===\nIn June 2006, through his friendship with [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], Divac linked up with [[Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n]] as part of the lawyer's candidate bid for the presidency of [[Real Madrid]] [[polideportivo]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/06/05/actualidad/1149492115_850215.html|title=Calder\u00f3n presenta su proyecto para el Real Madrid con Mijatovic como director deportivo|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=June 5, 2006|accessdate=April 16, 2018}}</ref> When Calder\u00f3n closely won the club elections on July 2, 2006, Divac was announced as the head of operations at [[Real Madrid Baloncesto|Real Madrid]] basketball club though the scope of his job description soon got reduced to consulting duties as president Calder\u00f3n's adviser for basketball and club's international coordinator.<ref name=\"elmundo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2008/04/02/baloncesto/1207128247.html|title=El incre\u00edble caso de Vlade Divac|agency=''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''|date=April 4, 2008|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://elpais.com/deportes/2006/09/22/actualidad/1158909714_850215.html|title=Divac llega al Real Madrid como \"asesor\" y con el \"gran reto de traer la NBA a Europa\"|agency=''[[El Pa\u00eds]]''|date=September 22, 2006|accessdate=July 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Divac's role in the club's day-to-day operations turned out to be largely symbolic, and he even admitted as much in a March 2007 interview for Croatian weekly ''[[Globus (weekly)|Globus]]'': \"I literally do nothing and I only serve as part of the ''royal club'''s image.

Since the founding of the country, and particularly with the end of the [[American Civil War]], power shifted away from the states and toward the national government. The progression of federalism includes [[dual federalism|dual]], [[U.S. state|state]]-centered, and [[new federalism]].\n\n\n== Federalism in the early Republic ==\nFederalism was a political solution for the problems with the [[Articles of Confederation]] which gave little practical authority to the federal government. For example, the Articles allowed the [[Continental Congress]] the power to sign treaties and declare war, but it could not raise taxes to pay for an army and all major decisions required a unanimous vote.<ref>{{harvnb|Gerston|2007|pp=24\u201325}}</ref>\n\nThe movement was greatly strengthened by the reaction to [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786\u20131787, which was an armed uprising of [[Yeoman#United States|yeoman farmers]] in western [[Massachusetts]]. The rebellion was fueled by a poor economy that was created, in part, by the inability of the federal government to deal effectively with the debt from the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Moreover, the federal government had proven incapable of raising an army to quell the rebellion, so that Massachusetts had been forced to raise its own.''\n\nOn May 15th, 1787, fifty-five delegates met at what would be known as the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional convention]] in the [[Philadelphia]] State House. There, the delegates debated the structure, provisions, and limitations of [[Federalism]] in what would be the [[Constitution of the United States]]. Preceding examples, such as in the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], influenced the delegates whilst framing their ideas of Federal bicameral legislature ([[United States Congress]]), balanced representation of small and large states ([[Great Compromise]]), and [[checks and balances]] structures<ref>= \"Liberty Fund\"> https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/1791-us-bill-of-rights-1st-10-amendments-with-commentary#targetText=The%20first%20ten%20amendments%20were,as%20the%20Bill%20of%20Rights.</ref>[[James Madison]] stated in a pre-convention [[memorandum]] to the delegates that because \"one could hardly expect the state legislatures to take enlightened views on national affairs\", a stronger central government was necessary.<ref>{{harvnb|Gerston|2007|p=26}}</ref> Madison later wrote in [[Federalist No. 10]] on his support for a federal government, \"the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens[.]\"<ref>https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-10</ref> The convention had begun altering its original plan but then decided to abandon all efforts of emendation, and officially set about constructing a new [[Constitution of the United States]]. Once the convention concluded and released the Constitution for public consumption, the Federalist and Anti-Federalist movements soon began publicizing their disagreeing beliefs in local newspapers and segments.<ref>{{Roche|1961|p=814}}</ref>\n\nThe most forceful defense of the new Constitution was ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', a compilation of 85 anonymous essays published in New York City to convince the people of the state to vote for ratification. These articles, written by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], with some contributed by [[John Jay]], examined the benefits of the new, proposed Constitution, and analyzed the political theory and function behind the various articles of the Constitution. ''The Federalist Papers'' remain one of the most important sets of documents in American history and political science.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\">Jackson, Kenneth T. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'': The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. p. 194.</ref>\n\nThose opposed to the new Constitution became known as the [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]. They generally were local rather than cosmopolitan in perspective, oriented to plantations and farms rather than commerce or finance, and wanted strong state governments and a weak national government. according to political scientist James Wilson, the Antifederalists:\n:were much more committed to strong states and a weak national government....A strong national government, they felt, would be distant from the people and would use its powers to annihilate or absorb the functions that properly belonged to the states.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Wilson|title=American Government: Brief Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fZfk-KosYcC&pg=PA21|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=21\u201322|isbn=978-0547212760}}.</ref> The Anti-Federalist critique soon centered on the absence of a [[bill of rights]], which Federalists in the ratifying conventions promised to provide.\n\nBecause [[George Washington]] lent his prestige to the Constitution and because of the ingenuity and organizational skills of its proponents, the Constitution was ratified by all the states. The outgoing [[Congress of the Confederation]] scheduled elections for the new government, and set March 4, 1789 as the date that the new government would take power. In 1789, Congress submitted twelve articles of amendment to the states. Ten of these articles, written by congressional committees, achieved passage on December 15, 1791 and became the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] set the guidelines for federalism in the United States.\n\n=== Federalist Party ===\n{{Main|Federalist Party}}\n\nAs soon as the first Federalist movement dissipated, a second one sprang up to take its place. This one was based on the policies of Alexander Hamilton and his allies for a stronger national government, a [[Loose constructionism|loose construction]] of the Constitution, and a mercantile (rather than agricultural) economy. As time progressed, the factions which adhered to these policies organized themselves into the nation's first political party, the Federalist Party, and the movement's focus and fortunes began to track those of the party it spawned.\n\nWhile the Federalist movement of the 1780s and the Federalist Party were distinct entities, they were related in more than just a common name. The [[Democratic-Republican Party]], the opposition to the Federalist Party, emphasized the fear that a strong national government was a threat to the liberties of the people. They stressed that the [[History of the United States public debt|national debt]] created by the new government would bankrupt the country, and that federal bondholders were paid from taxes paid by honest farmers and workingmen. These themes resonated with the Anti-Federalists, the opposition to the Federalist movement of the 1780s. As Norman Risjord has documented for Virginia, of the supporters of the Constitution in 1788, 69% joined the Federalist party, while nearly all (94%) of the opponents joined the Republicans. 71% of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s supporters in Virginia were former anti-federalists who continued to fear centralized government, while only 29% had been proponents of the Constitution a few years before. In short, nearly all of the opponents of the Federalist movement became opponents of the Federalist Party.\n\nThe movement reached its zenith with the election of [[John Adams]], an overtly Federalist President. However, with the defeat of Adams in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]] and the [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|death of Hamilton]], the Federalist Party began a long decline from which it never recovered. What finally finished off the Federalist party was the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814, in which five [[New England]] states gathered to discuss several constitutional amendments necessary to protect New England's interests in regard to the blockade of their ports by the British during the [[War of 1812]]. The threat of [[Secession in the United States|secession]] also was proposed during these secret meetings. Three delegates were sent to Washington, DC to negotiate New England's terms only to discover the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], ending the war with the British. The Federalists were then seen by many as traitors to the union.<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/warof1812/section8.rhtml War of 1812] Sparknotes.com</ref>\n\n==Federalism under the Marshall Court==\n{{see also|John Marshall}}\nThe United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall played an important role in defining the power of the federal and state governments during the early 19th century. As the U.S. Constitution does not specifically define many dividing lines between the layers of government, the Supreme Court settled the issue in New York. The question was answered particularly in the cases, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', in which the court unanimously found that the states could not tax a federal institution that was deemed legitimate and appropriate, ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', in which Congress was confirmed control of interstate commerce under the commerce clause instead of the states, and [[Marbury v. Madison]] which broadly expanded the power of the national government. A notable instance in which the Marshall Court empowered the states under federalism was in that of [[Barron v. Baltimore]], a case which resulted in Marshall\u2019s court unanimously concluding that the 5th amendment only applied to the federal government and not the states.\n\n==Dual Federalism==\n{{main|Dual federalism}}\nDespite Chief Justice Marshall's strong push for the federal government, the court of his successor, [[Roger B. Taney]] (1835\u20131864), decided cases that favored equally strong national and state governments. The basic philosophy during this time was that the U.S. Government ought to be limited to its [[enumerated powers]] and that all others belonged to the states. Any powers that were not granted to the U. S. Government by the Constitution were handed over to the states through the Tenth Amendment. Relevant court cases Dual federalism had a significant impact on social issues in the United States. [[Dred Scott v. Sanford]] was an example of how Taney's dual federalism helped stir up tensions eventually leading to the outbreak of the Civil War. Another example of dual federalism's social impact was in the [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] ruling. Dual federalism had set up that the U. S. Government could not legislate on moral issues. It was an issue that had to be decided by the states, and thus \"separate but equal\" could exist. Lastly, near the end of dual federalism's lifespan, both the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth]] and the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth]] Amendment bolstered the power of the national government, and divided state and federal power( Fuad Nor,1977).\n\n==Between Dual Federalism and the New Deal==\nThe ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 marked a significant transfer of authority from state governments to the federal government, declaring United States citizenship paramount to state citizenship. Over time, the application of the Fourteenth Amendment and incorporation of the Bill of Rights to the states strengthened the federal government\u2019s power to protect against state intrusions upon individual rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutional law for a changing America. Rights, liberties, and justice|last=Epstein, Lee, 1958-|others=Walker, Thomas G., 1945-|isbn=9781483384016|edition= Ninth|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=910310223|date = October 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStill, in the immediate aftermath of the Taney court and the rise of [[Dual federalism]], the division of labor between federal, state, and local governments was relatively unchanged for over a century. Political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] summarized the system in place during those years in ''The End of the Republican Era''<ref>Lowi, T. ''The End of the Republican Era'' ({{ISBN|0-8061-2887-9}}), [[University of Oklahoma]] Press, 1995\u20132006. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThis lack of change is no more apparent than in Supreme Court rulings that addressed federalism against the backdrop of the laissez-faire, pro-business Gilded Age. In ''United States v. E.C. Knight Co.'' (1895), the Supreme Court continued along the path of promoting dual federalism in striking down a provision of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In an 8-1 decision, the Court ruled that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate monopolies by adopting a limited interpretation of interstate commerce, a win for states\u2019 rights. In 1918, a 5-4 majority ruled similarly in ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]],'' a challenge against the constitutionality of the Federal Child Labor Act of 1915. However, by 1941, this ruling was reversed in ''United States v. Darby Lumber Company''. The Court delivered another victory for dual federalism in ''[[Coyle v. Smith]]'' (1911), where Oklahoma\u2019s effort to relocate their capital to Oklahoma City was halted. The state agreed to keep the capital in Guthrie until at least 1913 as part of the terms of their Enabling Act of 1906, which outlined the conditions for Oklahoma\u2019s acceptance into the Union as a state. These cases illustrate the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent willingness to rule in favor of states\u2019 rights until ''[[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.|National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'' (1937), which ushered in a new era of cooperative federalism for the courts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutional law for a changing America. Rights, liberties, and justice|last=Epstein, Lee, 1958-|others=Walker, Thomas G., 1945-|isbn=9781483384016|edition= Ninth|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=910310223|date = October 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s stubbornness on guarding states\u2019 rights, much of the modern federal apparatus owes its origins to changes that occurred during the period between 1861 and 1933. While banks had long been incorporated and regulated by the states, the [[National Bank Act]]s of 1863 and 1864 saw Congress establish a network of national banks that had their reserve requirements set by officials in Washington. During World War I, a system of federal banks devoted to aiding farmers was established, and a network of federal banks designed to promote home ownership came into existence in the last year of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. Congress used its power over interstate commerce to regulate the rates of interstate (and eventually intrastate) railroads and even regulated their stock issues and labor relations, going so far as to enact a law regulating pay rates for railroad workers on the eve of World War I. During the 1920s, Congress enacted laws bestowing collective bargaining rights on employees of interstate railroads and some observers dared to predict it would eventually bestow collective bargaining rights on persons working in all industries. Congress also used the commerce power to enact morals legislation, such as the [[Mann Act]] of 1907 barring the transfer of women across state lines for immoral purposes, even as the commerce power remained limited to interstate transportation\u2014it did not extend to what were viewed as intrastate activities such as manufacturing and mining.\n\nAs early as 1913, there was talk of regulating stock exchanges, and the Capital Issues Committee formed to control access to credit during World War I recommended federal regulation of all stock issues and exchanges shortly before it ceased operating in 1921. With the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] Congress used land sale revenues to make grants to the states for colleges during the Civil War on the theory that land sale revenues could be devoted to subjects beyond those listed in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] of the Constitution. On several occasions during the 1880s, one house of Congress or the other passed bills providing land sale revenues to the states for the purpose of aiding primary schools. During the first years of twentieth century, the endeavors funded with federal grants multiplied, and Congress began using general revenues to fund them\u2014thus utilizing the [[general welfare clause]]'s broad spending power, even though it had been discredited for almost a century (Hamilton's view that a broad spending power could be derived from the clause had been all but abandoned by 1840).\n\nDuring Herbert Hoover's administration, grants went to the states for the purpose of funding poor relief. The 1920s saw Washington expand its role in domestic law enforcement. Disaster relief for areas affected by floods or crop failures dated from 1874, and these appropriations began to multiply during the administration of [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913\u201321). By 1933, the precedents necessary for the federal government to exercise broad regulatory power over all economic activity and spend for any purpose it saw fit were almost all in place. Virtually all that remained was for the will to be mustered in Congress and for the Supreme Court to acquiesce.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zavodnyik|first=Peter|title=The Rise of the Federal Colossus: The Growth of Federal Power from Lincoln to F.D.R.|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-0-313-39293-1|pages=21\u201330, 186\u201393, 213\u201319, 291\u201393, 313\u201327, 363\u201364, 380\u201393, 416\u201319|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AhhlcAAACAAJ&dq=zavodnyik}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===State government policies===\n*[[Property law]]\n*[[Education]]\n*Estate and [[inheritance]] law\n*[[Commerce]] laws of ownership and exchange\n*[[Banking]] and credit laws\n*[[Labor law]] and [[professional licensure in the United States|professional licensure]]\n*[[Insurance]] laws\n*[[Family law]]s\n*[[Morals]] laws\n*[[Public health]] and [[quarantine]] laws\n*[[Public works]] laws, including [[eminent domain]]\n*[[Building code]]s\n*[[Corporations law]]\n*[[Land use]] laws\n*[[Water law|Water]] and [[Mineral rights|mineral resource]] laws\n*Judiciary and criminal procedure laws\n*[[Election|Electoral]] laws, including parties\n*[[Civil service]] laws\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Local government policies===\n*Variances (adaptation of state law to local conditions)\n*Public works\n*Contracts for public works\n*Licensing of public accommodations\n*Assessable improvements\n*Basic public services<ref>Lowi, T.

More specifically, it supports the idea that the Tenth Amendment does not provide any additional powers to the states.<ref>Epstein, L., & Walker, T. G. (2019). Constitutional law for a changing America. Thousand Oaks, CA: CQ Press, an imprint of SAGE Publications, Inc.</ref> It operates under the assumption that the federal and state governments are \"partners,\" with the federal creating laws for the states to carry out. It relies on the [[Supremacy Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] as constitutional bases for its argument. Court cases such as [[United States v. Darby Lumber Co.]] and [[Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority]] expanded the role of Cooperative Federalism by forcing states to enforce federal labor laws.\n\nAlthough Cooperative Federalism has roots in the civil war, the [[Great Depression]] marked an abrupt end to Dual Federalism and a dramatic shift to a strong national government. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] policies reached into the lives of U.S. citizens like no other federal measure had. As the Supreme Court had rejected nearly all of Roosevelt's economic proposals, the president proposed the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]] to add more members.

The formerly distinct division of responsibilities between state and national government had been described as a \"layer cake,\" but, with the lines of duty blurred, cooperative federalism was likened to a \"marble cake\" or a \"picket fence.\" In cooperative federalism, federal funds are distributed through [[grants in aid]] or [[categorical grant]]s which gave the federal government more control over the use of the money.\n\n== New Federalism ==\n{{main|New Federalism}}\nAnother movement calling itself \"New Federalism\" appeared in the late 20th century and early 21st century. New Federalism, which is characterized by a gradual return of power to the states, was initiated by President Ronald Reagan (1981\u201389) with his \"devolution revolution\" in the early 1980s and lasted until 2001. Previously, the federal government had granted money to the states categorically, limiting the states to use this funding for specific programs. Reagan's administration, however, introduced a practice of giving block grants, freeing state governments to spend the money at their own discretion. An example and the first case of this was Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority  (SAMTA) (1985). Garcia was a worker for SAMTA and appealed that because SAMTA received federal money, that they had to abide by federal labor regulations. SAMTA argued that they did not because the money received was to be used at their own discretion and did not need to abide by federal statutes because they are locally operated and make decisions about the transit system. This gave more autonomy and power to the states by allowing them to use more discretion, not having to abide by federal regulations.\n\nUnder New Federalism, the question that is asked is may the federal government constitutionally command the states to carry out federal policy? For this, the courts use the anti-commandeering principle. \u201cThe anti-commandeering doctrine says that the federal government cannot require states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal law.\u201d This became the principle by New York v. United States (1992). In this case, New York sued the federal government, questioning the authority of congress to regulate waste management. The courts ruled that it violated the 10th amendment because congress made the state of New York commandeer to federal regulations when states already take legal ownership and liability for waste treatment. Establishing this principle, giving states more autonomy on issues that fall under their discretion.\n\nA modern-day application of this rule can be found in Murphy v. NCAA (2018). New Jersey\u2019s governor attacked the federal government\u2019s prohibition on sports gambling. The courts again used the anti-commandeering principle, allowing states to regulate sports gambling at their discretion. This is starting to become a trend because now states are passing laws on issues that are often federally prohibited or heavily regulated by Congress under the commerce clause, as in the areas of medical marijuana (''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]''), [[partial-birth abortion]] (''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]''), gun possession (''[[United States v. Lopez]]''), federal police powers (''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', which struck down portions of the [[Violence Against Women Act]]), or agriculture (''[[Wickard v. Filburn]]'').\n\n==See also==\n*[[Anti-Federalists]]\n*[[Federalism]]\n*[[Laboratories of democracy]]\n*[[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]]\n*[[Federalist Society]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading and references==\n*{{citation|last=Gerston|first=Larry N.|title=American Federalism: A Concise Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yzEJiboJdkUC|place=[[Armonk, New York|Armonk]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[United States]]|publisher=M.E.

Since the founding of the country, and particularly with the end of the [[American Civil War]], power shifted away from the states and toward the national government. The progression of federalism includes [[dual federalism|dual]], [[U.S. state|state]]-centered, and [[new federalism]].\n\n\n== Federalism in the early Republic ==\nFederalism was a political solution for the problems with the [[Articles of Confederation]] which gave little practical authority to the federal government. For example, the Articles allowed the [[Continental Congress]] the power to sign treaties and declare war, but it could not raise taxes to pay for an army and all major decisions required a unanimous vote.<ref>{{harvnb|Gerston|2007|pp=24\u201325}}</ref>\n\nThe movement was greatly strengthened by the reaction to [[Shays' Rebellion]] of 1786\u20131787, which was an armed uprising of [[Yeoman#United States|yeoman farmers]] in western [[Massachusetts]]. The rebellion was fueled by a poor economy that was created, in part, by the inability of the federal government to deal effectively with the debt from the [[American Revolutionary War]]. Moreover, the federal government had proven incapable of raising an army to quell the rebellion, so that Massachusetts had been forced to raise its own.''\n\nOn May 15th, 1787, fifty-five delegates met at what would be known as the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional convention]] in the [[Philadelphia]] State House. There, the delegates debated the structure, provisions, and limitations of [[Federalism]] in what would be the [[Constitution of the United States]]. Preceding examples, such as in the [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], influenced the delegates whilst framing their ideas of Federal bicameral legislature ([[United States Congress]]), balanced representation of small and large states ([[Great Compromise]]), and [[checks and balances]] structures<ref>= \"Liberty Fund\"> https://oll.libertyfund.org/pages/1791-us-bill-of-rights-1st-10-amendments-with-commentary#targetText=The%20first%20ten%20amendments%20were,as%20the%20Bill%20of%20Rights.</ref>[[James Madison]] stated in a pre-convention [[memorandum]] to the delegates that because \"one could hardly expect the state legislatures to take enlightened views on national affairs\", a stronger central government was necessary.<ref>{{harvnb|Gerston|2007|p=26}}</ref> Madison later wrote in [[Federalist No. 10]] on his support for a federal government, \"the smaller the number of individuals composing a majority, and the smaller the compass within which they are placed, the more easily will they concert and execute their plans of oppression. Extend the sphere, and you take in a greater variety of parties and interests; you make it less probable that a majority of the whole will have a common motive to invade the rights of other citizens[.]\"<ref>https://www.congress.gov/resources/display/content/The+Federalist+Papers#TheFederalistPapers-10</ref> The convention had begun altering its original plan but then decided to abandon all efforts of emendation, and officially set about constructing a new [[Constitution of the United States]]. Once the convention concluded and released the Constitution for public consumption, the Federalist and Anti-Federalist movements soon began publicizing their disagreeing beliefs in local newspapers and segments.<ref>{{Roche|1961|p=814}}</ref>\n\nThe most forceful defense of the new Constitution was ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'', a compilation of 85 anonymous essays published in New York City to convince the people of the state to vote for ratification. These articles, written by [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]], with some contributed by [[John Jay]], examined the benefits of the new, proposed Constitution, and analyzed the political theory and function behind the various articles of the Constitution. ''The Federalist Papers'' remain one of the most important sets of documents in American history and political science.<ref name=\"Citycyclopedia\">Jackson, Kenneth T. ''The Encyclopedia of New York City'': The New York Historical Society; Yale University Press; 1995. p. 194.</ref>\n\nThose opposed to the new Constitution became known as the [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]]. They generally were local rather than cosmopolitan in perspective, oriented to plantations and farms rather than commerce or finance, and wanted strong state governments and a weak national government. according to political scientist James Wilson, the Antifederalists:\n:were much more committed to strong states and a weak national government....A strong national government, they felt, would be distant from the people and would use its powers to annihilate or absorb the functions that properly belonged to the states.<ref>{{cite book|author=James Wilson|title=American Government: Brief Edition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1fZfk-KosYcC&pg=PA21|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning|pages=21\u201322|isbn=978-0547212760}}.</ref> The Anti-Federalist critique soon centered on the absence of a [[bill of rights]], which Federalists in the ratifying conventions promised to provide.\n\nBecause [[George Washington]] lent his prestige to the Constitution and because of the ingenuity and organizational skills of its proponents, the Constitution was ratified by all the states. The outgoing [[Congress of the Confederation]] scheduled elections for the new government, and set March 4, 1789 as the date that the new government would take power. In 1789, Congress submitted twelve articles of amendment to the states. Ten of these articles, written by congressional committees, achieved passage on December 15, 1791 and became the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. The [[Tenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Tenth Amendment]] set the guidelines for federalism in the United States.\n\n=== Federalist Party ===\n{{Main|Federalist Party}}\n\nAs soon as the first Federalist movement dissipated, a second one sprang up to take its place. This one was based on the policies of Alexander Hamilton and his allies for a stronger national government, a [[Loose constructionism|loose construction]] of the Constitution, and a mercantile (rather than agricultural) economy. As time progressed, the factions which adhered to these policies organized themselves into the nation's first political party, the Federalist Party, and the movement's focus and fortunes began to track those of the party it spawned.\n\nWhile the Federalist movement of the 1780s and the Federalist Party were distinct entities, they were related in more than just a common name. The [[Democratic-Republican Party]], the opposition to the Federalist Party, emphasized the fear that a strong national government was a threat to the liberties of the people. They stressed that the [[History of the United States public debt|national debt]] created by the new government would bankrupt the country, and that federal bondholders were paid from taxes paid by honest farmers and workingmen. These themes resonated with the Anti-Federalists, the opposition to the Federalist movement of the 1780s. As Norman Risjord has documented for Virginia, of the supporters of the Constitution in 1788, 69% joined the Federalist party, while nearly all (94%) of the opponents joined the Republicans. 71% of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s supporters in Virginia were former anti-federalists who continued to fear centralized government, while only 29% had been proponents of the Constitution a few years before. In short, nearly all of the opponents of the Federalist movement became opponents of the Federalist Party.\n\nThe movement reached its zenith with the election of [[John Adams]], an overtly Federalist President. However, with the defeat of Adams in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1800|election of 1800]] and the [[Burr\u2013Hamilton duel|death of Hamilton]], the Federalist Party began a long decline from which it never recovered. What finally finished off the Federalist party was the [[Hartford Convention]] of 1814, in which five [[New England]] states gathered to discuss several constitutional amendments necessary to protect New England's interests in regard to the blockade of their ports by the British during the [[War of 1812]]. The threat of [[Secession in the United States|secession]] also was proposed during these secret meetings. Three delegates were sent to Washington, DC to negotiate New England's terms only to discover the signing of the [[Treaty of Ghent]], ending the war with the British. The Federalists were then seen by many as traitors to the union.<ref>[http://www.sparknotes.com/history/american/warof1812/section8.rhtml War of 1812] Sparknotes.com</ref>\n\n==Federalism under the Marshall Court==\n{{see also|John Marshall}}\nThe United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall played an important role in defining the power of the federal and state governments during the early 19th century. As the U.S. Constitution does not specifically define many dividing lines between the layers of government, the Supreme Court settled the issue in New York. The question was answered particularly in the cases, ''[[McCulloch v. Maryland]]'', in which the court unanimously found that the states could not tax a federal institution that was deemed legitimate and appropriate, ''[[Gibbons v. Ogden]]'', in which Congress was confirmed control of interstate commerce under the commerce clause instead of the states, and [[Marbury v. Madison]] which broadly expanded the power of the national government. A notable instance in which the Marshall Court empowered the states under federalism was in that of [[Barron v. Baltimore]], a case which resulted in Marshall\u2019s court unanimously concluding that the 5th amendment only applied to the federal government and not the states.\n\n==Dual Federalism==\n{{main|Dual federalism}}\nDespite Chief Justice Marshall's strong push for the federal government, the court of his successor, [[Roger B. Taney]] (1835\u20131864), decided cases that favored equally strong national and state governments. The basic philosophy during this time was that the U.S. Government ought to be limited to its [[enumerated powers]] and that all others belonged to the states. Any powers that were not granted to the U. S. Government by the Constitution were handed over to the states through the Tenth Amendment. Relevant court cases Dual federalism had a significant impact on social issues in the United States. [[Dred Scott v. Sanford]] was an example of how Taney's dual federalism helped stir up tensions eventually leading to the outbreak of the Civil War. Another example of dual federalism's social impact was in the [[Plessy v. Ferguson]] ruling. Dual federalism had set up that the U. S. Government could not legislate on moral issues. It was an issue that had to be decided by the states, and thus \"separate but equal\" could exist. Lastly, near the end of dual federalism's lifespan, both the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixteenth]] and the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Seventeenth]] Amendment bolstered the power of the national government, and divided state and federal power( Fuad Nor,1977).\n\n==Between Dual Federalism and the New Deal==\nThe ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868 marked a significant transfer of authority from state governments to the federal government, declaring United States citizenship paramount to state citizenship. Over time, the application of the Fourteenth Amendment and incorporation of the Bill of Rights to the states strengthened the federal government\u2019s power to protect against state intrusions upon individual rights.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutional law for a changing America. Rights, liberties, and justice|last=Epstein, Lee, 1958-|others=Walker, Thomas G., 1945-|isbn=9781483384016|edition= Ninth|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=910310223|date = October 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nStill, in the immediate aftermath of the Taney court and the rise of [[Dual federalism]], the division of labor between federal, state, and local governments was relatively unchanged for over a century. Political scientist [[Theodore J. Lowi]] summarized the system in place during those years in ''The End of the Republican Era''<ref>Lowi, T. ''The End of the Republican Era'' ({{ISBN|0-8061-2887-9}}), [[University of Oklahoma]] Press, 1995\u20132006. p. 6.</ref>\n\nThis lack of change is no more apparent than in Supreme Court rulings that addressed federalism against the backdrop of the laissez-faire, pro-business Gilded Age. In ''United States v. E.C. Knight Co.'' (1895), the Supreme Court continued along the path of promoting dual federalism in striking down a provision of the Sherman Antitrust Act. In an 8-1 decision, the Court ruled that Congress lacked the authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate monopolies by adopting a limited interpretation of interstate commerce, a win for states\u2019 rights. In 1918, a 5-4 majority ruled similarly in ''[[Hammer v. Dagenhart]],'' a challenge against the constitutionality of the Federal Child Labor Act of 1915. However, by 1941, this ruling was reversed in ''United States v. Darby Lumber Company''. The Court delivered another victory for dual federalism in ''[[Coyle v. Smith]]'' (1911), where Oklahoma\u2019s effort to relocate their capital to Oklahoma City was halted. The state agreed to keep the capital in Guthrie until at least 1913 as part of the terms of their Enabling Act of 1906, which outlined the conditions for Oklahoma\u2019s acceptance into the Union as a state. These cases illustrate the Supreme Court\u2019s consistent willingness to rule in favor of states\u2019 rights until ''[[NLRB v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corp.|National Labor Relations Board v. Jones & Laughlin Steel Corporation]]'' (1937), which ushered in a new era of cooperative federalism for the courts.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Constitutional law for a changing America. Rights, liberties, and justice|last=Epstein, Lee, 1958-|others=Walker, Thomas G., 1945-|isbn=9781483384016|edition= Ninth|location=Thousand Oaks, California|oclc=910310223|date = October 2, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDespite the Supreme Court\u2019s stubbornness on guarding states\u2019 rights, much of the modern federal apparatus owes its origins to changes that occurred during the period between 1861 and 1933. While banks had long been incorporated and regulated by the states, the [[National Bank Act]]s of 1863 and 1864 saw Congress establish a network of national banks that had their reserve requirements set by officials in Washington. During World War I, a system of federal banks devoted to aiding farmers was established, and a network of federal banks designed to promote home ownership came into existence in the last year of [[Herbert Hoover]]'s administration. Congress used its power over interstate commerce to regulate the rates of interstate (and eventually intrastate) railroads and even regulated their stock issues and labor relations, going so far as to enact a law regulating pay rates for railroad workers on the eve of World War I. During the 1920s, Congress enacted laws bestowing collective bargaining rights on employees of interstate railroads and some observers dared to predict it would eventually bestow collective bargaining rights on persons working in all industries. Congress also used the commerce power to enact morals legislation, such as the [[Mann Act]] of 1907 barring the transfer of women across state lines for immoral purposes, even as the commerce power remained limited to interstate transportation\u2014it did not extend to what were viewed as intrastate activities such as manufacturing and mining.\n\nAs early as 1913, there was talk of regulating stock exchanges, and the Capital Issues Committee formed to control access to credit during World War I recommended federal regulation of all stock issues and exchanges shortly before it ceased operating in 1921. With the [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts]] Congress used land sale revenues to make grants to the states for colleges during the Civil War on the theory that land sale revenues could be devoted to subjects beyond those listed in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] of the Constitution. On several occasions during the 1880s, one house of Congress or the other passed bills providing land sale revenues to the states for the purpose of aiding primary schools. During the first years of twentieth century, the endeavors funded with federal grants multiplied, and Congress began using general revenues to fund them\u2014thus utilizing the [[general welfare clause]]'s broad spending power, even though it had been discredited for almost a century (Hamilton's view that a broad spending power could be derived from the clause had been all but abandoned by 1840).\n\nDuring Herbert Hoover's administration, grants went to the states for the purpose of funding poor relief. The 1920s saw Washington expand its role in domestic law enforcement. Disaster relief for areas affected by floods or crop failures dated from 1874, and these appropriations began to multiply during the administration of [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913\u201321). By 1933, the precedents necessary for the federal government to exercise broad regulatory power over all economic activity and spend for any purpose it saw fit were almost all in place. Virtually all that remained was for the will to be mustered in Congress and for the Supreme Court to acquiesce.<ref>{{cite book|last=Zavodnyik|first=Peter|title=The Rise of the Federal Colossus: The Growth of Federal Power from Lincoln to F.D.R.|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, CA|isbn=978-0-313-39293-1|pages=21\u201330, 186\u201393, 213\u201319, 291\u201393, 313\u201327, 363\u201364, 380\u201393, 416\u201319|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AhhlcAAACAAJ&dq=zavodnyik}}</ref>\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===State government policies===\n*[[Property law]]\n*[[Education]]\n*Estate and [[inheritance]] law\n*[[Commerce]] laws of ownership and exchange\n*[[Banking]] and credit laws\n*[[Labor law]] and [[professional licensure in the United States|professional licensure]]\n*[[Insurance]] laws\n*[[Family law]]s\n*[[Morals]] laws\n*[[Public health]] and [[quarantine]] laws\n*[[Public works]] laws, including [[eminent domain]]\n*[[Building code]]s\n*[[Corporations law]]\n*[[Land use]] laws\n*[[Water law|Water]] and [[Mineral rights|mineral resource]] laws\n*Judiciary and criminal procedure laws\n*[[Election|Electoral]] laws, including parties\n*[[Civil service]] laws\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Local government policies===\n*Variances (adaptation of state law to local conditions)\n*Public works\n*Contracts for public works\n*Licensing of public accommodations\n*Assessable improvements\n*Basic public services<ref>Lowi, T.

More specifically, it supports the idea that the Tenth Amendment does not provide any additional powers to the states.<ref>Epstein, L., & Walker, T. G. (2019). Constitutional law for a changing America. Thousand Oaks, CA: CQ Press, an imprint of SAGE Publications, Inc.</ref> It operates under the assumption that the federal and state governments are \"partners,\" with the federal creating laws for the states to carry out. It relies on the [[Supremacy Clause]] and the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] as constitutional bases for its argument. Court cases such as [[United States v. Darby Lumber Co.]] and [[Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority]] expanded the role of Cooperative Federalism by forcing states to enforce federal labor laws.\n\nAlthough Cooperative Federalism has roots in the civil war, the [[Great Depression]] marked an abrupt end to Dual Federalism and a dramatic shift to a strong national government. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] policies reached into the lives of U.S. citizens like no other federal measure had. As the Supreme Court had rejected nearly all of Roosevelt's economic proposals, the president proposed the [[Judicial Procedures Reform Bill of 1937]] to add more members. The expansion of the Court, which never materialized, along with a Democrat-controlled Congress would tilt Court rulings in favor of Roosevelt's policies.<ref>{{harvnb|Gerston|2007|p=57}}</ref> Lowi notes three Supreme Court cases that validated the shift in power:<ref>{{harvnb|Lowi|1995|p=17}}</ref>\n*''[[National Labor Relations Board v.

The formerly distinct division of responsibilities between state and national government had been described as a \"layer cake,\" but, with the lines of duty blurred, cooperative federalism was likened to a \"marble cake\" or a \"picket fence.\" In cooperative federalism, federal funds are distributed through [[grants in aid]] or [[categorical grant]]s which gave the federal government more control over the use of the money.\n\n== New Federalism ==\n{{main|New Federalism}}\nAnother movement calling itself \"New Federalism\" appeared in the late 20th century and early 21st century. New Federalism, which is characterized by a gradual return of power to the states, was initiated by President Ronald Reagan (1981\u201389) with his \"devolution revolution\" in the early 1980s and lasted until 2001. Previously, the federal government had granted money to the states categorically, limiting the states to use this funding for specific programs. Reagan's administration, however, introduced a practice of giving block grants, freeing state governments to spend the money at their own discretion. An example and the first case of this was Garcia v. San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority  (SAMTA) (1985). Garcia was a worker for SAMTA and appealed that because SAMTA received federal money, that they had to abide by federal labor regulations. SAMTA argued that they did not because the money received was to be used at their own discretion and did not need to abide by federal statutes because they are locally operated and make decisions about the transit system. This gave more autonomy and power to the states by allowing them to use more discretion, not having to abide by federal regulations.\n\nUnder New Federalism, the question that is asked is may the federal government constitutionally command the states to carry out federal policy? For this, the courts use the anti-commandeering principle. \u201cThe anti-commandeering doctrine says that the federal government cannot require states or state officials to adopt or enforce federal law.\u201d This became the principle by New York v. United States (1992). In this case, New York sued the federal government, questioning the authority of congress to regulate waste management. The courts ruled that it violated the 10th amendment because congress made the state of New York commandeer to federal regulations when states already take legal ownership and liability for waste treatment. Establishing this principle, giving states more autonomy on issues that fall under their discretion.\n\nA modern-day application of this rule can be found in Murphy v. NCAA (2018). New Jersey\u2019s governor attacked the federal government\u2019s prohibition on sports gambling. The courts again used the anti-commandeering principle, allowing states to regulate sports gambling at their discretion. This is starting to become a trend because now states are passing laws on issues that are often federally prohibited or heavily regulated by Congress under the commerce clause, as in the areas of medical marijuana (''[[Gonzales v.
