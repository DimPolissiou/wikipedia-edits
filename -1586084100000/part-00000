So it would not be unlikely that a temple of bronze was made for Apollo\u2026\n\n[13] The fourth temple was made by Trophonius and Agamedes; the tradition is that it was made of stone. It was burnt down in the archonship of Erxikleides at [[Athens]], in the first year of the fifty-eighth [[Olympiad]] (548/47), when Diognetus of Krotona was victorious. The modern temple was built for the god by the Amphictyons from the sacred treasures, and the architect was one Spintharos of Korinth.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pausanias|first=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.5|title=Description of Greece|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book X.5.9-13.}}</ref></blockquote>Pausanias did not mention that the reconstruction after the 548/47 fire was paid for and directed by members of the Athenian [[Alcmaeonidae|Alkmaeonid]] family who had been forcibly exiled from that city by the tyrant [[Peisistratos]]. \u00a0From [[Herodotus|Herodotos]]\u2019 ''Histories'':  <blockquote>As the Alkmaeonids were considering every strategy they could think of against the Peisistratids, they accepted a contract from the [[Amphictyonic League|Amphityons]] to build the temple at Delphi, the same one that is there now [as of the mid-fifth century BCE], but which had not you been built at that time. [3] And since they were not only quite wealthy but also distinguished in their lineage, the temple they constructed turned out more beautiful in all respects than the original plan required; for example, whereas the agreement had called for them to use tufa as the building material, they built the fa\u00e7ade of [[Parian marble]] instead.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Herodotos|first=|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.62|title=The Histories|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Book V.62.2-3}}</ref>  </blockquote>The Alkmaeonid temple, completed by about 511 at the latest, was of the [[Doric order|Doric]] order, with a six by fifteen column ''[[peristyle]]'' (surrounding colonnade). \u00a0The sculpted decoration of its pediments was the work of the Athenian sculptor [[Antenor]]. The east [[pediment]] depicted Apollo\u2019s arrival at Delphi in triumph on his four-horse chariot.

Some key finders beep or flash lights on demand.\n\n==Types==\n===Sound-based===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[File:Keyfinder-inside.jpg|thumb|upright|Interior of a sound-based key finder]]\n\nEarly models of key finder were sound-based, and listened for a clap or [[whistle]] (or a sequence of same), then beeped for the user to find them. Determining what was a clap or a whistle proved difficult, resulting in poor performance and false alarms. Because of this low quality and unreliability, these early key finders were soon discarded and were unpopular for serious needs.\n\n=== Radio ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nAs electronics became smaller and cheaper, and [[battery life]] improved, radio became viable to locate the keys, which were fitted with a small receiver. A separate transmitter is used to activate one or more receivers. All wireless key finders have to \"listen\" for a searching transmission, resulting in battery replacement at intervals ranging from 3 months to a year. Using a radio signal removes the risk of false alarms.\n\nSome distributors include a cost-effective key-return service that assists in returning the keys should they be lost in a taxi, bus or other public place, provided the customer registered their devices and contact information. The [[transmitter]] can also contain information to help return it to its rightful owner.\n\n===Peer-to-peer===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\n[[Peer-to-peer]] key finders no longer require a separate \"base\"; they are all functionally identical and based on a [[Communications system|communication system]] wherein each device can find all the others individually. The user can, for example, use a [[digital wallet]] to find misplaced [[key (lock)|keys]] and vice versa, or a [[mobile phone]] to find a lost TV remote control or eyeglasses. In addition, since the keyfinders have their own transmitters, they can reply to each other by radio as well as by beeping and flashing a light to attract attention. The seeking unit can then follow this beacon to find even a buried set of keys. Having a transmitter in each unit also means that, unlike second generation units, losing a single transmitter does not result in total loss of the ability to find other items it tracks.\n\n=== Bluetooth low energy beacon ===\n{{expand section|date=August 2019}}\nModern key finders use a [[Bluetooth low energy beacon]]  to broadcast a uniqueID that is picked up by nearby phones running the appropriate software, that is then reported to the manufacturer's website along with the location where they picked up the signal. Even though different manufacturers use the same underlying technology and standards, their apps do not share information with each other, so each manufacturer requires a different app for its devices.\n\nExample of trackers that work this way are [[Chipolo]], ON!Track (by [[Hilti]]), Tick (by [[Milwaukee Electric Tool Corporation]]), [[Tile (company)|Tile]], TrackTag (by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]]), [[TrackR]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toolguyd.com/bosch-tracktag-bluetooth-tool-tracking/|title=Bosch TrackTag, a Bluetooth Tracking Device You Attach to Your Tools|date=2015-09-08|website=ToolGuyd|language=en-US|access-date=2019-10-08}}</ref> and PROTAG.\n\n== Uses ==\n\n=== Typical user experience ===\n{{unreferenced section|date=October 2019}}\nA typical usage is to attach a key finder device to a set of keys, and if these keys are lost or misplaced, to perform an action to initiate the search functionality (such as clapping or pressing a button on the locator device). Modern key finder devices are able to: 1) generate a distinct sound, such as a beep or tone; 2) flash a light, and/or; 3) somehow guide a user toward the lost item.

In Ryder translation, they are: Ill-considered Action, The Loyal Mungoose, The Four Treasure-Seekers, The Lion-Makers, Hundred-Wit Thousand-Wit and Single-Wit, The Musical Donkey, Slow the Weaver, The Brahman's Dream, The Unforgiving Monkey, The Credulous Fiend, The Three-Breasted Princess, The Fiend Who Washed His Feet.<ref name=ryder1/>\n\nOne of the fables in this book is the story about [[The Brahmin and the Mongoose|a woman and a mongoose]]. She leaves her child with a [[mongoose]] friend. When she returns, she sees blood on the mongoose's mouth, and kills the friend, believing the animal killed her child. The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.\n\n==Links with other fables==\nThe fables of ''Panchatantra'' are found in numerous world languages.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character.

They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.\"<ref name=e1965/> Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching {{IAST|dharma}}, or proper moral conduct.<ref>{{citation | last=Falk|first=H. | title=Quellen des Pa\u00f1catantra | year=1978 | pages=173\u2013188}}</ref> Also:<ref>{{citation | year=1996 | title = Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions | author1=Roderick Hindery | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0866-9 | page=166 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&pg=PA166&dq=roguery}}</ref>\n{{quote|On the surface, the Pa\u00f1catantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.

Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, ''Kalila and Dimna,'' became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.\n\nAfter the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull \u201cShanzabeh\", a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.\n\nIbn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE \"re-telling\" (see Francois de Blois' Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book ''Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah'').  The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript).

Some present fables that demonstrate how different characters have different needs and motives, which is subjectively rational from each character's viewpoint, and that addressing these needs can empower peaceful relationships even if they start off in a different way.<ref name=olivellexx/> For example, in the fable ''The Old Man the Young Wife'', the text relates a story wherein an old man marries a young woman from a penniless family.<ref name=ryder341>Arthur William Ryder (1925), [https://archive.org/stream/Panchatantra_Arthur_W_Ryder/Panchatantra%20-%20Arthur%20W%20Ryder#page/n343/mode/2up The Panchatantra], University of Chicago Press, pages 341-343</ref> The young woman detests his appearance so much that she refuses to even look at him let alone consummate their marriage.<ref name=\"Haase2007\"/> One night, while she sleeps in the same bed with her back facing the old man, a thief enters their house.

According to Olivelle, this may be by design where the text's ancient author sought to bring the reader out of the fantasy world of talking and pondering animals into the realities of the human world.<ref name=olivelle155/>\n\nThe fifth book contains twelve fables about hasty actions or jumping to conclusions without establishing facts and proper due diligence. In Ryder translation, they are: Ill-considered Action, The Loyal Mungoose, The Four Treasure-Seekers, The Lion-Makers, Hundred-Wit Thousand-Wit and Single-Wit, The Musical Donkey, Slow the Weaver, The Brahman's Dream, The Unforgiving Monkey, The Credulous Fiend, The Three-Breasted Princess, The Fiend Who Washed His Feet.<ref name=ryder1/>\n\nOne of the fables in this book is the story about [[The Brahmin and the Mongoose|a woman and a mongoose]]. She leaves her child with a [[mongoose]] friend. When she returns, she sees blood on the mongoose's mouth, and kills the friend, believing the animal killed her child. The woman discovers her child alive, and learns that the blood on the mongoose mouth came from it biting the snake while defending her child from the snake's attack. She regrets having killed the friend because of her hasty action.\n\n==Links with other fables==\nThe fables of ''Panchatantra'' are found in numerous world languages. It is also considered partly the origin of European secondary works, such as folk tale motifs found in [[Boccaccio]], [[La Fontaine's Fables|La Fontaine]] and the works of [[Grimm Brothers]].<ref name=meisig157/><ref>Dan Ben-Amos (2010), Introduction: The European Fairy-Tale Tradition between Orality and Literacy, Journal of American Folklore, Volume 123, Number 490, Fall 2010, pp. 373-376</ref> For a while, this had led to the hypothesis that popular worldwide animal-based fables had origins in India and the Middle East.<ref name=meisig157/> According to Max Muller,\n\n{{Quote|\nSanskrit literature is very rich in fables and stories; no other literature can vie with it in that respect; nay, it is extremely likely that fables, in particular animal fables, had their principal source in India.\n|[[Max Muller]]|On the Migration of Fables<ref name=muller10429/>}}\n\nThis monocausal hypothesis has now been generally discarded in favor of polygenetic hypothesis which states that fable motifs had independent origins in many ancient human cultures, some of which have common roots and some influenced by co-sharing of fables.

Indian painting, 1610.]]\n\nIn the Indian tradition, ''The Panchatantra'' is a {{IAST|n\u012bti\u015b\u0101stra}}. ''N\u012bti'' can be roughly translated as \"the wise conduct of life\"<ref name=niti/> and a ''\u015b\u0101stra'' is a technical or scientific treatise; thus it is considered a treatise on political science and human conduct. Its literary sources are \"the expert tradition of political science and the folk and literary traditions of storytelling\". It draws from the [[Dharma]] [[Puru\u1e63\u0101rtha|and]] [[Artha]] ''\u015b\u0101stra''s, quoting them extensively.<ref name=olivelle18/> It is also explained that ''n\u012bti'' \"represents an admirable attempt to answer the insistent question how to win the utmost possible joy from life in the world of men\" and that ''n\u012bti'' is \"the harmonious development of the powers of man, a life in which security, prosperity, resolute action, friendship, and good learning are so combined to produce joy\".<ref name=niti/>\n\n''The Panchatantra'' shares many stories in common with the Buddhist [[Jataka tales]], purportedly told by the historical [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] before his death around 400 BCE. As the scholar Patrick Olivelle writes, \"It is clear that the Buddhists did not invent the stories. [...] It is quite uncertain whether the author of [the Panchatantra] borrowed his stories from the ''J\u0101taka''s or the ''Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata'', or whether he was tapping into a common treasury of tales, both oral and literary, of ancient India.\"<ref name=olivelle18/> Many scholars believe the tales were based on earlier oral folk traditions, which were finally written down, although there is no conclusive evidence.<ref>Bedekar: \"Its probable relation to early folk and oral tradition of storytelling in India has been suggested by many. Rather, it is fashionable to make such statements that 'Panchatantra' and allied Katha literature in India had their origin in early folk stories. However, not a single credible evidence has been produced till this date, other than lengthy discussions on hypothetical assumptions.\"</ref> In the early 20th century, [[W. Norman Brown]] found that many folk tales in India appeared to be borrowed from literary sources and not vice versa.<ref>[[W. Norman Brown|Brown, Norman W.]] 1919. \"'The Panchatantra' in Modern Indian Folklore\", ''Journal of the American Oriental Society,'' Vol 39, pp 1 &17: \"It is doubtless true that in the remote past many stories had their origin among the illiterate folk, often in pre-literary times, and were later taken into literature. It is also just as true that many stories that appear in literature existed there first and are not indebted to the folklore for their origin. But leaving aside questions concerning the early history of Hindu stories and dealing strictly with modern Indian fiction, we find that folklore has frequently taken its material from literature. This process has been so extensive that of the 3000 tales so far reported, all of which have been collected during the past fifty years, at least half can be shown to be derived from literary sources. [...] This table affords considerable evidence in support of the theory that it is the folk tales and not the literary tales that are borrowed.</ref>\n\n[[File:Nalanda Temple 2 ei7-42.jpg|thumb|left|Panchtantra illustration in Nalanda Temple, 7th century CE (Turtle and the Geese)]]\nAn early Western scholar who studied ''The Panchatantra'' was Dr. [[Johannes Hertel]], who thought the book had a [[Machiavelli|Machiavellian]] character.

They glorify shrewdness and practical wisdom, in the affairs of life, and especially of politics, of government.\"<ref name=e1965/> Other scholars dismiss this assessment as one-sided, and view the stories as teaching {{IAST|dharma}}, or proper moral conduct.<ref>{{citation | last=Falk|first=H. | title=Quellen des Pa\u00f1catantra | year=1978 | pages=173\u2013188}}</ref> Also:<ref>{{citation | year=1996 | title = Comparative ethics in Hindu and Buddhist traditions | author1=Roderick Hindery | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. | isbn=978-81-208-0866-9 | page=166 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=-FswBLvTkvQC&pg=PA166&dq=roguery}}</ref>\n{{quote|On the surface, the Pa\u00f1catantra presents stories and sayings which favor the outwitting of roguery, and practical intelligence rather than virtue.

Perhaps because the first section constituted most of the work, or because translators could find no simple equivalent in Zoroastrian Pahlavi for the concept expressed by the Sanskrit word 'Panchatantra', the jackals' names, ''Kalila and Dimna,'' became the generic name for the entire work in classical times.\n\nAfter the first chapter, Ibn al-Muqaffa\u02bf inserted a new one, telling of Dimna's trial. The jackal is suspected of instigating the death of the bull \u201cShanzabeh\", a key character in the first chapter. The trial lasts for two days without conclusion, until a tiger and leopard appear to bear witness against Dimna. He is found guilty and put to death.\n\nIbn al-Muqaffa' inserted other additions and interpretations into his 750CE \"re-telling\" (see Francois de Blois' Burz\u014dy's voyage to India and the origin of the book ''Kal\u012blah wa Dimnah'').  The political theorist Jennifer London suggests that he was expressing risky political views in a metaphorical way. (Al-Muqaffa' was murdered within a few years of completing his manuscript).
