A disputed [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] border was the main cause of the war, but other issues had also played a role. There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], when India granted asylum to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. India initiated a [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War#Forward policy|Forward Policy]] in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the [[McMahon Line]], the eastern portion of the [[Line of Actual Control]] proclaimed by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1959.\n\nUnable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre- (2,000 mile-) long Himalayan border,<ref name=\"Indo-China War of 1962\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |title=Indo-China War of 1962 |website=globalseurity.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235919/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |archivedate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> China launched simultaneous offensives in [[Ladakh]] and across the [[McMahon Line]] on 20 October 1962. Chinese troops outmatched Indian forces in both theatres, capturing [[Rezang La]] in [[Chushul]] in the western theatre, as well as [[Tawang]] in the eastern theatre. The war ended when China declared a [[ceasefire]] on 21 November 1962, and simultaneously announced its withdrawal to its claimed 'Line of Actual Control'.\n\nMuch of the fighting took place in harsh [[mountain warfare|mountain conditions]], entailing large-scale combat at altitudes of over 4,000 metres (14,000 feet).<ref name=\"Calvin\">{{cite web |last=Calvin |first=James Barnard |date=April 1984 |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |title=The China-India Border War |publisher=Marine Corps Command and Staff College |accessdate=15 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111000325/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/CJB.htm |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Sino-Indian War was also noted for the lack of deployment of [[Navy|naval]] and [[Air force|aerial]] assets by both China and India.\n\nAs the [[Sino-Soviet split]] heated up, the [[Soviet Union]] ramped up its efforts to support India, especially with the sale of advanced [[Russian Aircraft Corporation MiG|MiG]] fighter aircraft. Initially, India had not accepted major offers of Soviet hardware, with Nehru fearing it would lead to heavy reliance on imported weapons for defence, but with major weapons being delivered to [[Pakistan]] by countries of the [[Western Bloc]], and in particular refusal by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to sell advanced weaponry to India because of the political climate (India's inclination towards the Soviets), caused it to turn to the Soviet Union for military hardware.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chari | first1 = P.R. | year = 1979 | title = Indo-Soviet Military Cooperation: A Review | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013244 | jstor = 2643691 | doi = 10.1525/as.1979.19.3.01p0028w }}</ref> It was the first war between China and India and the latter's second armed conflict in the span of less than a year following the [[Annexation of Goa|Indian invasion and annexation of Portuguese Goa]]. After the end of the war, both sides kept forward armed positions and a number of small clashes broke out, but no large-scale fighting ensued.\n\n==Location==\n[[Image:British Indian Empire 1909 Imperial Gazetteer of India.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-Simla British map published in 1909 shows the so-called \"Outer Line\" as India's northern boundary.]]\n[[File:Postal Map of China ,1917.jpg|thumb|right|Postal Map of China published by the Government of China in 1917]]\nChina and India shared a long border, sectioned into three stretches by [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]] (then an Indian [[protectorate]]), and [[Bhutan]], which follows the [[Himalayas]] between [[Burma]] and what was then [[West Pakistan]]. A number of disputed regions lie along this border. At its western end is the [[Aksai Chin]] region, an area the size of [[Switzerland]], that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]] (which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965). The eastern border, between Burma and Bhutan, comprises the present Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North East Frontier Agency|North-East Frontier Agency]]). Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict.\n\nMost combat took place at high altitudes. The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) above sea level, and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding 7,000 metres (23,000 feet). The [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Chinese Army]] had possession of one of the highest ridges in the regions. The high altitude and freezing conditions also caused logistical and welfare difficulties; in past similar conflicts (such as the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War I]]) harsh conditions have caused more casualties than have enemy actions. The Sino-Indian War was no different, with many troops on both sides succumbing to the freezing cold temperatures.<ref name=\"Chushul\"/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|China\u2013India relations|Sino-Indian border dispute}}\n\nThe main cause of the war was a dispute over the [[sovereignty]] of the widely separated [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to [[Kashmir]] and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\n===Aksai Chin===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin}}\n[[Image:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional borders of Jammu and Kashmir (CIA map).

The border preferred by British Indian Empire, shown in two-toned purple and pink, included the [[Aksai Chin]] and narrowed down to the [[Yarkand River]].]]\n\nThe western portion of the Sino-Indian boundary originated in 1834, with the conquest of [[Ladakh]] by the armies of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the [[Sikh Empire]]. Following an [[Sino-Sikh War|unsuccessful campaign]] into Tibet, Gulab Singh and the Tibetans signed a [[Treaty of Chushul|treaty in 1842]] agreeing to stick to the \"old, established frontiers\", which were left unspecified.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=24}}<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P.

British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border, who did not show any interest.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=25\u201326}} The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern end of the boundary at [[Pangong Lake]], but regarded the area north of it till the [[Karakoram Pass]] as ''terra incognita''.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=26}}\n\nThe Maharaja of Kashmir and his officials were keenly aware of the trade routes from Ladakh. Starting from [[Leh]], there were two main routes into Central Asia: one passed through the [[Karakoram Pass]] to [[Shahidulla]] at the foot of the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and went on to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through the Kilian and Sanju passes; the other went east via the [[Chang Chenmo Valley]], passed the [[Lingzi Tang Plains]] in the Aksai Chin region, and followed the course of the [[Karakash River]] to join the first route at Shahidulla.{{sfn|Warikoo, India's gateway to Central Asia|2009|pp=1\u20132}} The Maharaja regarded Shahidulla as his northern outpost, in effect treating the Kunlun mountains as the boundary of his domains. His British suzerains were sceptical of such an extended boundary because Shahidulla was 79 miles away from the Karakoram pass and the intervening area was uninhabited. Nevertheless, the Maharaja was allowed to treat Shahidulla as his outpost for more than 20 years.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"Shahidulla was occupied by the Dogras almost from the time they conquered Ladakh.\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48}} quotes a report by [[Ney Elias]] in 1885: \"He [the Wazir] wants the Maharaja to re-occupy Shahidulla in the Karakash valley. Previous to the rebellions in Eastern Turkistan which broke up Chinese rule there in 1863, the Kashmiris had occupied Shahidulla for nearly 20 years. About 1865 they abandoned it, and in 1868 Shaw and Hayward found it occupied by the Andijani (Kokandi) troops of the late Amir Yakub Beg. In 1873\u201374 Sir D. Forsyth recognised the Amir\u2019s ownership, and recommended the Maharaja\u2019s boundary to be drawn to the north of the Karakash valley as shown in the map accompanying the mission report. This I believe has never been accepted by Kashmir, and the boundary has been left an open question.\"}}{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48,&nbsp;83}}: An India Office (London) memorandum in 1893 stated: \"Shahidulla has hitherto been regarded as the frontier post on the road from Leh to Yarkand. Lord Kimberley the secretary of state would suggest that the Chinese Government at Peking ... should be intimated...that the Indian authorities, acting on behalf of the Kashmir State, will gladly co-operate with the Chinese authorities in Kashgaria in determining the frontier on the road from Leh to Kashgar. Her Majesty\u2019s Government would, however, demur to any attempt being made by the Kashgarian officials to fix the boundary of the Ladakh State on this road without their previous concurrence being obtained.\"}}\n\n[[File:Johnson-journey-ilchi1865-mapa.jpg|thumb|left|[[W.

The boundary, marked with a thin dot-dashed line, agrees with the 1878 British map.]]\nChinese Turkestan regarded the \"northern branch\" of the Kunlun range with the Kilian and Sanju passes as its southern boundary. Thus the Maharaja's claim was uncontested.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"The southern frontier of Chinese Turkestan was similarly undefined... the Chinese 'considered the Kuen-lun mountains (i.e. the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju passes) as their frontier'...\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=58}} quotes Captain [[Francis Younghusband|Younghusband]]'s report of 1889: \"In the former Chinese occupation the Kuen-Lun Mountains (that is the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju Passes) were always recognised as the frontier, and the country to the south belonged to no one in particular. When the Chinese revolt took place and they were driven from Yarkand, the Kashmir State sent a detachment of troops to Shahidullah and built a fort there. Yakub Beg when he came into power at Yarkand sent some troops, who built a fort at Ali Nazar on the Karakash River at the junction of the roads from the Kilian and Sanju Passes. Shortly afterwards the Kashmiris evacuated the Shahidullah fort after occupying it for about three years, and the Andijanis then took possession of it and occupied it till Yakub Beg's death.\"}} After the 1862 [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]], which saw the expulsion of the Chinese from Turkestan, the Maharaja of Kashmir constructed a small fort at Shahidulla in 1864. The fort was most likely supplied from [[Khotan]], whose ruler was now independent and on friendly terms with Kashmir. When the Khotanese ruler was deposed by the Kashgaria strongman [[Yakub Beg]], the Maharaja was forced to abandon his post in 1867. It was then occupied by Yakub Beg's forces until the end of the Dungan Revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Van Eekelen, Indian Foreign Policy and the Border Dispute|2013|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Palit, War in High Himalaya|1991|p=29}}</ref>\nIn the intervening period, [[W. H. Johnson]] of [[Survey of India]] was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. While in the course of his work, he was \"invited\" by the Khotanese ruler to visit his capital. After returning, Johnson noted that Khotan's border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire the [[Karakash River|Karakash Valley]] was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the [[Lanak La|eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley]] along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the \"[[Johnson Line (boundary)|Johnson Line]]\" (or \"Ardagh-Johnson Line\").{{sfn|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=116}}{{efn|Some commentators state that Johnson's work was \"severely criticised\" as inaccurate. His boundary line was described as \"patently absurd\", and extending further north than the Indian claim. Johnson is said to have been reprimanded by the British Government for crossing into Khotan without permission and he resigned from the Survey.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"Noorani\"/> Others state that Johnson's bold explorations were highly commended, and he was rehired a year later at a higher salary. The \"invitation\" from the Khotanese ruler was likely a forcible removal, and the ruler was merely seeking British help in warding off Yakub Beg and the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Mehra, John Lall (Book review)|1991|p=149}}}}\n\nAfter the Chinese reconquered Turkestan in 1878, renaming it [[Xinjiang]], they again reverted to their traditional boundary. By now, the Russian Empire was entrenched in Central Asia, and the British were anxious to avoid a common border with the Russians. After creating the [[Wakhan corridor]] as the buffer in the northwest of Kashmir, they wanted the Chinese to fill out the \"no man's land\" between the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. Under British (and possibly Russian) encouragement, the Chinese occupied the area up to the [[Yarkand River]] valley (called [[Raskam]]), including Shahidulla, by 1890.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=65\u201366}} They also erected a boundary pillar at the Karakoram pass by about 1892.<ref>{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=73}}; {{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=63}}</ref> These efforts appear half-hearted. A map provided by Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at [[St. Petersburgh]], in 1893 showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Johnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.<ref>{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=73,&nbsp;78}}: \"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\"</ref>\n\nBy 1892, the British settled on the policy that their preferred boundary for Kashmir was the \"Indus watershed\", i.e., the water-parting from which waters flow into the Indus river system on one side and into the Tarim basin on the other. In the north, this water-parting was along the Karakoram range. In the east, it was more complicated because the [[Chip Chap River]], [[Galwan River]] and the [[Chang Chenmo River]] flow into the Indus whereas the [[Karakash River]] flows into the Tarim basin.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=52\u201353,&nbsp;60,&nbsp;69,&nbsp;72}} A boundary alignment along this water-parting was defined by the Viceroy [[Lord Elgin]] and communicated to London. The British government in due course proposed it to China via its envoy Sir [[Claude MacDonald]] in 1899. This boundary, which came to be called the [[Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line]], ceded to China the Aksai Chin plains in the northeast, and the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in the north. In return, the British wanted China to cede its 'shadowy suzerainty' on [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]].{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=114\u2013115}}{{efn|The so-called Macartney-MacDonald proposal was precipitated by the crisis over [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], which was theoretically a vassal state of both China and Kashmir. In 1890, the British invaded Hunza and replaced its ruler, and the Chinese remonstrated. The British wanted the Chinese to cede their suzerainty over Hunza and yet grant rights to cultivate lands outside its boundary. In return for this largesse, they were prepared to cede the Aksai Chin plains, but not Lingzi Tang plains, to China.

Graham, [[North-East Frontier Agency|NEFA]] official, which included the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. Thus, in the last half of the 19th century, it was clear that the British treated the Tawang Tract as part of Tibet. This boundary was confirmed in a 1 June 1912 note from the British General Staff in India, stating that the \"present boundary (demarcated) is south of Tawang, running westwards along the foothills from near Ugalguri to the southern Bhutanese border.\"<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> A 1908 map of The Province of Eastern Bengal and Assam prepared for the Foreign Department of the Government of India, showed the international boundary from Bhutan continuing to the Baroi River, following the Himalayas foothill alignment.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1913, representatives of the UK, China and Tibet attended a conference in [[Shimla|Simla]] regarding the borders between Tibet, China and British India.

The details of the Indo-Tibetan boundary was not revealed to China at the time.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> The foreign secretary of the British Indian government, [[Henry McMahon]], who had drawn up the proposal, decided to bypass the Chinese (although instructed not to by his superiors) and settle the border bilaterally by negotiating directly with Tibet.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> According to later Indian claims, this border was intended to run through the highest ridges of the [[Himalayas]], as the areas south of the Himalayas were traditionally Indian.<ref name=\"VKSingh\">{{cite web |url=http://www.india-seminar.com/2006/562/562-vk-singh.htm |title=562 V.K.

There was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet\". The other was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border\". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China's going to war. He argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be \"substantially accurate\".<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nThe CIA's declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war. According to this document, \"Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration&nbsp;\u2014 their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground\". In general terms, they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military \"reoccupation\" policy.  Secondary reasons for the attack were to damage Nehru's prestige by exposing Indian weakness and<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/> to expose as traitorous Khrushchev's policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nAnother factor which might have affected China's decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet-U.S.-India encirclement and isolation of China.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> India's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and United States were both strong at this time, but the Soviets (and Americans) were preoccupied by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and would not interfere with the Sino-Indian War.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> P. B. Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement. Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola, and China's buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October, the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Another explanation is that the confrontation in the Taiwan Strait had eased by then.\n\nGarver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies, particularly the Forward Policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China's decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans \"to attribute others' behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors\". Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nNeville Maxwell and [[Allen S. Whiting (political scientist)|Allen Whiting]] argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese, and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances, and regarded the Forward Policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> Mao Zedong himself compared the Forward Policy to a strategic advance in [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]]:\n\n{{quote|Their [India's] continually pushing forward is like crossing the [[Xiangqi#Board|Chu Han boundary]]. What should we do? We can also set out a few pawns, on our side of the river. If they don't then cross over, that\u2019s great. If they do cross, we'll eat them up [chess metaphor meaning to take the opponent's pieces]. Of course, we cannot blindly eat them. Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. We must pay attention to the situation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>}}\n\nIndia claims that the motive for the Forward Policy was to cut off the supply routes for Chinese troops posted in NEFA and Aksai Chin.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> According to the official Indian history, the forward policy was continued because of its initial success, as it claimed that Chinese troops withdrew when they encountered areas already occupied by Indian troops. It also claimed that the Forward Policy was having success in cutting out supply lines of Chinese troops who had advanced South of the McMahon Line, though there was no evidence of such advance before the 1962 war. The Forward Policy rested on the assumption that Chinese forces \"were not likely to use force against any of our posts, even if they were in a position to do so\". No serious re-appraisal of this policy took place even when Chinese forces ceased withdrawing.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Nehru's confidence was probably justified given the difficulty for China to supply the area over the high altitude terrain over 5000&nbsp;km (3000 miles) from the more populated areas of China.\n\nChinese policy toward India, therefore, operated on two seemingly contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961. On the one hand, the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope, although a shrinking one, that some opening for talks would appear. On the other hand, they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal. Regarding the hope, they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude. Regarding Indian intentions, they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism; for this reason he opposed border talks.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nKrishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos, Chinese officials in Chen Yi's delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him. At several private\nmeetings with Menon, Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first. He did not, as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative, leaving the Chinese with the impression\nthat Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nIn September, the Chinese took a step toward criticising Nehru openly in their commentary. After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name, the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism (People's Daily Editorial, 9 September): \"Somebody at the Non-Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead...contrary to facts.\" This was a distortion of Nehru's remarks but appeared close enough to be credible. On the same day, Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception: \"Those who attempted to deny history, ignore reality, and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated.\" On 10 September, they dropped all circumlocutions and criticised him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report\u2014the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nBy early 1962, the Chinese leadership began to believe that India's intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war.<ref name = \"Garver\"/><ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1961, the Indian army had been sent into [[Goa]], a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after [[Portugal]] refused to surrender the [[exclave]] [[colony]] to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it as an example of India's expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India's Home Minister declared, \"If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat [[Invasion of Goa|what it did in Goa]]. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces\",<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, \"India will take steps to end [Chinese] aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa\".<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as [[Delhi]] increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines.<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> Foreign Minister [[Chen Yi (communist)|Marshal Chen Yi]] commented at one high-level meeting, \"Nehru's forward policy is a knife.

This was further triggered by [[Mao Zedong]]'s views that: \"The way to world conquest lies through Havana, Accra, and Calcutta\". Calvin believes that Chinese actions show a \"pattern of conservative aims and limited objectives, rather than expansionism\" and blames this particular conflict on India's provocations towards China. Calvin also expresses that China, in the past, has been adamant to gain control over regions to which it has a \"traditional claim\", which triggered the dispute over NEFA and [[Aksai Chin]] and indeed [[Tibet]]. Calvin's assumption, based on the history of the Cold War and the Domino Effect, assumed that China might ultimately try to regain control of everything that it considers as \"traditionally Chinese\" which in its view includes the entirety of South East Asia.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nThe [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration was disturbed by what they considered \"blatant Chinese communist aggression against India\".

[[Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] and General [[Maxwell Taylor]] advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. McNamara stated \"Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given, we should recognise that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack, we would have to use nuclear weapons.

These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] during most of the Sino-Indian War). The U.S. nonetheless provided non-combat assistance to Indian forces and planned to send the carrier [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']] to the Bay of Bengal to support India in case of an air war.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-untold-story-how-the-us-came-to-indias-aid-in-1962/20121204.htm The Untold Story: How Kennedy came to India's aid in 1962] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221734/http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-untold-story-how-the-us-came-to-indias-aid-in-1962/20121204.htm |date=17 December 2013 }}, Rediff News, 4 December 2012.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Sino-Soviet split]] heated up, Moscow made a major effort to support India, especially with the sale of advanced Mig warplanes.

According to P.R.

Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably, the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru's foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of \"brotherhood\". Because of India's inability to anticipate Chinese aggression, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] faced harsh criticism from government officials, for having promoted pacifist relations with China.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> Indian President [[Radhakrishnan]] said that Nehru's government was naive and negligent about preparations, and Nehru admitted his failings.<ref name=BlackNovember /> According to Inder Malhotra, a former editor of ''The Times of India'' and a commentator for ''The Indian Express'', Indian politicians invested more effort in removing Defence Minister [[Krishna Menon]] than in actually waging war.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\" /> Krishna Menon's favoritism weakened the Indian Army, and national morale dimmed.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> The public saw the war as a political and military debacle.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> Under American advice (by American envoy [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |title=Whoever has seen Aksai Chin, as I have, would want someone else to have it |newspaper=Indian Express |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307023311/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |archivedate=7 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) Indians refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the [[Indian air force]] to beat back the Chinese advances.

Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question the once popular \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\").

The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments; by asking for help during the war, India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors.

There had been a series of violent border skirmishes between the two countries after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]], when India granted asylum to the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]]. India initiated a [[Events leading to the Sino-Indian War#Forward policy|Forward Policy]] in which it placed outposts along the border, including several north of the [[McMahon Line]], the eastern portion of the [[Line of Actual Control]] proclaimed by [[Premier of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Premier]] [[Zhou Enlai]] in 1959.\n\nUnable to reach political accommodation on disputed territory along the 3,225 kilometre- (2,000 mile-) long Himalayan border,<ref name=\"Indo-China War of 1962\">{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |title=Indo-China War of 1962 |website=globalseurity.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713235919/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/indo-prc_1962.htm |archivedate=13 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> China launched simultaneous offensives in [[Ladakh]] and across the [[McMahon Line]] on 20 October 1962.

Initially, India had not accepted major offers of Soviet hardware, with Nehru fearing it would lead to heavy reliance on imported weapons for defence, but with major weapons being delivered to [[Pakistan]] by countries of the [[Western Bloc]], and in particular refusal by the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to sell advanced weaponry to India because of the political climate (India's inclination towards the Soviets), caused it to turn to the Soviet Union for military hardware.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Chari | first1 = P.R. | year = 1979 | title = Indo-Soviet Military Cooperation: A Review | journal = Asian Survey | volume = 19 | issue = 3| pages = 230\u2013244 | jstor = 2643691 | doi = 10.1525/as.1979.19.3.01p0028w }}</ref> It was the first war between China and India and the latter's second armed conflict in the span of less than a year following the [[Annexation of Goa|Indian invasion and annexation of Portuguese Goa]].

A number of disputed regions lie along this border. At its western end is the [[Aksai Chin]] region, an area the size of [[Switzerland]], that sits between the Chinese autonomous region of [[Xinjiang]] and [[Tibet]] (which China declared as an autonomous region in 1965). The eastern border, between Burma and Bhutan, comprises the present Indian state of [[Arunachal Pradesh]] (formerly the [[North East Frontier Agency|North-East Frontier Agency]]). Both of these regions were overrun by China in the 1962 conflict.\n\nMost combat took place at high altitudes. The Aksai Chin region is a desert of salt flats around 5,000 metres (16,000 feet) above sea level, and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] is mountainous with a number of peaks exceeding 7,000 metres (23,000 feet). The [[People's Liberation Army Ground Force|Chinese Army]] had possession of one of the highest ridges in the regions. The high altitude and freezing conditions also caused logistical and welfare difficulties; in past similar conflicts (such as the [[Italian Campaign (World War I)|Italian Campaign]] of [[World War I]]) harsh conditions have caused more casualties than have enemy actions. The Sino-Indian War was no different, with many troops on both sides succumbing to the freezing cold temperatures.<ref name=\"Chushul\"/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n==Background==\n{{Main|China\u2013India relations|Sino-Indian border dispute}}\n\nThe main cause of the war was a dispute over the [[sovereignty]] of the widely separated [[Aksai Chin]] and [[Arunachal Pradesh]] border regions. Aksai Chin, claimed by India to belong to [[Kashmir]] and by China to be part of Xinjiang, contains an important road link that connects the Chinese regions of Tibet and Xinjiang. China's construction of this road was one of the triggers of the conflict.\n\n===Aksai Chin===\n{{Main|Aksai Chin}}\n[[Image:Kashmir map big.jpg|thumb|left|Traditional borders of Jammu and Kashmir (CIA map).

The border preferred by British Indian Empire, shown in two-toned purple and pink, included the [[Aksai Chin]] and narrowed down to the [[Yarkand River]].]]\n\nThe western portion of the Sino-Indian boundary originated in 1834, with the conquest of [[Ladakh]] by the armies of Raja [[Gulab Singh]] (Dogra) under the suzerainty of the [[Sikh Empire]]. Following an [[Sino-Sikh War|unsuccessful campaign]] into Tibet, Gulab Singh and the Tibetans signed a [[Treaty of Chushul|treaty in 1842]] agreeing to stick to the \"old, established frontiers\", which were left unspecified.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=24}}<ref name=\"Rubin\">The Sino-Indian Border Disputes, by Alfred P.

British commissioners contacted Chinese officials to negotiate the border, who did not show any interest.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=25\u201326}} The British boundary commissioners fixed the southern end of the boundary at [[Pangong Lake]], but regarded the area north of it till the [[Karakoram Pass]] as ''terra incognita''.{{sfn|Maxwell, India's China War|1970|p=26}}\n\nThe Maharaja of Kashmir and his officials were keenly aware of the trade routes from Ladakh. Starting from [[Leh]], there were two main routes into Central Asia: one passed through the [[Karakoram Pass]] to [[Shahidulla]] at the foot of the [[Kunlun Mountains]] and went on to [[Yarkant County|Yarkand]] through the Kilian and Sanju passes; the other went east via the [[Chang Chenmo Valley]], passed the [[Lingzi Tang Plains]] in the Aksai Chin region, and followed the course of the [[Karakash River]] to join the first route at Shahidulla.{{sfn|Warikoo, India's gateway to Central Asia|2009|pp=1\u20132}} The Maharaja regarded Shahidulla as his northern outpost, in effect treating the Kunlun mountains as the boundary of his domains. His British suzerains were sceptical of such an extended boundary because Shahidulla was 79 miles away from the Karakoram pass and the intervening area was uninhabited. Nevertheless, the Maharaja was allowed to treat Shahidulla as his outpost for more than 20 years.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"Shahidulla was occupied by the Dogras almost from the time they conquered Ladakh.\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=48}} quotes a report by [[Ney Elias]] in 1885: \"He [the Wazir] wants the Maharaja to re-occupy Shahidulla in the Karakash valley. Previous to the rebellions in Eastern Turkistan which broke up Chinese rule there in 1863, the Kashmiris had occupied Shahidulla for nearly 20 years. About 1865 they abandoned it, and in 1868 Shaw and Hayward found it occupied by the Andijani (Kokandi) troops of the late Amir Yakub Beg. In 1873\u201374 Sir D. Forsyth recognised the Amir\u2019s ownership, and recommended the Maharaja\u2019s boundary to be drawn to the north of the Karakash valley as shown in the map accompanying the mission report.

Thus the Maharaja's claim was uncontested.<ref>{{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=57}}: \"The southern frontier of Chinese Turkestan was similarly undefined... the Chinese 'considered the Kuen-lun mountains (i.e. the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju passes) as their frontier'...\"</ref>{{efn|{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=58}} quotes Captain [[Francis Younghusband|Younghusband]]'s report of 1889: \"In the former Chinese occupation the Kuen-Lun Mountains (that is the branch of them over which are the Kilian and Sanju Passes) were always recognised as the frontier, and the country to the south belonged to no one in particular. When the Chinese revolt took place and they were driven from Yarkand, the Kashmir State sent a detachment of troops to Shahidullah and built a fort there. Yakub Beg when he came into power at Yarkand sent some troops, who built a fort at Ali Nazar on the Karakash River at the junction of the roads from the Kilian and Sanju Passes. Shortly afterwards the Kashmiris evacuated the Shahidullah fort after occupying it for about three years, and the Andijanis then took possession of it and occupied it till Yakub Beg's death.\"}} After the 1862 [[Dungan Revolt (1862\u201377)|Dungan Revolt]], which saw the expulsion of the Chinese from Turkestan, the Maharaja of Kashmir constructed a small fort at Shahidulla in 1864. The fort was most likely supplied from [[Khotan]], whose ruler was now independent and on friendly terms with Kashmir. When the Khotanese ruler was deposed by the Kashgaria strongman [[Yakub Beg]], the Maharaja was forced to abandon his post in 1867. It was then occupied by Yakub Beg's forces until the end of the Dungan Revolt.<ref>{{harvnb|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=48}}; {{harvnb|Van Eekelen, Indian Foreign Policy and the Border Dispute|2013|p=160}}; {{harvnb|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=65}}; {{harvnb|Palit, War in High Himalaya|1991|p=29}}</ref>\nIn the intervening period, [[W. H. Johnson]] of [[Survey of India]] was commissioned to survey the Aksai Chin region. While in the course of his work, he was \"invited\" by the Khotanese ruler to visit his capital. After returning, Johnson noted that Khotan's border was at Brinjga, in the Kunlun mountains, and the entire the [[Karakash River|Karakash Valley]] was within the territory of Kashmir. The boundary of Kashmir that he drew, stretching from Sanju Pass to the [[Lanak La|eastern edge of Chang Chenmo Valley]] along the Kunlun mountains, is referred to as the \"[[Johnson Line (boundary)|Johnson Line]]\" (or \"Ardagh-Johnson Line\").{{sfn|Fisher, Rose & Huttenback, Himalayan Battleground|1963|p=116}}{{efn|Some commentators state that Johnson's work was \"severely criticised\" as inaccurate. His boundary line was described as \"patently absurd\", and extending further north than the Indian claim. Johnson is said to have been reprimanded by the British Government for crossing into Khotan without permission and he resigned from the Survey.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/><ref name=\"Noorani\"/> Others state that Johnson's bold explorations were highly commended, and he was rehired a year later at a higher salary. The \"invitation\" from the Khotanese ruler was likely a forcible removal, and the ruler was merely seeking British help in warding off Yakub Beg and the Russian Empire.{{sfn|Mehra, John Lall (Book review)|1991|p=149}}}}\n\nAfter the Chinese reconquered Turkestan in 1878, renaming it [[Xinjiang]], they again reverted to their traditional boundary. By now, the Russian Empire was entrenched in Central Asia, and the British were anxious to avoid a common border with the Russians. After creating the [[Wakhan corridor]] as the buffer in the northwest of Kashmir, they wanted the Chinese to fill out the \"no man's land\" between the Karakoram and Kunlun ranges. Under British (and possibly Russian) encouragement, the Chinese occupied the area up to the [[Yarkand River]] valley (called [[Raskam]]), including Shahidulla, by 1890.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=65\u201366}} They also erected a boundary pillar at the Karakoram pass by about 1892.<ref>{{harvp|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|p=73}}; {{harvp|Mehra, An \"agreed\" frontier|1992|p=63}}</ref> These efforts appear half-hearted. A map provided by Hung Ta-chen, a senior Chinese official at [[St. Petersburgh]], in 1893 showed the boundary of Xinjiang up to Raskam. In the east, it was similar to the Johnson line, placing Aksai Chin in Kashmir territory.<ref>{{harvp|Woodman, Himalayan Frontiers|1970|pp=73,&nbsp;78}}: \"Clarke added that a Chinese map drawn by Hung Ta-chen, Minister in St. Petersburg, confirmed the Johnson alignment showing West Aksai Chin as within British (Kashmir) territory.\"</ref>\n\nBy 1892, the British settled on the policy that their preferred boundary for Kashmir was the \"Indus watershed\", i.e., the water-parting from which waters flow into the Indus river system on one side and into the Tarim basin on the other. In the north, this water-parting was along the Karakoram range. In the east, it was more complicated because the [[Chip Chap River]], [[Galwan River]] and the [[Chang Chenmo River]] flow into the Indus whereas the [[Karakash River]] flows into the Tarim basin.{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=52\u201353,&nbsp;60,&nbsp;69,&nbsp;72}} A boundary alignment along this water-parting was defined by the Viceroy [[Lord Elgin]] and communicated to London. The British government in due course proposed it to China via its envoy Sir [[Claude MacDonald]] in 1899. This boundary, which came to be called the [[Macartney\u2013MacDonald Line]], ceded to China the Aksai Chin plains in the northeast, and the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]] in the north. In return, the British wanted China to cede its 'shadowy suzerainty' on [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]].{{sfn|Noorani, India\u2013China Boundary Problem|2010|pp=114\u2013115}}{{efn|The so-called Macartney-MacDonald proposal was precipitated by the crisis over [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]], which was theoretically a vassal state of both China and Kashmir. In 1890, the British invaded Hunza and replaced its ruler, and the Chinese remonstrated. The British wanted the Chinese to cede their suzerainty over Hunza and yet grant rights to cultivate lands outside its boundary. In return for this largesse, they were prepared to cede the Aksai Chin plains, but not Lingzi Tang plains, to China.

Indian troops marching to Thag La had suffered in the previously unexperienced conditions; two [[Gurkha]] soldiers died of [[pulmonary edema]].<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/>\n\nOn 10 October, an Indian [[Rajput]] patrol of 50 troops to Yumtso La were met by an emplaced Chinese position of some 1,000 soldiers.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> Indian troops were in no position for battle, as Yumtso La was 16,000 feet (4,900 m) above sea level and Kaul did not plan on having artillery support for the troops.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/> The Chinese troops opened fire on the Indians under their belief that they were north of the McMahon Line. The Indians were surrounded by Chinese positions which used [[mortar fire]]. They managed to hold off the first Chinese assault, inflicting heavy casualties.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nAt this point, the Indian troops were in a position to push the Chinese back with mortar and machine gun fire. Brigadier Dalvi opted not to fire, as it would mean decimating the [[Rajput]] who were still in the area of the Chinese regrouping. They helplessly watched the Chinese ready themselves for a second assault.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/> In the second Chinese assault, the Indians began their retreat, realising the situation was hopeless. The Indian patrol suffered 25 casualties, and the Chinese 33. The Chinese troops held their fire as the Indians retreated, and then buried the Indian dead with military honours, as witnessed by the retreating soldiers. This was the first occurrence of heavy fighting in the war.<ref name=\"Calvin\" />\n\nThis attack had grave implications for India and Nehru tried to solve the issue, but by 18 October, it was clear that the Chinese were preparing for an attack, with a massive troop buildup.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> A long line of mules and porters had also been observed supporting the buildup and reinforcement of positions south of the Thag La Ridge.<ref name=\"NamkaChu\"/>\n\n==Chinese and Indian preparations==\n\n===Chinese motives===\nTwo of the major factors leading up to China's eventual conflicts with Indian troops were India's stance on the disputed borders and perceived Indian subversion in [[Tibet]]. There was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian efforts to undermine Chinese control of Tibet, Indian efforts which were perceived as having the objective of restoring the pre-1949 status quo ante of Tibet\". The other was \"a perceived need to punish and end perceived Indian aggression against Chinese territory along the border\". John W. Garver argues that the first perception was incorrect based on the state of the Indian military and polity in the 1960s. It was, nevertheless a major reason for China's going to war. He argues the Chinese perception of Indian aggression to be \"substantially accurate\".<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nThe CIA's declassified POLO documents reveal contemporary American analysis of Chinese motives during the war. According to this document, \"Chinese apparently were motivated to attack by one primary consideration&nbsp;\u2014 their determination to retain the ground on which PLA forces stood in 1962 and to punish the Indians for trying to take that ground\". In general terms, they tried to show the Indians once and for all that China would not acquiesce in a military \"reoccupation\" policy.  Secondary reasons for the attack were to damage Nehru's prestige by exposing Indian weakness and<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/> to expose as traitorous Khrushchev's policy of supporting Nehru against a Communist country.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nAnother factor which might have affected China's decision for war with India was a perceived need to stop a Soviet-U.S.-India encirclement and isolation of China.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> India's relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and United States were both strong at this time, but the Soviets (and Americans) were preoccupied by the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and would not interfere with the Sino-Indian War.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> P. B. Sinha suggests that China waited until October to attack because the timing of the war was exactly in parallel with American actions so as to avoid any chance of American or Soviet involvement. Although American buildup of forces around Cuba occurred on the same day as the first major clash at Dhola, and China's buildup between 10 and 20 October appeared to coincide exactly with the United States establishment of a blockade against Cuba which began 20 October, the Chinese probably prepared for this before they could anticipate what would happen in Cuba.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Another explanation is that the confrontation in the Taiwan Strait had eased by then.\n\nGarver argues that the Chinese correctly assessed Indian border policies, particularly the Forward Policy, as attempts for incremental seizure of Chinese-controlled territory. On Tibet, Garver argues that one of the major factors leading to China's decision for war with India was a common tendency of humans \"to attribute others' behavior to interior motivations, while attributing their own behavior to situational factors\". Studies from China published in the 1990s confirmed that the root cause for China going to war with India was the perceived Indian aggression in Tibet, with the forward policy simply catalysing the Chinese reaction.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>\n\nNeville Maxwell and [[Allen S. Whiting (political scientist)|Allen Whiting]] argue that the Chinese leadership believed they were defending territory that was legitimately Chinese, and which was already under de facto Chinese occupation prior to Indian advances, and regarded the Forward Policy as an Indian attempt at creeping annexation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/> Mao Zedong himself compared the Forward Policy to a strategic advance in [[Xiangqi|Chinese chess]]:\n\n{{quote|Their [India's] continually pushing forward is like crossing the [[Xiangqi#Board|Chu Han boundary]]. What should we do? We can also set out a few pawns, on our side of the river. If they don't then cross over, that\u2019s great. If they do cross, we'll eat them up [chess metaphor meaning to take the opponent's pieces]. Of course, we cannot blindly eat them. Lack of forbearance in small matters upsets great plans. We must pay attention to the situation.<ref name=\"Garver\"/>}}\n\nIndia claims that the motive for the Forward Policy was to cut off the supply routes for Chinese troops posted in NEFA and Aksai Chin.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> According to the official Indian history, the forward policy was continued because of its initial success, as it claimed that Chinese troops withdrew when they encountered areas already occupied by Indian troops. It also claimed that the Forward Policy was having success in cutting out supply lines of Chinese troops who had advanced South of the McMahon Line, though there was no evidence of such advance before the 1962 war. The Forward Policy rested on the assumption that Chinese forces \"were not likely to use force against any of our posts, even if they were in a position to do so\". No serious re-appraisal of this policy took place even when Chinese forces ceased withdrawing.<ref name=\"officialhistory\"/> Nehru's confidence was probably justified given the difficulty for China to supply the area over the high altitude terrain over 5000&nbsp;km (3000 miles) from the more populated areas of China.\n\nChinese policy toward India, therefore, operated on two seemingly contradictory assumptions in the first half of 1961. On the one hand, the Chinese leaders continued to entertain a hope, although a shrinking one, that some opening for talks would appear. On the other hand, they read Indian statements and actions as clear signs that Nehru wanted to talk only about a Chinese withdrawal. Regarding the hope, they were willing to negotiate and tried to prod Nehru into a similar attitude. Regarding Indian intentions, they began to act politically and to build a rationale based on the assumption that Nehru already had become a lackey of imperialism; for this reason he opposed border talks.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nKrishna Menon is reported to have said that when he arrived in Geneva on 6 June 1961 for an international conference in Laos, Chinese officials in Chen Yi's delegation indicated that Chen might be interested in discussing the border dispute with him. At several private\nmeetings with Menon, Chen avoided any discussion of the dispute and Menon surmised that the Chinese wanted him to broach the matter first. He did not, as he was under instructions from Nehru to avoid taking the initiative, leaving the Chinese with the impression\nthat Nehru was unwilling to show any flexibility.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nIn September, the Chinese took a step toward criticising Nehru openly in their commentary. After citing Indonesian and Burmese press criticism of Nehru by name, the Chinese critiqued his moderate remarks on colonialism (People's Daily Editorial, 9 September): \"Somebody at the Non-Aligned Nations Conference advanced the argument that the era of classical colonialism is gone and dead...contrary to facts.\" This was a distortion of Nehru's remarks but appeared close enough to be credible. On the same day, Chen Yi referred to Nehru by implication at the Bulgarian embassy reception: \"Those who attempted to deny history, ignore reality, and distort the truth and who attempted to divert the Conference from its important object have failed to gain support and were isolated.\" On 10 September, they dropped all circumlocutions and criticised him by name in a China Youth article and NCNA report\u2014the first time in almost two years that they had commented extensively on the Prime Minister.<ref name=\"CIA:ToI\"/>\n\nBy early 1962, the Chinese leadership began to believe that India's intentions were to launch a massive attack against Chinese troops, and that the Indian leadership wanted a war.<ref name = \"Garver\"/><ref name=\"Calvin\"/> In 1961, the Indian army had been sent into [[Goa]], a small region without any other international borders apart from the Indian one, after [[Portugal]] refused to surrender the [[exclave]] [[colony]] to the Indian Union. Although this action met little to no international protest or opposition, China saw it as an example of India's expansionist nature, especially in light of heated rhetoric from Indian politicians. India's Home Minister declared, \"If the Chinese will not vacate the areas occupied by it, India will have to repeat [[Invasion of Goa|what it did in Goa]]. India will certainly drive out the Chinese forces\",<ref name=\"Calvin\"/> while another member of the Indian Congress Party pronounced, \"India will take steps to end [Chinese] aggression on Indian soil just as it ended Portuguese aggression in Goa\".<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> By mid-1962, it was apparent to the Chinese leadership that negotiations had failed to make any progress, and the Forward Policy was increasingly perceived as a grave threat as [[Delhi]] increasingly sent probes deeper into border areas and cut off Chinese supply lines.<ref name = \"Patterson\"/> Foreign Minister [[Chen Yi (communist)|Marshal Chen Yi]] commented at one high-level meeting, \"Nehru's forward policy is a knife.

This was further triggered by [[Mao Zedong]]'s views that: \"The way to world conquest lies through Havana, Accra, and Calcutta\". Calvin believes that Chinese actions show a \"pattern of conservative aims and limited objectives, rather than expansionism\" and blames this particular conflict on India's provocations towards China. Calvin also expresses that China, in the past, has been adamant to gain control over regions to which it has a \"traditional claim\", which triggered the dispute over NEFA and [[Aksai Chin]] and indeed [[Tibet]]. Calvin's assumption, based on the history of the Cold War and the Domino Effect, assumed that China might ultimately try to regain control of everything that it considers as \"traditionally Chinese\" which in its view includes the entirety of South East Asia.<ref name=\"Calvin\"/>\n\nThe [[John Fitzgerald Kennedy|Kennedy]] administration was disturbed by what they considered \"blatant Chinese communist aggression against India\". In a May 1963 [[National Security Council (USA)|National Security Council]] meeting, contingency planning on the part of the United States in the event of another Chinese attack on India was discussed. [[Secretary of Defense|Defense Secretary]] [[Robert McNamara]] and General [[Maxwell Taylor]] advised the president to use nuclear weapons should the Americans intervene in such a situation. McNamara stated \"Before any substantial commitment to defend India against China is given, we should recognise that in order to carry out that commitment against any substantial Chinese attack, we would have to use nuclear weapons. Any large Chinese Communist attack on any part of that area would require the use of nuclear weapons by the U.S., and this is to be preferred over the introduction of large numbers of U.S. soldiers.\"<ref name=\"Anand\">{{cite news|title='63 Tapes Reveal Kennedy and Aides Discussed Using Nuclear Arms in a China-India Clash|author=Anand Giridharadas|date=26 August 2005|location=Mumbai, India|newspaper=New York Times}}</ref> After hearing this and listening to two other advisers, Kennedy stated \"We should defend India, and therefore we will defend India.\"<ref name=\"Anand\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/08/27/2003269368 |title=JFK, aides considered nuclear arms in China-India clash |newspaper=[[Taipei Times]] |date=2017-03-03 |accessdate=2017-03-10 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526225134/http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2005/08/27/2003269368 |archivedate=26 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> It remains unclear if his aides were trying to dissuade the President of considering any measure with regard to India by immediately raising the stakes to an unacceptable level, nor is it clear if Kennedy was thinking of conventional or nuclear means when he gave his reply.<ref name=\"Anand\"/> By 1964 China had developed its own nuclear weapon which would have likely caused any American nuclear policy in defense of India to be reviewed.<ref name=\"Anand\"/> The [[Lyndon Baines Johnson|Johnson]] Administration considered and then rejected giving nuclear weapons technology to the Indians.

These jets were seen as necessary to beef up Indian air strength so that air-to-air combat could be initiated safely from the Indian perspective (bombing troops was seen as unwise for fear of Chinese retaliatory action). Nehru also asked that these aircraft be manned by American pilots until Indian airmen were trained to replace them. These requests were rejected by the Kennedy Administration (which was involved in the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] during most of the Sino-Indian War). The U.S. nonetheless provided non-combat assistance to Indian forces and planned to send the carrier [[USS Kitty Hawk (CV-63)|USS ''Kitty Hawk'']] to the Bay of Bengal to support India in case of an air war.<ref>[http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-untold-story-how-the-us-came-to-indias-aid-in-1962/20121204.htm The Untold Story: How Kennedy came to India's aid in 1962] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221734/http://www.rediff.com/news/special/the-untold-story-how-the-us-came-to-indias-aid-in-1962/20121204.htm |date=17 December 2013 }}, Rediff News, 4 December 2012.</ref>\n\nAs the [[Sino-Soviet split]] heated up, Moscow made a major effort to support India, especially with the sale of advanced Mig warplanes.

According to P.R.

Indians reacted with a surge in patriotism and memorials were erected for many of the Indian troops who died in the war. Arguably, the main lesson India learned from the war was the need to strengthen its own defences and a shift from Nehru's foreign policy with China based on his stated concept of \"brotherhood\". Because of India's inability to anticipate Chinese aggression, [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru|Nehru]] faced harsh criticism from government officials, for having promoted pacifist relations with China.<ref name=\"Neville_Maxwell\"/> Indian President [[Radhakrishnan]] said that Nehru's government was naive and negligent about preparations, and Nehru admitted his failings.<ref name=BlackNovember /> According to Inder Malhotra, a former editor of ''The Times of India'' and a commentator for ''The Indian Express'', Indian politicians invested more effort in removing Defence Minister [[Krishna Menon]] than in actually waging war.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\" /> Krishna Menon's favoritism weakened the Indian Army, and national morale dimmed.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> The public saw the war as a political and military debacle.<ref name=\"BlackNovember\"/> Under American advice (by American envoy [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] who made and ran American policy on the war as all other top policy makers in the US were absorbed in coincident Cuban Missile Crisis<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |title=Whoever has seen Aksai Chin, as I have, would want someone else to have it |newspaper=Indian Express |date=3 March 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307023311/http://www.indianexpress.com/news/whoever-has-seen-aksai-chin-as-i-have-would-want-someone-else-to-have-it/3634/0 |archivedate=7 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>) Indians refrained, not according to the best choices available, from using the [[Indian air force]] to beat back the Chinese advances.

Many Indians view the war as a betrayal of India's attempts at establishing a long-standing peace with China and started to question the once popular \"Hindi-Chini bhai-bhai\" (meaning \"Indians and Chinese are brothers\").

The new Indian republic had avoided international alignments; by asking for help during the war, India demonstrated its willingness to accept military aid from several sectors.

At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets.

It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, \"Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen\", meaning his \"Lady Poverty\".<ref name=\"cefa\"/> \n[[File:Sassetta 001.jpg|thumb|''Saint Francis Abandons His Father''.

He said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the forsaken country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\" He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose.<ref name=\"chest54\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;54\u201356</ref> When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nIn order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/> Some accounts report that he stripped himself naked in token of this renunciation, and the Bishop covered him with his own cloak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrinesf.org/life-of-st-francis.html|title=Life of St. Francis|first=Fr.

He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.<ref name=\"cefa\"/> This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].<ref name=\"chest54\"/> By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].\n\n===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===\n====The Friars Minor====\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n \nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Innocent III]] approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295\u20131300]]\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.<ref name=\"chest107\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;107\u2013108</ref> Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.<ref name=\"Francis of Assisi and His World\">Galli(2002), pp.&nbsp;74\u201380</ref> This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on 16 April 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====\n[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], 28 March 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.<ref name=\"chest110\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;110\u2013111</ref> This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].\n\n===Travels===\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World and convert them, after the example of the first disciples of Jesus, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as \u201ceminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind\u201d.<ref>Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed. Otto Karrer (London: [[Sheed and Ward]], 1979) 244.</ref> The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.<ref name=\"chest130\">Chesterton (1924), p.130</ref>\n\nIn the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]<ref name=\"chest126\">Chesterton (1924), p.126</ref> (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the [[Dominican Order#Foundation|Friars Preachers]], another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on 29 August 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.<ref>Runciman, Steven.

Tolan (p.126) discusses the incident as recounted by Bonaventure, an incident which does not extend to a fire actually being lit.</ref> It has been suggested that the winged figures atop the columns piercing the roof of the building on the left of the scene are not idols (as [[Erwin Panofsky]] had proposed) but are part of the secular iconography of the sultan, affirming his worldly power which, as the scene demonstrates, is limited even as regards his own \"priests\" who shun the challenge.<ref>P\u00e9ter Bokody, [https://www.academia.edu/1787059/Idolatry_or_Power_St._Francis_in_Front_of_the_Sultan  \"Idolatry or Power: St. Francis in Front of the Sultan\"], in: ''Promoting the Saints: Cults and Their Contexts from Late Antiquity until the Early Modern Period'', ed.

The scene in the fresco adopts a position midway between the two extremes. Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,<ref>Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)</ref> many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.<ref>For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258\u2013263.

See Tolan, pp. 168</ref> The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre.

Assisi.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Francis preaching to the birds outside of [[Bevagna]] ([[Master of Saint Francis]]).]] By this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].<ref name=\"b162\">Bonaventure (1867), p.&nbsp;162</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]\" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nOn 29 September 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on 10 March 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n[[File:Honorius_III_approving_the_Rule_of_St._Francis,_Bartolome_del_Castro,_c._1500_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Honorius III]] Approving the Rule of St. Francis of Assisi'', Bartolome del Castro, c. 1500 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on 29 November 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterward as far north as [[Bologna]].\n\n=== Stigmata, final days, and Sainthood ===\n[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.<ref name=Goff>Le Goff, Jacques.

Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\"<ref name=\"chest131\">Chesterton (1924), p.131</ref> Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where the Franciscan movement began, and feeling that the end of his life was approaching, he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, 3 October 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''\"Voce mea ad Dominum\"''.\n<!-- [[File:Traslaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds, de Benet Mercad\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad\u00e9]]]] -->\n\nOn 16 July 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, a friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on 25 May 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[Image:Francis_wolf.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Francis talking to the [[wolf of Gubbio]] ([[:de:Carl Weidemeyer|Carl Weidemeyer]], 1911)]] Francis set out to imitate Christ and literally carry out his work. This is important in understanding Francis' character, his affinity for the Eucharist and respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> He preached: \"Your God is of your flesh, He lives in your nearest neighbor, in every man.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Eimerl |first=Sarel |others=et al |title=The World of Giotto: c. 1267\u20131337 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc1200eime |url-access=registration |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1967 |isbn=0-900658-15-0 |p=[https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc1200eime/page/15 15]}}</ref>\n\nHe and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty, which was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his order.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nHe believed that nature itself was the mirror of God.

In his ''Canticle of the Creatures'' (\"Praises of Creatures\" or \"[[Canticle of the Sun]]\"), he mentioned the \"Brother Sun\" and \"Sister Moon\", the wind and water. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that \"he considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died\".<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nFrancis' visit to Egypt and attempted [[rapprochement]] with the Muslim world had far-reaching consequences, long past his own death, since after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader Kingdom]], it would be the Franciscans, of all Catholics, who would be allowed to stay on in the Holy Land and be recognized as \"[[Custodian of the Holy Land|Custodians of the Holy Land]]\" on behalf of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\nAt Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known ''presepio'' or ''cr\u00e8che'' ([[Nativity scene]]).<ref name=\"b178\">Bonaventure (1867), p. 178</ref> His nativity imagery reflected the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight.<ref name=\"b178\"/> Both Thomas of Celano and [[Saint Bonaventure]], biographers of Saint Francis, tell how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real [[ox]] and [[donkey]].<ref name=\"b178\"/> According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.\n\n===Nature and the environment===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs without citations-->\nFrancis preached the Christian doctrine that the world was created good and beautiful by God but suffers a need for redemption because of human sin. He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.<ref name=\"b78\"/> Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.<ref name=\"b78\">Bonaventure (1867), pp.&nbsp;78\u201385</ref>\n\n[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\"<ref name=\"b78\"/> The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had \u201cdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree-quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On 29 November 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=Pope John Paul II |date=29 November 1979 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref>  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation \u2013 animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon \u2013 to give honor and praise to the Lord.

In this account, he was selling cloth and velvet in the marketplace on behalf of his father when a beggar came to him and asked for [[alms]]. At the conclusion of his business deal, Francis abandoned his wares and ran after the beggar. When he found him, Francis gave the man everything he had in his pockets.

It is possible that his spiritual conversion was a gradual process rooted in this experience. Upon his return to Assisi in 1203, Francis returned to his carefree life. In 1205, Francis left for [[Apulia]] to enlist in the army of [[Walter III, Count of Brienne]]. A strange vision made him return to Assisi, having lost his taste for the worldly life.<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> According to [[Hagiography|hagiographic]] accounts, thereafter he began to avoid the sports and the feasts of his former companions. In response, they asked him laughingly whether he was thinking of marrying, to which he answered, \"Yes, a fairer bride than any of you have ever seen\", meaning his \"Lady Poverty\".<ref name=\"cefa\"/> \n[[File:Sassetta 001.jpg|thumb|''Saint Francis Abandons His Father''. Francis of Assisi breaking off his relationship with his father and renouncing his patrimony, laying aside publicly even the garments he had received from him.]]\nOn a [[pilgrimage]] to Rome, he joined the poor in begging at [[Old St. Peter's Basilica|St. Peter's Basilica]].<ref name=\"ODCC Francis\"/> He spent some time in lonely places, asking God for [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|spiritual enlightenment]]. He said he had a mystical [[visions of Jesus and Mary|vision of Jesus Christ]] in the forsaken country chapel of [[San Damiano, Assisi|San Damiano]], just outside Assisi, in which the [[San Damiano cross|Icon of Christ Crucified]] said to him, \"Francis, Francis, go and repair My house which, as you can see, is falling into ruins.\" He took this to mean the ruined church in which he was presently praying, and so he sold some cloth from his father's store to assist the priest there for this purpose.<ref name=\"chest54\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;54\u201356</ref> When the priest refused to accept the ill-gotten gains, an indignant Francis threw the coins on the floor.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nIn order to avoid his father's wrath, Francis hid in a cave near San Damiano for about a month. When he returned to town, hungry and dirty, he was dragged home by his father, beaten, bound, and locked in a small storeroom. Freed by his mother during Bernardone's absence, Francis returned at once to San Damiano, where he found shelter with the officiating priest, but he was soon cited before the city consuls by his father. The latter, not content with having recovered the scattered gold from San Damiano, sought also to force his son to forego his inheritance by way of restitution. In the midst of legal proceedings before the [[Bishop of Assisi]], Francis renounced his father and his [[Property|patrimony]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/> Some accounts report that he stripped himself naked in token of this renunciation, and the Bishop covered him with his own cloak.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shrinesf.org/life-of-st-francis.html|title=Life of St. Francis|first=Fr.

He spent some time at a neighbouring monastery working as a scullion. He then went to Gubbio, where a friend gave him, as an alms, the cloak, girdle, and staff of a pilgrim. Returning to Assisi, he traversed the city begging stones for the restoration of St. Damiano's. These he carried to the old chapel, set in place himself, and so at length rebuilt it. Over the course of two years, he embraced the life of a [[penitent]], during which he restored several ruined chapels in the countryside around Assisi, among them San Pietro in Spina (in the area of San Petrignano in the valley about a kilometer from Rivotorto, today on private property and once again in ruin); and the [[Porziuncola]], the little chapel of [[Basilica of Santa Maria degli Angeli|St. Mary of the Angels]] in the plain just below the town.<ref name=\"cefa\"/> This later became his favorite [[Dwelling|abode]].<ref name=\"chest54\"/> By degrees he took to nursing [[leper]]s, in the [[lazar house]]s near [[Assisi]].\n\n===Founding of the Franciscan Orders===\n====The Friars Minor====\nOne morning in February 1208, Francis was hearing Mass in the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels, near which he had then built himself a hut. The Gospel of the day was the \"Commissioning of the Twelve\" from the Book of Matthew. The disciples are to go and proclaim that the Kingdom of God is at hand. Francis was inspired to devote himself to a life of poverty. Having obtained a coarse woolen tunic, the dress then worn by the poorest Umbrian peasants, he tied it around him with a knotted rope and went forth at once exhorting the people of the country-side to penance, brotherly love, and peace. Francis' preaching to ordinary people was unusual since he had no license to do so.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n \nHis example drew others to him. Within a year Francis had eleven followers. The brothers lived a [[simple living|simple life]] in the deserted [[lazar house]] of Rivo Torto near Assisi; but they spent much of their time wandering through the mountainous districts of [[Umbria]], making a deep impression upon their hearers by their earnest exhortations.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n[[File:Legend of St. Francis by Giotto.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pope Innocent III]] approving the statutes of the Order of the Franciscans, by [[Giotto]], 1295\u20131300]]\nIn 1209 he composed a simple rule for his followers (\"friars\"), the ''Regula primitiva'' or \"Primitive Rule\", which came from verses in the Bible. The rule was \"To follow the teachings of our Lord Jesus Christ and to walk in his footsteps\". He then led his first eleven followers to Rome to seek permission from [[Pope Innocent III]] to found a new religious Order.<ref name=\"chest107\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;107\u2013108</ref> Upon entry to Rome, the brothers encountered Bishop Guido of Assisi, who had in his company [[Giovanni di San Paolo]], the [[Cardinal Bishop of Sabina]]. The Cardinal, who was the confessor of Pope Innocent&nbsp;III, was immediately sympathetic to Francis and agreed to represent Francis to the pope. Reluctantly, Pope Innocent agreed to meet with Francis and the brothers the next day. After several days, the pope agreed to admit the group informally, adding that when God increased the group in grace and number, they could return for an official admittance. The group was [[tonsure]]d.<ref name=\"Francis of Assisi and His World\">Galli(2002), pp.&nbsp;74\u201380</ref> This was important in part because it recognized Church authority and prevented his following from possible accusations of heresy, as had happened to the [[Waldensians]] decades earlier. Though a number of the Pope's counselors considered the mode of life proposed by Francis as unsafe and impractical, following a dream in which he saw Francis holding up the [[Basilica of St. John Lateran]] (the cathedral of Rome, thus the 'home church' of all Christendom), he decided to endorse Francis' Order. This occurred, according to tradition, on 16 April 1210, and constituted the official founding of the [[Franciscan Order]].<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> The group, then the \"Lesser Brothers\" (''Order of Friars Minor'' also known as the ''Franciscan Order'' or the ''Seraphic Order''), were centered in the Porziuncola and preached first in Umbria, before expanding throughout Italy.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Francis chose never to be ordained a priest, although he was later ordained a deacon.<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\n====The Poor Clares and the Third Order====\n[[File:Josep Benlliure Gil17.jpg|thumb|St. Clare is received by St. Francis, Josep Benlliure]]\nFrom then on, the new Order grew quickly with new vocations.  Hearing Francis preaching in the church of [[Assisi Cathedral|San Rufino]] in Assisi in 1211, the young noblewoman [[Clare of Assisi]] became deeply touched by his message and realized her calling. Her cousin Rufino, the only male member of the family in their generation, was also attracted to the new Order, which he joined. On the night of [[Palm Sunday]], 28 March 1212, Clare clandestinely left her family's palace. Francis received her at the Porziuncola and thereby established the Order of Poor Ladies.<ref name=\"chest110\">Chesterton (1924), pp.&nbsp;110\u2013111</ref> This was an Order for women, and he gave Clare a [[religious habit]], or garment, similar to his own, before lodging her in a nearby monastery of [[Order of St. Benedict|Benedictine]] nuns until he could provide a suitable retreat for her, and for her younger sister, [[Agnes of Assisi|Caterina]], and the other young women who had joined her. Later he transferred them to San Damiano,<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> to a few small huts or cells of wattle, straw, and mud, and enclosed by a hedge. This became the first monastery of the Second Franciscan Order, now known as [[Poor Clares]].<ref name=\"cefa\"/>\n\nFor those who could not leave their homes, he later formed the [[Third Order of Saint Francis|Third Order of Brothers and Sisters of Penance]], a fraternity composed of either [[laity]] or clergy whose members neither withdrew from the world nor took [[religious vows]]. Instead, they observed the principles of Franciscan life in their daily lives.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> Before long, this Third Order grew beyond Italy. The Third Order is now titled the [[Secular Franciscan Order]].\n\n===Travels===\nDetermined to bring the Gospel to all peoples of the World and convert them, after the example of the first disciples of Jesus, Francis sought on several occasions to take his message out of Italy. In the late spring of 1212, he set out for Jerusalem, but was shipwrecked by a storm on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast, forcing him to return to Italy. On 8 May 1213, he was given the use of the mountain of [[La Verna]] (Alverna) as a gift from [[Count]] Orlando di Chiusi, who described it as \u201ceminently suitable for whoever wishes to do penance in a place remote from mankind\u201d.<ref>Fioretti quoted in: St. Francis, ''The Little Flowers, Legends, and Lauds'', trans. N. Wydenbruck, ed. Otto Karrer (London: [[Sheed and Ward]], 1979) 244.</ref> The mountain would become one of his favourite retreats for prayer.<ref name=\"chest130\">Chesterton (1924), p.130</ref>\n\nIn the same year, Francis sailed for Morocco, but this time an illness forced him to break off his journey in Spain. Back in Assisi, several noblemen (among them [[Tommaso da Celano]], who would later write the biography of St. Francis), and some well-educated men joined his Order. In 1215, Francis may have gone to Rome for the [[Fourth Lateran Council]], but that is not certain. During this time, he probably met a [[canon (priest)|canon]], [[Saint Dominic|Dominic de Guzman]]<ref name=\"chest126\">Chesterton (1924), p.126</ref> (later to be Saint Dominic, the founder of the [[Dominican Order#Foundation|Friars Preachers]], another [[Catholic religious order]]). In 1217, he offered to go to France. Cardinal Ugolino of Segni (the future Pope Gregory IX), an early and important supporter of Francis, advised him against this and said that he was still needed in Italy.\n\nIn 1219, accompanied by another friar and hoping to convert the Sultan of Egypt or win martyrdom in the attempt, Francis went to Egypt during the [[Fifth Crusade]] where a Crusader army had been encamped for over a year besieging the walled city of [[Damietta]] {{convert|2|mi|spell=in|abbr=off}} upstream from the mouth of one of the main channels of the Nile. The Sultan, [[al-Kamil]], a nephew of [[Saladin]], had succeeded his father as Sultan of Egypt in 1218 and was encamped upstream of Damietta, unable to relieve it. A bloody and futile attack on the city was launched by the Christians on 29 August 1219, following which both sides agreed to a ceasefire which lasted four weeks.<ref>Runciman, Steven.

Tolan (p.126) discusses the incident as recounted by Bonaventure, an incident which does not extend to a fire actually being lit.</ref> It has been suggested that the winged figures atop the columns piercing the roof of the building on the left of the scene are not idols (as [[Erwin Panofsky]] had proposed) but are part of the secular iconography of the sultan, affirming his worldly power which, as the scene demonstrates, is limited even as regards his own \"priests\" who shun the challenge.<ref>P\u00e9ter Bokody, [https://www.academia.edu/1787059/Idolatry_or_Power_St._Francis_in_Front_of_the_Sultan  \"Idolatry or Power: St. Francis in Front of the Sultan\"], in: ''Promoting the Saints: Cults and Their Contexts from Late Antiquity until the Early Modern Period'', ed.

Since the idea was put forward by the German art historian, Friedrich Rintelen in 1912,<ref>Friedrich Rintelen, ''Giotto und die Giotto-apokryphen'', (1912)</ref> many scholars have expressed doubt that Giotto was the author of the Upper Church frescoes.\n\nAccording to some late sources, the Sultan gave Francis permission to visit the sacred places in the Holy Land and even to preach there. All that can safely be asserted is that Francis and his companion left the Crusader camp for [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], from where they embarked for Italy in the latter half of 1220. Drawing on a 1267 sermon by Bonaventure, later sources report that the Sultan secretly converted or accepted a death-bed baptism as a result of the encounter with Francis.<ref>For grants of various permissions and privileges to Francis as attributed by later sources, see, e.g., Tolan, pp. 258\u2013263. The first mention of the Sultan's conversion occurs in a sermon delivered by Bonaventure on 4 October 1267. See Tolan, pp. 168</ref> The Franciscan Order has been present in the [[Holy Land]] almost uninterruptedly since 1217 when Brother Elias arrived at Acre. It received concessions from the [[Mameluke]] Sultan in 1333 with regard to certain Holy Places in [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre|Jerusalem]] and [[Bethlehem]], and (so far as concerns the Catholic Church) jurisdictional privileges from [[Pope Clement VI]] in 1342.<ref>Bulla ''Gratias agimus'', commemorated by Pope John Paul II in a [https://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/1992/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_19921130_p-schalluuck_it.html Letter] dated 30 November 1992.

Assisi.jpg|thumb|left|Saint Francis preaching to the birds outside of [[Bevagna]] ([[Master of Saint Francis]]).]] By this time, the growing Order of friars was divided into [[ecclesiastical province|provinces]] and groups were sent to France, Germany, Hungary, and Spain and to the East. Upon receiving a report of the martyrdom of five brothers in [[Morocco]], Francis returned to Italy via [[Venice]].<ref name=\"b162\">Bonaventure (1867), p.&nbsp;162</ref> Cardinal [[Pope Gregory IX|Ugolino di Conti]] was then nominated by the Pope as the protector of the Order. Another reason for Francis' return to Italy was that the Franciscan Order had grown at an unprecedented rate compared to previous religious orders, but its organizational sophistication had not kept up with this growth and had little more to govern it than Francis' example and simple rule. To address this problem, Francis prepared a new and more detailed Rule, the \"First Rule\" or \"Rule Without a [[Papal Bull]]\" (''Regula prima'', ''Regula non bullata''), which again asserted devotion to poverty and the apostolic life. However, it also introduced greater institutional structure, though this was never officially endorsed by the pope.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nOn 29 September 1220, Francis handed over the governance of the Order to Brother Peter Catani at the Porziuncola, but Brother Peter died only five months later, on 10 March 1221, and was buried there. When numerous miracles were attributed to the deceased brother, people started to flock to the Porziuncola, disturbing the daily life of the Franciscans. Francis then prayed, asking Peter to stop the miracles and to obey in death as he had obeyed during his life.\n[[File:Honorius_III_approving_the_Rule_of_St._Francis,_Bartolome_del_Castro,_c._1500_(Philadelphia_Museum_of_Art).jpg|left|thumb|''[[Honorius III]] Approving the Rule of St. Francis of Assisi'', Bartolome del Castro, c. 1500 ([[Philadelphia Museum of Art]])]]\nThe reports of miracles ceased. Brother Peter was succeeded by Brother Elias as [[Vicar]] of Francis. Two years later, Francis modified the \"First Rule\", creating the \"Second Rule\" or \"Rule With a Bull\", which was approved by Pope Honorius III on 29 November 1223. As the official Rule of the Order, it called on the friars \"to observe the Holy Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ, living in obedience without anything of our own and in chastity\". In addition, it set regulations for discipline, preaching, and entry into the Order. Once the Rule was endorsed by the Pope, Francis withdrew increasingly from external affairs.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> During 1221 and 1222, Francis crossed Italy, first as far south as [[Catania]] in Sicily and afterward as far north as [[Bologna]].\n\n=== Stigmata, final days, and Sainthood ===\n[[File:Cigoli, san francesco.jpg|thumb|Francis considered his [[stigmata]] part of the ''[[Imitation of Christ]]''.<ref name=Goff>Le Goff, Jacques.

Brother Leo, who had been with Francis at the time, left a clear and simple account of the event, the first definite account of the phenomenon of stigmata. \"Suddenly he saw a vision of a seraph, a six-winged angel on a cross. This angel gave him the gift of the five wounds of Christ.\"<ref name=\"chest131\">Chesterton (1924), p.131</ref> Suffering from these stigmata and from [[trachoma]], Francis received care in several cities ([[Siena]], [[Cortona]], [[Nocera Umbra|Nocera]]) to no avail. In the end, he was brought back to a hut next to the Porziuncola. Here, in the place where the Franciscan movement began, and feeling that the end of his life was approaching, he spent his last days dictating his spiritual testament. He died on the evening of Saturday, 3 October 1226, singing Psalm 142 (141), ''\"Voce mea ad Dominum\"''.\n<!-- [[File:Traslaci\u00f3n de San Francisco de As\u00eds, de Benet Mercad\u00e9.jpg|thumb|The Passing of Saint Francis of Assisi (1866), by [[Benet Mercad\u00e9]]]] -->\n\nOn 16 July 1228, he was pronounced a saint by Pope [[Gregory IX]] (the former cardinal Ugolino di Conti, a friend of Saint Francis and Cardinal Protector of the Order). The next day, the Pope laid the foundation stone for the [[Basilica of San Francesco d'Assisi|Basilica of Saint Francis]] in Assisi. Francis was buried on 25 May 1230, under the Lower Basilica, but his tomb was soon hidden on orders of Brother Elias to protect it from Saracen invaders. His exact burial place remained unknown until it was re-discovered in 1818. Pasquale Belli then constructed for the remains a crypt in neo-classical style in the Lower Basilica. It was refashioned between 1927 and 1930 into its present form by Ugo Tarchi, stripping the wall of its marble decorations. In 1978, the remains of Saint Francis were examined and confirmed by a commission of scholars appointed by [[Pope Paul VI]], and put into a glass urn in the ancient stone tomb.\n\n==Character and legacy==\n[[Image:Francis_wolf.JPG|thumb|right|Saint Francis talking to the [[wolf of Gubbio]] ([[:de:Carl Weidemeyer|Carl Weidemeyer]], 1911)]] Francis set out to imitate Christ and literally carry out his work. This is important in understanding Francis' character, his affinity for the Eucharist and respect for the priests who carried out the sacrament.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/> He preached: \"Your God is of your flesh, He lives in your nearest neighbor, in every man.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Eimerl |first=Sarel |others=et al |title=The World of Giotto: c. 1267\u20131337 |url=https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc1200eime |url-access=registration |publisher=Time-Life Books |year=1967 |isbn=0-900658-15-0 |p=[https://archive.org/details/worldofgiottoc1200eime/page/15 15]}}</ref>\n\nHe and his followers celebrated and even venerated poverty, which was so central to his character that in his last written work, the Testament, he said that absolute personal and corporate poverty was the essential lifestyle for the members of his order.<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nHe believed that nature itself was the mirror of God.

In his ''Canticle of the Creatures'' (\"Praises of Creatures\" or \"[[Canticle of the Sun]]\"), he mentioned the \"Brother Sun\" and \"Sister Moon\", the wind and water. His deep sense of brotherhood under God embraced others, and he declared that \"he considered himself no friend of Christ if he did not cherish those for whom Christ died\".<ref name = \"EBO Francis\"/>\n\nFrancis' visit to Egypt and attempted [[rapprochement]] with the Muslim world had far-reaching consequences, long past his own death, since after the fall of the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem|Crusader Kingdom]], it would be the Franciscans, of all Catholics, who would be allowed to stay on in the Holy Land and be recognized as \"[[Custodian of the Holy Land|Custodians of the Holy Land]]\" on behalf of the [[Catholic Church]].\n\nAt Greccio near Assisi, around 1220, Francis celebrated Christmas by setting up the first known ''presepio'' or ''cr\u00e8che'' ([[Nativity scene]]).<ref name=\"b178\">Bonaventure (1867), p. 178</ref> His nativity imagery reflected the scene in traditional paintings. He used real animals to create a living scene so that the worshipers could contemplate the birth of the child Jesus in a direct way, making use of the senses, especially sight.<ref name=\"b178\"/> Both Thomas of Celano and [[Saint Bonaventure]], biographers of Saint Francis, tell how he used only a straw-filled manger (feeding trough) set between a real [[ox]] and [[donkey]].<ref name=\"b178\"/> According to Thomas, it was beautiful in its simplicity, with the manger acting as the altar for the Christmas Mass.\n\n===Nature and the environment===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2017}}<!--3 paragraphs without citations-->\nFrancis preached the Christian doctrine that the world was created good and beautiful by God but suffers a need for redemption because of human sin. He believed that all creatures should praise God (a common theme in the Psalms) and the people have a duty to protect and enjoy nature as both the stewards of God's creation and as creatures ourselves.<ref name=\"b78\"/> Many of the stories that surround the life of Saint Francis say that he had a great love for animals and the environment.<ref name=\"b78\">Bonaventure (1867), pp.&nbsp;78\u201385</ref>\n\n[[File:St Francis Statue 2.JPG|thumb|left|A garden statue of Francis of Assisi with birds]]\nAn incident illustrating the Saint's humility towards nature is recounted in the \"Fioretti\" (\"Little Flowers\"), a collection of [[legend]]s and folklore that sprang up after the Saint's death. One day, while Francis was traveling with some companions, they happened upon a place in the road where birds filled the trees on either side. Francis told his companions to \"wait for me while I go to preach to my sisters the birds.\"<ref name=\"b78\"/> The birds surrounded him, intrigued by the power of his voice, and not one of them flew away. He is often portrayed with a bird, typically in his hand.\n\nAnother legend from the ''[[Fioretti]]'' tells that in the city of [[Gubbio]], where Francis lived for some time, was a [[Wolf of Gubbio|wolf \"terrifying and ferocious, who devoured men as well as animals\".]] Francis had compassion upon the townsfolk, and so he went up into the hills to find the wolf. Soon, fear of the animal had caused all his companions to flee, though the saint pressed on. When he found the wolf, he made the sign of the cross and commanded the wolf to come to him and hurt no one. Miraculously the wolf closed his jaws and lay down at Francis' feet.\n\n\"Brother Wolf, you do much harm in these parts and you have done great evil\", said Francis. \"All these people accuse you and curse you ... But brother wolf, I would like to make peace between you and the people.\" Then Francis led the wolf into the town, and surrounded by startled citizens made a pact between them and the wolf. Because the wolf had \u201cdone evil out of hunger, the townsfolk were to feed the wolf regularly. In return, the wolf would no longer prey upon them or their flocks. In this manner [[Gubbio]] was freed from the menace of the predator. Francis even made a pact on behalf of the town dogs, that they would not bother the wolf again. Finally, to show the townspeople that they would not be harmed, Francis blessed the wolf.\n\nThree-quarters of a millennium after his death, St Francis remains an important figure and symbol in and out of Anglican and Roman Catholic Churches. On 29 November 1979, [[Pope John Paul II]] declared Saint Francis the Patron Saint of Ecology.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |title=Inter Sanctos (Apostolic Letter AAS 71) |author=Pope John Paul II |date=29 November 1979 |accessdate=7 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809222858/http://francis35.org/pdf/papal_declaration.en.pdf |archive-date=9 August 2014 |url-status=dead |author-link=Pope John Paul II }}</ref>  During the World Environment Day 1982, John Paul II said that Saint Francis' love and care for creation was a challenge for contemporary Catholics and a reminder \"not to behave like dissident predators where nature is concerned, but to assume responsibility for it, taking all care so that everything stays healthy and integrated, so as to offer a welcoming and friendly environment even to those who succeed us.\" The same Pope wrote on the occasion of the World Day of Peace, 1 January 1990, the saint of Assisi \"offers Christians an example of genuine and deep respect for the integrity of creation ...\" He went on to make the point that: \"As a friend of the poor who was loved by God's creatures, Saint Francis invited all of creation \u2013 animals, plants, natural forces, even Brother Sun and Sister Moon \u2013 to give honor and praise to the Lord.
