In 1943 the 2nd Panzer Division took part in [[Operation Citadel]], as part of the [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII Panzer Corps]] of the 9th German Army of Army Group Centre. Following the operation's failure, the Red Army launched [[Operation Kutuzov]] in Army Group's Center's sector.

The division was equipped with [[Panther tank]]s. Following the [[invasion of Normandy]], the division was moved to Normandy in June 1944; it engaged British troops of the [[50th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|50th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. From June 6 until mid July the division stood in the Caumont area engaged in daily skirmishes with British units. During [[Operation Epsom]] a group of 6 Panther tanks of the Pz.Rg.3 was used for a counterattack to take [[Cheux]] but that attack failed and 5 of their tanks were lost. Although the 2nd Panzer Division was very experienced the German doctrine overall was flawed and couldn't be exploited in Normandy. All German Panzer divisions in Normandy suffered severe defeats when counterattacking.  The Division was relieved at Caumont by the [[326th infantry division]] and sent to the Verrieres ridge southwest of [[Caen]]. During the Canadian [[Operation Spring]] a Kampfgruppe from the division (Kampfgruppe Sterz) was sent to reinforce the [[272nd Infantry division]] at St.Andre sur Orne and St.Martin. The Kampfgruppe took St.Martin, destroying the [[Black Watch]] in the process and got involved in street fighting in St.Andre sur Orne. Kampfgruppe Zollh\u00f6fer of the [[9th SS Panzer Division]] took over and struck towards Point 67. After Operation Spring 2nd Panzer was sent to the US sector to help in halting [[Operation Cobra]]. They could stop the drive of the US 2nd AD for a moment but were too weak to cover the whole front. The division retreated and with its last 25 tanks it took part in [[Operation Luttich]], the failed German counterattack at Mortain. It was later encircled in the [[Falaise pocket]], but broke out with heavy losses in materiel and troops. At Falaise it was responsible for taking and holding [[St-Lambert-sur-Dive]] but was only able to take one part of the village. Nevertheless due to the efforts of the 2nd Panzer Division other German units, notably the 10th and the 12th SS, were able to cross the bridge over the Dives and escape eastwards. The division was reorganised in Germany, absorbing the depleted 352 Infantry Division. Due to the shortage in materiel, the division's complement of tanks was significantly reduced. Some tank companies only had [[assault gun]]s, although one battalion received Panther tanks.<ref name=\"Seven\" /><ref name=\"Eight\" >Mitcham, p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Battle of the Bulge ===\n<!---[[File:Troops advance in a snowstorm.jpg|thumb|Image of troops from the United States Army during the Battle of the Bulge which shows the weather conditions in which the two armies fought, including the 2nd Panzer Division.]]-->\nThe division was sent to the Western Front and attached to XLVII Panzer Corps, [[5th Panzer Army]] which was preparing for the German offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium (the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944). On the eve of battle, 2nd Panzer was about full strength, with 27 [[Panzer IV]]s, 58 [[Panther tank|Panthers]], and 48 [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault guns in the division tank parks.{{sfn|Cole|1965|p=178}} During the attack, 2nd Panzer drove towards the crucial road junction of [[Bastogne]]. However, Bastogne was quickly reinforced by the veteran [[101st Airborne Division]]. Attacks against the town failed. On 18 December, in accordance with the original plan, 2nd Panzer was directed toward the Meuse River, but was unable to reach the Meuse, as American reinforcements threatened its flanks and supply line. Its vanguard got to 4&nbsp;km from the Meuse, where on 24 December they were stopped by the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 2nd Armored Division]] and the British [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Military Channel, Program \"Tank Overhaul\" ca 22:51, Wednesday 13 August 2008 (UTC) \"18:00\u201319:00 hrs EDST\", mixed documentary featuring M18 Hellcat refurbishment with interviews of WW-II veterans and expert commentary by WW-II historians.</ref> 2nd Panzer was forced to retreat by fierce American counterattacks and lack of petrol.<ref>Steven J.

After heavy losses on the Eastern Front it was sent to France for rehabilitation (1944). It fought in [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] and was almost completely destroyed in the [[Falaise Pocket]] (1944). It was rebuilt once more and fought in the [[Battle of the Bulge]] (1944) and in the defence of the [[Rhine]] (1945), surrendering to US forces at war's end.\n\n==History==\n===Formation===\nThe 2nd Panzer Division was formed on 15 October 1935 and was headquartered in [[W\u00fcrzburg]], [[Bavaria]].

In 1943 the 2nd Panzer Division took part in [[Operation Citadel]], as part of the [[XLVII Panzer Corps (Germany)|XLVII Panzer Corps]] of the 9th German Army of Army Group Centre. Following the operation's failure, the Red Army launched [[Operation Kutuzov]] in Army Group's Center's sector. The division retreated, suffering heavy losses, having also lost two of its three tank battalions earlier in 1942 when they were send to the southern sector of the front to assist with the German push towards the Volga and Caucasus.<ref name=\"Seven\" /><ref name=\"Stoveszero\" >Stoves, p. 20</ref>\n\n===Battle of Normandy===\nIn late 1943 the 2nd Panzer Division was sent to France for refitting after the heavy losses it suffered on the Eastern Front. The division was equipped with [[Panther tank]]s. Following the [[invasion of Normandy]], the division was moved to Normandy in June 1944; it engaged British troops of the [[50th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|50th Infantry Division]] and the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]]. From June 6th until mid July the division stood in the Caumont area engaged in daily skirmishes with British units. During [[Operation Epsom]] a group of 6 Panther tanks of the Pz.Rg.3 was used for a counterattack to take [[Cheux]] but that attack failed and 5 of their tanks were lost. Although the 2nd Panzer Division was very experienced the German doctrine overall was flawed and couldn't be exploited in Normandy. All German Panzer divisions in Normandy suffered severe defeats when counterattacking.  The Division was relieved at Caumont by the [[326th infantry division]] and sent to the Verrieres ridge southwest of [[Caen]]. During the Canadian [[Operation Spring]] a Kampfgruppe from the division (Kampfgruppe Sterz) was sent to reinforce the [[272nd Infantry division]] at St.Andre sur Orne and St.Martin. The Kampfgruppe took St.Martin, destroying the [[Black Watch]] in the process and got involved in street fighting in St.Andre sur Orne. Kampfgruppe Zollh\u00f6fer of the [[9th SS Panzer Division]] took over and struck towards Point 67. After Operation Spring 2nd Panzer was sent to the US sector to help in halting [[Operation Cobra]]. They could stop the drive of the US 2nd AD for a moment but were too weak to cover the whole front. The division retreated and with its last 25 tanks it took part in [[Operation Luttich]], the failed German counterattack at Mortain. It was later encircled in the [[Falaise pocket]], but broke out with heavy losses in materiel and troops. At Falaise it was responsible for taking and holding [[St-Lambert-sur-Dive]] but was only able to take one part of the village. Nevertheless due to the efforts of the 2nd Panzer Division other German units, notably the 10th and the 12th SS, were able to cross the bridge over the Dives and escape eastwards. The division was reorganised in Germany, absorbing the depleted 352 Infantry Division. Due to the shortage in materiel, the division's complement of tanks was significantly reduced. Some tank companies only had [[assault gun]]s, although one battalion received Panther tanks.<ref name=\"Seven\" /><ref name=\"Eight\" >Mitcham, p. 48</ref>\n\n=== Battle of the Bulge ===\n<!---[[File:Troops advance in a snowstorm.jpg|thumb|Image of troops from the United States Army during the Battle of the Bulge which shows the weather conditions in which the two armies fought, including the 2nd Panzer Division.]]-->\nThe division was sent to the Western Front and attached to XLVII Panzer Corps, [[5th Panzer Army]] which was preparing for the German offensive in the Ardennes region of Belgium (the [[Battle of the Bulge]] in December 1944). On the eve of battle, 2nd Panzer was about full strength, with 27 [[Panzer IV]]s, 58 [[Panther tank|Panthers]], and 48 [[Sturmgesch\u00fctz III|StuG III]] assault guns in the division tank parks.{{sfn|Cole|1965|p=178}} During the attack, 2nd Panzer drove towards the crucial road junction of [[Bastogne]]. However, Bastogne was quickly reinforced by the veteran [[101st Airborne Division]]. Attacks against the town failed. On 18 December, in accordance with the original plan, 2nd Panzer was directed toward the Meuse River, but was unable to reach the Meuse, as American reinforcements threatened its flanks and supply line. Its vanguard got to 4&nbsp;km from the Meuse, where on 24 December they were stopped by the [[2nd Armored Division (United States)|U.S. 2nd Armored Division]] and the British [[3rd Royal Tank Regiment]].<ref>Military Channel, Program \"Tank Overhaul\" ca 22:51, Wednesday 13 August 2008 (UTC) \"18:00\u201319:00 hrs EDST\", mixed documentary featuring M18 Hellcat refurbishment with interviews of WW-II veterans and expert commentary by WW-II historians.</ref> 2nd Panzer was forced to retreat by fierce American counterattacks and lack of petrol.<ref>Steven J.

How could you bring a baby into the world whose father didn\u2019t want it? How could you ruin my career like that?
