Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the [[United States Army]]'s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the ''YUH-60A'' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the [[Boeing Vertol YUH-61]].\n\nNamed after the Native American war leader [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed. Modified versions have also been developed for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. In addition to U.S. Army use, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations. Black Hawks have served in combat during conflicts in [[Grenada]], [[Panama]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], and other areas in the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Initial requirement===\nIn the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]], and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the [[General Electric T700]]. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 11, 39.</ref> The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport within the [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]] limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 39, 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe UTTAS requirements for improved [[Reliability centered maintenance|reliability]], [[survivability]] and lower [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle costs]] resulted in features such as dual-engines with improved [[hot and high]] altitude performance, and a [[modular design]] (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry [[gearbox]]es; [[Bulletproofing|ballistically tolerant]], redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and [[Aircraft flight control system|flight controls]]); [[Crashworthiness|crashworthy]] crew ([[Vehicle armour#Aircraft|armored]]) and troop seats; [[Oleo strut|dual-stage oleo]] main [[landing gear]]; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust [[Helicopter rotor|main]] and [[Tail rotor|tail]] rotor systems; and a [[Self-sealing fuel tank|ballistically tolerant]], crashworthy [[Aircraft fuel system|fuel system]].<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 42\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:UH-60As over Port Salines airport Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|left|UH-60A Black Hawks over [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Port Salinas]] during the [[invasion of Grenada]], 1983. The conflict saw the first use of the UH-60 in combat.]]\nFour prototypes were constructed, with the first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing.<ref>Leoni 2007, p. 165.</ref> Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival [[Boeing-Vertol]] design, the [[Boeing-Vertol YUH-61|YUH-61A]], and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.<ref name=\"Eden\">Eden, Paul. \"Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904687-84-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Upgrades and variations===\nAfter entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions.<ref>Tomajczyk 2003, pp. 15\u201329.</ref>\n\nDue to weight increases from the addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987. The new model incorporated all of the modifications made to the UH-60A fleet as standard design features. The UH-60L also featured more power and lifting capability with upgraded T700-GE-701C engines and an improved gearbox, both from the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B Seahawk]].<ref name=\"Leoni p217-8\">Leoni 2007, pp. 217\u2013218.</ref> Its external lift capacity increased by {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

Soldiers pinned down in the field requiring quick resupply have depended on speed bags, bags filled with items airdropped from a UH-60.  However, all systems were ad-hoc with bags not made to keep things secure from impacts, so up to half of the airdropped items would be damaged upon hitting the ground.  Started in 2011, the ESBS sought to standardize the airdrop resupply method and keep up to 90 percent of supplies intact.  The system includes a hands-free reusable linear brake and expendable speed line and multipurpose cargo bag; when the bag is deployed, the brake applies friction to the rope, slowing it down enough to keep the bag oriented down on the padded base, a [[honeycomb]] and foam kit inside to dissipate energy.  The ESBS not only better protects helicopter-dropped supplies, it allows the Black Hawk to fly higher above the ground, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} up from 10 feet, while traveling {{convert|20|knot|mph km/h}}, limiting exposure to ground fire.  Each bag can weigh {{convert|125-200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and up to six can be deployed at once, dropping {{convert|40-50|ft/s|m/s}}.  Since supplies can be delivered more accurately and the system can be automatically released on its own, the ESBS can enable autonomous resupply from unmanned helicopters.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ Adding new punch to aerial deliveries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113200/http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ |date=12 October 2015}} - Army.mil, 16 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ Picatinny 'Speed Bag' resupplies Soldiers with less equipment damage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026045822/http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ |date=26 October 2015}} - Army.mil, 25 June 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ The enhanced speed bag system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919114140/http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ |date=19 September 2015}} - Army.mil, 7 July 2015</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:A U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter assigned to the Colorado Army National Guard flies to perform a water drop while fighting the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs, Colo., June 12, 2013 130612-Z-UA373-388.jpg|thumb|A view of a UH-60L cockpit]]\n\nThe UH-60 features four-blade main and tail rotors, and is powered by two [[General Electric T700]] [[turboshaft]] engines.<ref name=Harding/> The main rotor is fully articulated and has [[elastomeric]] bearings in the rotor head.

''Armed forces International'', 6 December 2012.</ref>\n[[File:VH-60 Marine One (modified).jpg|thumb|VH-60Ns used to transport the President of the United States]]\n*'''OPBH''': On 11 March 2014, Sikorsky successfully conducted the first flight demonstration of their Optionally Piloted Black Hawk (OPBH), a milestone part of the company's Manned/Unmanned Resupply Aerial Lifter (MURAL) program to provide autonomous cargo delivery for the U.S. Army.  The helicopter used the company's Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations under the control of an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS).  The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO).  The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations, while increasing sorties and maintaining crew rest requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |title= Sikorsky achieves first flight of manned/unmanned Black Hawk |newspaper= Flight global |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426022614/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |archive-date= 26 April 2014 |url-status= live}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |title= Optionally Piloted Black Hawk takes off |publisher= Shephard media |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092300/http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |archive-date= 4 June 2015 |url-status= live}}.</ref>\n*'''VH-60D Night Hawk''': VIP-configured HH-60D, used for Presidential transport by USMC.

Sikorsky submitted the S-70 design for the [[United States Army]]'s Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS) competition in 1972. The Army designated the prototype as the ''YUH-60A'' and selected the Black Hawk as the winner of the program in 1976, after a fly-off competition with the [[Boeing Vertol YUH-61]].\n\nNamed after the Native American war leader [[Black Hawk (Sauk leader)|Black Hawk]], the UH-60A entered service with the U.S. Army in 1979, to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois]] as the Army's tactical transport helicopter. This was followed by the fielding of electronic warfare and special operations variants of the Black Hawk. Improved UH-60L and UH-60M utility variants have also been developed. Modified versions have also been developed for the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]], [[United States Air Force|Air Force]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]]. In addition to U.S. Army use, the UH-60 family has been exported to several nations. Black Hawks have served in combat during conflicts in [[Grenada]], [[Panama]], [[Iraq]], [[Somalia]], the [[Balkans]], [[Afghanistan]], and other areas in the [[Middle East]].\n\n==Development==\n\n===Initial requirement===\nIn the late 1960s, the United States Army began forming requirements for a helicopter to replace the [[Bell UH-1 Iroquois|UH-1 Iroquois]], and designated the program as the Utility Tactical Transport Aircraft System (UTTAS). The Army also initiated the development of a new, common turbine engine for its helicopters that would become the [[General Electric T700]]. Based on experience in Vietnam, the Army required significant performance, survivability and reliability improvements from both UTTAS and the new powerplant.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 8\u201310.</ref> The Army released its UTTAS request for proposals (RFP) in January 1972.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 11, 39.</ref> The RFP also included air transport requirements. Transport within the [[C-130 Hercules|C-130]] limited the UTTAS cabin height and length.<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 39, 42\u201343.</ref>\n\nThe UTTAS requirements for improved [[Reliability centered maintenance|reliability]], [[survivability]] and lower [[Whole-life cost|life-cycle costs]] resulted in features such as dual-engines with improved [[hot and high]] altitude performance, and a [[modular design]] (reduced maintenance footprint); run-dry [[gearbox]]es; [[Bulletproofing|ballistically tolerant]], redundant subsystems (hydraulic, electrical and [[Aircraft flight control system|flight controls]]); [[Crashworthiness|crashworthy]] crew ([[Vehicle armour#Aircraft|armored]]) and troop seats; [[Oleo strut|dual-stage oleo]] main [[landing gear]]; ballistically tolerant, crashworthy main structure; quieter, more robust [[Helicopter rotor|main]] and [[Tail rotor|tail]] rotor systems; and a [[Self-sealing fuel tank|ballistically tolerant]], crashworthy [[Aircraft fuel system|fuel system]].<ref>Leoni 2007, pp. 42\u201348.</ref>\n\n[[File:UH-60As over Port Salines airport Grenada 1983.JPEG|thumb|left|UH-60A Black Hawks over [[Maurice Bishop International Airport|Port Salinas]] during the [[invasion of Grenada]], 1983. The conflict saw the first use of the UH-60 in combat.]]\nFour prototypes were constructed, with the first YUH-60A flying on 17 October 1974. Prior to delivery of the prototypes to the US Army, a preliminary evaluation was conducted in November 1975 to ensure the aircraft could be operated safely during all testing.<ref>Leoni 2007, p. 165.</ref> Three of the prototypes were delivered to the Army in March 1976, for evaluation against the rival [[Boeing-Vertol]] design, the [[Boeing-Vertol YUH-61|YUH-61A]], and one was kept by Sikorsky for internal research. The Army selected the UH-60 for production in December 1976. Deliveries of the UH-60A to the Army began in October 1978 and the helicopter entered service in June 1979.<ref name=\"Eden\">Eden, Paul. \"Sikorsky H-60 Black Hawk/Seahawk\", ''Encyclopedia of Modern Military Aircraft''. Amber Books, 2004. {{ISBN|1-904687-84-9}}.</ref>\n\n===Upgrades and variations===\nAfter entering service, the helicopter was modified for new missions and roles, including mine laying and medical evacuation. An EH-60 variant was developed to conduct electronic warfare and special operations aviation developed the MH-60 variant to support its missions.<ref>Tomajczyk 2003, pp. 15\u201329.</ref>\n\nDue to weight increases from the addition of mission equipment and other changes, the Army ordered the improved UH-60L in 1987. The new model incorporated all of the modifications made to the UH-60A fleet as standard design features. The UH-60L also featured more power and lifting capability with upgraded T700-GE-701C engines and an improved gearbox, both from the [[Sikorsky SH-60 Seahawk|SH-60B Seahawk]].<ref name=\"Leoni p217-8\">Leoni 2007, pp. 217\u2013218.</ref> Its external lift capacity increased by {{convert|1000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} up to {{convert|9000|lb|kg|abbr=on|sigfig=2}}.

Soldiers pinned down in the field requiring quick resupply have depended on speed bags, bags filled with items airdropped from a UH-60.  However, all systems were ad-hoc with bags not made to keep things secure from impacts, so up to half of the airdropped items would be damaged upon hitting the ground.  Started in 2011, the ESBS sought to standardize the airdrop resupply method and keep up to 90 percent of supplies intact.  The system includes a hands-free reusable linear brake and expendable speed line and multipurpose cargo bag; when the bag is deployed, the brake applies friction to the rope, slowing it down enough to keep the bag oriented down on the padded base, a [[honeycomb]] and foam kit inside to dissipate energy.  The ESBS not only better protects helicopter-dropped supplies, it allows the Black Hawk to fly higher above the ground, {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} up from 10 feet, while traveling {{convert|20|knot|mph km/h}}, limiting exposure to ground fire.  Each bag can weigh {{convert|125-200|lb|kg|abbr=on}} and up to six can be deployed at once, dropping {{convert|40-50|ft/s|m/s}}.  Since supplies can be delivered more accurately and the system can be automatically released on its own, the ESBS can enable autonomous resupply from unmanned helicopters.<ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ Adding new punch to aerial deliveries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012113200/http://www.army.mil/article/109286/Adding_new_punch_to_aerial_deliveries/ |date=12 October 2015}} - Army.mil, 16 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ Picatinny 'Speed Bag' resupplies Soldiers with less equipment damage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026045822/http://www.army.mil/article/128843/Picatinny__Speed_Bag__resupplies_Soldiers_with_less_equipment_damage/ |date=26 October 2015}} - Army.mil, 25 June 2014</ref><ref>[http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ The enhanced speed bag system] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919114140/http://www.army.mil/article/150801/The_enhanced_speed_bag_system/ |date=19 September 2015}} - Army.mil, 7 July 2015</ref>\n\n==Design==\n[[File:A U.S. Army UH-60 Black Hawk helicopter assigned to the Colorado Army National Guard flies to perform a water drop while fighting the Black Forest Fire near Colorado Springs, Colo., June 12, 2013 130612-Z-UA373-388.jpg|thumb|A view of a UH-60L cockpit]]\n\nThe UH-60 features four-blade main and tail rotors, and is powered by two [[General Electric T700]] [[turboshaft]] engines.<ref name=Harding/> The main rotor is fully articulated and has [[elastomeric]] bearings in the rotor head.

The helicopter used the company's Matrix technology (software to improve features of autonomous, optionally-piloted VTOL aircraft) to perform autonomous hover and flight operations under the control of an operator using a man-portable Ground Control Station (GCS).  The MURAL program is a cooperative effort between Sikorsky, the US Army Aviation Development Directorate (ADD), and the US Army Utility Helicopters Project Office (UH PO).  The purpose of creating an optionally-manned Black Hawk is to make the aircraft autonomously carry out resupply missions and expeditionary operations, while increasing sorties and maintaining crew rest requirements and leaving pilots to focus more on sensitive operations.<ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |title= Sikorsky achieves first flight of manned/unmanned Black Hawk |newspaper= Flight global |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20140426022614/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/sikorsky-achieves-first-flight-of-mannedunmanned-black-398455/ |archive-date= 26 April 2014 |url-status= live}}.</ref><ref>{{Citation |url= http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |title= Optionally Piloted Black Hawk takes off |publisher= Shephard media |date= 23 April 2014 |access-date= 23 April 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150604092300/http://www.shephardmedia.com/news/rotorhub/optionally-piloted-black-hawk-takes/ |archive-date= 4 June 2015 |url-status= live}}.</ref>\n*'''VH-60D Night Hawk''': VIP-configured HH-60D, used for Presidential transport by USMC.
