Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\n\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the [[state space]] of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space.<ref>Meyn, S. Sean P., and Richard L. Tweedie. (2009) ''Markov chains and stochastic stability''. Cambridge University Press. (Preface, p. iii)</ref> However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or [[countable set|countably infinite]] state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see [[#Variations|Variations]]). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n=== Transitions ===\nThe changes of state of the system are called transitions.<ref name=\":0\"/> The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a [[stochastic matrix|transition matrix]] describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.\n\nA discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps.<ref name=\":0\"/> The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the [[integers]] or [[natural numbers]], and the random process is a mapping of these to states.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=159\u2013163}}</ref> The Markov property states that the [[conditional probability distribution]] for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.\n\nSince the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future.<ref name=\":1\"/> However, the statistical properties of the system's future can be predicted.<ref name=\":1\"/> In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.\n\n==History==\nMarkov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=2\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GrinsteadSnell1997page4643\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/flooved3489|title=Introduction to Probability|author1=Charles Miller Grinstead|author2=James Laurie Snell|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8218-0749-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flooved3489/page/n473 464]\u2013466}}</ref><ref name=\"Bremaud2013pageIX3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|title=Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues|author=Pierre Bremaud|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3124-8|page=ix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323160437/https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|archivedate=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hayes20133\">{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|year=2013|title=First links in the Markov chain|journal=American Scientist|volume=101|issue=2|pages=92\u201396|doi=10.1511/2013.101.92}}</ref> Markov processes in continuous time were discovered long before [[Andrey Markov]]'s work in the early 20th century<ref name=\":0\" /> in the form of the [[Poisson point process|Poisson process]].<ref name=\"Ross1996page235and3583\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImUPAQAAMAAJ|title=Stochastic processes|author=Sheldon M.

From any position there are two possible transitions, to the next or previous integer. The transition probabilities depend only on the current position, not on the manner in which the position was reached. For example, the transition probabilities from 5 to 4 and 5 to 6 are both 0.5, and all other transition probabilities from 5 are 0. These probabilities are independent of whether the system was previously in 4 or 6.\n\nAnother example is the dietary habits of a creature who eats only grapes, cheese, or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following rules:\n*It eats exactly once a day.\n*If it ate cheese today, tomorrow it will eat lettuce or grapes with equal probability.\n*If it ate grapes today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10, and lettuce with probability 5/10.\n*If it ate lettuce today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10. It will not eat lettuce again tomorrow.\nThis creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice tomorrow depends solely on what it ate today, not what it ate yesterday or any other time in the past. One statistical property that could be calculated is the expected percentage, over a long period, of the days on which the creature will eat grapes.\n\nA series of independent events (for example, a series of coin flips) satisfies the formal definition of a Markov chain. However, the theory is usually applied only when the probability distribution of the next step depends non-trivially on the current state.\n\n===A non-Markov example===\nSuppose that there is a coin purse containing five quarters (each worth 25\u00a2), five dimes (each worth 10\u00a2), and five nickels (each worth 5\u00a2), and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If <math>X_n</math> represents the total value of the coins set on the table after {{mvar|n}} draws, with <math>X_0 = 0</math>, then the sequence <math>\\{X_n : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''not'' a Markov process.\n\nTo see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus <math>X_6 = \\$0.50</math>. If we know not just <math>X_6</math>, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that <math>X_7 \\geq \\$0.60</math> with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value <math>X_6</math> we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about <math>X_7</math> are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to <math>X_6</math>.\n\nHowever, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''total value'' of the coins on the table, we could define <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''count'' of the various coin types on the table. For instance, <math>X_6 = 1,0,5</math> could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model would be represented by 216 possible states (that is, 6x6x6 states, since each of the three coin types could have zero to five coins on the table by the end of the 6 draws). Suppose that the first draw results in state <math>X_1 = 0,1,0</math>. The probability of achieving <math>X_2</math> now depends on <math>X_1</math>; for example, the state <math>X_2 = 1,0,1</math> is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the <math>X_n = i,j,k</math> state depends exclusively on the outcome of the <math>X_{n-1}= \\ell,m,p</math> state.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\n===Discrete-time Markov chain===\nA discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... with the [[Markov property]], namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \\ldots, X_n=x_n) = \\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n),</math> if both [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]] are well defined, that is, if <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\ldots,X_n=x_n)>0.</math>\n\nThe possible values of ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> form a [[countable set]] ''S'' called the state space of the chain.\n\nMarkov chains are often described by a sequence of [[directed graph]]s, where the edges of graph ''n'' are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time ''n'' to the other states at time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n).</math> The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time ''n'' to time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of ''n'' and are thus not presented as sequences.\n\nThese descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1).</math> When time-homogeneous, the chain can be interpreted as a state machine assigning a probability of hopping from each vertex or state to an adjacent one. The probability <math>\\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_1=x_1)</math> of the machine's state can be analyzed as the statistical behavior of the machine with an element <math>x_1</math> of the state space as input, or as the behavior of the machine with the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=y)=[x_1=y]</math> of states as input, where <math>[P]</math> is the [[Iverson bracket]].\n\nThe fact that some sequences of states might have zero probability of occurring corresponds to a graph with multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]], where we omit edges that would carry a zero transition probability. For example, if ''a'' has a nonzero probability of going to ''b'', but ''a'' and ''x'' lie in different connected components of the graph, then <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_n=a)</math> is defined, while <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_1=x, \\ldots, X_n=a)</math> is not.\n\n====Variations====\n*{{Anchor|homogeneous}}Time-homogeneous Markov chains (or stationary Markov chains) are processes where\n::<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=y) = \\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_{n-1}=y)</math>\n:for all ''n''. The probability of the transition is independent of ''n''.\n*A Markov chain with memory (or a Markov chain of order ''m'')\n:where ''m'' is finite, is a process satisfying\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots , X_1=x_1) \\\\\n= &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots, X_{n-m}=x_{n-m})\n\\text{ for }n > m\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n:In other words, the future state depends on the past ''m'' states. It is possible to construct a chain <math>(Y_n)</math> from <math>(X_n)</math> which has the 'classical' Markov property by taking as state space the ordered ''m''-tuples of ''X'' values, ie. <math>Y_n= \\left( X_n,X_{n-1},\\ldots,X_{n-m+1} \\right)</math>.\n\n===Continuous-time Markov chain===\n{{See also | Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process)}}\nA continuous-time Markov chain (''X''<sub>''t''</sub>)<sub>''t''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0</sub> is defined by a finite or countable state space ''S'', a [[transition rate matrix]] ''Q'' with dimensions equal to that of the state space and initial probability distribution defined on the state space. For ''i''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''j'', the elements ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub> are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state ''i'' to state ''j''. The elements ''q''<sub>''ii''</sub> are chosen such that each row of the transition rate matrix sums to zero, while the row-sums of a probability transition matrix in a (discrete) Markov chain are all equal to one.\n\nThere are three equivalent definitions of the process.<ref name=\"norris1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains|year=1997|isbn=9780511810633|pages=60\u2013107|chapter=Continuous-time Markov chains I|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511810633.004|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Norris|first1=J.

If there is more than one unit eigenvector then a weighted sum of the corresponding stationary states is also a stationary state. But for a Markov chain one is usually more interested in a stationary state that is the limit of the sequence of distributions for some initial distribution.\n\nThe values of a stationary distribution <math> \\textstyle \\pi_i </math> are associated with the state space of '''P''' and its eigenvectors have their relative proportions preserved. Since the components of &pi; are positive and the constraint that their sum is unity can be rewritten as <math>\\textstyle \\sum_i 1 \\cdot \\pi_i=1</math> we see that the dot product of &pi; with a vector whose components are all 1 is unity and that &pi; lies on a [[standard simplex|simplex]].\n\n====Time-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state space====\n{{No footnotes\n|date= February 2012\n|section}}\nIf the Markov chain is time-homogeneous, then the transition matrix '''P''' is the same after each step, so the ''k''-step transition probability can be computed as the ''k''-th power of the transition matrix, '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.\n\nIf the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then there is a unique stationary distribution {{pi}}.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal|last=Serfozo|first=Richard|date=2009|title=Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes|url=https://archive.org/details/basicsappliedsto00serf_111|url-access=registration|journal=Probability and Its Applications|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5|issn=1431-7028|isbn=978-3-540-89331-8}}</ref> Additionally, in this case '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup> converges to a rank-one matrix in which each row is the stationary distribution {{pi}}:\n:<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k=\\mathbf{1}\\pi</math>\nwhere '''1''' is the column vector with all entries equal to 1. This is stated by the [[Perron\u2013Frobenius theorem]]. If, by whatever means, <math>\\scriptstyle \\lim_{k\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k</math> is found, then the stationary distribution of the Markov chain in question can be easily determined for any starting distribution, as will be explained below.\n\nFor some stochastic matrices '''P''', the limit <math>\\scriptstyle \\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k</math> does not exist while the stationary distribution does, as shown by this example:\n:<math>\\mathbf P=\\begin{pmatrix} 0& 1\\\\ 1& 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\qquad \\mathbf P^{2k}=I \\qquad \\mathbf P^{2k+1}=\\mathbf P</math>\n:<math>\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2}&\\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix} 0& 1\\\\ 1& 0 \\end{pmatrix}=\\begin{pmatrix}\\frac{1}{2}&\\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n(This example illustrates a periodic Markov chain.)\n\nBecause there are a number of different special cases to consider, the process of finding this limit if it exists can be a lengthy task. However, there are many techniques that can assist in finding this limit. Let '''P''' be an ''n''\u00d7''n'' matrix, and define <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{Q} = \\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k.</math>\n\nIt is always true that\n:<math>\\mathbf{QP} = \\mathbf{Q}.</math>\n\nSubtracting '''Q''' from both sides and factoring then yields\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q}(\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}_{n}) = \\mathbf{0}_{n,n} ,</math>\nwhere '''I'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'', and '''0'''<sub>''n'',''n''</sub> is the [[zero matrix]] of size ''n''\u00d7''n''. Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so '''Q''' must be a [[stochastic matrix]] (see the definition above). It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above and the fact that '''Q''' is a stochastic matrix to solve for '''Q'''. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in '''P''' is 1, there are ''n+1'' equations for determining ''n'' unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in '''Q''' and substitutes each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitutes the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector '''0''', and next left-multiplies this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find '''Q'''.\n\nHere is one method for doing so: first, define the function ''f''('''A''') to return the matrix '''A''' with its right-most column replaced with all 1's.

If there is a unique stationary distribution, then the largest eigenvalue and the corresponding eigenvector is unique too (because there is no other '''{{pi}}''' which solves the stationary distribution equation above). Let '''u'''<sub>''i''</sub> be the ''i''-th column of '''U''' matrix, that is, '''u'''<sub>''i''</sub> is the left eigenvector of '''P''' corresponding to \u03bb<sub>''i''</sub>. Also let '''x''' be a length ''n'' row vector that represents a valid probability distribution; since the eigenvectors '''u'''<sub>''i''</sub> span <math>\\R^n,</math> we can write\n:<math> \\mathbf{x}^T = \\sum_{i=1}^n a_i \\mathbf{u}_i, \\qquad a_i \\in \\R.</math>\n\nIf we multiply '''x''' with '''P''' from right and continue this operation with the results, in the end we get the stationary distribution '''{{pi}}'''.

The main idea is to see if there is a point in the state space that the chain hits with probability one. Generally, it is not true for continuous state space, however, we can define sets ''A'' and ''B'' along with a positive number ''\u03b5'' and a probability measure ''\u03c1'', such that\n:<math>\\begin{cases}\n\\text{If }\\tau_A = \\inf\\{n\\geq 0: X_n \\in A\\},&\\text{ then } P_z(\\tau_A<\\infty)>0\\text{ for all }z.\\\\\n\\text{If }x \\in A\\text{ and }C\\subset B,&\\text{ then } p(x, C)\\geq \\varepsilon \\rho(C).\n\\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen we could collapse the sets into an auxiliary point ''\u03b1'', and a recurrent [[Harris chain]] can be modified to contain ''\u03b1''. Lastly, the collection of [[Harris chain]]s is a comfortable level of generality, which is broad enough to contain a large number of interesting examples, yet restrictive enough to allow for a rich theory.\n\nThe use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.\n\n====Locally interacting Markov chains====\nConsidering a collection of Markov chains whose evolution takes in account the state of other Markov chains, is related to the notion of [[locally interacting Markov chains]]. This corresponds to the situation when the state space has a (Cartesian-) product form.\nSee [[interacting particle system]] and [[stochastic cellular automata]] (probabilistic cellular automata).\nSee for instance ''Interaction of Markov Processes''<ref>{{cite journal|last=Spitzer|first=Frank|year=1970|title=Interaction of Markov Processes|journal=Advances in Mathematics|volume=5|issue=2|pages=246\u2013290|doi=10.1016/0001-8708(70)90034-4}}</ref>\nor<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Wa7AAAAIAAJ&pg=PA181&lpg=PA181&dq=locally+interacting+markov+chains+toom+Dobrushin#v=onepage&q=locally%20interacting%20markov%20chains%20toom%20Dobrushin&f=false|title=Stochastic Cellular Systems: Ergodicity, Memory, Morphogenesis|author1=R.

Formally, state ''j'' is accessible from state ''i'' if there exists an integer ''n<sub>ij</sub>''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0 such that\n\n:<math> \\Pr(X_{n_{ij}}=j \\mid X_0=i) = p_{ij}^{(n_{ij})} > 0.</math>\n\nThis integer is allowed to be different for each pair of states, hence the subscripts in n<sub>ij</sub>.\nAllowing ''n'' to be zero means that every state is accessible from itself by definition. The accessibility relation is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily symmetric.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to communicate with state ''j'' (written ''i''&nbsp;\u2194&nbsp;''j'') if both ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' and ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A communicating class is a maximal set of states ''C'' such that every pair of states in ''C'' communicates with each other. Communication is an [[equivalence relation]], and communicating classes are the [[equivalence class]]es of this relation.\n\nA communicating class is closed if the probability of leaving the class is zero, namely if ''i'' is in ''C'' but ''j'' is not, then ''j'' is not accessible from&nbsp;''i''. The set of communicating classes forms a [[directed acyclic graph|directed, acyclic graph]] by inheriting the arrows from the original state space. A communicating class is closed if and only if it has no outgoing arrows in this graph.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to be essential or final if for all ''j'' such that ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' it is also true that ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A state ''i'' is inessential if it is not essential.<ref>{{cite book|last=Asher Levin|first=David|title=Markov chains and mixing times|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-8218-4739-8|year=2009|accessdate=2016-03-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205163334/https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-02-05}}</ref> A state is final if and only if its communicating class is closed.\n\nA Markov chain is said to be irreducible if its state space is a single communicating class; in other words, if it is possible to get to any state from any state.\n\n===Periodicity===\nA state <math>i</math> has period <math>k</math> if any return to state <math>i</math> must occur in multiples of <math>k</math> time steps.

Otherwise the period is not defined. Note that even though a state has period <math>k</math>, it may not be possible to reach the state in <math>k</math> steps. For example, suppose it is possible to return to the state in <math>\\{6,~8,~10,~12,\\dots\\}</math> time steps; <math>k</math> would be <math>2</math>, even though <math>2</math> does not appear in this list.\n\nIf <math>k = 1</math>, then the state is said to be aperiodic.\nOtherwise (<math> k > 1</math>), the state is said to be periodic with period&nbsp;<math>k</math>. A Markov chain is aperiodic if every state is aperiodic. An irreducible Markov chain only needs one aperiodic state to imply all states are aperiodic.\n\nEvery state of a [[bipartite graph]] has an even period.\n\n==={{anchor|Transience}}{{anchor|Recurrence}}Transience and recurrence===\nA state ''i'' is said to be transient if, given that we start in state ''i'', there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to ''i''.

In other words, a state ''i'' is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of ''1'', and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.\n\nIt can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number ''N'' such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number ''N''. In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.\n\n===Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions===\nIf the Markov chain is a [[time-homogeneous Markov chain]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wan|first=Lijie|last2=Lou|first2=Wenjie|last3=Abner|first3=Erin|last4=Kryscio|first4=Richard J.|date=2016|title=A comparison of time-homogeneous Markov chain and Markov process multi-state models|journal=Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications|volume=2|issue=3\u20134|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.1080/23737484.2017.1361366|issn=2373-7484|pmc=5803756|pmid=29430521}}</ref> so that the process is described by a single, [[time-independent matrix]] <math>p_{ij}</math>, then the vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is called a stationary distribution (or [[invariant measure]]) if <math>\\forall j \\in S</math> it satisfies\n\n:<math>0\\leq\\pi_j\\leq1.</math>\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\in S}\\pi_j = 1.</math>\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i p_{ij}.</math>\n\nAn irreducible chain has a positive stationary distribution (a stationary distribution such that <math>\\forall i, \\pi_i > 0</math>) if and only if all of its states are positive recurrent.<ref>{{citation\n|last= Serfozo\n|first= Richard\n|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5\n|isbn= 978-3-540-89331-8\n|mr= 2484222\n|page= 35\n|title= Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|year= 2009\n|journal= Probability and Its Applications\n|url-status= live\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319050311/https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|archivedate= 2015-03-19\n}}</ref> In that case, {{pi}} is unique and is related to the expected return time:\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\frac{C}{M_j}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>C</math> is the normalizing constant.

Such can occur in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in situations where a number of different transition matrices are used, because each is efficient for a particular kind of mixing, but each matrix respects a shared equilibrium distribution.\n\n===Reversible Markov chain{{Anchor|detailed balance}}===\nA Markov chain is said to be reversible if there is a probability distribution '''{{pi}}''' over its states such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_{n} = i) = \\pi_j \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i \\mid X_{n} = j)</math>\n\nfor all times ''n'' and all states ''i'' and ''j''.

This can be shown more formally by the equality\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\pi_i p_{ij} = \\sum_i \\pi_j p_{ji} = \\pi_j \\sum_i p_{ji} = \\pi_j\\,,</math>\n\nwhich essentially states that the total amount of money person ''j'' receives (including from himself) during the time-step equals the amount of money he pays others, which equals all the money he initially had because it was assumed that all money is spent (that is, ''p<sub>ji</sub>'' sums to 1 over ''i''). The assumption is a technical one, because the money not really used is simply thought of as being paid from person ''j'' to himself (that is, ''p<sub>jj</sub>'' is not necessarily zero).\n\nAs ''n'' was arbitrary, this reasoning holds for any ''n'', and therefore for reversible Markov chains '''{{pi}}''' is always a steady-state distribution of Pr(''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i'') for every&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIf the Markov chain begins in the steady-state distribution, that is, if <math>Pr(X_0=i)=\\pi_i</math>, then <math>Pr(X_n=i)=\\pi_i</math> for all <math>n</math> and the detailed balance equation can be written as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n} = i, X_{n+1} = j) = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i, X_{n} = j)\\,.</math>\n\nThe left- and right-hand sides of this last equation are identical except for a reversing of the time indices ''n'' and&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible directly from the transition matrix probabilities. The criterion requires that the products of probabilities around every closed loop are the same in both directions around the loop.\n\nReversible Markov chains are common in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches because the detailed balance equation for a desired distribution '''{{pi}}''' necessarily implies that the Markov chain has been constructed so that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution. Even with time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, where multiple transition matrices are used, if each such transition matrix exhibits detailed balance with the desired '''{{pi}}''' distribution, this necessarily implies that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution of the Markov chain.\n\n===Markovian representations===\nIn some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the 'current' and 'future' states. For example, let ''X'' be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process ''Y'', such that each state of ''Y'' represents a time-interval of states of ''X''. Mathematically, this takes the form:\n:<math>Y(t) = \\big\\{ X(s): s \\in [a(t), b(t)] \\, \\big\\}.</math>\nIf ''Y'' has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of ''X''.\n\nAn example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an [[autoregressive model|autoregressive]] [[time series]] of order greater than one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doblinger |first1=G. |title=Smoothing of noisy AR signals using an adaptive Kalman filter |journal=9th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 1998) |date=September 1998 |pages=781\u2013784 |url=https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-et_3285.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Transient evolution===\nThe probability of going from state ''i'' to state ''j'' in ''n'' time steps is\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_n=j\\mid X_0=i) </math>\n\nand the single-step transition is\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_1=j\\mid X_0=i). </math>\n\nFor a time-homogeneous Markov chain:\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_{k+n}=j \\mid X_{k}=i) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{k+1}=j \\mid X_k=i). </math>\n\nThe ''n''-step transition probabilities satisfy the [[Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation]], that for any ''k'' such that 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'',\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{ir}^{(k)} p_{rj}^{(n-k)}</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the state space of the Markov chain.\n\nThe [[marginal distribution]] Pr(''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'') is the distribution over states at time ''n''.

The general ''Q'' matrix for such a process is the following 2&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;2 matrix with ''\u03b1'',''\u03b2''&nbsp;>&nbsp;0\n:<math>Q = \\begin{pmatrix} -\\alpha & \\alpha \\\\ \\beta & -\\beta \\end{pmatrix}.</math>\n\nThe above relation for forward matrix can be solved explicitly in this case to give\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nHowever, direct solutions are complicated to compute for larger matrices. The fact that ''Q'' is the generator for a [[semigroup]] of matrices\n:<math>P(t+s) = e^{(t+s)Q} = e^{tQ} e^{sQ} = P(t) P(s)</math>\nis used.\n\n===Stationary distribution===\nThe stationary distribution for an irreducible recurrent CTMC is the probability distribution to which the process converges for large values of ''t''. Observe that for the two-state process considered earlier with P(''t'') given by\n:<math>P(t) = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} - \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} + \\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta}e^{-(\\alpha+\\beta)t}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nas ''t''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;\u221e the distribution tends to\n:<math>P_\\pi = \\begin{pmatrix}\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta} \\\\\n\\frac{\\beta}{\\alpha+\\beta} &\n\\frac{\\alpha}{\\alpha+\\beta}\n\\end{pmatrix}</math>\nObserve that each row has the same distribution as this does not depend on starting state.

There is a bidirectional secret passage between states 2 and 8.]]\nThe image to the right describes a discrete-time Markov chain with state-space {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}. The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the monsters move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions. Entries with probability zero are removed in the following transition matrix:\n\n<math>Q=\\begin{pmatrix} & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}&&&\\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n\\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & \\frac{1}{3} & & \\frac{1}{3} & & & & \\frac{1}{3}\\\\\n& & & \\frac{1}{2} & & & & \\frac{1}{2}\\\\\n& \\frac{1}{4} & && \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4} & & \\frac{1}{4}\\\\\n& & & & & \\frac{1}{2} & & \\frac{1}{2}\\end{pmatrix}</math>\n\nThis Markov chain is irreducible, because the ghosts can fly from every state to every state in a finite amount of time. Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving {{pi}}&nbsp;''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is <math>\\pi=(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)\\%.</math>\nThe central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.\n\n===Hitting times===\n{{Main|Phase-type distribution}}The hitting time is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.\n\n====Expected hitting times====\nFor a subset of states ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''S'', the vector ''k''<sup>''A''</sup> of hitting times (where element <math> k_i^A </math> represents the [[expected value]], starting in state ''i'' that the chain enters one of the states in the set ''A'') is the minimal non-negative solution to<ref name=\"norris2\" />\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nk_i^A = 0 & \\text{ for } i \\in A\\\\\n-\\sum_{j \\in S} q_{ij} k_j^A = 1&\\text{ for } i \\notin A.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Time reversal===\nFor a CTMC ''X''<sub>''t''</sub>, the time-reversed process is defined to be <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat X_t = X_{T-t}</math>. By [[Kelly's lemma]] this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.\n\nA chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. [[Kolmogorov's criterion]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.\n\n=== Embedded Markov chain <!-- Embedded Markov chain redirects here --> ===\n\nOne method of finding the [[stationary probability distribution]], {{pi}}, of an [[ergodic]] continuous-time Markov chain, ''Q'', is by first finding its '''embedded Markov chain (EMC)'''. Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a '''[[jump process]]'''. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, ''S'', is denoted by ''s''<sub>''ij''</sub>, and represents the [[conditional probability]] of transitioning from state ''i'' into state ''j''. These conditional probabilities may be found by\n\n:<math>\ns_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{q_{ij}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} q_{ik}} & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFrom this, ''S'' may be written as\n:<math>S = I - \\left( \\operatorname{diag}(Q) \\right)^{-1} Q</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] and diag(''Q'') is the [[diagonal matrix]] formed by selecting the [[main diagonal]] from the matrix ''Q'' and setting all other elements to zero.\n\nTo find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find <math>\\varphi</math> such that\n:<math>\\varphi S = \\varphi, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi</math> being a row vector, such that all elements in <math>\\varphi</math> are greater than 0 and [[norm (mathematics)|<math>\\|\\varphi\\|_1</math>]] = 1. From this, {{pi}} may be found as\n:<math>\\pi = {-\\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\over \\left\\| \\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\right\\|_1}.</math>\n\n(''S'' may be periodic, even if ''Q'' is not. Once {{pi}} is found, it must be normalized to a [[unit vector]].)\n\nAnother discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a \u03b4-skeleton&mdash;the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing ''X''(''t'') at intervals of \u03b4 units of time. The random variables ''X''(0),&nbsp;''X''(\u03b4),&nbsp;''X''(2\u03b4),&nbsp;... give the sequence of states visited by the \u03b4-skeleton.\n\n== Special types of Markov chains ==\n\n=== Markov model ===\n{{Main|Markov model}}\nMarkov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n!\n!System state is fully observable\n!System state is partially observable\n|-\n!System is autonomous\n|Markov chain\n|[[Hidden Markov model]]\n|-\n!System is controlled\n|[[Markov decision process]]\n|[[Partially observable Markov decision process]]\n|}\n\n===Bernoulli scheme===\n{{Main|Bernoulli scheme}}\nA [[Bernoulli scheme]] is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is even independent of the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states). A Bernoulli scheme with only two possible states is known as a [[Bernoulli process]].\n\n==Applications==\nResearch has reported the application and usefulness of Markov chains in a wide range of topics such as physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, music, game theory and sports.\n\n===Physics===\nMarkovian systems appear extensively in [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], whenever probabilities are used to represent unknown or unmodelled details of the system, if it can be assumed that the dynamics are time-invariant, and that no relevant history need be considered which is not already included in the state description.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics |first=Richard |last=Fitzpatrick |url=https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermal.pdf |accessdate=2017-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130172856/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermal.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-30 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite journal|last=van Ravenzwaaij|first=Don|last2=Cassey|first2=Pete|last3=Brown|first3=Scott D.|date=2016-03-11|title=A simple introduction to Markov Chain Monte\u2013Carlo sampling|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=143\u2013154|doi=10.3758/s13423-016-1015-8|pmid=26968853|pmc=5862921|issn=1069-9384}}</ref> For example, a thermodynamic state operates under a probability distribution that is difficult or expensive to acquire.

For example, imagine a large number ''n'' of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is ''n'' times the probability a given molecule is in that state.\n\nThe classical model of enzyme activity, [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics]], can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step the reaction proceeds in some direction. While Michaelis-Menten is fairly straightforward, far more complicated reaction networks can also be modeled with Markov chains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Chao|last2=Kou|first2=S.

Due to [[steric effects]], second-order Markov effects may also play a role in the growth of some polymer chains.\n\nSimilarly, it has been suggested that the crystallization and growth of some epitaxial [[superlattice]] oxide materials can be accurately described by Markov chains.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kopp |first1= V.

For example, an [[M/M/1 queue]] is a CTMC on the non-negative integers where upward transitions from ''i'' to ''i''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 occur at rate ''\u03bb'' according to a [[Poisson process]] and describe job arrivals, while transitions from ''i'' to ''i''&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;1 (for ''i''&nbsp;>&nbsp;1) occur at rate ''\u03bc'' (job service times are exponentially distributed) and describe completed services (departures) from the queue.\n\n===Internet applications===\n[[File:PageRank_with_Markov_Chain.png|right|thumb|A state diagram that represents the PageRank algorithm with a transitional probability of M, or <math>\\frac{\\alpha}{k_i} + \\frac{1-\\alpha}{N}</math>.]]\nThe [[PageRank]] of a webpage as used by [[Google]] is defined by a Markov chain.<ref>{{US patent|6285999}}</ref><ref name=\"BrijP.2016\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ctk6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA448|title=Handbook of Research on Modern Cryptographic Solutions for Computer and Cyber Security|author1=Gupta, Brij|author2=Agrawal, Dharma P.|author3=Yamaguchi, Shingo|date=16 May 2016|publisher=IGI Global|isbn=978-1-5225-0106-0|pages=448\u2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323150736/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ctk6DAAAQBAJ&pg=PA448|archivedate=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"LangvilleMeyer2006\">{{cite journal|last1=Langville|first1=Amy N.|last2=Meyer|first2=Carl D.|year=2006|title=A Reordering for the PageRank Problem|url=http://meyer.math.ncsu.edu/Meyer/PS_Files/ReorderingPageRank.pdf|url-status=live|journal=SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing|volume=27|issue=6|pages=2112\u20132113|citeseerx=10.1.1.58.8652|doi=10.1137/040607551|issn=1064-8275|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921211826/http://meyer.math.ncsu.edu/Meyer/PS_Files/ReorderingPageRank.pdf|archivedate=2017-09-21}}</ref> It is the probability to be at page <math>i</math> in the stationary distribution on the following Markov chain on all (known) webpages.

In current research, it is common to use a Markov chain <!-- this is actually a Markov perefect equilibria, not simply a Markov chain, I'll try to remember get back to this ~~~~ --> to model how once a country reaches a specific level of economic development, the configuration of structural factors, such as size of the [[middle class]], the ratio of urban to rural residence, the rate of [[political]] mobilization, etc., will generate a higher probability of transitioning from [[authoritarian]] to [[democratic regime|democratic]] regime.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Acemoglu |first= Daron |author2=Georgy Egorov |author3=Konstantin Sonin |title= Political model of social evolution |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year= 2011 |volume= 108 |pages= 21292\u201321296 |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.4/21292.short |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130415155803/http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.4/21292.short |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2013-04-15 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1019454108 |pmid= 22198760 |pmc= 3271566 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.225.6090 |bibcode= 2011PNAS..10821292A}}</ref>\n\n===Games===\nMarkov chains can be used to model many games of chance.<ref name=\":0\"/> The children's games [[Snakes and Ladders]] and \"[[Hi Ho!

In a first-order chain, the states of the system become note or pitch values, and a [[probability vector]] for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be [[MIDI]] note values, frequency ([[Hertz|Hz]]), or any other desirable metric.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Making Music with Algorithms: A Case-Study System |author1=K McAlpine |author2=E Miranda |author3=S Hoggar |journal=Computer Music Journal |issue=2 |year=1999 |volume=23 |doi=10.1162/014892699559733 |pages=19\u201330}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left\"\n|+ 1st-order matrix\n!

Usually the term \"Markov chain\" is reserved for a process with a discrete set of times, that is, a '''discrete-time Markov chain (DTMC)''',<ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\"Everitt, B.S. 2002\">Everitt, B.S. (2002) ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Statistics''. CUP. {{ISBN|0-521-81099-X}}</ref><ref name=\"Everitt, B.S. 2002\"/> but a few authors use the term \"Markov process\" to refer to a '''continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC)''' without explicit mention.<ref>Parzen, E.

''The Oxford Dictionary of Statistical Terms'', OUP. {{ISBN|0-19-920613-9}}</ref> In addition, there are other extensions of Markov processes that are referred to as such but do not necessarily fall within any of these four categories (see [[Markov model]]). Moreover, the time index need not necessarily be real-valued; like with the state space, there are conceivable processes that move through index sets with other mathematical constructs. Notice that the general state space continuous-time Markov chain is general to such a degree that it has no designated term.\n\nWhile the time parameter is usually discrete, the [[state space]] of a Markov chain does not have any generally agreed-on restrictions: the term may refer to a process on an arbitrary state space.<ref>Meyn, S. Sean P., and Richard L. Tweedie. (2009) ''Markov chains and stochastic stability''. Cambridge University Press. (Preface, p. iii)</ref> However, many applications of Markov chains employ finite or [[countable set|countably infinite]] state spaces, which have a more straightforward statistical analysis. Besides time-index and state-space parameters, there are many other variations, extensions and generalizations (see [[#Variations|Variations]]). For simplicity, most of this article concentrates on the discrete-time, discrete state-space case, unless mentioned otherwise.\n\n=== Transitions ===\nThe changes of state of the system are called transitions.<ref name=\":0\"/> The probabilities associated with various state changes are called transition probabilities. The process is characterized by a state space, a [[stochastic matrix|transition matrix]] describing the probabilities of particular transitions, and an initial state (or initial distribution) across the state space. By convention, we assume all possible states and transitions have been included in the definition of the process, so there is always a next state, and the process does not terminate.\n\nA discrete-time random process involves a system which is in a certain state at each step, with the state changing randomly between steps.<ref name=\":0\"/> The steps are often thought of as moments in time, but they can equally well refer to physical distance or any other discrete measurement. Formally, the steps are the [[integers]] or [[natural numbers]], and the random process is a mapping of these to states.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=159\u2013163}}</ref> The Markov property states that the [[conditional probability distribution]] for the system at the next step (and in fact at all future steps) depends only on the current state of the system, and not additionally on the state of the system at previous steps.\n\nSince the system changes randomly, it is generally impossible to predict with certainty the state of a Markov chain at a given point in the future.<ref name=\":1\"/> However, the statistical properties of the system's future can be predicted.<ref name=\":1\"/> In many applications, it is these statistical properties that are important.\n\n==History==\nMarkov studied Markov processes in the early 20th century, publishing his first paper on the topic in 1906.<ref>{{cite book|title=Markov Chains: From Theory to Implementation and Experimentation|last=Gagniuc|first=Paul A.|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|year=2017|isbn=978-1-119-38755-8|location=USA, NJ|pages=2\u20138}}</ref><ref name=\"GrinsteadSnell1997page4643\">{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/flooved3489|title=Introduction to Probability|author1=Charles Miller Grinstead|author2=James Laurie Snell|publisher=American Mathematical Soc.|year=1997|isbn=978-0-8218-0749-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/flooved3489/page/n473 464]\u2013466}}</ref><ref name=\"Bremaud2013pageIX3\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|title=Markov Chains: Gibbs Fields, Monte Carlo Simulation, and Queues|author=Pierre Bremaud|date=9 March 2013|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4757-3124-8|page=ix|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170323160437/https://books.google.com/books?id=jrPVBwAAQBAJ|archivedate=23 March 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Hayes20133\">{{cite journal|last1=Hayes|first1=Brian|year=2013|title=First links in the Markov chain|journal=American Scientist|volume=101|issue=2|pages=92\u201396|doi=10.1511/2013.101.92}}</ref> Markov processes in continuous time were discovered long before [[Andrey Markov]]'s work in the early 20th century<ref name=\":0\" /> in the form of the [[Poisson point process|Poisson process]].<ref name=\"Ross1996page235and3583\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImUPAQAAMAAJ|title=Stochastic processes|author=Sheldon M.

From any position there are two possible transitions, to the next or previous integer. The transition probabilities depend only on the current position, not on the manner in which the position was reached. For example, the transition probabilities from 5 to 4 and 5 to 6 are both 0.5, and all other transition probabilities from 5 are 0. These probabilities are independent of whether the system was previously in 4 or 6.\n\nAnother example is the dietary habits of a creature who eats only grapes, cheese, or lettuce, and whose dietary habits conform to the following rules:\n*It eats exactly once a day.\n*If it ate cheese today, tomorrow it will eat lettuce or grapes with equal probability.\n*If it ate grapes today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 1/10, cheese with probability 4/10, and lettuce with probability 5/10.\n*If it ate lettuce today, tomorrow it will eat grapes with probability 4/10 or cheese with probability 6/10. It will not eat lettuce again tomorrow.\nThis creature's eating habits can be modeled with a Markov chain since its choice tomorrow depends solely on what it ate today, not what it ate yesterday or any other time in the past. One statistical property that could be calculated is the expected percentage, over a long period, of the days on which the creature will eat grapes.\n\nA series of independent events (for example, a series of coin flips) satisfies the formal definition of a Markov chain. However, the theory is usually applied only when the probability distribution of the next step depends non-trivially on the current state.\n\n===A non-Markov example===\nSuppose that there is a coin purse containing five quarters (each worth 25\u00a2), five dimes (each worth 10\u00a2), and five nickels (each worth 5\u00a2), and one by one, coins are randomly drawn from the purse and are set on a table. If <math>X_n</math> represents the total value of the coins set on the table after {{mvar|n}} draws, with <math>X_0 = 0</math>, then the sequence <math>\\{X_n : n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\}</math> is ''not'' a Markov process.\n\nTo see why this is the case, suppose that in the first six draws, all five nickels and a quarter are drawn. Thus <math>X_6 = \\$0.50</math>. If we know not just <math>X_6</math>, but the earlier values as well, then we can determine which coins have been drawn, and we know that the next coin will not be a nickel; so we can determine that <math>X_7 \\geq \\$0.60</math> with probability 1. But if we do not know the earlier values, then based only on the value <math>X_6</math> we might guess that we had drawn four dimes and two nickels, in which case it would certainly be possible to draw another nickel next. Thus, our guesses about <math>X_7</math> are impacted by our knowledge of values prior to <math>X_6</math>.\n\nHowever, it is possible to model this scenario as a Markov process. Instead of defining <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''total value'' of the coins on the table, we could define <math>X_n</math> to represent the ''count'' of the various coin types on the table. For instance, <math>X_6 = 1,0,5</math> could be defined to represent the state where there is one quarter, zero dimes, and five nickels on the table after 6 one-by-one draws. This new model would be represented by 216 possible states (that is, 6x6x6 states, since each of the three coin types could have zero to five coins on the table by the end of the 6 draws). Suppose that the first draw results in state <math>X_1 = 0,1,0</math>. The probability of achieving <math>X_2</math> now depends on <math>X_1</math>; for example, the state <math>X_2 = 1,0,1</math> is not possible. After the second draw, the third draw depends on which coins have so far been drawn, but no longer only on the coins that were drawn for the first state (since probabilistically important information has since been added to the scenario). In this way, the likelihood of the <math>X_n = i,j,k</math> state depends exclusively on the outcome of the <math>X_{n-1}= \\ell,m,p</math> state.\n\n==Formal definition==\n\n===Discrete-time Markov chain===\nA discrete-time Markov chain is a sequence of [[random variable]]s ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, ''X''<sub>3</sub>, ... with the [[Markov property]], namely that the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the present state and not on the previous states:\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_1=x_1, X_2=x_2, \\ldots, X_n=x_n) = \\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n),</math> if both [[conditional probability|conditional probabilities]] are well defined, that is, if <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1,\\ldots,X_n=x_n)>0.</math>\n\nThe possible values of ''X''<sub>''i''</sub> form a [[countable set]] ''S'' called the state space of the chain.\n\nMarkov chains are often described by a sequence of [[directed graph]]s, where the edges of graph ''n'' are labeled by the probabilities of going from one state at time ''n'' to the other states at time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1, <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=x_n).</math> The same information is represented by the transition matrix from time ''n'' to time ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1. However, Markov chains are frequently assumed to be time-homogeneous (see variations below), in which case the graph and matrix are independent of ''n'' and are thus not presented as sequences.\n\nThese descriptions highlight the structure of the Markov chain that is independent of the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=x_1).</math> When time-homogeneous, the chain can be interpreted as a state machine assigning a probability of hopping from each vertex or state to an adjacent one. The probability <math>\\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_1=x_1)</math> of the machine's state can be analyzed as the statistical behavior of the machine with an element <math>x_1</math> of the state space as input, or as the behavior of the machine with the initial distribution <math>\\Pr(X_1=y)=[x_1=y]</math> of states as input, where <math>[P]</math> is the [[Iverson bracket]].\n\nThe fact that some sequences of states might have zero probability of occurring corresponds to a graph with multiple [[connected component (graph theory)|connected components]], where we omit edges that would carry a zero transition probability. For example, if ''a'' has a nonzero probability of going to ''b'', but ''a'' and ''x'' lie in different connected components of the graph, then <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_n=a)</math> is defined, while <math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=b\\mid X_1=x, \\ldots, X_n=a)</math> is not.\n\n====Variations====\n*{{Anchor|homogeneous}}Time-homogeneous Markov chains (or stationary Markov chains) are processes where\n::<math>\\Pr(X_{n+1}=x\\mid X_n=y) = \\Pr(X_n=x\\mid X_{n-1}=y)</math>\n:for all ''n''. The probability of the transition is independent of ''n''.\n*A Markov chain with memory (or a Markov chain of order ''m'')\n:where ''m'' is finite, is a process satisfying\n::<math>\n\\begin{align}\n{} &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots , X_1=x_1) \\\\\n= &\\Pr(X_n=x_n\\mid X_{n-1}=x_{n-1}, X_{n-2}=x_{n-2}, \\dots, X_{n-m}=x_{n-m})\n\\text{ for }n > m\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n:In other words, the future state depends on the past ''m'' states. It is possible to construct a chain <math>(Y_n)</math> from <math>(X_n)</math> which has the 'classical' Markov property by taking as state space the ordered ''m''-tuples of ''X'' values, ie. <math>Y_n= \\left( X_n,X_{n-1},\\ldots,X_{n-m+1} \\right)</math>.\n\n===Continuous-time Markov chain===\n{{See also | Kolmogorov equations (Markov jump process)}}\nA continuous-time Markov chain (''X''<sub>''t''</sub>)<sub>''t''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0</sub> is defined by a finite or countable state space ''S'', a [[transition rate matrix]] ''Q'' with dimensions equal to that of the state space and initial probability distribution defined on the state space. For ''i''&nbsp;\u2260&nbsp;''j'', the elements ''q''<sub>''ij''</sub> are non-negative and describe the rate of the process transitions from state ''i'' to state ''j''. The elements ''q''<sub>''ii''</sub> are chosen such that each row of the transition rate matrix sums to zero, while the row-sums of a probability transition matrix in a (discrete) Markov chain are all equal to one.\n\nThere are three equivalent definitions of the process.<ref name=\"norris1\">{{cite book|title=Markov Chains|year=1997|isbn=9780511810633|pages=60\u2013107|chapter=Continuous-time Markov chains I|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511810633.004|pmc=|pmid=|last1=Norris|first1=J.

If there is more than one unit eigenvector then a weighted sum of the corresponding stationary states is also a stationary state. But for a Markov chain one is usually more interested in a stationary state that is the limit of the sequence of distributions for some initial distribution.\n\nThe values of a stationary distribution <math> \\textstyle \\pi_i </math> are associated with the state space of '''P''' and its eigenvectors have their relative proportions preserved. Since the components of &pi; are positive and the constraint that their sum is unity can be rewritten as <math>\\textstyle \\sum_i 1 \\cdot \\pi_i=1</math> we see that the dot product of &pi; with a vector whose components are all 1 is unity and that &pi; lies on a [[standard simplex|simplex]].\n\n====Time-homogeneous Markov chain with a finite state space====\n{{No footnotes\n|date= February 2012\n|section}}\nIf the Markov chain is time-homogeneous, then the transition matrix '''P''' is the same after each step, so the ''k''-step transition probability can be computed as the ''k''-th power of the transition matrix, '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.\n\nIf the Markov chain is irreducible and aperiodic, then there is a unique stationary distribution {{pi}}.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite journal|last=Serfozo|first=Richard|date=2009|title=Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes|url=https://archive.org/details/basicsappliedsto00serf_111|url-access=registration|journal=Probability and Its Applications|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5|issn=1431-7028|isbn=978-3-540-89331-8}}</ref> Additionally, in this case '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup> converges to a rank-one matrix in which each row is the stationary distribution {{pi}}:\n:<math>\\lim_{k\\rightarrow\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k=\\mathbf{1}\\pi</math>\nwhere '''1''' is the column vector with all entries equal to 1.

However, there are many techniques that can assist in finding this limit. Let '''P''' be an ''n''\u00d7''n'' matrix, and define <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{Q} = \\lim\\limits_{k\\to\\infty}\\mathbf{P}^k.</math>\n\nIt is always true that\n:<math>\\mathbf{QP} = \\mathbf{Q}.</math>\n\nSubtracting '''Q''' from both sides and factoring then yields\n:<math>\\mathbf{Q}(\\mathbf{P} - \\mathbf{I}_{n}) = \\mathbf{0}_{n,n} ,</math>\nwhere '''I'''<sub>''n''</sub> is the [[identity matrix]] of size ''n'', and '''0'''<sub>''n'',''n''</sub> is the [[zero matrix]] of size ''n''\u00d7''n''. Multiplying together stochastic matrices always yields another stochastic matrix, so '''Q''' must be a [[stochastic matrix]] (see the definition above). It is sometimes sufficient to use the matrix equation above and the fact that '''Q''' is a stochastic matrix to solve for '''Q'''. Including the fact that the sum of each the rows in '''P''' is 1, there are ''n+1'' equations for determining ''n'' unknowns, so it is computationally easier if on the one hand one selects one row in '''Q''' and substitutes each of its elements by one, and on the other one substitutes the corresponding element (the one in the same column) in the vector '''0''', and next left-multiplies this latter vector by the inverse of transformed former matrix to find '''Q'''.\n\nHere is one method for doing so: first, define the function ''f''('''A''') to return the matrix '''A''' with its right-most column replaced with all 1's.

In this example, the n equations from \u201cQ multiplied by the right-most column of (P-In)\u201d have been replaced by the n stochastic ones.\nOne thing to notice is that if '''P''' has an element '''P'''<sub>''i'',''i''</sub> on its main diagonal that is equal to 1 and the ''i''th row or column is otherwise filled with 0's, then that row or column will remain unchanged in all of the subsequent powers '''P'''<sup>''k''</sup>.

Lastly, the collection of [[Harris chain]]s is a comfortable level of generality, which is broad enough to contain a large number of interesting examples, yet restrictive enough to allow for a rich theory.\n\nThe use of Markov chains in Markov chain Monte Carlo methods covers cases where the process follows a continuous state space.\n\n====Locally interacting Markov chains====\nConsidering a collection of Markov chains whose evolution takes in account the state of other Markov chains, is related to the notion of [[locally interacting Markov chains]].

Formally, state ''j'' is accessible from state ''i'' if there exists an integer ''n<sub>ij</sub>''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;0 such that\n\n:<math> \\Pr(X_{n_{ij}}=j \\mid X_0=i) = p_{ij}^{(n_{ij})} > 0.</math>\n\nThis integer is allowed to be different for each pair of states, hence the subscripts in n<sub>ij</sub>.\nAllowing ''n'' to be zero means that every state is accessible from itself by definition. The accessibility relation is reflexive and transitive, but not necessarily symmetric.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to communicate with state ''j'' (written ''i''&nbsp;\u2194&nbsp;''j'') if both ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' and ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A communicating class is a maximal set of states ''C'' such that every pair of states in ''C'' communicates with each other. Communication is an [[equivalence relation]], and communicating classes are the [[equivalence class]]es of this relation.\n\nA communicating class is closed if the probability of leaving the class is zero, namely if ''i'' is in ''C'' but ''j'' is not, then ''j'' is not accessible from&nbsp;''i''. The set of communicating classes forms a [[directed acyclic graph|directed, acyclic graph]] by inheriting the arrows from the original state space. A communicating class is closed if and only if it has no outgoing arrows in this graph.\n\nA state ''i'' is said to be essential or final if for all ''j'' such that ''i''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''j'' it is also true that ''j''&nbsp;\u2192&nbsp;''i''. A state ''i'' is inessential if it is not essential.<ref>{{cite book|last=Asher Levin|first=David|title=Markov chains and mixing times|page=16|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|isbn=978-0-8218-4739-8|year=2009|accessdate=2016-03-04|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205163334/https://books.google.com/books?id=6Cg5Nq5sSv4C&lpg=PA16&dq=essential%20class%20markov&pg=PA16#v=onepage|archivedate=2017-02-05}}</ref> A state is final if and only if its communicating class is closed.\n\nA Markov chain is said to be irreducible if its state space is a single communicating class; in other words, if it is possible to get to any state from any state.\n\n===Periodicity===\nA state <math>i</math> has period <math>k</math> if any return to state <math>i</math> must occur in multiples of <math>k</math> time steps. Formally, the [[periodic function|period]] of state <math>i</math> is defined as\n\n:<math> k = \\gcd\\{ n > 0: \\Pr(X_n = i \\mid X_0 = i) > 0\\}</math>\n\n(where <math>gcd</math> is the [[greatest common divisor]]) provided that this set is not empty. Otherwise the period is not defined. Note that even though a state has period <math>k</math>, it may not be possible to reach the state in <math>k</math> steps. For example, suppose it is possible to return to the state in <math>\\{6,~8,~10,~12,\\dots\\}</math> time steps; <math>k</math> would be <math>2</math>, even though <math>2</math> does not appear in this list.\n\nIf <math>k = 1</math>, then the state is said to be aperiodic.\nOtherwise (<math> k > 1</math>), the state is said to be periodic with period&nbsp;<math>k</math>. A Markov chain is aperiodic if every state is aperiodic. An irreducible Markov chain only needs one aperiodic state to imply all states are aperiodic.\n\nEvery state of a [[bipartite graph]] has an even period.\n\n==={{anchor|Transience}}{{anchor|Recurrence}}Transience and recurrence===\nA state ''i'' is said to be transient if, given that we start in state ''i'', there is a non-zero probability that we will never return to ''i''. Formally, let the [[random variable]] ''T<sub>i</sub>'' be the first return time to state ''i'' (the \"hitting time\"):\n\n:<math> T_i = \\inf \\{ n\\ge1: X_n = i\\}.</math>\n\nThe number\n\n:<math> f_{ii}^{(n)} = \\Pr(T_i = n \\mid X_0 = i)</math>\n\nis the probability that we return to state ''i'' for the first time after ''n'' steps.\nTherefore, state ''i'' is transient if\n\n:<math> \\Pr(T_i < \\infty \\mid X_0 = i) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty f_{ii}^{(n)} < 1. </math>\n\nState ''i'' is recurrent (or persistent) if it is not transient.\nRecurrent states are guaranteed (with probability 1) to have a finite hitting time.\nRecurrence and transience are class properties, that is, they either hold or do not hold equally for all members of a communicating class.\n\n====Mean recurrence time====\nEven if the hitting time is finite with probability ''1'', it need not have a finite [[expected value|expectation]]<!-- Should provide example later for this and reference it here -->.\nThe mean recurrence time at state ''i'' is the expected return time ''M<sub>i</sub>'':\n\n:<math> M_i = E[T_i]=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty n\\cdot f_{ii}^{(n)}.</math>\n\nState ''i'' is positive recurrent (or non-null persistent) if ''M<sub>i</sub>'' is finite; otherwise, state ''i'' is null recurrent (or null persistent).\n\n====Expected number of visits====\nIt can be shown that a state ''i'' is recurrent [[if and only if]] the expected number of visits to this state is infinite:\n\n:<math>\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty p_{ii}^{(n)} = \\infty.</math>\n\n====Absorbing states====\nA state ''i'' is called absorbing if it is impossible to leave this state.

In other words, a state ''i'' is ergodic if it is recurrent, has a period of ''1'', and has finite mean recurrence time. If all states in an irreducible Markov chain are ergodic, then the chain is said to be ergodic.\n\nIt can be shown that a finite state irreducible Markov chain is ergodic if it has an aperiodic state. More generally, a Markov chain is ergodic if there is a number ''N'' such that any state can be reached from any other state in any number of steps less or equal to a number ''N''. In case of a fully connected transition matrix, where all transitions have a non-zero probability, this condition is fulfilled with&nbsp;''N''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1.\n\nA Markov chain with more than one state and just one out-going transition per state is either not irreducible or not aperiodic, hence cannot be ergodic.\n\n===Steady-state analysis and limiting distributions===\nIf the Markov chain is a [[time-homogeneous Markov chain]],<ref>{{cite journal|last=Wan|first=Lijie|last2=Lou|first2=Wenjie|last3=Abner|first3=Erin|last4=Kryscio|first4=Richard J.|date=2016|title=A comparison of time-homogeneous Markov chain and Markov process multi-state models|journal=Communications in Statistics: Case Studies, Data Analysis and Applications|volume=2|issue=3\u20134|pages=92\u2013100|doi=10.1080/23737484.2017.1361366|issn=2373-7484|pmc=5803756|pmid=29430521}}</ref> so that the process is described by a single, [[time-independent matrix]] <math>p_{ij}</math>, then the vector <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is called a stationary distribution (or [[invariant measure]]) if <math>\\forall j \\in S</math> it satisfies\n\n:<math>0\\leq\\pi_j\\leq1.</math>\n:<math>\\sum_{j \\in S}\\pi_j = 1.</math>\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i p_{ij}.</math>\n\nAn irreducible chain has a positive stationary distribution (a stationary distribution such that <math>\\forall i, \\pi_i > 0</math>) if and only if all of its states are positive recurrent.<ref>{{citation\n|last= Serfozo\n|first= Richard\n|doi= 10.1007/978-3-540-89332-5\n|isbn= 978-3-540-89331-8\n|mr= 2484222\n|page= 35\n|title= Basics of Applied Stochastic Processes\n|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|year= 2009\n|journal= Probability and Its Applications\n|url-status= live\n|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150319050311/https://books.google.com/books?id=JBBRiuxTN0QC&pg=PA35\n|archivedate= 2015-03-19\n}}</ref> In that case, {{pi}} is unique and is related to the expected return time:\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\frac{C}{M_j}\\,,</math>\n\nwhere <math>C</math> is the normalizing constant.

If there is a probability distribution over states <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_j = \\sum_{i \\in S} \\pi_i \\, \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)</math>\n\nfor every state ''j'' and every time ''n'' then <math>\\boldsymbol{\\pi}</math> is an equilibrium distribution of the Markov chain. Such can occur in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods in situations where a number of different transition matrices are used, because each is efficient for a particular kind of mixing, but each matrix respects a shared equilibrium distribution.\n\n===Reversible Markov chain{{Anchor|detailed balance}}===\nA Markov chain is said to be reversible if there is a probability distribution '''{{pi}}''' over its states such that\n\n:<math>\\pi_i \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_{n} = i) = \\pi_j \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i \\mid X_{n} = j)</math>\n\nfor all times ''n'' and all states ''i'' and ''j''. This condition is known as the '''[[detailed balance]]''' condition (some books call it the local balance equation).\n\nConsidering a fixed arbitrary time ''n'' and using the shorthand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = j \\mid X_n = i)\\,,</math>\n\nthe detailed balance equation can be written more compactly as\n\n:<math>\\pi_i p_{ij} = \\pi_j p_{ji}\\,.</math>\n\nThe single time-step from ''n'' to ''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1 can be thought of as each person ''i'' having {{pi}}<sub>''i''</sub> dollars initially and paying each person ''j'' a fraction ''p<sub>ij</sub>'' of it. The detailed balance condition states that upon each payment, the other person pays exactly the same amount of money back.<ref name=\"Durrett2012\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|title=Essentials of Stochastic Processes|author=Richard Durrett|date=19 May 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-1-4614-3615-7|page=37|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206031627/https://books.google.com/books?id=i_Ovy6OvI54C&pg=PA37|archivedate=6 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Clearly the total amount of money '''{{pi}}''' each person has remains the same after the time-step, since every dollar spent is balanced by a corresponding dollar received. This can be shown more formally by the equality\n\n:<math>\\sum_i \\pi_i p_{ij} = \\sum_i \\pi_j p_{ji} = \\pi_j \\sum_i p_{ji} = \\pi_j\\,,</math>\n\nwhich essentially states that the total amount of money person ''j'' receives (including from himself) during the time-step equals the amount of money he pays others, which equals all the money he initially had because it was assumed that all money is spent (that is, ''p<sub>ji</sub>'' sums to 1 over ''i''). The assumption is a technical one, because the money not really used is simply thought of as being paid from person ''j'' to himself (that is, ''p<sub>jj</sub>'' is not necessarily zero).\n\nAs ''n'' was arbitrary, this reasoning holds for any ''n'', and therefore for reversible Markov chains '''{{pi}}''' is always a steady-state distribution of Pr(''X''<sub>''n''+1</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''j''&nbsp;|&nbsp;''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''i'') for every&nbsp;''n''.\n\nIf the Markov chain begins in the steady-state distribution, that is, if <math>Pr(X_0=i)=\\pi_i</math>, then <math>Pr(X_n=i)=\\pi_i</math> for all <math>n</math> and the detailed balance equation can be written as\n\n:<math>\\Pr(X_{n} = i, X_{n+1} = j) = \\Pr(X_{n+1} = i, X_{n} = j)\\,.</math>\n\nThe left- and right-hand sides of this last equation are identical except for a reversing of the time indices ''n'' and&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1.\n\n[[Kolmogorov's criterion]] gives a necessary and sufficient condition for a Markov chain to be reversible directly from the transition matrix probabilities. The criterion requires that the products of probabilities around every closed loop are the same in both directions around the loop.\n\nReversible Markov chains are common in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches because the detailed balance equation for a desired distribution '''{{pi}}''' necessarily implies that the Markov chain has been constructed so that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution. Even with time-inhomogeneous Markov chains, where multiple transition matrices are used, if each such transition matrix exhibits detailed balance with the desired '''{{pi}}''' distribution, this necessarily implies that '''{{pi}}''' is a steady-state distribution of the Markov chain.\n\n===Markovian representations===\nIn some cases, apparently non-Markovian processes may still have Markovian representations, constructed by expanding the concept of the 'current' and 'future' states. For example, let ''X'' be a non-Markovian process. Then define a process ''Y'', such that each state of ''Y'' represents a time-interval of states of ''X''. Mathematically, this takes the form:\n:<math>Y(t) = \\big\\{ X(s): s \\in [a(t), b(t)] \\, \\big\\}.</math>\nIf ''Y'' has the Markov property, then it is a Markovian representation of ''X''.\n\nAn example of a non-Markovian process with a Markovian representation is an [[autoregressive model|autoregressive]] [[time series]] of order greater than one.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Doblinger |first1=G. |title=Smoothing of noisy AR signals using an adaptive Kalman filter |journal=9th European Signal Processing Conference (EUSIPCO 1998) |date=September 1998 |pages=781\u2013784 |url=https://publik.tuwien.ac.at/files/pub-et_3285.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Transient evolution===\nThe probability of going from state ''i'' to state ''j'' in ''n'' time steps is\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_n=j\\mid X_0=i) </math>\n\nand the single-step transition is\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_1=j\\mid X_0=i). </math>\n\nFor a time-homogeneous Markov chain:\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\Pr(X_{k+n}=j \\mid X_{k}=i) </math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>p_{ij} = \\Pr(X_{k+1}=j \\mid X_k=i). </math>\n\nThe ''n''-step transition probabilities satisfy the [[Chapman\u2013Kolmogorov equation]], that for any ''k'' such that 0&nbsp;<&nbsp;''k''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''n'',\n\n:<math>p_{ij}^{(n)} = \\sum_{r \\in S} p_{ir}^{(k)} p_{rj}^{(n-k)}</math>\n\nwhere ''S'' is the state space of the Markov chain.\n\nThe [[marginal distribution]] Pr(''X''<sub>''n''</sub>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''x'') is the distribution over states at time ''n''.

The player controls Pac-Man through a maze, eating pac-dots. Meanwhile, he is being hunted by ghosts. For convenience, the maze shall be a small 3x3-grid and the monsters move randomly in horizontal and vertical directions. A secret passageway between states 2 and 8 can be used in both directions.

Due to the secret passageway, the Markov chain is also aperiodic, because the monsters can move from any state to any state both in an even and in an uneven number of state transitions. Therefore, a unique stationary distribution exists and can be found by solving {{pi}}&nbsp;''Q''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0 subject to the constraint that elements must sum to 1. The solution of this linear equation subject to the constraint is <math>\\pi=(7.7,15.4,7.7,11.5,15.4,11.5,7.7,15.4,7.7)\\%.</math>\nThe central state and the border states 2 and 8 of the adjacent secret passageway are visited most and the corner states are visited least.\n\n===Hitting times===\n{{Main|Phase-type distribution}}The hitting time is the time, starting in a given set of states until the chain arrives in a given state or set of states. The distribution of such a time period has a phase type distribution. The simplest such distribution is that of a single exponentially distributed transition.\n\n====Expected hitting times====\nFor a subset of states ''A''&nbsp;\u2286&nbsp;''S'', the vector ''k''<sup>''A''</sup> of hitting times (where element <math> k_i^A </math> represents the [[expected value]], starting in state ''i'' that the chain enters one of the states in the set ''A'') is the minimal non-negative solution to<ref name=\"norris2\" />\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nk_i^A = 0 & \\text{ for } i \\in A\\\\\n-\\sum_{j \\in S} q_{ij} k_j^A = 1&\\text{ for } i \\notin A.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n===Time reversal===\nFor a CTMC ''X''<sub>''t''</sub>, the time-reversed process is defined to be <math>\\scriptstyle \\hat X_t = X_{T-t}</math>. By [[Kelly's lemma]] this process has the same stationary distribution as the forward process.\n\nA chain is said to be reversible if the reversed process is the same as the forward process. [[Kolmogorov's criterion]] states that the necessary and sufficient condition for a process to be reversible is that the product of transition rates around a closed loop must be the same in both directions.\n\n=== Embedded Markov chain <!-- Embedded Markov chain redirects here --> ===\n\nOne method of finding the [[stationary probability distribution]], {{pi}}, of an [[ergodic]] continuous-time Markov chain, ''Q'', is by first finding its '''embedded Markov chain (EMC)'''. Strictly speaking, the EMC is a regular discrete-time Markov chain, sometimes referred to as a '''[[jump process]]'''. Each element of the one-step transition probability matrix of the EMC, ''S'', is denoted by ''s''<sub>''ij''</sub>, and represents the [[conditional probability]] of transitioning from state ''i'' into state ''j''. These conditional probabilities may be found by\n\n:<math>\ns_{ij} = \\begin{cases}\n\\frac{q_{ij}}{\\sum_{k \\neq i} q_{ik}} & \\text{if } i \\neq j \\\\\n0 & \\text{otherwise}.\n\\end{cases}\n</math>\n\nFrom this, ''S'' may be written as\n:<math>S = I - \\left( \\operatorname{diag}(Q) \\right)^{-1} Q</math>\nwhere ''I'' is the [[identity matrix]] and diag(''Q'') is the [[diagonal matrix]] formed by selecting the [[main diagonal]] from the matrix ''Q'' and setting all other elements to zero.\n\nTo find the stationary probability distribution vector, we must next find <math>\\varphi</math> such that\n:<math>\\varphi S = \\varphi, </math>\n\nwith <math>\\varphi</math> being a row vector, such that all elements in <math>\\varphi</math> are greater than 0 and [[norm (mathematics)|<math>\\|\\varphi\\|_1</math>]] = 1. From this, {{pi}} may be found as\n:<math>\\pi = {-\\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\over \\left\\| \\varphi (\\operatorname{diag}(Q))^{-1} \\right\\|_1}.</math>\n\n(''S'' may be periodic, even if ''Q'' is not. Once {{pi}} is found, it must be normalized to a [[unit vector]].)\n\nAnother discrete-time process that may be derived from a continuous-time Markov chain is a \u03b4-skeleton&mdash;the (discrete-time) Markov chain formed by observing ''X''(''t'') at intervals of \u03b4 units of time. The random variables ''X''(0),&nbsp;''X''(\u03b4),&nbsp;''X''(2\u03b4),&nbsp;... give the sequence of states visited by the \u03b4-skeleton.\n\n== Special types of Markov chains ==\n\n=== Markov model ===\n{{Main|Markov model}}\nMarkov models are used to model changing systems. There are 4 main types of models, that generalize Markov chains depending on whether every sequential state is observable or not, and whether the system is to be adjusted on the basis of observations made:\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px solid darkgray;\"\n!\n!System state is fully observable\n!System state is partially observable\n|-\n!System is autonomous\n|Markov chain\n|[[Hidden Markov model]]\n|-\n!System is controlled\n|[[Markov decision process]]\n|[[Partially observable Markov decision process]]\n|}\n\n===Bernoulli scheme===\n{{Main|Bernoulli scheme}}\nA [[Bernoulli scheme]] is a special case of a Markov chain where the transition probability matrix has identical rows, which means that the next state is even independent of the current state (in addition to being independent of the past states). A Bernoulli scheme with only two possible states is known as a [[Bernoulli process]].\n\n==Applications==\nResearch has reported the application and usefulness of Markov chains in a wide range of topics such as physics, chemistry, biology, medicine, music, game theory and sports.\n\n===Physics===\nMarkovian systems appear extensively in [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]], whenever probabilities are used to represent unknown or unmodelled details of the system, if it can be assumed that the dynamics are time-invariant, and that no relevant history need be considered which is not already included in the state description.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thermodynamics and Statistical Mechanics |first=Richard |last=Fitzpatrick |url=https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermal.pdf |accessdate=2017-06-02 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161130172856/http://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/sm1/Thermal.pdf |archivedate=2016-11-30 }}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">{{Cite journal|last=van Ravenzwaaij|first=Don|last2=Cassey|first2=Pete|last3=Brown|first3=Scott D.|date=2016-03-11|title=A simple introduction to Markov Chain Monte\u2013Carlo sampling|journal=Psychonomic Bulletin & Review|volume=25|issue=1|pages=143\u2013154|doi=10.3758/s13423-016-1015-8|pmid=26968853|pmc=5862921|issn=1069-9384}}</ref> For example, a thermodynamic state operates under a probability distribution that is difficult or expensive to acquire.

For example, imagine a large number ''n'' of molecules in solution in state A, each of which can undergo a chemical reaction to state B with a certain average rate. Perhaps the molecule is an enzyme, and the states refer to how it is folded. The state of any single enzyme follows a Markov chain, and since the molecules are essentially independent of each other, the number of molecules in state A or B at a time is ''n'' times the probability a given molecule is in that state.\n\nThe classical model of enzyme activity, [[Michaelis\u2013Menten kinetics]], can be viewed as a Markov chain, where at each time step the reaction proceeds in some direction. While Michaelis-Menten is fairly straightforward, far more complicated reaction networks can also be modeled with Markov chains.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Du|first=Chao|last2=Kou|first2=S.

Based on the reactivity ratios of the monomers that make up the growing polymer chain, the chain's composition may be calculated (for example, whether monomers tend to add in alternating fashion or in long runs of the same monomer). Due to [[steric effects]], second-order Markov effects may also play a role in the growth of some polymer chains.\n\nSimilarly, it has been suggested that the crystallization and growth of some epitaxial [[superlattice]] oxide materials can be accurately described by Markov chains.<ref>{{cite journal |last1= Kopp |first1= V.

In current research, it is common to use a Markov chain <!-- this is actually a Markov perefect equilibria, not simply a Markov chain, I'll try to remember get back to this ~~~~ --> to model how once a country reaches a specific level of economic development, the configuration of structural factors, such as size of the [[middle class]], the ratio of urban to rural residence, the rate of [[political]] mobilization, etc., will generate a higher probability of transitioning from [[authoritarian]] to [[democratic regime|democratic]] regime.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Acemoglu |first= Daron |author2=Georgy Egorov |author3=Konstantin Sonin |title= Political model of social evolution |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |year= 2011 |volume= 108 |pages= 21292\u201321296 |url= http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.4/21292.short |archive-url= https://archive.is/20130415155803/http://www.pnas.org/content/108/suppl.4/21292.short |url-status= dead |archive-date= 2013-04-15 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.1019454108 |pmid= 22198760 |pmc= 3271566 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.225.6090 |bibcode= 2011PNAS..10821292A}}</ref>\n\n===Games===\nMarkov chains can be used to model many games of chance.<ref name=\":0\"/> The children's games [[Snakes and Ladders]] and \"[[Hi Ho! Cherry-O]]\", for example, are represented exactly by Markov chains. At each turn, the player starts in a given state (on a given square) and from there has fixed odds of moving to certain other states (squares).\n\n===Music===\nMarkov chains are employed in [[algorithmic composition|algorithmic music composition]], particularly in [[software]] such as [[Csound]], [[Max (software)|Max]], and [[SuperCollider]]. In a first-order chain, the states of the system become note or pitch values, and a [[probability vector]] for each note is constructed, completing a transition probability matrix (see below). An algorithm is constructed to produce output note values based on the transition matrix weightings, which could be [[MIDI]] note values, frequency ([[Hertz|Hz]]), or any other desirable metric.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Making Music with Algorithms: A Case-Study System |author1=K McAlpine |author2=E Miranda |author3=S Hoggar |journal=Computer Music Journal |issue=2 |year=1999 |volume=23 |doi=10.1162/014892699559733 |pages=19\u201330}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: left\"\n|+ 1st-order matrix\n!

Belial also foresaw the dangers of the incredible power residing in Morrigan. If she could not properly control her power, it would consume her body and the world would suffer catastrophic damage. To counter this event from unfolding, Belial sealed two thirds of her soul away until she can endure her full power: Sealing one third in himself that would return to Morrigan upon his death. The other one third was sealed within a [[pocket dimension]] that eventually became a being of its own, named [[Lilith (Darkstalkers)|Lilith]]. Without knowing this, Morrigan grew up, tended after by two lesser demons named Lucien and Mudo. She found her life as a sheltered princess in the Aensland castle dull, so she would frequently visit the human world to look for entertainment, tempting humans regardless of their sex and fighting for her own pleasure.<ref>DoubleJump, ''Cross Edge: The Official Strategy Guide''.

Morrigan finds and challenges Pyron to battle, but is defeated, as he turns out to be too strong for her to beat.

Meanwhile, Demitri has returned to Makai shortly after learning of Belial's death and challenges Morrigan for the right to rule the demon realm. Morrigan gradually accepted the insistent vampire's demand prior to the events of ''[[Darkstalkers 3]]'' (''Vampire Savior''), with [[Jedah Dohma]] appearing after his century-long nap and creating the Majigen which sucked Morrigan and her castle into it. Jedah freed Lilith who is compelled to find Morrigan, eventually merging back into her as depicted in both their endings.\n\n====Other games====\nMorrigan was the first Darkstalker's character to break-out of the original fighting game series and cross over into the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'' (1998, remade as ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Origins]]'' in 2012), not only was Morrigan present, but an alternate \"Lilith-style\" Morrigan was a secret character; in her intro cutscene, Lilith appears and merges with her in a nod to when the two merged in Morrigan's ending in ''Vampire Savior''. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' (2000), she is joined by fellow ''Darkstalkers'' characters [[Anakaris]], [[B.B. Hood]] and [[Felicia (Darkstalkers)|Felicia]]. She was later accompanied by Felicia and [[Hsien-Ko]] for ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds]]'' (2011),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5518024/marvel-vs-capcom-3-will-be-a-living-comic-with-a-deep-story |title=Marvel Vs.

She would often leave at will out of mere boredom, much to the frustration of her guardians, elder men of the Aensland family. Her father, Belial, is not mentioned. Morrigan's role as a heroine is a focus, with her activities as a succubus downplayed. Princess Morrigan is shown fighting the werewolf [[Jon Talbain]] in the opening of the first three episodes. She seeks to battle the vampire lord Demitri Maximoff when he attempts to return to Makai, but their duel with erotic undertones<ref>[[Jonathan Clements]], [[Helen McCarthy]], ''The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised & Expanded Edition: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917''. Stone Bridge Press, 2012.</ref> is interrupted when they are sensed by [[Huitzil]]. In the final episode, Morrigan goes to Earth after Demitri was bested by Pyron and she encounters him unconscious in the ruins of his castle. Demitri suddenly awakens and attempts to vampirise Morrigan, but she does not resist, much to his surprise. Morrigan tells Demitri that he may become the leader of Makai after all, since a change of leadership is needed to help its current disarray from falling into destruction. They both later observe [[Donovan (Darkstalkers)|Donovan's]] victory over Pyron. The anime's Morrigan was voiced by [[Rei Sakuma]] and dubbed into English by [[Kathleen Barr]].\n\nIn the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] series ''[[Darkstalkers (comics)|Darkstalkers]]'', Morrigan is portrayed as a malevolent, evil and amoral succubus (unlike the games), who wants nothing more than to visit the human world and have a good time, often at the expense of the men she seduces and kills, and completely ignores her duty as future ruler of the Makai Realm. Morrigan's attitude annoys her father Belial and gets her two servants, Lucien and Mudo, into trouble. Eventually she hears of Demitri's restoration, and goes to her father to warn him, only to find that he is in no position to fight. For the first time, she takes on the responsibility that she has often put aside, and returns to the human world to fight Demitri, and prove herself worthy of the Makai Realm and the power that Belial sealed away many years ago. In the special issue ''Morrigan vs Demitri'' it is implied that had Belial not sealed away her power, Morrigan might have evolved into a being similar to Pyron and destroyed the Earth. In the comics, Morrigan's bats are the souls of her human victims, which are not destroyed but remain alive inside her body in an state of eternal bliss and pleasure after she drains them. Aside from consuming souls, Morrigan has no qualms about murdering and taking advantage on humans- despite this, she sees herself as simply taking people's souls in exchange for eternal bliss.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2005|title=Into the Darkness: The Darkstalkers Comic Book|url=|journal=Play|publisher=Fusion Pub|volume=37|pages=|via=}}</ref> She is also prominently featured in the followup series ''Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors'', in which she, Demitri, Donovan, and Pyron all fight each other. In the later crossover series ''Street Fighter vs Darkstalkers'', Morrigan meets Lilith. Together with her rival-partner Chun-Li, as well as other uneasy allies, Morrigan and Lilith fight and defeat Jedah once and for all, and then they merge, finally restoring Morrigan to her full power.\n\nMorrigan also appears in the comedic ''Darkstalkers'' drama CDs ''Vampire Knight'' (\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8), ''Darkness Mission'' (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30cd\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/120035637001 |title=\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc \u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30cd\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff5e\u7279\u9078\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u91a4\u6cb9\u5473\uff5e &#124; \u4e2d\u53e4 &#124; \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u7cfbCD &#124; \u901a\u8ca9\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u99ff\u6cb3\u5c4b |publisher=Suruga-ya.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> and ''Dengeki CD Bunko EX: Vampire'' (\u96fb\u6483CD\u6587\u5eabEX \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/120026700001 |title=\u96fb\u6483CD\u6587\u5eabEX \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2 \uff5e\u30b6 \u30ca\u30a4\u30c8 \u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e &#124; \u4e2d\u53e4 &#124; \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u7cfbCD &#124; \u901a\u8ca9\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u99ff\u6cb3\u5c4b |publisher=Suruga-ya.jp |date=1995-07-25 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> voiced by Rei Sakuma, [[Kikuko Inoue]] and [[Yumi T\u014dma]], as well as in multiple [[yonkoma]] parody comics for that were largely compiled from fan submissions.

She has a sister-like split part named [[Lilith (Darkstalkers)|Lilith]] and a rival named [[Demitri Maximoff]], and her moveset is reminiscent of [[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]] and [[Ken Masters|Ken]] from ''[[Street Fighter]]''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Video games===\n====''Darkstalkers'' games====\nIn the ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' series, Morrigan is a [[succubus]] and the adopted daughter of the demon king [[Belial in popular culture|Belial]] of the Aensland House, one of the three major houses of Makai (\u9b54\u754c, lit. \"Demon World\"), who prophesied her birth in [[Scotland]] in the year 1678. Belial also foresaw the dangers of the incredible power residing in Morrigan. If she could not properly control her power, it would consume her body and the world would suffer catastrophic damage. To counter this event from unfolding, Belial sealed two thirds of her soul away until she can endure her full power: Sealing one third in himself that would return to Morrigan upon his death. The other one third was sealed within a [[pocket dimension]] that eventually became a being of its own, named [[Lilith (Darkstalkers)|Lilith]]. Without knowing this, Morrigan grew up, tended after by two lesser demons named Lucien and Mudo. She found her life as a sheltered princess in the Aensland castle dull, so she would frequently visit the human world to look for entertainment, tempting humans regardless of their sex and fighting for her own pleasure.<ref>DoubleJump, ''Cross Edge: The Official Strategy Guide''.

Morrigan gradually accepted the insistent vampire's demand prior to the events of ''[[Darkstalkers 3]]'' (''Vampire Savior''), with [[Jedah Dohma]] appearing after his century-long nap and creating the Majigen which sucked Morrigan and her castle into it. Jedah freed Lilith who is compelled to find Morrigan, eventually merging back into her as depicted in both their endings.\n\n====Other games====\nMorrigan was the first Darkstalker's character to break-out of the original fighting game series and cross over into the ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom]]'' series. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom: Clash of Super Heroes]]'' (1998, remade as ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Origins]]'' in 2012), not only was Morrigan present, but an alternate \"Lilith-style\" Morrigan was a secret character; in her intro cutscene, Lilith appears and merges with her in a nod to when the two merged in Morrigan's ending in ''Vampire Savior''. In ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes]]'' (2000), she is joined by fellow ''Darkstalkers'' characters [[Anakaris]], [[B.B. Hood]] and [[Felicia (Darkstalkers)|Felicia]].

She would often leave at will out of mere boredom, much to the frustration of her guardians, elder men of the Aensland family. Her father, Belial, is not mentioned. Morrigan's role as a heroine is a focus, with her activities as a succubus downplayed. Princess Morrigan is shown fighting the werewolf [[Jon Talbain]] in the opening of the first three episodes. She seeks to battle the vampire lord Demitri Maximoff when he attempts to return to Makai, but their duel with erotic undertones<ref>[[Jonathan Clements]], [[Helen McCarthy]], ''The Anime Encyclopedia, Revised & Expanded Edition: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917''. Stone Bridge Press, 2012.</ref> is interrupted when they are sensed by [[Huitzil]]. In the final episode, Morrigan goes to Earth after Demitri was bested by Pyron and she encounters him unconscious in the ruins of his castle. Demitri suddenly awakens and attempts to vampirise Morrigan, but she does not resist, much to his surprise. Morrigan tells Demitri that he may become the leader of Makai after all, since a change of leadership is needed to help its current disarray from falling into destruction. They both later observe [[Donovan (Darkstalkers)|Donovan's]] victory over Pyron. The anime's Morrigan was voiced by [[Rei Sakuma]] and dubbed into English by [[Kathleen Barr]].\n\nIn the [[UDON|UDON Comics]] series ''[[Darkstalkers (comics)|Darkstalkers]]'', Morrigan is portrayed as a malevolent, evil and amoral succubus (unlike the games), who wants nothing more than to visit the human world and have a good time, often at the expense of the men she seduces and kills, and completely ignores her duty as future ruler of the Makai Realm. Morrigan's attitude annoys her father Belial and gets her two servants, Lucien and Mudo, into trouble. Eventually she hears of Demitri's restoration, and goes to her father to warn him, only to find that he is in no position to fight. For the first time, she takes on the responsibility that she has often put aside, and returns to the human world to fight Demitri, and prove herself worthy of the Makai Realm and the power that Belial sealed away many years ago. In the special issue ''Morrigan vs Demitri'' it is implied that had Belial not sealed away her power, Morrigan might have evolved into a being similar to Pyron and destroyed the Earth. In the comics, Morrigan's bats are the souls of her human victims, which are not destroyed but remain alive inside her body in an state of eternal bliss and pleasure after she drains them. Aside from consuming souls, Morrigan has no qualms about murdering and taking advantage on humans- despite this, she sees herself as simply taking people's souls in exchange for eternal bliss.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=January 2005|title=Into the Darkness: The Darkstalkers Comic Book|url=|journal=Play|publisher=Fusion Pub|volume=37|pages=|via=}}</ref> She is also prominently featured in the followup series ''Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors'', in which she, Demitri, Donovan, and Pyron all fight each other. In the later crossover series ''Street Fighter vs Darkstalkers'', Morrigan meets Lilith. Together with her rival-partner Chun-Li, as well as other uneasy allies, Morrigan and Lilith fight and defeat Jedah once and for all, and then they merge, finally restoring Morrigan to her full power.\n\nMorrigan also appears in the comedic ''Darkstalkers'' drama CDs ''Vampire Knight'' (\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30fb\u30ca\u30a4\u30c8), ''Darkness Mission'' (\u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30cd\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/120035637001 |title=\u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2\u30cf\u30f3\u30bf\u30fc \u30c0\u30fc\u30af\u30cd\u30b9\u30df\u30c3\u30b7\u30e7\u30f3\uff5e\u7279\u9078\u30d0\u30bf\u30fc\u91a4\u6cb9\u5473\uff5e &#124; \u4e2d\u53e4 &#124; \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u7cfbCD &#124; \u901a\u8ca9\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u99ff\u6cb3\u5c4b |publisher=Suruga-ya.jp |date= |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> and ''Dengeki CD Bunko EX: Vampire'' (\u96fb\u6483CD\u6587\u5eabEX \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.suruga-ya.jp/product/detail/120026700001 |title=\u96fb\u6483CD\u6587\u5eabEX \u30f4\u30a1\u30f3\u30d1\u30a4\u30a2 \uff5e\u30b6 \u30ca\u30a4\u30c8 \u30a6\u30a9\u30fc\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ba\uff5e &#124; \u4e2d\u53e4 &#124; \u30a2\u30cb\u30e1\u7cfbCD &#124; \u901a\u8ca9\u30b7\u30e7\u30c3\u30d7\u306e\u99ff\u6cb3\u5c4b |publisher=Suruga-ya.jp |date=1995-07-25 |accessdate=2016-07-07}}</ref> voiced by Rei Sakuma, [[Kikuko Inoue]] and [[Yumi T\u014dma]], as well as in multiple [[yonkoma]] parody comics for that were largely compiled from fan submissions.

He has written several collections of poetry, short stories and novels. He is known mainly for the language of the Bengali diaspora which he adopted and developed for his narratives. He lived in [[Kolkata]] only until the Hungry generation movement died down at the end of the 1960s, and shifted thereafter to Durgapur. At the end of Seventies he shifted his base to New Delhi where he invented his narrative language of the Bengali diaspora, i.e. of people who live outside West Bengal.\n\n==Career==\nRabindra Guha came to India with his parents during the [[Partition of India]] and toiled for a foothold. He was good at studies and chose the profession of a management adviser to various institutions. He left his profession to become a full-scale writer when he shifted to New Delhi. There with his son he started a venture in Television production. A group which called itself '''Dilli Haaters''' developed around him.
