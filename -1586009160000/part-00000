'''BBC Radio & Music Production''' unit ({{aka}} '''Bristol Network Radio''') operates separately from [[BBC Radio Bristol]] (part of the BBC local radio network), which serves listeners in and around the city. The network production team makes programs for the UK and a global audience. The genre focus in Bristol includes a wide range of topics such as food and farming, environmental journalism, natural history, investigative documentaries, human interest, Bristol R&M Production readings, drama, poetry, conversation, and political debates. In 2017, the team in Bristol began producing podcasts for the BBC. It has been located in [[Broadcasting House, Bristol]] since 1934, which is also home to the [[BBC Natural History Unit]], [[BBC West]], and BBC Radio Bristol, in addition to BBC Network Radio Bristol.\n\n== BBC Network Radio Bristol and the War Years ==\n\nThe Bristol BBC operations were important during World War II when the London based directors of the World Service chose to move the \u201cmorale boosting\u201d parts of the operation away from London. This is because of their fear of attacks during [[The Blitz]], which ultimately led the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], all school and children's programmes, religion and variety teams \u2013 700 people in total \u2013 to the location in Bristol.\n\nBy 1940, six studios were operating at the BBC Broadcasting House located in [[Whiteladies Road]], however, the BBC also made use of other locations around the city for concerts, music recordings, and public performances. These included Redland Park Hall, All Saints Hall, College Road, the Chapter House, Clifton Parish Hall, and the Co-operative Hall. This was the start of a partnership between the BBC and Bristol's public bodies. The partnership was formalized in 2009 with the first Memorandum of Understanding between the BBC and a UK city.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/bbc-bristol-partnership</ref>\n\nWith the fall of [[France]], Bristol's location meant that it sat within bombing range of the [[Luftwaffe]]. Therefore, it was decided to extend BBC broadcasting into [[Wales]] from the West, but also to set up emergency underground broadcast studios in the Clifton Rocks Railway caverns.  A [[transmitter]], a studio, and a radio control room (complete with an [[ozonator]] to combat the smell of the River Avon) were all concealed in the rock cliffs at Clifton Down inside the railway tunnel. As a result, the BBC HQ in London had the ability to quickly switch to broadcasting in Bristol, sometimes mid news bulletin, when the capital was under air attack and continue delivering BBC radio news.<ref>[[Clifton Rocks Railway]]</ref>\n\n== Any Questions ==\n\nPolitical debate programme ''[[Any Questions?]]'' first broadcast in 1948 was developed by the BBC in Bristol in the post-war years. In this weekly programme, members of the public asked their political representatives questions on matters important to them.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p01jdpfz</ref>  \n\nThe programme was first transmitted on the West of England Home Service.  It was only meant as a six-week stopgap but is still running today and was the inspiration for the television format BBC ''Question time''. The programme is produced by a three-person team in Bristol who, for fifty weeks a year, travel to venues in cities, towns, villages, and hamlets at the invitation of community groups, schools, local organisations across [[Great Britain]] and [[Northern Ireland]].  On 10 April 1970, the Friday broadcast moved from the BBC Home Service to BBC Radio 4 and it is that network which has broadcast both the live and the recorded repeat of Any Questions? since that date. It has a weekly audience of 1.5 million.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/profiles/4CTsltGbCNNcCblVMgPj8QK/chris-mason</ref>\n\n== Poetry Please ==\n\nThe BBC Radio Production Department is the birthplace of Poetry Please.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06wbrk9</ref> on BBC Radio 4.\nCurrently presented by Roger McGough CBE<ref>[[Roger McGough]]</ref> it is thought to be the longest-running poetry programme broadcast anywhere in the world. \nThere have been various attempts to find another contender but, so far, without success. \nFaber, who published a series of Poetry Please anthologies, have also confirmed this.<ref>https://www.faber.co.uk/9780571303298-poetry-please.html</ref> \n\nThe poems featured on the programme come from BBC Radio 4 listeners' requests. The format was refreshed slightly two years from straight requests with actors reading the poems to an interview format featuring established and up-and-coming poets who go through listener requests to share the poems that have equally inspired them to write and talk about their own adventures in poetry.\n\nFor the 40th anniversary of the programme in 2019 the presenter, and poet, Roger McGough chose Charles Causley to read his own Eden Rock. McGough was interviewed by the songwriter, singer and broadcaster Cerys Matthews. Poetry Please also broadcast the Poetry By Heart finals.\n\n\u201cTaking a poem into your heart makes it part of you. Saying a poem aloud makes you part of its life in the world. This is a rich and nourishing relationship that can last a lifetime.\u201d - Jean Sprackland\n\nPoetry By Heart is a national competition designed to encourage pupils aged 14\u201318 in schools and colleges in England to learn and to recite poems by heart.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qp7q/galleries</ref>\n\nThe series also featured on a BBC4 TV documentary in 2009 to mark the programme's 30th anniversary and its unique role in sharing \"the people's poetry\" in the UK.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcCk5xmRbL0</ref>\n\nPoetry Please values its connection with Bristol and \u2013 in the spirit of partnership with the city \u2013 featured Bristol's first-ever Poet Laureate Miles Chambers as a guest in August 2018 as he came to the end of his two-year tenure in the role.<ref>https://www.ideasfestival.co.uk/blog/bristol-city-poet/miles-chambers-bristol-city-poet-2016-2018/</ref>\n\nMiles was also the closing voice of the first-ever More Than Words speech Radio 4 radio festival in the city.\n\n== Soul music ==\n\nAnother of the unit's unique programmes is Soul Music which has been a popular series on BBC Radio 4 since 2010 but has also been broadcast on the BBC World Service with a special focus on international songs.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b008mj7p</ref>\n\nSOUL MUSIC has no presenter focusing instead on a chosen song and the unique emotional impact it can have on people's lives. Those individuals share their stories of what the featured song means to them.  The series has won a number of awards including a Prix Europa in October 2014 for Strange Fruit which was produced by Maggie Ayre from the Bristol unit.  The same programme also won a Radio Academy Gold award in 2013.  It was also the winner of the Best Radio Programme Broadcasting Press Guild Award in March 2013 which is chosen by radio reviewers and critics.\n\nMaggie Ayre talked about her involvement with Soul Music on Ujima community radio station (not for profit)<ref>[[Ujima Radio]]</ref> when BBC Radio 4 (Bristol team) and UJIMA created a partnership event which was held in Bristol to tell the story of 50 years of Bristol Civil Rights activism in November 2016.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZA0VgYhByVg</ref>\n\n== Radio roots of Natural History Unit ==\n\nBBC Bristol is probably most famous for Natural History Television.  Funded by the BBC licence fee (public funding) when it began it has changed the face of international broadcasting.  The BBC Natural History Unit's links to Bristol and its roots in radio date back to the 1940's when Desmond Hawkins joined the West Region staff as a young producer.  His personal love of nature led to a radio series called ''The Naturalist'' which started on the Home Service in 1946 and was an instant success.  He followed this up with ''Out of Doors'' and ''Birds in Britain''. Desmond Hawkins is often cited as the Godfather of natural history broadcasting and someone who saw the value in educating generations about the planet we share.  When he was given the freedom of the city of Bristol Sir David Attenborough paid tribute to Christopher Parsons and Desmond Hawkins, who established the Natural History TV Unit in 1957. \"I had the honour and luck and privilege to be asked to join these two men. The honour belongs to them,\" he said.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-25413238</ref>\n\nBy the early 1950s, Hawkins had been promoted to Head of Programmes for the West Region and was keen to see if his radio formats would work in the developing medium of television. At the time radio still commanded much higher audiences than the fledgling television service but Hawkins was not alone in recognising the potential for natural history programmes for the newer medium. His vision was shared by Frank Gillard, the regional Head, and Christopher Parsons. The three men would become the driving force behind the establishment of the Natural History Unit (NHU) in Bristol.\n\nSir David Attenborough has worked with the NHU Radio Department in Bristol including the wonderful \"Life Stories\" \u2013 a series of talks on the natural histories of creatures and plants from around the world.  He was also the first voice to introduce Tweet of the Day a daily celebration of global birdlife that from 2013 has woken up BBC Radio 4 listeners every morning.  Here is a blog by Sarah Blunt, the distinguished natural history radio producer, writing about the birth of Tweet.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/radio4/entries/3143388d-5c2f-3e73-a3c1-727bb8c6b65d</ref>\n\n== Natural history ==\n\nBristol Network Radio still makes original and groundbreaking Natural History content for public service radio (not for profit)\nand produced the first Eco-Thriller drama podcast 'FOREST 404' for BBC Radio 4 and BBC Sounds.\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p06tqsg3</ref>\n\nSet in the 24th century, after a data crash called 'The Cataclysm'. Pan, the main character, is a young woman with a boring job sorting and deleting old sound files that survived the crash. She uncovers a set of sound recordings from the early 21st century that haunt her. \n\nThis immersive sci-fi thriller stars Pearl Mackie, Tanya Moodie and Pippa Haywood \u2013 with original music by Bonobo. You can still hear it on BBC Sounds.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p074m60p</ref>\n\nForest 404 was used to launch a groundbreaking public experiment investigating the impact of natural sounds on well-being and mental health. This was done in partnership with the AHRC (Arts & Humanities Research Council), Natural History Television, Exeter University, Bristol University and the Open University. The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the ChristChurch Studios in Clifton to record drama. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012 The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in Bristol called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership.

The drama was written by Bristol-based writer Tim X Atack<ref>http://www.timatack.co.uk/</ref>  \n\nIt was produced and directed by Becky Ripley and the accompanying talks were produced by Eliza Lomas.  The series has won critical acclaim and some awards include a British Writers Guild award in January 2020 for Tim X Atack and a silver Prix Europa. It was the first drama to make it into the iTunes podcast Top Ten.  Its highest position was #2.\n\n== The Fun Factory ==\n\nBBC Bristol began producing BBC drama from 1940 onward. \nShows like ITMA, Bandwagon, Workers Playtime and Garrison Theatre were all made and broadcast from BBC Bristol as part of what they called \"The Fun Factory\".  \nThe BBC acquired the ChristChurch Studios in Clifton to record drama. (These studios were subsequently taken over by Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in 2001).  As drama changed the network radio team in Bristol, led by then Chief Producer Jeremy Howe [[Jeremy Howe (radio drama editor)]] (currently the editor of BBC Radio 4's soap opera The Archers) encouraged a new approach. Subject matter and stories, the production techniques and editing are more typical of factual documentary making with producers digitally editing their own work and focusing as much on the edit as performances.\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nThe BBC Network Radio department in Bristol was honoured to receive a special award for its contribution to the nation, to the city and to the region in 2013 by the local Royal Television Society. They recognised radio's role in encouraging new talent, discovering and celebrating British actors, writers and broadcasters.  The award was accepted by broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby who started his own distinguished career as a news reporter at the BBC in Bristol.  \n\n<ref>https://www.bristolmedia.co.uk/news/1431/radio-is-honoured-at-rts-west-of-england-awards</ref>\n\nBBC Radio & Music Production in Bristol has also been the catalyst for two festivals in the city.  More Than Words - a celebration of Radio 4 and speech radio - in 2012.  Bristol Food Connections (2013 - 2019) bringing good food and people together to debate and celebrate inspiring ideas through the filter of food.\n\n== Programs of note ==\n\nThe BBC is a publicly funded broadcaster.  The licence fee pays for radio as well as television programmes.  The BBC radio programmes made in Bristol include:\n\n* ''Any Questions''\n* ''Great Lives''\n* ''One To One''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Word of Mouth''\n* ''Poetry Please''\n* ''Out of the Ordinary''\n* ''The Patch''\n* ''The Untold''\n* ''A Good Read''\n* ''Natalie Haynes Stands Up for the Classics''\n* ''Evil Genius''\n* ''Ramblings with Clare Balding''\n* ''Farming Today''\n* ''Open Country''\n* ''On Your Farm''\n* ''Costing the Earth''\n* ''The Food Programme''\n* ''Sketches''\n* ''The BBC Earth Podcast''\n* ''The Living World''\n* ''Tweet of the Day''\n* ''Natural Histories''\n* ''Book of the Week''\n* ''Short Cuts''\n* ''The Invention of...''\n* ''Recycle Radio''\n* ''Afternoon Drama''\n* ''With Great Pleasure''\n* ''The History of Ideas'' (with BBC Radio 4)<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04bwydw]</ref>\n\nAdditionally, ''The People's Shipping Forecast'' was a highlight of the ''We British'' day - exploring the many identities and influences on our islands as evidenced through its poems and its voices. This encouraged BBC Radio 4 listeners to suggest their own poetic lines (inspired by the BBC Radio 4 shipping forecast) which were joined together to create something for the stormy waters of everyday living.  The poet Murray Lachlan Young used these to create and read this work.\n\n<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/3zW5TLdY6q1K17bBjKmwnZG/the-peoples-shipping-forecast</ref>\n\nMore recently the Bristol-based poetry & arts team in BBC network radio has made the Four Seasons equinox poetry inserts for BBC Radio 4 - quarterly burst of poetry to reconnect listeners with nature and poems which chime with the changing of the seasons.\n\n== Famous voices ==\n\nPresenters associated with Bristol include: \n\n* [[Matthew Parris]]\n* [[Roger McGough]]\n* [[Harriett Gilbert]]\n* [[Grace Dent]]\n* [[Jonathan Dimbleby]]\n* [[Chris Mason (journalist)|Chris Mason]]\n* [[Clare Balding]]\n* Jolyon Jenkins<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01rh55j</ref>\n* Joe Queenan<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wxpqh</ref>\n* [[Natalie Haynes]]\n* [[Sheila Dillon]]\n* Dan Saladino<ref>https://www.penguin.co.uk/authors/1083274/dan-saladino.html?tab=penguin-books</ref>\n* Helen Mark<ref>https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/11/full-steam-ahead</ref>\n* Charlotte Smith<ref>https://www.countryfilelive.com/windsor-great-park/meet-the-stars/charlotte-smith</ref>\n* Anna Hill<ref>https://www.ofc.org.uk/blog/i-never-said-qa-anna-hill</ref>\n* Caz Graham<ref>https://www.gaj.org.uk/article/member-profile-caz-graham</ref>\n* Sybil Ruscoe<ref>[[Sybil Ruscoe]]</ref>\n* Tom Heap<ref>[[Tom Heap]]</ref>\n* Brett Westwood<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04ynnmn</ref>\n* Polly Weston<ref>https://www.spectator.co.uk/2018/12/the-story-of-the-cook-who-spent-10-years-preparing-food-for-those-on-death-row/</ref>\n* Emily Knight<ref>https://podbiblemag.com/2019/06/05/a-bbc-earth-blog-telling-stories-of-nature-in-the-glorious-technicolour-world-of-audio/</ref>\n* Michael Rosen<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qtnz</ref>\n* Dr Laura Wright<ref>https://www.english.cam.ac.uk/news/archives/3746</ref>\n* Melvyn Bragg<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b018g26x</ref>\n* Russell Kane<ref>https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/evil-genius-with-russell-kane/id1356142765?mt=2</ref>\n* Jaega Wise<ref>https://imbibe.com/news/moves-like-jaega-meet-the-brewer-changing-the-face-of-craft-beer/</ref>\n* Leyla Kazim<ref>https://www.greatbritishchefs.com/contributors/leyla-kazim</ref>\n\n== Partnerships ==\n\nIn March 2012 The Network Radio team in Bristol curated and presented a weekend speech festival in BristoL called ''More Than Words.''<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/more-than-words/</ref> It was sponsored by BBC Audio & Music Content and was a not-for-profit partnership festival.\n\nIt brought together different creative groups and organizations in the city as part of the Bristol BBC cultural partnership.

The first Bristol Food Connections festival was an ambitious 11-day initiative, born out of a five-year partnership between the BBC and public bodies in the city to drive much stronger engagement between the BBC in Whiteladies Road and local people. The aim of Bristol Food Connections was to open up food education, aspiring entrepreneurs and the food industry to the widest possible talent pool through outreach and education initiatives via BBC broadcasting.<ref>https://www.bristolfoodconnections.com/the-bbc-at-bristol-food-connections/</ref><ref>https://visitbristol.co.uk/whats-on/bristol-food-connections-p2196433</ref>\n\n== BBC Food and Farming Awards ==\n\nThe BBC Food and Farming Awards has been an annual event in the city since 2013 although the awards themselves were launched in 2000 in London by HRH Prince Charles.

He was a grandson of [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall, Lord of Argyll]], a man who had been forced from Scotland into exile in the first third of the century. It was under John Gallda that the [[Clan MacDougall|MacDougall]] leadership made its resurgence in Scotland after generations of English exile.\n\nBy the mid century, John Gallda was married to Johanna Isaac, a niece of [[David II, King of Scotland]], and  restored to a portion of the MacDougalls' originally holdings in [[Argyll]]. The favours bestowed upon the MacDougalls by the [[King of Scotland|Scottish Crown]] appear to have been a tactic to keep in check nearby magnates, such as [[John of Islay|John MacDonald, Lord of the Isles]], a man who headed the MacDougalls' regional rivals, the [[Clan Donald|MacDonalds]]. Although John Galla enjoyed close ties to the [[House of Bruce|Bruce]] regime, with the subsequent accession of [[Robert II, King of Scotland]], and the start of the [[House of Stewart|Stewart]] regime, the MacDougalls quickly fell from favour. John Gallda was the last MacDougall to hold the lordship of [[Lorne, Scotland|Lorne]]. He and Johanna had two legitimate daughters through which the lordship passed, whilst the leadership of MacDougalls passed to an illegitimate son.\n\n==Familial background==\n\n[[File:Sr Dargael, Balliol Roll.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Coat of arms]] of the [[Lord of Argyll]] as it appears in the fourteenth-century ''Balliol Roll''.<ref>[[#C3|Campbell of Airds (2014)]] p. 204; [[#M1|McAndrew (2006)]] p. 66; [[#M4|McAndrew (1999)]] p. 693 \u00a7 1328; [[#M6|McAndrew (1992)]]; [[#T8|''The Balliol Roll'' (n.d.)]].</ref> It corresponds to the [[seal (emblem)|seal]] of John Gallda's great-grandfather, [[Alexander of Argyll|Alexander MacDougall, Lord of Argyll]].<ref>[[#C3|Campbell of Airds (2014)]] p. 204; [[#M1|McAndrew (2006)]] p. 66; [[#M4|McAndrew (1999)]] p. 693 \u00a7 1328; [[#M6|McAndrew (1992)]].</ref>{{#tag:ref|The coat of arms is [[blazon]]ed: ''[[Or (heraldry)|or]], a galley [[Sable (heraldry)|sable]] with dragon heads at prow and stern and flag flying [[gules]], charged on the hull with four portholes [[argent]]''.<ref>[[#M1|McAndrew (2006)]] p. 66; [[#T8|''The Balliol Roll'' (n.d.)]].</ref> It is the only painted example of a coat of arms borne by the MacDougall [[Lords of Lorne]].<ref>[[#M1|McAndrew (2006)]] p. 66.</ref> Whilst in the service of the English in 1319, John Gallda's father, Allan MacDougall of Argyll, bore a galley on his seals.<ref>[[#B8|Bain (1887)]] pp. lxiv&ndash;lxv, 122 \u00a7 647, 130 \u00a7 684.</ref>|group=note}}]]\n\nJohn Gallda was a son of Allan MacDougall of Argyll (fl. 1319), who was in turn a son of [[John of Argyll|John MacDougall, Lord of Argyll]] (died 1316).<ref>[[#B14|Boardman, S (2006)]] p. 65; [[#S2|Sellar (2003)]]; [[#B1|Boardman, S (2000)]] p. 221 tab. iv; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] pp. 194 tab. ii, 209 tab. iii.</ref> The [[epithet]] ''gallda'' can be taken to mean \"the foreigner\",<ref>[[#P1|Penman (2014)]] p. 80; [[#M2|MacDonald (2013)]] p. 48; [[#B14|Boardman, S (2006)]] p. 65; [[#S2|Sellar (2003)]]; [[#S1|Sellar (2000)]] p. 217.</ref> \"Anglicised\", or \"Lowlandised\".<ref>[[#B2|Bateman; McLeod (2007)]] p. xxiii; [[#M10|McLeod (2005)]].</ref> ''Gallda'' was not an unheard of epithet, and was apparently accorded to people who were fluent in the [[Scots language|Scots]] or [[English language|English]] languages,<ref>[[#B2|Bateman; McLeod (2007)]] p. xxiii; [[#M10|McLeod (2005)]].</ref> or to people who had spent time in either [[Kingdom of England|England]],<ref>[[#B2|Bateman; McLeod (2007)]] p. xxiii.</ref> or non-Gaelic speaking areas of [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]].<ref>[[#C1|Coira (2008)]] p. 141.</ref>\n\nJohn Gallda's aforesaid grandfather, John MacDougall, had been closely connected with the Comyns, and therefore had been a constant opponent of [[Robert I, King of Scotland]], and an ally of the latter's English counterparts, [[Edward I, King of England]] and [[Edward II, King of England]].
